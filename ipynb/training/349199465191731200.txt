This week let me pass along some of the more absorbing blogs and Web sites Ive come across recently other corners of the online world where people are talking about aging and caregiving from very different perspectives I find a blog called   particularly compelling Much of what we read and hear about dementia comes from family members a firsthand account of life with Alzheimers disease is much rarer We can understand why perhaps Some people get the diagnosis everyone dreads and withdraw in fear or shame others can no longer summon the concentration and verbal ability to explain their experiences to others But Dr David Hilfiker a retired physician and author in Washington DC took to the Web When he began posting in January about his adventure with Alzheimers  and thats the word he uses  he provided a thoughtful window onto a condition that touches millions of lives At age  hes frank about what hes had to give up bookkeeping for his church because he made too many errors and what hes held onto driving for now and biking as his cognition slowly declines He contemplates his fears vulnerability dependence isolation the burden on his family But Dr Hilfiker sounds surprisingly sanguine about life with dementia In February for example he told readers that hed added a week to a planned West Coast visit with children and grandchildren My diagnosis gives me an excuse to live a more fulfilling life he wrote after years of playing Dr Responsible His blog led to a Washington Post article which led to a spike in his blog traffic and in turn to a contract for a book and a collaborator to help him assemble it scheduled for publication late next year Readers of Watching the Lights Go Out include other people with early dementia who express a lot of gratitude for bringing this disease out of the closet Dr Hilfiker told me Caregivers email him too saying that its helped them to understand better what their spouse or parent is going through Hes careful to point out that hes in the very early stages of dementia that I dont know whats coming later But for now this is not as scary a disease as I thought it was and as the whole culture thinks it is he told me He recognizes with sorrow the toll on his caregivers But for himself he says this is almost the happiest time of my life I can also recommend   a very different reading experience Dr Muriel Gillick serves as a caregiver for her yearold father so she can speak personally about say the apparent shortcomings of the muchtouted culture change approach to nursing homes She also cares for her yearold mother who recently moved into her home in Newton Mass More to the point as a geriatrician and palliative medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School she can knowledgeably discuss the latest research on kidney dialysis patients sometimes misplaced optimism and its consequences for their treatment Not many physicians  trust me on this  write as clearly and colloquially Dr Gillick is the author of several books including the wonderfully titled The Denial of Aging Perpetual Youth Eternal Life and Other Dangerous Fantasies She intends to post weekly on a range of topics related to advanced illness and endoflife care We spend a ton of money taking care of sick old people and we do a pretty crummy job she told me That doesnt make much sense She hopes that patients families health care professionals and policy makers alike will read Life in the End Zone  and on the basis of her first few posts they should
