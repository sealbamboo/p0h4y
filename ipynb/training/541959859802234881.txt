Good morning, everyone, and welcome to another working week. We hope the weekend respite was relaxing and invigorating because the time has come to resume the usual routine of meetings and deadlines and what-not. You knew this would happen, yes? To cope, we are, once again, quaffing multiple cups of stimulation. Our flavor, for those keeping track, remains pumpkin spice, since we stocked up a few weeks ago. Please feel free to join us or simply grab a bottle of water, if you prefer. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits to get you started. Have a smashing day and do stay in touch…. Merck agreed to pay $8.4 billion for Cubist Pharmaceuticals as the drug giant pushes deeper into antibiotics; a United Nations agency is scheduled to hold two days of closed-door meetings starting today to firm up a model law requiring harsh penalties for ‘falsified drug-related crimes;’ Foreign drug makers in China say they are concerned that recent regulatory delays could push back plans to introduce their newest medicines into the country by as many as two years; and two cancer immunotherapy drugs being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck proved remarkably effective against the blood cancer Hodgkin lymphoma in two small, separate studies.
