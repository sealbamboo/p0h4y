A trial of an experimental vaccine against the Ebola virus is to begin in Oxford The first of  healthy volunteers will be injected with the vaccine It contains only a small portion of genetic material from the virus so it cannot cause the disease   Normally it would take years of human trials before a completely new vaccine was approved for use But such is the urgency of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa that this experimental vaccine is being fast tracked at an astonishing rate If the trials are successful it could be used to immunise health workers in affected areas by the end of the year  By then around  doses should be available The vaccine is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health   Funding for the trials is coming from the Wellcome Trust Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development   The Oxford study will aim to establish two things that the vaccine produces a good immune response in volunteers and with few sideeffects   The vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee common cold virus to carry a single Ebola protein  it cannot trigger either disease but should prompt the production of antibodies against Ebola Professor Adrian Hill director of the Jenner Institute in Oxford who is leading the trial said This is a remarkable example of how quickly a new vaccine can be progressed into the clinic using international cooperation Blood tests from the volunteers will reveal the extent of their antibody response within two to four weeks Further volunteers will be given the vaccine in Africa next month and there are trials in the United States of a different formulation  both vaccines could be used if they prove safe and effective   Promising results from animal studies were  The United States has said it will send  troops to West Africa to build treatment clinics and to train health workers in how to halt the spread of the deadly virus The official death toll now stands at more than  people although the outbreak may have killed many times that number
