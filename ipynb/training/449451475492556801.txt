Women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer may soon be able to avoid the stark choice of preventative surgery after a research breakthrough For women carrying the mutated BRCA gene opting to have breasts and ovaries removed has been the only way of reducing the cancer risk Belfast researchers have found a link between high hormone levels and BRCA carriers ability to fight cancer Currently around one in  women in the UK have the BRCA mutation It exposes them to a  risk of breast cancer and  risk of ovarian cancer As it is hereditary the mutated gene can devastate families with generations of women at risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer  The only alternative has been preventative surgery such as a mastectomy removal of the breast and oophorectomy removal of the ovaries It can be a difficult choice for young healthy women some of whom are still at childbearing age Highprofile carriers of the mutated BRCA gene who opted for double mastectomies include the Hollywood actresses   and   But now researchers at Queens University Belfast have said they have come up with a possible alternative  The research conducted at QUBs Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology CCRCB is said to prove there is a direct link between high levels of oestrogen and DNA damage which causes cancer in the breasts and ovaries  The scientists discovered that the cells of women with the BRCA mutation cannot effectively fight the very high levels of oestrogen that exist in all womens breasts and ovaries   This leaves them vulnerable to DNA damage Dr Kienan Savage who led the research said This discovery is very significant in the management of women with the BRCA gene mutation  Its the first really credible evidence that oestrogen is driving cancer in women with a BRCA gene mutation  Because of this discovery we now have the opportunity to propose an alternative treatment to surgery It also opens up the possibility of pausing treatment for a period in order for women to have children if desired The research which has been ongoing for four years was funded by Cancer Focus NI and Cancer Research UK  The next stage will be clinical trials which could start within a year For one Northern Ireland family in particular the outcome of the trials could be very significant Several members of the extended Conlon family who are originally from County Armagh are carriers of the BRCA mutation  rather than face the risk of developing or redeveloping cancer One of the sisters Caroline McErlane had elective surgery in  We became aware of the BRCA gene in  when the second of my sisters was suffering from breast cancer Mrs McErlane said They were beginning to establish quite a strong family history and Bronagh was recommended to test for the BRCA gene Unfortunately her test came back positive Caroline McErlane is one of seven Conlon siblings  five sisters and two brothers   One by one they took the test and discovered that all five women and one of the men were carrying the BRCA gene The women opted for surgery We all agreed that without a doubt with the decisions available to us then this was the safest route forward for all of us Mrs McErlane said However she believes the QUB breakthrough may bring huge benefits for the younger members of her family Its very very positive  At this stage myself and my brothers and sisters have taken our decisions but we all have children and among us there are eight girls who potentially could test positive So our focus is very much on the next generation not only of our own family but the BRCA family at large  A number of our cousins also have tested positive so its a bigger picture Mrs McErlane added She said that alternative treatment to the surgical removal of breasts and ovaries would give the younger members of the Conlon family choices that her own generation did not have  Our timing of our diagnosis was when we already had our children theirs wont be They can decide when they are  to test and one of my nieces has tested and is positive She said her niece was now facing the nagging question  when will this rear up and bite me So I think its very very exciting that they have choices Mrs McErlane said The chief executive of Cancer Focus Northern Ireland Roisin Foster said This has been the potential in the foreseeable future to benefit women all over the world  We are only able to support this vital work because of the generosity of the local community
