Salome Karwah  lost both her parents to Ebola On August  she walked out of the same Monrovia treatment center where they had died a survivor of the virus And then one month later she returned Ebola treatment centers are full of divisions between sick and healthy confirmed and suspected dirty and clean Karwah is standing in a fencedin ward of suspected Ebola patients gently bouncing a monthold baby against her chest I help patients who are helpless she says I help a lot of the babies Some of them without their parents they cry a lot The baby begins to whimper They were breast feeding Its hard As a survivor Karwah is immune to the current strain of Ebola which makes her an ideal employee at the clinic But even with immunity an Ebola treatment center is a difficult place to work There is a lot of death Everyone who chooses to work there  volunteers survivors body collectors  feels some sense of duty to fight the epidemic It was not hard to come back says Karwah Of course I lost my two parents here but if I can help someone survive I will be very happy Its hard not to tear up thinking about what shes been through One of the doctors working alongside her at the treatment center cant help it Thats the most profound thing says Dr Daniel Lucey His eyes well up but he doesnt wipe them Rule number two of operating near Ebola after washing hands is dont touch your face Lucey an infectious disease physician at Georgetown University will be working at the treatment center a total of five weeks during this trip He hopes to come back again Karwah has no plans to leave her job until the epidemic is over Its hard to imagine when that will be It struck me that Monrovia feels more like a city preparing for Ebola to stay than a city expecting it go away anytime soon Ambulances scream down main streets and sirens are drowned out by the sounds of construction equipment building new clinics The president has canceled school until March a full year after the epidemic in Liberia began Despite current efforts it still feels like Ebola is winning there Its surreal then to return to the US and find mild hysteria To read headlines like Can Dallas Defeat Ebola A woman on my flight from Washington DC back to California is wearing rubber gloves People seem confused and scared without knowing why At the airport when I arrive home to Los Angeles a man comes up to me in the crowd outside the terminal Can I borrow your phone he says scanning the crowd I know my girlfriend is here somewhere but my iPhone died His hand brushes against mine as I hand him my phone Thank you so much He dials her number then looks up at me as if remembering something I guess I should ask are you coming back from West Africa Ummm yeah I say confused How does he know Or wait is he asking because hes afraid of me Actually I am But hes not listening He puts the phone to his ear laughing as if I must be joking Just had to ask You know like before I touch your phone and stuff Hi Honey Im here under the JetBlue sign Thanks he says when he hands it back Youre a life saver
