 As Autism Awareness Month wrapped up yesterday there was small but encouraging news A limited British study recently found that up to  percent of highfunctioning autistic kids had recovered enough that they no longer met common criteria for the disorder Symptoms among  children with highfunctioning   were examined over three years  from ages  to   by Dr Elizabeth Pellicano of the University of Londons Institute of Education While Dr Pellicano found that symptoms declined for all the children over time seven of the kids or  percent improved so much after three years they failed to meet criteria on diagnostic instruments Pellicano writes in the March issue of the   The only significant difference between the group that no longer met the diagnostic criteria for autism vs those who did was the age at which they began receiving intervention The earlier treatment was received the better the results While the results sound encouraging Pellicano quickly cautioned that the documented improvement does not mean that these children dont have autism It means she told Everyday Health that the common belief that autism is a static condition is incorrect My findings suggest that the behavioral features do change over time she said These behavioral features will wax and wane with development meaning a portion of the sample who dont meet criteria now might meet it later Some autism advocates however do not share the same measured view as Pellicano Earlier yesterday several comments on Twitter heralded it as proof that autism symptoms are reversible What do you think of the new research stating that ASD symptoms are reversible Autism is NOT for life tweeted the charity Treating Autism     which believes in biomedical approaches to autism and that autism is treatable The tweet shared a link to Pellicanos work But Pellicano vehemently disputes this Nowhere in the paper do I say that the behavioral features of autism can be reversed she told us In fact I strongly believe that this is precisely the wrong way to think about things We should be aiming to empower both individuals with autism with the skills to cope in the world and nonautistic individuals to accommodate autistic differences not to reverse the symptoms of autism In other research University of Connecticut psychologist Deborah Fein says that as many as  percent of autistic children may recover from the disorder An example is Canadian teen Carly Fleischmann who was diagnosed with autism at age  and underwent intensive therapy Amazingly at age  while still unable to vocalize her speech she typed a message on her therapists computer during a   session HELP TEETH HURT This unleashed a torrent of written words and today yearold Carly is thriving Shes even cowritten a book with her dad Arthur titled   which was published last month and has a Facebook   Yet another significant autism recovery case is Leo Lytel a Washington DC boy who was part of Feins study and also was diagnosed at age  Like Carly Leo underwent intensive therapy  a regimen that at its height consisted of  hours of treatment a week At age  Leo had progressed from a child with classic   into a conversational welladjusted and academically successful kid However the numbers from both Pellicanos and Feins studies show that the majority of children with autism do not make such strides as Fleischmann and Lytel
