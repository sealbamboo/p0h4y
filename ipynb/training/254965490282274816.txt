When a California company developed a product to be used in spinal fusion surgeries the firms president said he knew it faced a new ethical dilemma even noting a recent   questioning the high profits some firms were making from donated human tissue Spinal Elements a small and growing company had long made plates screws and other technology used in spinal surgeries But its new Hero Allograft was the first product it ever made from the tissue  in this case the bones  of a donated human cadaver Jason Blain president of   says the company struggled with the idea of making a profit off of a product  even though the company put in its own research and labor to make it  that could not have been made without a family agreeing to donate a loved ones body We think that allograft represents the physical embodiment of someones life and it should be treated that way says Blain He says the products name Hero Allograft honors the families that made the decision to donate a body And Spinal Elements will donate the net proceeds to two charities the MakeaWish Foundation and St Jude Childrens Research Hospital Blain says he hopes to donate at least several thousand dollars a month The product which comes in various formats will cost about  to  per graft Bain says The companys announcement cites a   reported with the   which showed that the human tissue industry is a littleknown and lightlyregulated adjunct to organ donation But unlike organ donation it generates big profits  at least  billion a year  on sales in the US The new product is a bone paste that is made by crushing cleaning and processing human bone Paste made from cadaver bone the company says can easily meld with a patients own bone better stabilizing the spine In some ways the announcement from Spinal Elements reflects clever marketing The company is entering a market where other bigger companies already sell similar bone paste But Blain is counting on surgeons sharing his qualms about the profits made off human tissue donation and wanting to adopt a new approach
