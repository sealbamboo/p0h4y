Bottles of liquid nutritional supplements have become such staples in older peoples refrigerators in nursing homes and assisted living facilities and in hospitals that its easy to assume they serve a useful purpose for seniors who are losing weight The American Geriatrics Society declared otherwise in its   issued in February and intended to caution doctors and patients about questionable procedures drugs and practices As I reported then it advised against using such products and prescription drugs that supposedly stimulate appetites At the societys annual scientific meeting in Orlando Fla last week Paul Mulhausen who led the geriatricians Choosing Wisely work group took even more direct aim at drinks like Boost and Ensure and similar generic brands Pointing out in his presentation that their primary ingredients are water and several forms of sugar as well as some oils and proteins and flavorings he called them liquid candy bars with vitamins An eightounce bottle of rich chocolate Boost Original for instance contains  grams of protein  but also  grams of sugar and no fiber Ensure boasts that in its original formulation sugar content has fallen to  grams from  grams  Froot Loops and Lucky Charms have much less sugar per serving than these drinks Theyre marketed as something that helps you be vigorous and well as you age Dr Mulhausen chief medical officer for Telligen a health management company based in Iowa told me in an interview TV commercials urge seniors to stay strong stay active with Boost But Dr Mulhausen pointed out the only place their value is clear for typical older patients is when people are malnourished very sick and in a hospital  as reported in   In other settings or for other people theres    even if they do add a few pounds They can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms When people have weight loss they should be seen by a physician Dr Mulhausen said If an underlying disease is the reason Ensure wont be much help If an older person is having trouble consuming enough healthy food  because he cant shop or cook because she has trouble using utensils or chewing because a lowsalt diet is so unappetizing he doesnt want to eat because mealtimes are lonely and boring  liquid supplements still arent a good solution Instead geriatricians urge that caregivers  both family and professionals  find ways to help older people eat real food  Seniors may respond to a liberalized and more palatable diet or a more social environment at mealtime Adult day programs can be a good way to provide those They may need assistance with eating   That takes time a commodity overworked aides in understaffed nursing homes often lack Its easier to open a bottle of Boost But unless an older person is hospitalized and undernourished or suffering from head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer that makes swallowing difficult liquid candy bars are seldom the way to go
