Bored with your usual workout? Your muscles might be, too. . Changing exercise routines every three to four weeks can trigger something called “muscle confusion”: As muscles become exposed to new routines, they are forced to work harder in response. The end result: stronger muscles and increased energy levels.. “Do something your muscles aren’t used to,” said TODAY's Jenna Wolfe, who is also a certified personal trainer. “They will have to work harder, they will have to think harder, and you will eventually end up burning more calories in the process.”. As part of . , Jenna decided to throw her own muscles into a world of confusion. She signed up for a hip hop class — and her time in the dance studio might have confused her a little .  much.. "Is this anything? I feel like that's something." Jenna asked, while attempting to keep up with the class. “My body just doesn’t move like all these other people.” . While it wasn’t easy or familiar, Jenna’s change in her routine strengthened her muscles and added a fun change to her regular workouts. (Just don’t expect her dance career to take off anytime soon!). Want to accept Jenna’s 30 Days to a Better You challenge? . !
