Think about people dying from drinking too much and you probably think of the classic disease of alcoholics cirrhosis of the liver Or perhaps an alcoholfueled car crash But there are many more ways to kill yourself with alcohol unfortunately and they account for  in  deaths in workingage adults according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention One in  is a big number says   who leads the alcohol program at the CDC and is an author of the   published Thursday in   One of the issues with alcohol that is particularly tragic is the extent to which it gets people in the prime of their lives And those premature deaths cost the United States  billion a year the report found or  a drink The report underscores that alcohol is the fourthlargest cause of preventable deaths behind smoking poor nutrition and lack of activity The CDC researchers looked at how alcohol affects deaths from chronic diseases from high blood pressure and stroke to breast cancer And it also looked at acute causes of death like motor vehicle accidents In those cases they included deaths where the medical examiner found a bloodalcohol level of at least  percent above the   of  Those causes of death also included falls homicides poisoning that involved pills or other substances along with alcohol and suicides From  through  an average of  deaths were attributed to alcohol each year the study found Almost threequarters of the deaths  percent were in men Men tend to drink more and also to drive more Brewer says and are also more likely to be involved in homicides Some states have much bigger problems with alcoholcaused deaths than others In New Mexico  percent of deaths in the to age range were caused by alcohol Other Western states including Montana and Wyoming werent far behind For more states see the chart below By contrast just  percent of Marylands deaths were attributable to alcohol less than half the rate in New Mexico Other states with low rates of alcoholrelated deaths include New York New Jersey Ohio and Indiana Rural states where people drive long distances have more problems with drunken driving but state policies can have a big impact too Brewer says Raising the cost of alcohol by  percent can lower consumption by  percent But taxes on alcohol tend to be low compared with those on cigarettes If that news isnt sobering enough the in number is almost certainly an underestimate Brewer says because the CDC didnt include other causes of death in younger adults including HIVAIDS pneumonia and tuberculosis Alcohol is a major factor in deaths from those conditions Brewer told Shots But when we were doing our scientific analyses we simply didnt have good estimates on the number of those deaths caused by heavy drinking
