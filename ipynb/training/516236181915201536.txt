About  women worldwide die because of   Five million more are admitted to hospitals with complications after the procedure Activists and researchers on both sides of the abortion debate agree that these back alley operations are dangerous for women Its figuring out the best way to stop them that has been contentious One approach has been to make abortion illegal But evidence is accumulating that this strategy doesnt work And it may even backfire says   who studies reproductive health at the Harvard School of Public Health Many studies have shown that making abortions illegal doesnt decline the number of abortions Langer tells NPR Women just resort to unsafe providers more often To support the claim Langer cites a large study   in the   a few years ago which looked at abortions around the world The conclusion Prohibiting the procedures is linked with slightly higher rates of abortions And the majority of these illegal procedures are dangerous for women The study estimated abortion rates in the  regions around the globe determined by researchers at the   a think tank in Washington that advocates for abortion rights who worked with the World Health Organization The researchers also calculated the fraction of women in each region living what they called liberal laws for abortions About  in  pregnancies worldwide was terminated by an abortion in  the team found That translates to about  million abortions Rates of abortion were about  percent higher on average in regions with widespread restrictions compared with places where liberal laws dominate Once a procedure becomes illegal the need is still there Langer says Women will look for services safe or unsafe to terminate their pregnancy Political scientist   thinks the   study is misleading He works at the Charlotte Lozier Institute a research organization that is opposed to abortion The study tries to compare apples and oranges New tells NPR Many of the countries where abortion is legally restricted tend to have high poverty rates and a variety of other social pathologies that increase the demand for abortions This clouds some of the findings and makes them less reliable than one would like In  an estimated  percent of abortions worldwide occurred in developing countries WHO   and nearly of half of those were performed by someone lacking the proper training or in an unsafe environment In Africa about  percent of abortions fell into this unsafe category Data for these poor countries are only rough estimates New points out Health records are scarce So researchers had to extrapolate from small surveys or deduce rates from models based on data from other countries A better way to see how laws affect abortion rates New says is to look at what happens in a particular country when it relaxes or tightens its restrictions Consider the US The number of abortions increased by nearly  percent in the first six years after   legalized the procedure In  about  abortions were reported in the US By  the number had shot up to nearly  million the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Legal abortions in the US are safe procedures The   is about  deaths per  million abortions Another example is Eastern Europe After the collapse of the Soviet Union many countries had the freedom to change their abortion policies Some started limiting the procedure to only those needed for medical reasons That restriction was linked to about a  percent decrease in abortion rate a study in  in  If you dig deeper into that study another finding stands out Rates of maternal deaths declined when countries soften restrictive abortion laws  presumably because of a decline in unsafe abortions The change was small in the Eastern European countries But a similar trend has occurred in other places that relax restrictions on abortion says   of the Guttmacher Institute who led the  study The clearest evidence that legalizing abortion reduces deaths and complications from unsafe procedures comes from South Africa Sedgh says The country legalized abortions in  Within three years the number of women dying from procedure   by  percent Simply changing the law is not enough to reduce dangerous operations Sedgh says For instance abortions have been legal in India for decades Still about  percent arent performed by skilled physicians or in medically safe rooms the Guttmacher Institute   After a law changes women need to know that abortions are legal Sedgh tells NPR Providers need to be trained to do safe abortions to deal with complications And supplies need to be in place A   for this idea has been occurring in Mexico City In  the metropolis became one of the few places in Latin America to allow firsttrimester abortions But the government went one step further It trained doctors to do the procedures distributed information about the law and ensured clinics had the supplies they needed The result No studies have looked at how the mortality rate from abortions both legal and illegal changed in Mexico City since  After about  procedures in legal clinics Anger says the city has not reported a single death But the key to protecting women from abortion injuries may have nothing to with changing the law or offering women safer options both Langer and Sedgh say Instead it may boil down to stopping unwanted pregnancies in the first place Ensuring access to contraception for all women definitely decreases abortion rates Harvards Langer says Sweden and Norway have the lowest rates of abortion not because adolescents engage in less in sexual activities she says But rather they know how to protect themselves
