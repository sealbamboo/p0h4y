So theres this baby who has swallowed a caliber bullet The mother rushes into a drugstore crying What shall I do 
   Give him a bottle of castor oil replies the druggist but dont point him at anybody Whether you find this joke amusing depends on many more variables than you probably ever realized It depends on a common cultural understanding of the technical properties of castor oil It depends as many funny jokes do and as any fourth grader can attest on our own squeamishness about bodily functions Getting less obvious your sense of humor can also depend on your age your gender your IQ your political inclinations how extroverted you are and the health of your   reward circuit If you think all this analysis sounds a bit well unfunny E B White would back you up He once wrote that picking apart jokes is like dissecting frogs Few people are interested and the subject always dies in the end Fortunately the cognitive neuroscientist Scott Weems isnt afraid of being unfunny Humor is worthy of serious academic study he argues in his book Ha The Science of When We Laugh and Why   because it yields insights into how our brains process a complex world and how that in turn makes us who we are Though animals laugh humans spend more time laughing than exhibiting any other emotion But what gives some people a better sense of humor than others Not surprisingly extroverts tend to laugh more and produce more jokes yet in tests measuring the ability to write cartoon captions people who were more neurotic assertive manipulative and dogmatic were actually funnier As the old saw holds many of the best comics really are miserable Perhaps Dr Weems writes unhappy people are more likely than others to speak out in awkward or socially unacceptable ways to make a good joke Or as people from Aristotle to Gertrude Stein have pointed out unhappiness can breed creativity and the best jokes require both intellectual gymnastics and astute observation of human nature Analyzing humorsometimes requires taking jokes apart Dr Weems unpacks getting jokes into three basic components constructing sorting through relevant knowledge experience and expectations reckoning jettisoning our errors and mistaken expectations and resolving reaching a satisfying often surprising conclusion See how your brain quickly does all three when reading the Lenoworthy headline Doctor Testifies in Horse Suit Dr Weems argues that these three stages are the same ones we use for solving daily problems from logistical to interpersonal to existential Interpreting our world he writes is a creative event At their root jokes are about conflict and detecting errors is how our brains turn conflict to reward Without this ability we wouldnt be able to make decisions learn new tricks or get along with each other There are some important questions the book doesnt quite tackle In particular the discussion of male and female humor is interesting but unsatisfying Explaining why men tend to make more jokes yet women are more likely to laugh at them Dr Weems speculates that women approach jokes with a more open mind But I suspect there are cultural factors at work having to do with power and submission as well as hardwired evolutionary courtship strategies Make us laugh and were yours Men want women to smile much to the chagrin of feminists like the street artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh see   Stop Telling Women to Smile Interestingly women laugh less as they age but not men Still Dr Weems makes a good case that humor makes us our best selves and that we should all laugh more Studies show that humor improves our health helps us get along better with others and even makes us smarter he writes Laughter literally loosens up our blood vessels promoting healthy circulation in a way similar to aerobic exercise Interestingly though the funniest people dont live longer Not only do they tend to be more neurotic they are also likelier to smoke to be more sedentary and to gain weight Still even if it doesnt extend life humor makes it more bearable by lessening our emotional and physical pain In one famous humor study conducted by James Rotton at Florida International University subjects who watched funny movies after surgery requested  percent less pain medication Another study showed that watching an episode of Friends reduced anxiety three times as effectively as just sitting and resting Subjects also performed better on   such as wordassociation problems after reading funny jokes and watching videos of Robin Williams performing standup comedy For those of us who are more Grinch than Groucho Dr Weems says it is possible to improve your sense of humor either through training or by increasing your exposure to funny media and people along with lots of practice To his credit he even tried some standup of his own one night at a club in Baltimore Did he kill it Apparently not Luckily for us it looks as if hell stick to his day job
