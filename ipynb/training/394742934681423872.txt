Messiah United Methodist Church in Springfield Va is unusually busy for a Thursday morning Its not a typical time for worship but parishioner Stacy Riggs and her husband have come for something a little different a medical screening Im getting ready to turn  sooner than Id like to say and just thought it was a good time to get an overall screening said Riggs of Fairfax Va She doesnt have any symptoms but she stopped by the church which as a service to parishioners is offering a day of testing by the company   For less than  Riggs is getting six different screenings for stroke heart disease and osteoporosis Life Line says it has checked  million Americans this way at churches and community centers and up to  percent of them have been found to have some sort of abnormality But several of the tests performed by Life Line are on a list of procedures for healthy people to avoid The tests can potentially do more harm than good according to the   an independent panel that recommends evidencebased treatments Even though the screening tests are generally noninvasive followup exams and procedures often are not and can increase a persons odds of being injured or overtreated One of those questionable tests is   which looks for plaque buildup in a neck artery that can cause a stroke Its on the American Academy of Family Physicians   With that test the patient is more likely actually to have a stroke because of the screening and subsequent testing and possible surgery than if theyd never been screened at all says Dr Glen Stream who chairs the academys board The problem he says is that many of the findings are false positives  in other words things that may be abnormal but wont ever hurt you But once you find something he says its hard not to aggressively treat it even when thats not the right approach Theres sort of a compelling momentum for patient and doctor both to say Well now that we know theres a problem we need to investigate and understand it And then theres the dilemma about Do we treat it  Stream says So many times watchful waiting is the right treatment option but it just doesnt always sit well Dr Andy Manganaro medical director of Life Line Screening in Independence Ohio takes a different view He says the companys tests save many lives Manganaro who was a vascular surgeon for  years says he was often called to see a patient in the emergency room who had an alreadyruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that could have been discovered earlier with screening tests of the sort that Life Line Screening offers Had they known they had the aneurysm a week before we could have fixed it with very little risk to them he says And they would have been going home instead of to the morgue And while most of the research and advisory panels are nearly unanimous that several tests offered by Life Line and other companies are more likely to cause harm than good for people without symptoms Manganaro counters that the research those panels cite is out of date Even people who arent at major risk can benefit he says because the tests push them to change their lifestyles before more damage is done Yes you can tell people in general lose weight stop smoking exercise lead a healthy lifestyle But most often it goes in one ear and out the other Manganaro says On the other hand though if you show someone a picture of their carotid artery filled with plaque as compared to a normal carotid artery theyre much more likely to throw out their Lucky Strikes on the way out the door But its not just about quitting smoking or taking other steps to improve your health Its also about money Life Line Screening is a forprofit company and it often   that help promote the screening days If Life Line screens find an abnormality the patients can be referred to the hospital for followup care which means more business for the hospital Cardiac care can be especially lucrative The fact that forprofit companies are pushing these tests should raise consumer suspicions says   medical director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center When information comes in the form of an advertisement or promotion regardless of the source be skeptical Santa says Realize that from a health point of view if this was a really good and important thing to do you probably wouldnt need to be advertising and promoting it Most important he adds is to talk to your family doctor before doing any kind of screening to make sure youre getting the tests that are right for you
