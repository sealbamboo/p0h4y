The Mediterranean diet  higher in vegetables fruits whole grains and olive oil and lower in dairy products and meat  has long been   Researchers have new clues as to why They found that the diet was associated with longer telomeres the protective structures at the end of chromosomes Shorter telomeres are associated with agerelated chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy Researchers used data on  healthy women part of a larger health study whose diets were ranked on a scale of one to nine for similarity to the ideal Mediterranean diet Researchers measured their telomere lengths with blood tests and followed them for more than  years with periodic examinations The study published in the journal BMJ controlled for body mass index smoking physical activity reproductive history and other factors and found that the higher the score for adherence to the diet the longer the telomeres The difference in telomere length for each point on the adherence scale the researchers estimate was equivalent to an average one and a half years of life Based on our data said the lead author Marta CrousBou a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School a threepoint change in the adherence score is equivalent to  years of aging a difference comparable to that between smokers and nonsmokers
