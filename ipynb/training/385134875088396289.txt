And thats good news for health care insurance companies    Young and fit people like Zanardelli  and Foster  have to buy into the system to support the laws mandate that all people must have health insurance next year Under Obamacare companies can no longer deny policies to people with preexisting conditions and some  million Americans are uninsured according to the latest US Census Bureau figures  What insurance companies will save on medical costs for the healthier population will help pay for the older sicker people who are entering into the insurance market for the first time But because theyre young  and dont foresee getting sick any time soon  some Millennials may decide to skip insurance and risk paying a fine  Zanardelli and Foster have health insurance now but its pricey and it covers nothing Zanardelli said She hasnt been to the doctor in years and shells out about  a month Her policy doesnt cover prescriptions either  If its not generic I cant afford it  She says her family warned her about this when she left her teaching job in Charlotte to follow her passion for cooking One of the first things my parents said was that I was really going to miss that good health insurance and they were right Im healthy but I really do Zaradelli said Ultimately though its worth it  This doesnt feel like work to me I love what I do New insurance will make this even better The owners of Neue Southern met in  when they enrolled in the culinary arts program at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte The two chose to move to South Carolina after working under wellknown chefs in New York The foodie fast lane they decided wasnt for them When they scanned the country for opportunities the food trucks in their East Village neighborhood inspired them Why not bring a slice of the East Village to Greenville where Foster got his first taste of cooking in the kitchen of his Germanborn grandmother They were true foodie pioneers  Zanardelli says the people of Greenville welcomed their European take on old Southern favorites but when it comes to health insurance they may have been better off somewhere else South Carolina ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes according to the latest edition of    While Obamacare is federal legislation the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide how they would handle the implementation Leaders in South Carolina have been downright antagonistic to the legislation  Just because the Supreme Court says something is constitutional doesnt make it constitutional one South Carolina state senator who introduced an antiObamacare bill this year  The senators bill failed as did others  one of which would actually have made it a crime for a state or federal official to implement any provision of Obamacare  but the state did successfully refuse to expand Medicaid It has not set up its own health care marketplace  We dont talk politics around here because there goes half our client base either way Foster said while mixing the base for the Ramen But politics aside we need something better than what we have  For the more than   there are parts of the federal legislation that will help them Many will be able to buy policies through the federal health insurance marketplaces And many such as the chefs of Neue Southern will be eligible for tax breaks and subsidies to help them pay for any policies bought through these marketplaces The policies themselves will also be much more comprehensive All health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care including hospitalization outpatient care emergency services mental health and substance abuse care maternity and newborn care prescription drugs lab tests rehab and pediatric care  Premiums will vary depending on the depth of coverage Outofpocket costs for an individual are capped at   When Zanardelli and Foster do get a break from work they say they will shop around and figure out which policy best fits their needs Health care coverage could come in handy right now for Foster  He struggled with a double ear infection for weeks A doctor at the local urgent care center told him ear drops would cost him  he paid to avoid permanent damage to his ears Now he has a sinus infection Unfortunately even if he were to buy insurance through the exchanges today the policies wont kick in until January  Not having insurance they say is not an option  even if the fine would be a lot cheaper than the least expensive policy option I think of this as an investment in our future health care Zanardelli said Most of the younger people we hear object to Obamacare are looking at the present and how it affects them now  We are relatively healthy but in a few decades we will likely need medical attention We feel optimistic it will be something that can work better for us health wise and be affordable she continued That would be a beautiful thing
