Weve already nudged you this week about the   And this got us thinking more about the timing of our meals Theres a growing body of evidence to suggest that when we eat during a hour cycle is likely more important for our health than we realized Take for instance a study published earlier this year which we   on that suggests the best way to maximize weight loss is to eat early in the day not late As part of the study researchers in Spain recruited hundreds of middleage folks who were overweight and put them on a diet for five months At the end of the study the folks whod eaten their main meal of the day before  pm lost about  more pounds than the people who ate a dinner meal later in the evening The late eaters were also more likely to eat breakfast Whats interesting here is that all the dieters were eating about the same number of calories and had similar levels of physical activity And the authors concluded that indeed the timing of when we eat does seem to matter So whats going on here Researchers think our body clocks have a lot to do with it You see in addition to the master clock in our brains there are also little timekeeping clocks in all the organs of our bodies  from our livers and hearts to our guts Since these clocks dont work on a perfect hour cycle they need to be reset each day Think of it as winding up an old grandfather clock Light works as a main cue to reset the brain clock And scientists say an important reset cue for the miniclocks in our body is the first bite of food in the morning Its the biological nudge that says Hey the day has started  wake up and start working When the timing of meals does not match with the sleepwake cycle well theres a disconnect between the different clocks that we have in basically all the cells of our body explained   who directs the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston We spoke to him back in January when the study was published If you listen to my conversation on NPRs   youll also hear how scientist   of the Salk Institute explains the likely connections between the timing of meals and the bodys ability to process food optimally When the clocks in our body are out of sync explains Panda then our body stores extra energy as fat And over a long period of time that can lead to Type  diabetes obesity and increased risk for heart diseases So bottom line respect the clock And stay tuned on this topic More research is on its way
