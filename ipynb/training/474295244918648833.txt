A new study finds that these  types are more likely to have old age listed as their cause of death than chronic diseases according to lead author     The study published in the most recent edition of  finds that most centenarians die from pneumonia or general frailty rather than cancer or heart disease   are more likely to kill people who only make it to their s and s   To get at this information Evans examined data from the death records of people in the United Kingdom who died between  and  She looked at a group of  people who were between  and  when they died The median age of death was   Evans said she was surprised at how large that  population is It has nearly doubled every decade since the s in the UK Globally the  population is projected to grow to about  million people by the end of the century    Looking at where these centenarians died showed that the majority ended their days in a care home  or hospital  They were less likely to die at home  or in hospice care   show the elderly prefer to die at home so the study authors argue that as this population grows there is an urgent need to ensure adequate longterm care and responsive community care services to support people living with extreme longevity in these care settings   Since the elderly are often frail earlier studies have shown that  where a persons family lived Home Evans suggests may be more of a metaphor for where you feel safe and secure and where your loved ones are nearby    While this study specifically looked at the British population the number of centenarians has grown all around the world   who works with many of these oldold people as the medical director of the   said that the study is an important tool to understand a population thats often overlooked When it comes to the elderly there are really three groups we look at explained Adelman Those who are considered old who are  to  years of age the older between ages  to  and the oldold which are those people over the age of   But when you look at centenarians that really is an expanding group and the important thing is to get their advance directives to make sure these people express how they want to be treated in their later years so they can live a better quality of life and be more comfortable Where do they want to live how do they want to live and whats best for them Because of advances made in medical technology and the fact many people entering their golden years are more healthconscious than ever before Adelman says its time society takes the elderly including centenarians seriously because this older age group will continue to grow and need care To be honest  is no longer old noted Adelman Ten thousand Americans are turning  every day There are  million baby boomers who were born between  and  They are more educated they have the best health literacy than prior generations they exercise they eat right and they are living longer healthier lives  We need to be able to provide them the best care and services possible as they age into their s s and beyond
