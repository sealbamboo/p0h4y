A man in The Times cafeteria the other day bought sliced turkey white rice a slice of white bread with butter and a Diet Coke I realize it wasnt a vegan lunch but it provides a lesson in how to create a healthful meal color I spent the month of January on a vegan diet I did eat a small piece of cheese without thinking while sitting and talking with friends  an example of mindless eating that could be fodder for a different story and I learned a lot from experimenting from readers suggestions and from books Foremost among the lessons is that a vegan diet is not necessarily a healthful diet You can replace animal products with chemicals and bagels French fries white rice candy and sodas can be vegan Not exactly what the doctor ordered for a long and happy life And again a pretty colorless diet Although many people choose to eat a vegan diet for their health more do it for reasons having to do with the environment and animal rights according to surveys Those folks were my cheerleaders all month Here are a few ideas for adopting a more plantbased diet for  and beyond  Make sure the food on your plate is full of it Fruits and vegetables make that easy Were told by the US government that we need at least five servings a day Fewer than  of Americans consume that and many nutritionists say five is not enough  Sharon Palmer author of The PlantPowered Diet and PlantPowered for Life says it can be difficult to maintain a vegan diet while traveling especially in places where you dont speak the language Be nice she says Look at websites that list veganfriendly spots such as   Consider relaxing your standards once in a while In unfamiliar territory it might be tough to verify that a dish is free of cheese or fish sauce Theres no vegan police Palmer says Its a persontoperson choice  Im grateful that I know how to cook and that fresh produce available yearround in Southern California makes just about any diet easy Offer to bring a vegan dish when youre invited to dinner to ease any discomfort for the host  Tofu nuts beans meat substitutes and even vegetables are easy sources of protein But many people no matter their diets are short of vitamin D which generally comes from the sun and from fortified foods and of vitamin B which we mainly get from meat Palmer says it can be worthwhile to take supplements  Consider changing one thing a week  maybe try brown rice and tofu for breakfast rather than a bacon sandwich Most of us can benefit from eating fewer animal products For me eggs and ice cream were what I missed most I can happily live without cold cuts and Im ready to give up beef All that puts it squarely in the reducetarian camp wwwreducetariancom  an initiative to get people to eat fewer animal products  Buy or grow new fruits and vegetables I also was pleasantly surprised by some things we tasted including Beyond Meats grilled chicken Tofurkys hot dogs and several veggie burgers My family loved the food at restaurants we tried including the best Brussels sprouts ever at Mohawk Bend in Echo Park  If vegan isnt enough theres always a raw vegan diet A reader Thomas Leeman says he was heavy as a young adult but lost weight when he adopted a raw diet of vegetables fruits nuts and legumes His cholesterol fell from  to  he says Now I eat as large a portion as I want never thinking about quantity or calories he wrote in an email  Ah yes The most frequent question from friends and strangers alike was whether I lost any I dont own a scale but I can say I absolutely lost the notinsignificant weight I gained over the holidays Beyond that I dont know What I can say however is that I can see a vegan January in
