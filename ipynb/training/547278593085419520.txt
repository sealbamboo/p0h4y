Superstar athletes Peyton Manning LeBron James and Serena Williams led their colleagues with endorsements of food and beverages that are caloriedense and unhealthful  sending mixed messages about diet and health researchers said Of  brands endorsed by  top athletes nearly a quarter of them  were for food and beverages   different brands in  the year studied by researchers from Yale Stanford Duke and Harvard universities Some brands appeared more than once on the list Nearly  of the  food products were energydense and nutrientpoor and  of the  beverages got all of their calories from added sugar according to the study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics The researchers noted a striking irony of having someone so physically fit as these athletes promoting such unhealthy foods lead researcher Marie Bragg of Yales Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity said in a telephone interview And they said adolescents ages  to  were the group that saw the most of such commercials It would be ideal if athletes stopped promoting unhealthful food Bragg said But thats a tall order given how much money is involved But she said she hopes to see such endorsements become a liability for athletes Andy Bellatti a registered dietitian and cofounder of the group Dietitians for Professional Integrity agreed We have to reach that tipping point where advertising for soda is seen as irresponsible he said especially because so many children looked up to sports stars Sports beverages were the largest category of athlete endorsements with  followed by soft drinks with  and fast food with  the researchers wrote The products in tennis star Serena Williams ads had the worst scores for nutrition Manning had the most ads for food and beverages with  followed by baseball player Ryan Howard with  Howard the researchers wrote endorsed the fewest energydense nutrientpoor products Underlying the research is a recommendation from the World Health Organization for policies limiting young peoples exposure to food advertising Professional athletes are in a unique position to use their highly visible status to promote healthy messages to youth the researchers wrote Efforts to reach the athletes spokesmen were not immediately successful The American Beverage Assn a trade group issued a statement saying Americas beverage companies have a longstanding commitment to responsible advertising and marketing practices including not directing advertising to audiences comprised predominantly of children under  The statement notes that children under  are the not the age groupÂ that is primarily viewing food and beveragerelated advertisements that include professional athletes Football star Manning reportedly earns  million a year from contracts with Papa Johns Pizza Gatorade Wheaties and other companies that do not sell food the researchers said Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant earned an estimated  million a year from his endorsement contract with McDonalds they said James also a basketball star was reported to receive  million to endorse Bubblicious Gum one flavor was called LeBrons Lightning Lemonade Such money suggests how much food and beverage companies value associations with celebrity athletes the researchers wrote But they said future research should examine how professional athletes endorsement of food products affects consumption attitudes toward food and beverage brands and intentions to purchase The researchers quantified professional athletes endorsements and evaluated the nutritional quality of those foods and drinks and determined the number of TV commercial exposures of the endorsements and commercials They looked at  athletes in Bloomberg Businessweeks Power  rankings in  The list ranks athletes according to their endorsement value and prominence They also used an advertisement database called AdScope as well as Nielsen ratings The researchers watched the ads and collected nutrition information for each food product then generated scores based on the nutrients in them For restaurants the top five marketed products were used Beverages were considered nutrientpoor if all of the calories came from added sugar healthful if the total was less than  All of that was used to generate a score to rank athletes It was that ranking that Manning Williams and James topped The researchers found that the National Basketball Assn had the most athletes who endorsed food  followed by the National Football League with  and Major League Baseball with  Public health officials and others have previously criticized professional athletes for endorsing lessthanhealthful food But Bragg said this was the first quantification of the phenomenon Last month the American Beverage Assn joined with First Lady Michelle Obama and the Partnership for a Healthier America of which Mrs Obama serves as honorary chair to support an initiative encouraging people to drink water In a statement about that initiative the beverage industry group  whose companies include CocaCola Co Dr Pepper Snapple Group Nestle Waters North America and PepsiCo  said the industry had long been committed to the health and wellness of Americans The Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative is a volunteer program that many food and beverage companies have joined vowing to advertise healthful foods on childrens programs Bragg called that an important step but some critics have noted that many programs including sports events are not childrens programs but are still watched by children as are the ads placed on them The Pediatrics researchers noted that tobacco companies had a history of ads with athletes including baseball legends Babe Ruth Joe DiMaggio Ted Williams and Lou Gehrig They noted that the industry adopted a voluntary advertising code in  not to use athletes r
