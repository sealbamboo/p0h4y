 Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the Italian parent company of drug maker Cosmo Technologies Ltd. said Friday they had terminated a previously announced $2.7 billion merger agreement—a deal that had been structured as a so-called inversion.. Those deals have come under increased scrutiny in Washington and elsewhere. Raleigh, N.C.-based Salix’s move to scrap the agreement represents one of the first deal-making retreats in the wake of new rules implemented last month by the U.S. Treasury to make inversions less attractive.
