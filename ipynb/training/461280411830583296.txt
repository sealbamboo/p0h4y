Until recently Mike Smith  of Long Beach Calif worked  hours a day Monday through Friday and then half a day on Saturday He was a district manager for a national auto parts chain He dreamed of retiring early but it wasnt an option for him because he and his wife relied on the health insurance tied to his job At our age with some preexisting medical conditions it would have been very costly to buy insurance on the open market  about  a month he says But the Affordable Care Act changed that Smith retired in January So did his wife Laura also  The couple now has a private health insurance policy bought through Covered California the states insurance marketplace It costs  a month The coverage helped the Smiths make a major lifestyle change Just after noon on a recent weekday Mike is at their Long Beach home cooking lunch Weve got organic shallots organic Brussels sprouts and organic apple cider vinegar he says stirring the ingredients with a wooden spoon I love the smell of the shallots dont you Smith says hes now also able to take care of his elderly inlaws and his yearold grandchild He gets to practice his guitar more often too A   by Georgetown University and the Urban Institute predicts the ACA will enable up to  million Americans to leave their jobs and become selfemployed start new businesses or retire early Its a finding that runs counter to   by critics of the federal health law who contend it will cost the nation jobs and cripple Americas smallbusiness economy It will take years to know how the health law will change the work landscape in a broad sense but already the law has changed life for Rebecca Murray Last year Murray says her husband  a freelance worker in the information technology field  was diagnosed with chronic spinal arthritis He needed good health insurance which he received through Murrays job as a social worker in Chicago for a dialysis company But Murray didnt like her job Murray and her husband are both  with a monthold daughter and a second child on the way Before the Affordable Care Act they couldnt get insurance on the individual market because of his   But under the federal health law they now qualify for a subsidized policy that will cost  a month for the whole family Its not cheap she says but the coverage allowed her to quit her job and launch an online business to help other young women take care of sick loved ones Its thrilling its exciting its kind of like taking a leap into the unknown  and I know its a big risk Murray says of her new venture But this really is allowing me to finally step into what I feel is truly satisfying for the soul Just a year ago she adds I was convinced I would be a renal social worker for the next something years and just raise my kids  and hope they could live out their dreams instead
