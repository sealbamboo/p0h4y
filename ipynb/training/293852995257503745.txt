Tuesday marks the th anniversary of   the US Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Thousands of activists on both sides of the issue are holding rallies marking the day at state capitals across the country In the decades since the decision abortion has been one of the most debated and legislated issues in the nation And state legislatures which are increasingly passing laws restricting abortion have become the debates key battlegrounds South Dakota is one such state On a busy thoroughfare in Sioux Falls a dusting of snow surrounds a small brick building that houses a Planned Parenthood clinic Inside clinic staff are using informed consent procedures now mandated by state law In one room a nurse and patient quietly discuss the pages of forms required before an abortion can be performed With the end of one legal challenge here a mandatory hour waiting period for an abortion is about to increase to  hours The law says a woman must be allowed to see an ultrasound and that the doctor must record any response A doctor is also required to read a statement saying abortion causes an increased risk of suicide  a claim that abortionrights groups say is not supported by medical evidence The doctor must also tell patients that an abortion will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being Its language that is designed to demean and degrade and shame a woman says Sarah Stoesz president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota North Dakota and South Dakota The situation in that state is becoming increasingly more difficult The group is battling legislation that it says is intended to intimidate women The latest flashpoint is a provision requiring patients get counseling from crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortions and try to discourage them We will never give up on that because it is   heinous and it is   degrading and it is so wrong to put a woman in that position Stoesz says Several crisis pregnancy centers in Sioux Falls would not provide anyone to discuss the requirement In part the law says the centers will assess the mothers health and judge whether she is being coerced into having an abortion What the state is trying to do is to ensure that the mother has an informed decision says Mary Spaulding Balch who monitors and directs state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee Theyre not   the abortion but they certainly can make sure that prior to making this lifeanddeath decision that the mother knows the full and complete consequences of that decision A movement to impose the requirement has momentum in the states where a growing number of legislatures are passing restrictions The laws  more than   alone according to the Guttmacher Institute which studies abortion in the US  include stronger informed consent measures parental notification ultrasound requirements and clinic regulations In addition more than a halfdozen states now restrict abortion after  weeks based on the theory that fetuses can feel pain Four decades after   five states including Mississippi North Dakota and South Dakota have just one clinic that performs abortion Spaulding Balch says those laws reflect the will of their citizens The states reflect the people more closely and they have an ability to respond to what the people in the state thinks is reasonable she says After four decades both sides say they have the support of the American people National Right to Life points to a   that shows half of those surveyed identify themselves as prolife versus prochoice But abortionrights groups say that   poll shows more than  of Americans think abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances Another focal point in the abortion debate has been Wichita Kan where second and thirdtrimester abortions were performed for years at a clinic owned by Dr George Tiller An avowed abortion opponent murdered Tiller in  and the clinic has remained vacant since then Now abortionrights activists are trying to reopen it Julie Burkhart who ran Tillers political action committee in Kansas says she formed the Trust Women Foundation to find doctors willing to perform firsttrimester abortions in Wichita a city that is divided on the issue  and that has been without an abortion provider for   years We did a lot of soul searching Burkhart says Her group decided that to honor Tiller and the women who live in the area it needed to reestablish abortion care which we are doing with a new model of practice We will be offering full spectrum OBGYN care Burkhart says she has found three outoftown doctors willing to come to Wichita and expects the clinic to open within two months Tiller had recognized that regulations might be passed to try to close the facility so he built large operating rooms and wide hallways similar to what you might see in a minor emergency center Regulations requiring clinics to meet those standards did eventually pass in Kansas and are now in court Abortionrights activists see reopening of the clinic as a bright spot in the abortion debate but those opposed to abortion vow to do everything they can to keep it closed David Gittrich state development director for Kansans for Life started a petition drive to persuade the city to rezone the area We need to continue being prolife until we reverse the   decision and have opportunity to make it illegal in our state and in other states Gittrich says Things dont change and get solved unless youre in the race for a long haul But after so many years bickering about the laws and the social divide Planned Parenthoods Stoesz says the issue is about not only abortion but how women feel about their autonomy and whats best for their families Stoesz adds that shed like to see real dialogue and common ground on issues like reducing the need for abortion and ending child hunger But with the two sides so far apart the question remains whether they can engage in any real discussion I just think the country is tired of this Stoesz says of the ongoing divide Its been  years since   and people want to move on
