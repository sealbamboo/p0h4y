With onequarter of adults over age  taking cholesterollowering statin drugs it figures that more than a few people would have trouble sticking with the program More than a few actually A big new study of statin use in the real world found that  percent of patients taking the pills reported side effects including muscle pain nausea and problems with their liver or nervous system Thats a lot higher than the  to  percent reported in the randomized controlled trials that provided evidence for regulatory approval of the medicines This   which was published in   looked at more than  people whod been prescribed statins from  through  at two academic medical centers About twothirds of people with side effects quit taking statins All in all half of all the people who been prescribed the drugs quit them at last temporarily Twenty percent quit for more than a year Its tough to get people to take medicine to reduce the odds of disease years from now notes   a cholesterol researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas The vast majority of people dont have side effects he wrote in an  accompanying the study Not continuing the drug has a lot more to do with people just not wanting to take drugs for a lifetime People have decidedly mixed feelings about the side effects associated with statins according to a  NPRTruven Health Analytics   The worry of course is that the ranks of statin quitters include people at high risk of heart disease for whom the daily dose of cholesterollowering drug can reduce the risk of deadly heart attacks Statins are important drugs especially for patients with known heart disease says Dr Alexander Turchin an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who led the study These are not drugs you just want to throw away without a second thought And many of the people in this study who quit the drug were able to get back on statins Turchin and his colleagues found Reasons varied The side effects might have been tolerable he told Shots They could have been specific to a particular drug that wouldnt arise with a different statin Or they might not have been due to a statin at all I had a patient with shoulder pain that we thought might have been due to a statin but it turned out to be lymphoma But patients should still proceed with caution when considering statins says Dr Barbara Roberts director of the Womens Cardiac Center at Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island and author of a   called   Studies havent shown that statins help women who dont already have heart disease even if they have risk factors like obesity and family history she says Thats compared to a recent   that found a  percent reduction in heart attacks in people who follow a Mediterranean diet You can get just as much benefit from following the Mediterranean diet as you can from statins she says Last year the Food and Drug Administration   that taking statins slightly increases the risk of diabetes even in people at a healthy weight and with no other risk factors No research has been done to see if the diabetes goes away when patients stop taking statins she says And longterm statin use may cause nerve damage Roberts says That damage often reverses she says but the process can take months I have two patients who wound up bedridden from biopsyproven neuropathy due to statins both improved but never returned to normal strength People should know their risk factors for heart disease like smoking or a family history and know their target level for LDL cholesterol A lot of primary care doctors and even some cardiologists dont know what the current prevention guidelines are Roberts says and may try to lower patients cholesterol needlessly This   based on the Framingham Risk Score can help with that mission I had a patient in her s her LDL lowdensity lipoprotein the bad cholesterol was  Roberts says Her doctor wanted to put her on a statin Shes now  She hasnt been on a statin and she still doesnt have heart disease
