Fifteen years after tobacco companies agreed to pay billions of dollars in fines in what is still the largest civil litigation settlement in US history its unclear how state governments are using much of that money So far tobacco companies have paid more than  billion to state governments as part of the year  billion settlement Among many state governments receiving money Orange County Calif is an outlier Voters mandated that  percent of money from tobacco companies be spent on smokingrelated programs like a cessation class taught in the basement of Anaheim Regional Medical Center So go ahead and take a minute or two to write down reasons why you want to quit and well talk about them in just a bit Luisa Santa says at the start of a recent session Every year since  this program has been funded by money from the tobacco settlement The fivepart class is free for anyone living or working in Orange County When they sign up participants get a quit kit full of things like toothpicks and gum And if they come for at least three of the five sessions they get a free twoweek supply of nicotine patches In the mids Mississippi was the undisputed leader on the tobacco issue In  Mike Moore the state attorney general filed the first state lawsuit against big tobacco Individual lawsuits by smokers failed because courts held people responsible for their decision to smoke but Moore argued that Mississippi shouldnt be forced to pay the costs of treating smokingrelated diseases Things such as lung cancer heart disease emphysema lowbirthweight babies and others we have to pay Moore told NPR in a  interview The state is obligated to pay for those for our citizens that are not covered in other ways and we feel like theyre caused by the tobacco products Moore argued that tobacco companies should pay for medical bills and eventually the courts agreed That agreement said no ads and no targeting youth Popular advertising characters like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man were killed off as a result The settlement left the tobacco industry immune from future state and federal suits but the agreement said nothing about how states had to spend the money Looking back on it Moore remembers it was a long slog It was not an easy task Moore tells NPRs Arun Rath When we filed our case here in  my governor actually sued me to try to stop the tobacco case The tobacco companies sued Moore as well he says and it went all the way to the Supreme Court It took me two years before I even had five states who would agree to join the efforts Moore now serves on the board of directors of the American Legacy Foundation a group created by the tobacco settlement The organizations mission is to create national antismoking campaigns like the   The tobacco settlement included money specifically to fund public service announcements but Moore says most of the settlement money came with no strings attached and that has made it impossible to hold states accountable In Mississippi where the settlement money was put into a trust fund a lot of it was spent on things other than smoking prevention and health care Moore says What happened as the years went by legislators come and go and governors come and go  so we got a new governor and he had a new opinion about the tobacco trust fund he says So a trust fund that should have  billion in it now doesnt have much at all and unfortunately thats one of my biggest disappointments And its not just Mississippi Moore says that all across the country hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to states and the states have made choices not to spend the money on public health and tobacco prevention Its not all bad news in Mississippi however Moore says money that was spent on tobacco prevention has helped reduce teen smoking by more than  percent in just five years Adult smoking has been reduced by about  percent and he says it is that way around much of the US as well We need to continue the vigilance he says We have new products coming out  ecigarettes and the like  we just need to talk the states into spending the money to do something about it Myron Levin covered the tobacco industry for the   for many years and is also the founder of the health and safety news site   He says talking states into spending settlement money on tobacco prevention is a tough sell To show the settlement was not just a big money grab Levin says there was definitely a feeling that states had a moral obligation to spend at least a sizeable chunk of money on programs to help people quit smoking and to prevent kids from starting So it was understood without being codified into the agreement that states would make a big investment in this he says They havent To help guide state governments in  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states reinvest  percent of the money from the settlement and tobacco taxes in antismoking programs But most state governments have decided to prioritize other things Colorado has spent tens of millions of its share to support a literacy program while Kentucky has invested half of its money in agricultural programs What states have actually done has fluctuated year by year  but its never come close to  percent Levin says There are some fairly notorious cases of money being used for fixing potholes for tax relief and for financial assistance for tobacco farmers Levin says some states dont have any money coming in anymore because they securitized their future payments with an investor in order to receive a lump sum That lump sum often went into their states general fund For its part the tobacco industry has managed to weather the settlement fairly well New products like smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes have put many companies on the road to big sales Levin says When you are supplying the most widely used addictive product in the world you have certain advantages he says Their cash flows remain enormous One indirect effect of the settlement Levin says is legislation that gave the Federal Drug Administration control over tobacco products President Obama signed the law in  Something that could happen although I wouldnt put a lot of money on it is they could ratchet down the allowable levels of nicotine in cigarettes to a level that is essentially nonaddictive he says That would be a total game changer Nonaddictive cigarettes would indeed be a game changer for people like Susan Hallock an attendee at the class in Orange County who says she desperately wants to quit I feel ashamed she says I feel like I have to hide my hand with the cigarette in it But the nicotine keeps her coming back over and over Ill smoke like six to eight months and quit Or a month and quit Its just different every time Shes hoping that this time with the help of the free class shell be successful And she has a real chance The program has a  percent success rate for adults like her
