It was supposed to be a short stay In  Roger Anderson was to undergo surgery to relieve a painfully compressed spinal disk His wife Karen figured the staff at the hospital in Portland Ore would understand how to care for someone with Parkinsons disease It can be difficult Parkinsons patients like Mr Anderson for example must take medications at precise intervals to replace the brain chemical dopamine which is diminished by the disease You dont have much of a window Mrs Anderson said If you have to wait an hour you have tremendous problems Without these medications people may freeze and be unable to move or develop uncontrolled movements called dyskinesia and are prone to falls But the nurses at the Portland hospital didnt seem to grasp those imperatives Youd have to wait half an hour or an hour and thats not how it works for Parkinsons patients Mrs Anderson said Nor did hospital rules at the time permit her to simply give her husband the Sinemet pills on her own Surgery and anesthesia the disrupted medications an incision that subsequently became infected  all contributed to a tailspin that lasted nearly three months Mr Anderson developed delirium rotated between rehab centers and hospitals took a fall lost  pounds People were telling me Hes never going to come home Mrs Anderson said He did recover and at  is doing well his wife said though his disease has progressed But his wasnt an unusual story neurologists say Any older person faces dangers in a hospital but for people with Parkinsons  largely a disease of older adults  theyve proved particularly hazardous Patients were telling us these horrendous stories said Dr Michael Okun a University of Florida neurologist and national medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation Even in good hospitals Even in my own hospital People with Parkinsons   and their stays last longer A common reason These patients arent getting their meds on time and theyre not getting the right meds Dr Okun said Some need to take their dopaminereplacing drugs as often as every two hours a schedule at odds with standard hospital regimens Worse some commonly prescribed drugs  including Compazine and Phenergan for nausea and Reglan to stimulate bowel function after surgery  actually block dopamine and worsen symptoms in patients with Parkinsons Then they are at risk for falls and fractures and for aspiration pneumonia Moreover any infection can lead to delirium because Parkinsons patients have lowered cognitive reserve But the drug Haldol which hospitals frequently use to reduce confusion is also a dopamine blocker Haldol is the worst drug you can give a Parkinsons patient Dr Okun said Over all it can be a real mess  With proper treatment most Parkinsons patients can live long and good lives but stressing them with a fall or an infection or anesthesia can make them fall apart he said turning supposed inandout hospitalizations into weeks of illness and decline Not everyone is as lucky as Roger Anderson What will help in the long run is   and changing the way they function And yet  isnt this a sad commentary  its slow going to effect change in the health care system and in the meantime a lot of people are getting hurt Dr Okun said So unfair as it may be to put the onus on patients and families the foundation is offering   that includes a bracelet identifying the wearer as a Parkinsons patient and fact sheets and reminder slips to hand out to doctors and nurses We want to arm people Dr Okun said The Andersons have used the kit for subsequent hospitalizations and found it useful And Mrs Anderson reports that now years after their threemonth nightmare hospitals actually encourage her to bring along her husbands medications and to administer the pills herself as his schedule demands You might argue that the hospital is magnanimously allowing her to do the job its staff is supposed to do but shes fine with that It beats the alternative
