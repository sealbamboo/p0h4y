Weve all heard that eating fish is good for us Regularly eating fish has been linked to a host of health benefits  for our   our   and our   Now heres some more good news A study published Monday in the   suggests that eating oily fish once or twice a week could maybe  just maybe  add a few years to your life Oily fish like salmon trout and herring are of course a good source of omega fatty acids which are essential to numerous bodily functions Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Washington wanted to know how eating fish high in omegas affected health So over the course of  years they monitored a group of almost  healthy adults aged  years or older But unlike most studies that have looked at the question the researchers didnt want to rely on study subjects to accurately recall what they ate so they measured blood levels of omegas instead And since they were interested in dietary intake only they excluded participants who took fish oil supplements After controlling for factors like age sex and lifestyle the researchers found that on average adults with the highest blood levels of omega fatty acids lived  years longer In particular these adults had a  percent lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease  which is in line with other studies that have tied omegas to cardiovascular benefits Higher levels of fatty acids were most strongly associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke Omega fatty acids are very unique in that at very small levels in the diet they have pretty powerful effects on a range of body functions says Dr   lead author of the study According to Mozaffarian the main reason why omegas are important is because of their role in building cell membranes Our cell membranes are  percent fat he explains If we didnt have fatty acids we wouldnt have cells Omegas can stabilize the function of heart cells says Mozaffarian They can also alter the way that cells interact with each other and even affect gene function Because the study was not a randomized trial the findings dont actually prove that higher levels of omegas are responsible for the observed health benefits There still could be  some mysterious factor that is unknown Mozaffarian acknowledges Nevertheless Mozaffarian recommends that people especially those over  make an effort to include fish in their diets You get the most bang for your buck by eating one to two servings of fatty fish per week he says However consuming more than two servings of fish per week doesnt appear to increase blood levels of omegas much further This means that as long as you eat fish regularly its probably unnecessary to take additional fish oil supplements says Mozaffarian
