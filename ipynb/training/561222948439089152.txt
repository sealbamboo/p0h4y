Senior church figures have called on the UK government to block the creation of babies from three people The Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales said it was not clear the technique  adding a donor womans mitochondria to another womans egg  was safe or ethical But a group of scientists has urged MPs to approve the procedure  intended to stop deadly mitochondrial diseases Ministers want to allow the technique and MPs will debate it on Tuesday Mitochondria are   within the body and their most crucial role is to convert energy locked in food into energy the cell can use  About one in every  babies is born with mitochondrial disease which can be fatal Mitochondria are passed to a child from the mother and the proposed technique involves adding healthy mitochondria from a donor woman to an egg from another then fertilising it with one mans sperm The Reverend Brendan McCarthy Church of England adviser on medical ethics said We need to be absolutely clear that the techniques that will be used will be safe and we need to be absolutely sure that they will work He also said the ethics of the issue should be properly discussed before a decision was made adding Whats the rush Sharon Bernardi who lost all of her seven children to mitochondrial disease said the proposed technique was not about changing the colour of a childs eyes or hair This is trying to make children survive she said Were not playing God or anything She said her first baby died within  hours of birth and she lost five other children while they were babies  and her son Edward at the age of  I would ask them the Church of England desperately to please look at the bigger picture and look at the children who have been affected by this dreadful disease she said No child should be born with a disease thats going to cut their life short I cant believe anybody from the Church would want that The Right Reverend John Sherrington a Roman Catholic bishop   about the proposal No other country has allowed this procedure and the international scientific community is not convinced that the procedure is safe and effective he said There are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process But in a    scientists from  countries said the technique offered some affected families the opportunity to have healthy children They said the UK had run an exemplary and internationally admired process to consider the issue since  and they called on Parliament to approve the proposed change The UK hosts a world class team at Newcastle University developing this technology which is ideally placed to be among the first to treat patients they added The House of Commons debate on Tuesday is on a   to the the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act  to enable mitochondrial donation This idea has raised ethical questions since it was first proposed  years ago Doctors say it could prevent repeats of Sharon Bernardis experiences But critics say it introduces a permanent change to DNA that would be passed through the generations raises concerns about the use of embryos and opens the door to designer babies  Those are the issues MPs will be debating on Tuesday  Three reviews by the fertility regulator suggest the technique is safe but nobody can be certain until it is finally tried in people  When I spoke to the head of the mitochondrial research centre in Newcastle he said he was anxious ahead of the vote  But if the technique is approved then scientists expect the first attempt before the end of the year  Two separate techniques are being devised but they both share the same common principle  take the DNA from the parents and combine it with healthy mitochondria from a female donor Asked about the Church of Englands comments  first    Prof Jeremy Farrar director of the Wellcome Trust said the Church had a right to interject But he said he was surprised it had done so at this late stage He said there had been a series of scientific ethical and public consultations adding This process has been going on for seven years or more Prof Farrar said scientists cannot be sure the technique is  safe until it is used on humans but that jump always had to be made with new techniques I dont think theres been any more rigorous look at any scientific endeavour coming into humans he added
