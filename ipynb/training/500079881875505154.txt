A charity says a decision by the NHS in England to reject a drug for men with prostate cancer is a fiasco  Abiraterone is already given to patients at the endoflife after chemotherapy as it gives patients an extra few months But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said it was not costeffective to offer it earlier It said while the drug improved quality of life it was unclear whether it had the same impact on life expectancy This was due to problems with the research data NICE said claiming the trial was finished early  something disputed by the drugs makers Janssen Instead patients will have to rely on their doctors applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund a special pot set aside for cancer drugs not routinely available on the NHS Some  patients have done this in the last year but that fund is due to end in  Owen Sharp chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK the largest mens health charity said the whole process was a fiasco He criticised NICEs inflexibility and the drug companys resultsgathering process saying This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer   For many this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating sideeffects which come with it    The decision comes just a week after    again leaving the Cancer Drugs Fund as the only option for patients The drug normally costs  a month but is given to the NHS for a discounted price after negotiations two years ago when the ruling on its use after chemotherapy was reached At the time it was hailed as a real breakthrough for patients with aggressive prostate cancer NICE chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said he was disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use before chemotherapy He told BBC Radio s Today programme that pharmaceutical firms had to balance their desire to make a profit with the reality that the NHS had to meet all its needs If we dont put in place arrangements to require drug companies to look critically at what they are asking the NHS to pay it will simply be a question of offering the keys to the safe and we cant do that Sir Andrew said As well as the dispute about the way the research was conducted this ruling has caused controversy because of the way NICE carried out the assessment When it assessed the drug for use after chemotherapy in  NICE adopted its endoflife criteria which means it is willing to pay more For the latest assessment it was judged to be a standard treatment The final guidance is expected later in the year but major changes at this stage are considered unlikely  While it will apply to England the other UK nations also consider NICEs findings Janssen medical director Dr Peter Barnes said the firm was very disappointed and would appeal against the decision
