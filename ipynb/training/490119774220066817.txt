
 I love my summer stirfry weeks The list of ingredients sometimes looks daunting but think of the effort required to put a stirfry together as family time Start the rice pour yourself a glass of wine put others to work measuring and chopping and visit while you prep Once your mise en place is ready have the others set the table while you make the stirfry in under  minutes You barely heat up the kitchen  I was after Thai flavors in some of the stirfries I made this week because I had a beautiful bunch of Thai basil from the farmers market To this end I decided to cook a mix of sweet vegetables corn tomatoes squash in coconut oil which Ive never used for a stirfry The oil was perfect adding a  rich but light coconut flavor I will definitely use it again I also used radishes and their greens in one recipe I always feel silly throwing away those beautiful greens They resemble turnip greens  slightly bitter  so I seasoned the dish with a sweet and sour sauce Its now one of my favorite stirfries and I know what I will do from now on when I have a bunch of radishes that arent going to make it into a salad lingering in the refrigerator   This is another Thaiinfluenced dish spiced with sriracha and featuring the beautiful green vegetable amaranth  This crunchy colorful stirfry has an added kick from serrano chiles  Coconut oil gives this dish fragrance without heaviness  Turkey cutlets are easy to prep and cook quickly and young snap peas can be almost as tender as the more traditional snow peas for stirfries  The bitterness of radish greens pairs wells with a sweetandsour sauce in this stirfry
