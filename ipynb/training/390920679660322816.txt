The majority of Americans are misinformed about the causes and frequency of miscarriages a national survey shows Most of those surveyed said they thought miscarriage was rare and believed that stressful events or chronic stress were the major causes These false beliefs often lead to feelings of guilt or blame in parents who experience a miscarriage according to the researchers  Miscarriage is a traditionally taboo subject that is rarely discussed publicly  even though nearly  million occur in the US each year making it the most common complication of pregnancy study researcher Dr S Zev Williams an OBGYN at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York said in a statement Williams and his colleagues surveyed  men and women in the United States about their personal experiences and beliefs about miscarriage the causes and  and their emotional impact on people who experience them  About  percent of those surveyed said they thought miscarriage was rare when in fact it occurs in one out of four pregnancies the researchers said However  percent reported that the emotional impact is severe and potentially equivalent to losing a child which is a reality for many people who experience one  Chromosomal abnormalities are in fact the most common   accounting for  to  percent But among the survey respondents  percent listed a stressful event as a common cause  percent cited longstanding stress and  percent cited lifting a heavy object Fortyone percent said they believed miscarriages may be due to sexually transmitted diseases  percent cited previous abortions and  percent cited implanted longterm forms of birth control  Nearly a quarter of those surveyed falsely believed that a mother not wanting the pregnancy could result in a miscarriage  Results of the survey were presented Oct  at the meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ASRM in Boston  Doctors can identify  using karyotyping a technique for identifying abnormal numbers of chromosomes But traditional karyotyping must be performed at the time of the miscarriage  By contrast a new technique called rescue karyotyping also described at the ASRM meeting offers a way of finding abnormalities some time afterward by testing tissue saved after a miscarriage  In a recent study rescue karyotyping that was used on  percent of archived tissue samples revealed important information about the cause of miscarriage  Through this technique we hope to get a better understanding for why miscarriage occurs in some women Williams said in the statement
