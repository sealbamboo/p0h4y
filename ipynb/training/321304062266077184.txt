A new   in the journal   says scientists have been seriously underestimating the amount of dengue around the globe The study says there could be as many as  million dengue infections worldwide each year making it more prevalent than malaria This is four times higher than the current dengue prevalence estimate of the World Health Organization One reason for the huge increase in estimated infections is that dengue has been spreading far and wide Its usually described as an infectious tropical disease but lately its been popping up even outside the tropics Thereve been major outbreaks in Portugal and Russia and   in the US Prior to  the mosquitoborne disease had only been reported in nine tropical countries according to the WHO Now its endemic in more than  nations  an entomologist at the University of California Davis says its continuing to spread Not only are the number of cases increasing the geographic range is increasing says Scott a coauthor of the   study So dengue is spreading in to areas where it was not previously but we are also seeing more and more cases Previous efforts to count dengue cases were missing huge numbers of infections  mainly the less severe ones which might not lead to hospitalization or medical attention the authors write Dengue appears to be attracted to overcrowded slums in the burgeoning cities of the developing world Scott says the new report shows that poverty is a significant risk factor for dengue taking hold in a new environment People living in substandard conditions where theyre storing water and they dont have proper disposal of waste are more at risk he says Rainwater accumulates in containers and the mosquito that transmits this virus   then lays its eggs in those places Not only is dengue making more and more people sick in some of the poorest countries in the world its straining alreadyfragile health care systems You get these explosive epidemics Scott says With large numbers of people getting infected in short periods of times it really overwhelms the public health infrastructure With so many infections that were previously unaccounted for theres far more virus circulating in the environment This could mean that containing dengue or at least stopping its current rampant growth is going to be difficult But many scientists are working on it NPRs Geoff Brumfiel reported on efforts in England to develop   to wipe out the virus And in Australia scientists are   in the hope that theyll be too sick to bite
