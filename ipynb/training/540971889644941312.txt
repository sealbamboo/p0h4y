Remember when Cheerios and GrapeNuts went GMOfree That was about a year ago when their corporate creators   that these products would no longer contain ingredients made from genetically modified organisms like common types of corn soybeans or sugar beets When they actually arrived on supermarket shelves though there was a mysterious change in their list of ingredients Four vitamins that previously had been added to GrapeNuts  vitamins A D B and B also known as riboflavin  were gone Riboflavin vanished from Cheerios  a professor of crop science at the University of Georgia and defender of GMOs was among the first to point out the change He   General Mills and Post Foods for marketing their nonGMO cereals as especially wholesome The new version of Cheerios is certainly less nutritious he told a reporter for Foodnavigatorusacom which covers the food industry This minicontroversy never got much attention Recently though as we   who are using genetically altered yeast and bacteria to make nutrients and flavors we recalled the strange case of the vanishing vitamins We wondered Do GMO microbes make vitamins too Is that why they cant be used in nonGMO cereals The companies directly involved werent terribly helpful Post Foods the maker of GrapeNuts informed us in a prepared statement that vitamins were removed because they did not meet nonGMO standards but refused to explain why this was so Two of the worlds major vitamin makers   and   declined to provide details of their manufacturing There is very little nonproprietary information I could talk to you about a spokesman for DSM wrote in an email We dug further and discovered that vitamins may fail the nonGMO test for a variety of reasons Some companies are most likely making vitamin B and riboflavin using genetically modified microbes they have at least   scientific papers showing how this can be done On the other hand these vitamins dont   come from GMO microbes There are strains of bacteria that produce these vitamins naturally Yet even such microbes may not qualify for nonGMO status because theres another hurdle Vitaminmakers have to show that their microbes consumed feed  glucose for instance  that came from nonGMO sources Theres a further complication Some vitamins have to be mixed with other substances such as cornstarch to handle them easily Cant prove that the cornstarch was free of genetic modification Sorry no nonGMO certification from the   an independent organization Bethany Davis director of regulatory affairs at   which sells nutritional supplements says that for all those reasons vitamins get very tight scrutiny before they can be certified as nonGMO It is still possible to find nonGMO vitamins she says Increasingly you can get them from China But it requires additional time and attention Big cereal manufacturers like General Mills or Post Foods Davis says may find it easier just to drop vitamins from the recipe Extracting vitamins from ordinary foods like carrots is possible but its generally much more expensive That leaves one method of vitamin production thats cheap industrialscale and reliably nonGMO synthetic chemistry Vitamins are commonly manufactured from scratch in chemical factories using ingredients that cannot be linked to any genes or biological process at all That technology may not inspire great affection but it does at least qualify as nonGMO
