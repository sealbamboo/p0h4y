 Prostate cancer is typically treated with hormone therapy over a period of  months but according to preliminary new research treating patients for half the time works just as well Researchers at Sherbrooke University Hospital Center in Quebec found that   for  months live just as long as those treated longer  a finding that could revolutionize prostate cancer treatment Their research which they will present at the   in Orlando Fla on Thursday has not yet been peerreviewed so it comes with some caveats Hormone therapy for   acts similarly to castration as it stops the body from producing the tumorfeeding hormone testosterone However the treatment comes with a host of   which means shortening treatment time could save men months of misery Shorterterm hormone therapy could have a big impact on the lives of men with prostate cancer reducing the quantity and intensity of its unpleasant side effects as well as treatment costs Abdenour Nabid MD study author and associate professor at Sherbrooke University Hospital Center said in a statement For the benefit of the patients we hope these results will convince doctors that they can stop hormone therapy after one and a half years instead of two to three years While patients would still have to deal with unpleasant side effects during treatment an month treatment plan could shorten the ordeal and help men avoid some of the longterm side effects that come with prostate cancer treatment says Bruce Roth MD a medical oncologist at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis What were concerned about are the longterm impacts of hormonal therapy  osteoporosis diabetes and cardiovascular events says Dr Roth who was not involved in the research Also the longer youre on hormonal therapy the less chance the testosterone will bounce back If the patient is cured but has to go through  years of testosterone deprivation you may be doing more harm than good They looked at  men with localized highrisk prostate cancer and administered  months of treatment to  patients and  months of treatment to  They then followed the patients for an average of six and a half years and found that the difference in survival rate was not statistically significant   percent of the men who received  months of treatment were still alive compared to  percent of men who received  months of treatment The death rate was similar after  years as well according to the study In addition there was no significant difference in   or cancer spread between the two treatment groups However its still important to be cautious Roth says Because the study has not yet undergone peer review its too early to change treatment protocol I could imagine that the results could be true Roth says but you dont want to make a new standard out of a single trial
