The Justice Department sued a neurosurgeon and the operators of a network of doctor-owned implant distributorships, alleging they defrauded Medicare of millions of dollars with unnecessary spinal surgeries.. The neurosurgeon, Dr. Aria Sabit, and the distributorship network, Reliance Medical Systems LLC, were the subject of a 2013 Page One article in The Wall Street Journal detailing that Dr. Sabit profited from implants he used in dozens of surgeries at a California hospital, some with tragic outcomes.
