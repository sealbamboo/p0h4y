The approval is limited to women over the age of   Developed by Roche Molecular Systems Inc the   can be used to see if a woman needs additional screening for cervical cancer and to gather information about her future risk  The Pap test  the standard for  years  is designed to look for abnormal squamous cells that could indicate cervical cancer while the HPV test looks for DNA from the virus A vaginal swab is required for both the Pap test and the HPV DNA test so you wont notice a difference at the doctors office  The potential benefit of the HPV test is that everybody that has a precancerous change or cervical cancer will have a positive test said Dr Kevin Ault professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City  Youre not going to miss anybody There are other HPV tests out there but this one can detect the most problematic strains  HPV  and  The test can also detect DNA from  other types of HPV that are associated with an increased cancer risk HPV causes more than  of all cervical cancers The problem with any HPV test is that a lot of women  between  and   will test positive for the virus Ault said And most women who get HPV dont develop cervical cancer  HPV is so common that at least  of people who are sexually active will get a genital HPV infection at some point in their lives    Most people who get HPV only have it for a few months or a year and then it goes away Ault said Its really the people it persists in that are going to the problem But how do we know who with HPV will likely develop cervical cancer Positive results on the HPV test will necessitate further screening he said Patients who test positive may have to have a Pap smear as well and potentially biopsies and other procedures The disadvantage is a lot of people are going to be scared he said  If this new test is adopted as the primary screening method Ault said doctors can focus their Pap examinations on women who are already known to have HPV In most cases patients who dont have HPV are less likely to need a Pap which is why the advisory committee felt it best to recommend the Roche test be administered as the first form of detection womens health experts say If both the Pap smear and the HPV test are negative that would mean the patient essentially has almost no chance of developing cervical cancer in the next five years Ault said  Every year  women are diagnosed in the US with cervical cancer This is especially tragic because cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease and it is well established that HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers worldwide Women need better access to screening tools that include primary HPV screening in order to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer said Dr Thomas Wright Jr an expert in gynecology and pathology at Columbia University Medical Center Many gynecologists are used to doing routine Pap tests so the HPV test may take a little while to replace the traditional pap smear Ault said  But Thursdays approval of the test does not change current practice guidelines  Cervical cancer screening guidelines are usually proposed through organizations such as the American Cancer Society or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The FDAs role is in approval of the test itself
