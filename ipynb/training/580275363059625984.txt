ur young British public are growing up fast Whether its watching my threeyearold niece manoeuvring her way through an iPad better than I can or listening to teenagers putting the world to rights theres no doubt that the youth of today are living in a fastpaced world and are hungry to experience it In terms of the internet sex seems to be on a different playing field with the advent of information sharing porn and social media adding a whole new layer to the world of teenage sex and relationships With this change comes real alarm that we are not providing sufficient guidance for our young people at a vulnerable time of their development My own recollections of sex education circa  are hazy the school nurse waving a strip of condoms in front of a room of giggling yearold girls and then three years later a switchedon adviser from Brook coming to speak sadly when the majority of girls there were having sex already Otherwise it was a reliance on friends older sisters parents or the indispensable More magazine for the problem page and gawking over position of the fortnight Young people these days however have no problems accessing information about sex And its unfair to say that sex education in the classroom hasnt improved since my teens The recent   demonstrated that sex education in schools if done properly has a significant and positive effect on young peoples sexual decision making health and wellbeing But what it also identifies along with a number of other recent studies is that were not doing it enough and were not doing it right  The Office for National Statistics reports that   compared with some of our European counterparts Sexually transmitted infection rates remain significant Young peoples perceptions of relationships and what constitutes consent are worryingly skewed and high proportions of young lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people experience bullying prejudice and a lack of education with severe consequences  In the absence of satisfactory direction of real concern is the information children are independently turning to in its place Easy access to porn and the hypersexualised use of social media at this crucial stage of development has created a false sense of sexual normality for young people This is at a huge cost to their wellbeing and personal growth My feeling of frustration and sadness when encountering a young person in clinic whos never heard of PEPhepatitis B vaccinations or a girl in distress as shes been told anal sex is what everyones doing is becoming a distressingly common occurrence and something that must be addressed Pressure is now on the government to make some well measured decisions regarding the wellbeing of our teens The education select committee has just released its recommendations to make sex education  posed to be renamed relationships and sex education  to be mandatory in schools The rename is to highlight a muchneeded focus on consent young peoples rights sexual wellbeing and education about samesex relationships What the committee has also highlighted is the need for adequately trained people to deliver this specialist teaching However financial cuts have meant the loss of many of these trained individuals at a huge detriment to our young population The   that enables teachers to confidently and appropriately deliver sex education had funding withdrawn in  And with the  handover of commissioning sexual health services to local authorities subsequent cash cuts to sexual health and contraceptive clinics is reducing the potential for clinicians to provide guidance for other professionals educational outreach and focused young peoples services For now decisions regarding the future of sex education are eagerly awaited and people committed to this cause continue their work in educating and empowering these adolescents In the UK we are fortunate to live in a society that prides itself on both education and freedom of sexual choice The focus now is on maintaining these rights for our younger population and arming them with the knowledge they need to tackle what lies ahead Life as a teenager is complicated enough so lets not sell them short
