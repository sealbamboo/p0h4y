Office visits are the bread and butter of many physicians practices Medicare pays for more than  million of them a year often to deal with routine problems like colds or high blood pressure Most require relatively modest amounts of a doctors time or medical knowhow Not so for Michigan obstetriciangynecologist   He charged for the most complex  and expensive  office visits for virtually every one of his  Medicare patients in  his billings show In fact Medicare paid Agomuoh for an average of eight such visits per patient that year a staggering number compared with his peers Doctors and other health providers nationwide charged the top rate in  for just  percent of office visits for patients they had seen before But Agomuoh was one of more than  health professionals nationwide who billed Medicare for the most expensive type of office visits at least  percent of the time that year a ProPublica analysis of newly released Medicare data found  who runs a Florida urgent care center charged the program at that level for all  visits by his established patients   an Oceanside Calif internist facing disciplinary charges from his state medical board collected the highest rate to see almost all of his  Medicare patients an average of seven times each By exposing such massive variations in how doctors bill the nations health program for seniors and the disabled experts said ProPublicas analysis shows Medicare couldand shouldbe doing far more to use its own data to sniff out costinflating errors and fraud I think this is a smoking gun said Dr Robert Berenson a former senior Medicare official who is now a fellow at the Urban Institute a Washington DC think tank Whos asleep at the switch here The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which runs Medicare declined an interview request and said in a statement that it could not comment on ProPublicas analysis because it had not seen it The agency declined to discuss individual providers but said their data may not take into account money collected by a provider and subsequently returned to CMS or payments that may have been withheld after claims were already processed but prior to release to the provider CMS is working to ensure that physicians and health care providers appropriately bill for office visits also known as evaluation and management services the agency said American Medical Association President Dr Ardis Dee Hoven cautioned that billing data can be misleading without considering further details about doctors practices Even those who handle medical billing professionally sometimes disagree about the right way to classify a visit Agomuoh Im and Farhoomand insist that they treat older sicker or more difficult patients than their peers Agomuoh also suggested that the Medicare data contained errors the agency stands behind it Individually office visits for established patients cost taxpayers little ranging from an average of  for the simplest cases to more than  for the most extensive But collectively they add up Medicare shelled out more than  billion for them in  In April Medicare released data showing  payments for outpatient services and for the first time specified how much money went to individual health providers The data allows consumers to look at which procedures doctors are performing and how frequently and how their billings compare with those of their peers ProPublica has created a tool called   that allows people to do just that Doctors or their staffs determine how to bill for routine office visits for established patients those the provider has seen at least once before based on a variety of factors including the thoroughness of the review of a patients medical history the comprehensiveness of the physical exam and the complexity of medical decisionmaking involved The AMAs coding system gives them five options An uncomplicated visit typically of short duration should be coded a  a visit that involves more intense examination and often consumes more time should be coded a  The most common code for visits is in the middle a  ProPublica focused its analysis on the  physicians and other providers who charged for at least  office visits for established patients Medicare did not release data on services that a provider performed on fewer than  patients We found that while most providers had a tiny percentage of level  cases more than  billed exclusively at the highest level Another  did it more than  percent of the time About  health professionals billed only at levels  or  I cant see a situation where every visit would be a level  especially on an established patient said Cyndee Weston executive director of the American Medical Billing Association a trade group I was trying to talk myself into it but I just cant see it A   from the US Department of Health and Human Services inspector general found that doctors are choosing higher codes more often for evaluation and management services the broad category that includes office visits Agomuoh the Michigan OBGYN stood out for reasons beyond his office visits Medicare paid for an average of eight wheezing evaluations for each of his patients in  at  a pop Almost all of his patients received multiple ultrasounds of arteries in the legs at  per test and arms at  per test records show Most of his peers rarely if ever performed these services Agomuoh said his billings reflect that many of his patients have asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and drug addictions
