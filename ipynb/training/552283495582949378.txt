Lets get a couple of things straight first about estrogen the socalled female hormone First it influences a lot more than just whats going on down there its produced by the brain of course and brain scientists are increasingly studying estrogen as a neuromodulator a chemical with powerful effects on the brain as well as the reproductive system Second its not just females who have estrogen need it and suffer with its loss Males do too as a recent study involving the humble songbird makes clear A group of studies presented in San Diego this week at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience suggest that estrogen is indeed powerful It may buffer women of childbearing age from the toxic effects of stress on her baby as well as herself one study found Shoring up declining estrogen levels in middleaged women seems to prevent decline in cognitive skills  including remembering things when under stress  two other studies suggest And in male as well as female songbirds and neuroscientists would have us believe in humans too estrogen levels in the brain spike at the sound of sociallymeaningful things  say the cry of a baby In male songbirds estrogen in the brain rises at such cues as well At such moments estrogen causes neurons in the brains sensory cortex to fire faster At the health sciences campus of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles  postmenopausal women were asked to submerge their hands in icy water for three minutes Twenty minutes later the women were put through a dizzying test of working memory and multitasking skill remembering lists of words while also reading sentences and judging whether they were grammatically correct or not For almost five years the women had been taking either estrogen replacement therapy or a placebo The study authors knew that the hippocampus  a key node in the brains memory circuit  is highly sensitive to estrogen and that stress routinely causes memory impairments They wondered whether the women who had gotten hormone replacement would weather the doublewhammy of icy waters and shortterm memory challenge better than those who had not The women with the highest levels of estrogen in their blood not only remembered more words and judged the grammar of sentences more accurately they responded with less stress than those with lower levels of estrogen as measured by their levels of the stress hormone cortisol At Vanderbilt School of Medicine Dr Paul Newhouse and his colleagues investigated a more roundabout way of increasing estrogens cognitiveÂ  effects in women after menopause with the breast cancer drug tamoxifen Although tamoxifen blocks estrogens action in the breast  thus preventing recurrence in women whove been treated for breast cancer  the drug is believed to increase estrogens clout in the brain In all  participants took tamoxifen for three months and a placebo for another three months At the end of each trial period the women were presented with a different kind of mental challenge undergoing tests of mental skills while taking one of two drugs that mimics the chemical effects on the brain of aging including difficulty in forming memories the motionsickness drug scopolamine and an early drug for high blood pressure mecamylamine For the women who took it tamoxifen appeared to buffer the cognitive effects of the two other drugs and they performed better in tests of attention verbal memory and spatial navigation And its benefits were greatest for women who were found in genetic assays to have a genetic variation that put them at higher risk for developing Alzheimers disease
