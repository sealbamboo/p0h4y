According to the   there are about  species of mosquitoes Some feed on plant nectar some on reptiles some on birds and others on mammals Of the species that do bite humans it is only the females that go for blood  the protein aids in egg production The Aedes vexans species which is  does feed on humans making it seem that all mosquitoes are out to get you For this species if youre a mammal youre on the menu said Joseph M Conlon a retired US Navy entomologist and a technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association  Random fact The mosquito featured in Jurassic Park wouldnt have bitten humans or dinosaurs Conlon said it is the only species that doesnt feed on blood  You may have heard that eating certain foods  such as bananas beer and garlic  can attract or repel mosquitoes But Conlon said Nothing that you eat affects mosquitoes all that much   You can rest assured that wearing dark clothes probably wont draw mosquitoes to you either And Conlon said   on mosquitoes attraction to Type O blood was later refuted due to bad statistics Harry Savage chief research entomologist at the CDC said carbon dioxide and heat are the biggest draws for mosquitoes Scent can also play a role Ingredients in your sweat and other skin secretions which are often genetically determined can make one person more attractive to a mosquito than another Both experts agree that size matters when it comes to being bitten  Evidence suggests mosquitoes tend to prefer men over women adults over children and larger people over smaller ones Conlon said the larger figures likely produce more heat more carbon dioxide and have more body mass to bite  If you think that being pregnant makes you a mosquito magnet you arent alone A   published in  supported the belief that mosquitoes prefer pregnant women  But the study included only  pregnant women and  nonpregnant women and used mosquitoes native to Gambia a small country in Africa Conlon and Savage said the study might be valid but not for the obvious reason Pregnant women give off more heat and carbon dioxide which our experts said are attractive to mosquitoes Getting hot and sweaty and breathing heavily after a workout could potentially make you just as much of a target as a momtobe Citronella is a weak repellent  the oil You have to crush the leaves Conlon said So that citronella plant on sale at the store Its not your best bet for preventing bites  Citronella candles arent going to help much either A breeze or change of wind direction can blow away any protection To me citronella only protects the candle Savage said Conlon said there is no known effective area repellent The best option is an Environmental Protection Agencyregistered repellent for use on the body such as products that contain the ingredient DEET The EPA has an   for finding products that meet its standards Conlon also cautions against natural products claiming to repel mosquitoes There really isnt any evolutionary pressure to produce a natural repellent for humans We are just another protein source on this planet No matter where you go in the US there are good vectors mosquitoes that transmit disease Savage said  The Asian tiger mosquito common in the Eastern and Central states is a particular species to watch It arrived in the United States from Asia in the s and the species is a   carrier of dengue fever yellow fever chikungunya dog heartworm and West Nile Savage said this mosquito can be found in Ohio and Missouri for example and along the East Coast Malaria is no stranger here either Malaria can flourish in moderate climates Conlon said not just in the tropics As recent as the late th century half the United States was endemic with the disease according to the   Of more recent concern to public health experts is the introduction of atypical or nonnative viruses such as West Nile and chikungunya  More challenges are meeting our shores every day from tourism and travel If we let our guard down chikungunya could take hold here Conlon said The worlds becoming a smaller place and some of nastiest diseases on Earth are only a sixhour plane flight away
