For the roughly  people each year who give up a kidney to someone in need of a transplant in the United States a new study finds that generosity may come at a price a roughly tenfold increased risk of kidney failure in the  years following their donation That increased risk however tells only half the story  and not depending on how you look at things the more important half In the  years after he or she goes under the knife a live kidney donor has a  likelihood of developing endstage kidney disease requiring chronic dialysis or a transplant researchers from Johns Hopkins University have found While that is higher than the  probability he or she would have had as a nondonor the fact is that kidney failure remains a highly improbable outcome The study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn is the first to assess both the absolute risk a kidney donor faces after the operation and the added risk he or she incurs as a result of it It comes at a time when the gap between those needing a kidney transplant and the availability of the organs is vast About  Americans are in line awaiting an available kidney and most will wait at least five years before a kidney from a deceased donor becomes available Living donors  relatives friends and increasingly strangers  are narrowing that gap In   of kidney transplants came from living donors with more than  such procedures performed in over  countries And while donors are told the loss of a kidney cannot be without risk they havent had many hard facts to guide them in their decision Now they do The extra risk theyre taking from donating a kidney was very low said Johns Hopkins University transplant surgeon Dorry L Segev who led researchers in reviewing the records of all  people who donated a kidney for transplantation in the United States between April  and November  Its actually very reassuring he added Crucial to this finding is the fact that kidney donors are not only unusually generous They are also as a group unusually healthy Compared with the US population at large they start with a much smaller risk of going on to develop kidney disease When you take their chance of developing endstage kidney disease and multiply it by  said Segev the result is still a very low number To demonstrate how kidney donors might have fared had they not made their gift the researchers created a comparison group of nondonors from a large national survey of Americans health and nutrition They drew from that database  men and women with health status and habits very similar to those of donors And then they tracked those donors for  years to see how many developed kidney disease that required ongoing dialysis placed a donor on a transplant waiting list or resulted in a transplant Potential donors if they go through the screening process and are deemed appropriate are among the healthiest of people walking the planet said Dr Gabriel Danovitch who heads UCLAs kidney and pancreas transplant program But since many donors are directly related to the transplant patient some may harbor hardtodetect genetic or familial risk factors he said And a fraction of those may go on to develop kidney disease as well Danovitch who was not involved in the current study says he does not believe the new information will put off wouldbe donors When its done right and best practices are followed the risks of donation are balanced  overbalanced if anything  against the benefit the donor gets from seeing the recipient do well and improving his or her own sense of having done well Danovitch said In the roughly  years he has been performing kidney transplants Danovitch said he has rarely seen donors who express regrets  even if they go on to develop kidney disease themselves After thousands and thousands of transplants Danovitch reckoned that he saw perhaps five donors who went on to need transplants The halo effect of being a kidney donor is the gain these patients get for the finite but real  and small  additional risk they take upon themselves he said Now that physicians have hard numbers to offer wouldbe donors they should expect that some at least will see the increased risk they face and waver says Dr Scott D Halpern a transplantation bioethicist at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania People are notoriously bad at weighing an increased risk of an unwanted outcome against a very low probability it will ever happen Halpern said Its a normal bias of human decision making If they are to help prospective donors make the right decisions for themselves said Halpern transplant surgeons will need to give these individuals a short course in absolute and relative risk and cast the new numbers in their proper context That will mean asking wouldbe donors to focus not just how much likelier they are to get sick if they donate but how low that probability was to begin with
