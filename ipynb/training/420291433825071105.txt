One of the hinge points in human history was the   It led to large communities monumental architecture and complex societies It also led to tooth decay When huntergatherers started adding grains and starches to their diet it brought about the age of cavities At least thats   But it turns out that even before agriculture what huntergatherers ate could rot their teeth The evidence comes from a cave in Morocco  the Cave of the Pigeons its called  where ancient people lived and died between  and  years ago These were hunters and gatherers they didnt grow stuff And what was astonishing to scientists whove studied the cave people was the condition of their teeth Basically nearly everybody in the population had caries or tooth decay says   a paleoanthropologist with the Natural History Museum in London Humphrey says  percent of the more than  people from the cave she studied had serious tooth decay I was quite surprised by that says Humphrey I havent seen that extent of caries in other ancient populations Certainly life was brutal and short for Stone Age folks what with saber tooth cats parasites and not an aspirin to be found anywhere But at least the paleo diet  meat tubers berries maybe some primitive vegetables and very few carbs was supposed to be good for the teeth Carbohydrates can turn sugary in your mouth then bacteria turn that into enameleating acid But apparently these ancient people had a thing for acorns Acorns says Humphrey are high in carbohydrates They also have quite a sticky texture So they would have adhered easily to the teeth Yes these people did eat meat And snails apparently whose shells littered the cave But they also ate a lot acorns judging by the debris they left behind Without toothbrushes  without dental floss  that diet rotted their teeth Eventually the tooth crowns wore away says Humphrey They were eating on the polished roots of their teeth I think they would have been in pain Humphrey says this is the earliest case of widespread dental caries ever seen by thousands of years It contradicts the idea that agriculture ushered in tooth decay and that the socalled paleo diet is inherently healthy she says When it came to cuisine she says paleolithic people were simply opportunistic Some elements of the ancient diet were good others were not Theres not one kind of paleo diet Humphrey says I think wherever people lived they had to make best of the wild food resources available to them In this case Humphrey believes ground acorn patties She hasnt tried them herself but she plans to I would like to she says I imagine that they would be something like sweet chestnuts Kind of like the   of the paleolithic The research appears in the
