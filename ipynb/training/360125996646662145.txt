As expected the Food and Drug Administration   an additional three years of protection from generic competition to the makers of the most popular form of the emergency contraceptive pill   The decision is one of the last formal pieces of business as the drug makes its way to retail shelves after   to make it more easily available to women who want to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex The government   to keep the medication agerestricted last month after losing a series of court battles But as with almost everything involving this fight even this last bit of policymaking is well complicated Heres a recap As part of its   the FDA had granted   the maker of Plan B One Step three additional years of exclusivity to sell its product on pharmacy shelves to  and yearolds Everyone would still have had to show ID to obtain it Other generic emergency contraceptives containing the hormone levongestrel there are older twopill versions as well as a generic version of the onepill product were to remain behind the pharmacy counter Then the FDA decided in June to remove all age restrictions from Plan B One Step And that was followed by Wednesdays decision to grant another three years of exclusivity to the products manufacturer this time to sell to all ages Those three year terms however will run concurrently So generic competitors can apply to the FDA to sell to women of all ages without restriction beginning in  But theres a twist in the latest development Because now there will be no prescription version of Plan B One Step any more  it will be fully overthecounter with no age restrictions  its generic counterpart can no longer be prescription either But it also cant be sold to those under age  because of the new protections for the brandname drug granted by the FDA The result is that Plan B OneStep which costs around  will be available on pharmacy and other retail shelves without restriction The generic onepill product which costs about  less may also be available on retail shelves if it gets the FDAs blessing but only to those age  and older Those younger wont be able to purchase it at all And the much cheaper twopill versions will remain behind the pharmacy counter where it will have to be requested and proofofage shown with prescriptions required for those under age  Its a less than perfect result say those who wanted the full array of products make fully available We are disappointed by FDAs most recent decision to maintain age restrictions on generic brands of emergency contraception which will leave more affordable alternatives of safe and simple emergency contraceptive products out of reach for many women says Jessica Arons president and CEO of the   a group that advocated for the switch to overthecounter status for the products This decision is not supported by the evidence to the Administration will only lead to more confusion on the part of consumers and pharmacies and will unnecessarily continue to feed the false assertion by some that emergency contraception is unsafe or risky
