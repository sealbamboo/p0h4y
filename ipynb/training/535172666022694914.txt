For the first time since the FDA began a voucher program several years ago to encourage development of drugs to treat neglected tropical diseases, a drug maker has sold a voucher to another company. And the deal may now help the pharmaceutical industry ballpark the value of these vouchers.. Knight Therapeutics says Gilead Sciences agreed to pay $125 million for a voucher that the small Canadian drug maker obtained from the FDA last March. The program has generated interest, because a drug maker that develops a treatment for a qualifying tropical disease receives a voucher for an FDA priority review for another medicine, which means the agency would be obligated to review the medicine in six months, instead of the standard 10 months.
