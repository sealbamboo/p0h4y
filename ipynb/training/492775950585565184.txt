While testing whether a   could keep you from getting drunk we discovered that its pretty entertaining  and revealing  to track your blood alcohol while drinking Using a device to test bloodalcohol levels we watched the alcohol in our bodies soar as we drank two beers on empty stomachs And we noticed theres a place on the curve  about  or  BAC  when the buzz is the sweetest The   movement has turned monitoring steps sleep and other activities with technology into a selfimprovement pastime Could the next frontier be alcohol consumption It turns out that the industry that makes bloodalcohol testing devices has been trying to turn us into quantified drinkers for years And new products on the market are making monitoring even easier by linking it to your smartphone One company BACtrack has just released a key chain alcohol test about the size of a lighter for  BACtrack claims its newest product the   will be a game changer for people who want to drink more responsibly Technology like this which can help people find out if theyre around or over  BAC the limit for driving might even help make a dent in drunk driving rates and the   every year the companys president and CEO   tells us Previously there was a stigma with alcohol testing and weve been fighting that stigma says Nothacker who started the company in  as a college senior and is now based in San Francisco We want people to talk about their BAC and not be embarrassed The BACtrack app that goes with the Vio takes a reading of your BAC after you blow into the device But it also allows you to text your friends your BAC So someone can say I am two drinks in Im not meeting you there heres my BAC  Nothacker says Other companies have also begun marketing smartphone bloodalcohol tests to quantified self enthusiasts  any any drinker who wants to be better informed For example theres the   a device that plugs into the audio jack of the smartphone and connects with an app Its also about  Nothacker might be right that more testing devices in the hands of consumers  rather than just law enforcement  could help bring down consumption of alcohol But the reading you get will be at best a ballpark figure of your actual BAC None of the smartphone devices are as precise or accurate as what the police will use to test your BAC if they pull you over under suspicion of intoxication According to Nothacker those devices can compensate for more variables such as altitude But one interesting feature of both the Vio and the Breathometer tells you how long it will take to reach  BAC from wherever you are over  So if youre drinking late youll see that you wont sober up until the next day in a lot of cases Nothacker says But these companies are clear in their marketing materials about one thing Dont use this tool to decide whether you should operate a motor vehicle or equipment And its never safe to drink any amount of alcohol and drive partly because theres a huge variation in how alcohol impairs individuals even at very low BAC So if these devices cant help you decide definitively if youre too drunk to drive why would you use it One public health researcher whos familiar with the technology says he thinks these new tools could help people make better decisions The key chain Breathalyzer allows people to find out how much theyve had to drink objectively And they can get a pretty good sense of whether its a good idea to drive   an associate professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington tells The Salt In study after study we see that just objectively tracking your use of a substance will reduce your use And while a super accurate bloodalcohol test is essential if youre using it to decide whether to send someone to jail knowing your BAC is  versus  is less important for a personal tool says McDonell If the outcome is to help a person stop using or reduce their use of alcohol accuracy is less important he says And those expensive devices are never going to get out there to everybody McDonell is planning to use the Vio in a study of incentivebased alcohol addiction treatment Hell give patients the device Theyll measure their BAC and then send it to him through the app If they blow a  they get a reward of some kind It should allow us to deliver alcohol treatment in peoples home without having them come into the clinic And thats big because we know most people dont come in he says The clinic is often too far or too timeconsuming or they fear the stigma of being there he says Our anecdotal playtime with the Vio certainly made us more aware of the degree of our intoxication Soon we were able to more accurately guess our BAC which the Vio asks you to do before every measurement We also became more aware of just how much the amount of food in your stomach influences the rate at which you absorb alcohol  the more food you eat and the slower you drink while eating the slower your BAC will rise That rate though differs person to person Check out   from our yeast experiment The variation between three people of about the same age and weight is pretty significant But these tools are far from perfect It turns out that its a bit awkward to operate both bloodalcohol testing device and a smartphone app in a noisy bar with drunk people around you And if youre lending the tool to a friend whos never used it before it can be hard to tell if hes blowing hard enough into the device  the likely cause of several faulty readings of  one of our friends got with the Vio The Vio is also a bit fussy We got a lot of error messages And the company recommends you use it at least once a month to keep it moist and in working order The texting feature is also a bit clunky and theres some mixed messages with the marketing of the device If BACtrack is trying to discourage people from going overboard with alcohol why encourage them to post pictures of their drunk selves on the Internet through the app And while BACtrack says to wait at least  minutes after eating drinking or smoking before blowing into the device that can be inconvenient if youre already intoxicated and need a quick reading And Nothacker notes it can take up to an hour for alcohol to be absorbed so your BAC could continue to rise for  minutes after a reading All in all though a key chain bloodalcohol reader is a handy tool to have around And we can easily imagine a future where people sign their texts and emails with their BAC This email was composed at BAC  Maybe we should even try that here at The Salt Over and out with a BAC of
