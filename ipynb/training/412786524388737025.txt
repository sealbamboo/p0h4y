About  of yearold girls are terrified about putting on weight the first UK study looking for warning signs of eating disorders suggests Doctors said they were worried by the high degree of weight fixation found in yearold girls years before eating disorders typically start Researchers say it might be possible to stop full eating disorders developing Their findings in the Journal of Adolescent Health came from interviews with the parents of  yearolds Eating disorders such as anorexia tend to start in the midteenage years although they can begin before then The study by University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked at the years before those disorders tend to start Interviews with the parents of  yearold schoolchildren showed One of the researchers Dr Nadia Micali told the BBC she was surprised children were so concerned about weight at such a young age For me the results were particularly worrying I wouldnt have thought theyd be so common at this age Part of me thinks its a shame we didnt ask earlier we dont know when this behaviour starts  Quite a large proportion will develop fullblown eating disorders maybe more than half However she said there might be an opportunity to help children before they develop an eating disorder if a reliable set of warning signs could be developed for parents and teachers In a statement the eating disorder charity Beat said it was an interesting and important study This is the first time a study like this has been carried out so we have nothing to compare it to and therefore dont know if the problem is increasing or getting worse  However it is striking and worrying how many young people had concerns about their weight from such a young age  It does not mean that they will all go on to develop eating disorders but they could be tempted by unhealthy ways to control their weight and shape The findings came through data collected from the   A separate analysis of those children by a team at the University of Warwick suggested bullying was linked to an increased risk of psychotic experiences such as hearing voices and paranoia Lead researcher Prof Dieter Wolke said We want to eradicate the myth that bullying at a young age could be viewed as a harmless rite of passage that everyone goes through  it casts a long shadow over a persons life and can have serious consequences for mental health It strengthens on the evidence base that reducing bullying in childhood could substantially reduce mental health problems  The benefit to society would be huge but of course the greatest benefit would be to the individual
