The menus of millennia past can be tough to crack especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables For archaeologists studying a prehistoric site in Sudan dental plaque provided a hint When you eat you get this kind of film of dental plaque over your teeth says Karen Hardy   with the Catalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona If you dont clean it off it mixes up with bits of food and it gets stuck in this area below the gum she says It can calcify within about two weeks and once its calcified its very hard That plaque is so hard that it lasts thousands of years And since prehistoric folk were not known for their flossing habits the plaque that survived them can serve as a kind of scrapbook for what they ate and breathed Hardy and her colleagues were studying skeletons from Al Khiday in Central Sudan a   that was used between around  and  years ago since before the advent of farming in the area Using a few isotope and chemical analysis techniques Hardy says they found all sorts of different things in the teeth of  individuals things like sand dirt pollen plant fibers  even evidence of carbon from breathing smoke from a fire Most surprisingly in seven of the  individuals they found cracked starch granules evidence that people were roasting and eating a plant called   or   It looks like grass but has a network of roots like little potatoes Tastes a lot like dirt says Ted Webster a weed scientist with the US Department of Agriculture He wrote his PhD on nutsedges and as part of his defense he had to eat one raw He doesnt recommend it But for a huntergatherer it was probably great a starchy pack of energy that grew everywhere And it contains   an amino acid we need to survive As Hardy and her colleagues   in the journal   even when farming developed in the area  years later people were still munching on nutsedge But at some point the root it lost its charm By the s botanists branded purple nutsedge as the worlds worst weed in a book of the same name They listed it as being a problem in  countries and  different crops says Webster The only way to get rid of the plant is to uproot it by hand But a weed is just a plant growing in the wrong place Hardy says it wasnt just the prehistoric Sudanese who valued it Ancient Egyptians used it to make perfume It was a staple for some Aboriginal populations And it may even have prevented tooth decay Turns out the nutsedge produces antibacterial chemicals that inhibit   an acidproducing bacterium that breaks down tooth enamel and   Thats why this study was very exciting Hardy says We identified a plant that had been forgotten about but has all these wonderful qualities In one group of skeletons Hardys group found fewer cavities than would have been expected for the time period There is a potential possibility that it might be linked to the consumption of   but we cant be sure of that says Hardy They can be sure that people were munching on purple nutsedge for millennia It might have provided snacks for civilizations plodding along the route to development At the very least it helped them avoid totally horrible teeth
