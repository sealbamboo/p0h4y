Dr Howard Murad whose El Segundobased company makes his eponymous skincare products has become a vocal proponent of painting drawing and sculpting for overall wellbeing Murad  was inspired in  when retinal surgery forced him to spend a month looking downward He began to paint and believes that he healed faster as a result Since then he incorporates art into his philosophy for skin and general health alongside a diet that is rich in water and whole foods targeted supplements rest and exercise I always feel that if you put on a happy face youre going to look a lot more beautiful There is an emotional component to your appearance If there is some creative outlet you will sleep better be more vibrant smile more These are all attributes that cost nothing and have more benefit than expensive treatments When I see a patient I like to look at the whole picture to understand why his or her skin is doing something It is never just one problem Our skin turns over once a month so there is always a chance for renewal I talk a lot about cellular hydration  making sure the body and skin are nourished with plenty of water and foods rich in water Then I advise my patients to give themselves permission to be creative in whatever form they choose At our retreats yes Weve done them in Palm Springs and New York and will be doing more We have an art therapy class giving everyone paper and crayons and paints and teaching them they dont have to be perfect I just tell them to throw paint onto a canvas and see what happens We have a traditional program at our Inclusive Health Spa treatments massages facials everything to improve the appearance But in the consultation we talk about ways people can express themselves creatively that will help their overall wellbeing and send them home with a plan to do that There is more and more art therapy around in hospitals and clinics and research shows that it does help the healing process even for serious illnesses It encourages people to see outside themselves to have a different perspective It allows light to enter Theres a joy that happens Doing art can reconnect us to our childhood young children and toddlers know they dont have to be perfect They forgive easily They have no problem with selfexpression with getting dirty and muddy That only happens later when we are taught to conform I tell my patients Even if you think those two colors dont go together do it anyway The most important thing we need to learn is that its OK to not color inside the lines
