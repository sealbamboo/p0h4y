If youre having trouble picturing a health datapalooza think plus data geeks entrepreneurs industry bigwigs and bureaucrats stuffed into hotel conference rooms with lots of coffee and PowerPoints Early this week the fourth annual   conference descended on Washington DC including a contest over the course of the twoday meeting to come up with the best health app on the spot The government was there because it has   of information about costs and quality of health care Techies say health care could be revolutionized if entrepreneurs could take the data and liberate it in Datapaloozaspeak from spreadsheets and databases so it could be poured into apps and computer programs that anybody could use Jonathan Bush CEO of   for one is beside himself with excitement Data scientist may be the sexiest career in the stcentury he exclaimed during his keynote speech on Monday He paced the stage and explained how he sees forces aligning in a way that make data  and the ability to make it useful for decisionmaking  the most important forces in health care Thats in large part because the federal Affordable Care Act is full of financial incentives for groups of doctors hospitals and other providers of care that can prove theyre more efficient higher in quality or cost less than competitors The datas there the technologys there the entrepreneurs are there Bush said in an interview They are watching the cost of health care go up and they are seeing how people feel about the product despite its cost and theyre saying somethings going to pop So that is exciting There is in fact this pregnant moment New companies are already being born like the one yearold Mike Galbo started in January after his grandmother had a bad experience in a rehabilitation hospital Caregivers messed up the medications She was hallucinating for a week he said She was overmedicated and it was a really traumatic experience for my grandfather and my family Galbo is a professional data analyst and recognized that his grandmothers problem boiled down to a lack of good information when it was time to choose where she should go for care after a hospital stay The hospital she was leaving was no help She was given a list of facilities in her area with only phone numbers and addresses to help her choose he said Unfortunately she didnt make the best choice Galbo was frustrated He could use the phone in his pocket to look up reviews of almost any other kind of business and how much it would cost but there was virtually no reliable information on hospitals So despite having no previous experience in the health care business Galbo and a friend launched   a company that takes government data on the quality of health facilities and recent patient reviews and puts it at peoples fingertips Four hospital systems are going to start using it this summer Its exactly the kind of outsider innovation that the federal governments chief technology officer for health   wants to see more of He said too many people in health care are intimidated because they know the system is so complex But if you look at the circle of people out there that can do interesting things with data thats a much much larger circle and so thats really who we want to talk to he said Leaders in the health data field say that if Sivak really wants to draw in more creative entrepreneurs his agency the US Department of Health and Human Services needs to make more of its data on health care prices and quality publicly available In May the government   data on how much hospitals across the country charge for a hundred of the most common health care procedures At Datapalooza this week it released information on  more Industrys reaction was thanks but its only small fraction of what we want and need
