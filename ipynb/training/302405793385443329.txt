 Although a   is considered the gold standard for colon cancer screening a new study finds that many patients are reluctant to have the test Patients are more likely to opt for a simple fecal occult blood test  a brief part of a medical exam  that checks for bleeding which can be a sign of   the researchers said The best test is the one that the patient actually performs said lead researcher Dr John Inadomi a distinguished professor and head of the division of gastroenterology at the University of Washington in Seattle We should not assume that all patients prefer colonoscopy therefore patient preferences should be elicited to determine the test to which they are most likely to adhere he said The main difference between the two tests Inadomi said is that a fecal occult blood test should be done every year while for most people a colonoscopy can be done every  years starting at age  In addition any cancerous or precancerous polyps found during a colonoscopy can be removed during the procedure If a fecal occult blood test proves positive a colonoscopy is the next step The downside of a colonoscopy for many patients is the preparation which involves fasting and using   the day before the procedure Many patients also dont like being sedated and there can be complications particularly a puncture of the intestine cause by the instrument Inadomi said The report was published in the April  issue of the   For the study  men and women were assigned to or given a choice of having a colonoscopy or a fecal occult blood test Within a year  percent of the participants had the selected screening test Only about  percent of those who chose or were assigned to a colonoscopy actually had one however compared with more than  percent of those who were assigned to or chose a fecal occult blood test the researchers found Significant racialethnic differences existed in screening with whites more likely to have a colonoscopy and nonwhites a fecal occult blood test the researchers found Blacks had the lowest rate of colon cancer screening at  percent Asians and Latinos  at about  percent and  percent respectively  had the highest rates the study found We have seen benefit from colon cancer screening with fewer people dying from it said Dr Theodore Levin a gastroenterologist at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek Calif and the author of an accompanying journal editorial If we want to raise our screening rates then we need to offer people choices other than colonoscopy Levin said there are many alternatives to colonoscopy such as a virtual colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and often when people are given too many choices they end up not doing anything People may become confused and more likely to do nothing but if you offered them colonoscopy a test they dont want to do or another test like a fecal occult blood test then they are more likely to be screened he said
