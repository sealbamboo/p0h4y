Lethal Shocking Unacceptable Dysfunctional Failures at every level So said the report into maternity care at Cumbrias Furness General Hospital But as was pointed out repeatedly as the inquiry  on Tuesday the parallels with   are chillingly similar In fact Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt went as far as calling it a second Stafford Hospital  albeit it on a smaller scale In both cases poor care was covered up by a culture of secrecy and intimidation priorities seemed to have been distorted by the pursuit of foundation trust status and the wider NHS missed opportunities to deal with the problems at an earlier stage In both cases it led to unnecessary suffering  and it was left to patients to expose the truth So can we be sure this is not happening elsewhere Its a question that always gets asked when these reports are published  and the sad truth is that there can be no guarantees Dr Bill Kirkup the chair of the Morecambe Bay Inquiry named after the trust which ran the hospital admitted as such He said there could be elements of what he found happening elsewhere when pressed by journalists  There has been several major investigations into Stafford Hospital two of which have been chaired by barrister Sir Robert Francis The inquiries focused on care provided in AE and several wards linked to the unit from  to  They the described the unnecessary suffering of patients who were left to crying out in pain and dehydrated from a lack of water Data showed the number of deaths were between  and  above what would have been expected during the period The reports said there was a culture of bullying and denial where appalling standards were let go as managers pursued targets But the finger of blame was pointed at the whole system including regulators and the regional health authority  Two things make this possible The NHS is such a vast institution  it sees a million patients every  hours  that despite all the regulation and monitoring it is difficult to know what is going on everywhere Standards of care vary greatly across the country But even within hospitals good and bad can exist side by side This is a point Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter has made  He visited Stafford Hospital before the problems came to light and praised the care being provided But he hadnt seen the wards that would later become notorious for their substandard care Afterwards his explanation was that hospitals are a series of microclimates That certainly seems to be the case at Furness General Hospital where the midwives who called themselves the musketeers created a situation where the maternity unit effectively became their fiefdom while managers seemed so motivated by a desire to achieve foundation trust status that they suppressed the information they did have But of course its impossible to keep everything quiet What is perhaps equally shocking to the poor standards is the fact that people outside the hospital did know something was wrong but it was never acted up on Why The report lists in detail a series of missed opportunities by the North West Health Authority Care Quality Commission and Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman to tackle the problems at an earlier stage  This spanned a period when the structure of regulation and monitoring was changing Some of this was part of the constant state of revolution the NHS finds itself in but other changes were being made in light of the Stafford Hospital scandal  Tuesdays independent inquiry chaired by former senior Department of Health official Dr Bill Kirkup looked at maternity care from  to   It said the unit was dysfunctional with extremely poor working relationships between staff Midwives pursued normal childbirth at any cost This lethal mix led to the unnecessary deaths with  babies and one mother dying when different care would have saved their lives But the failures stretched all the way to the headquarters of national bodies with the Care Quality Commission Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and regional health authority missing opportunities With new people coming into post and new processes being introduced intelligence on the problems brewing was not passed on nor acted on particularly in  the year after a cluster of five serious incidents  After this there were another  deaths  six of which would have expected to be prevented Errors such as these  the report lists seven  prompted Dr Kirkup to recommend that before future reorganisations are pursued the cumulative impact of them is properly assessed  The only problem with that is the NHS has just under gone one of its biggest ever reorganisations with the dismantling of regional health authorities and primary care trusts It begs the question in a couple of years could we be in the same position we are now
