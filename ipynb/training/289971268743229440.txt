 In the past soda consumption has been linked to     weight gain and many more ills But in case you need another reason to toss the pop a new clinical trial from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that choosing water over soda can really help with weight loss  even if you havent made other healthy changes to your diet In the study which was funded by Nestle Waters USA researchers split  overweight adults into three groups one that replaced sugary drinks with water one that switched to diet drinks and one that was given weightloss advice and could make changes of their choice After six months participants across the boards lost an average of between  and  pounds But the groups who cut out sugary drinks were more likely to shed at least five percent of their original weight  percent versus  percent in the comparison group When compared to the group who switched to diet soda the water group shaved several points off of their blood sugar and blood pressure levels Researchers werent completely sure why the water group showed improvement upon those two levels though they speculated it was because the water group was better hydrated The lesson If you want to lose weight but arent sure how to get started it could be as easy as quitting soda Replacing just two fullcalorie sodas per day with water can save you up to  calories and perhaps more notably  teaspoons of sugar The American Heart Association recommends consuming only  to  teaspoons of total sugar daily To make the switch easier try experimenting with ways you can   For example try infusing water with fresh fruits or flavorings such as mint or cucumber You can also try swapping sugared soda for brewed green tea  green tea has no calories and has a host of health benefits
