And Then There Were None The title of Agatha Christies  mystery her masterpiece spooled through my mind on a recent visit to the Hebrew Home at Riverdale where my mother died  years ago Out on the patio one man sat in the sunshine with his visiting children and grandchildren On his left forearm was the telltale tattoo of time spent in Auschwitz marking him a survivor of the death camp where one million Jews lost their lives  The string of letters and numbers vivid more than  years later is a ghastly sight no matter how many times youve seen one But each year at an accelerating pace there are fewer survivors left to remind us of the last centurys atrocities The number varies in different accounts but Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr recently told the Senates Special Committee on Aging that  survivors remain in the United States A decade ago at the Hebrew Home there seemed to be hundreds Now there are  among a total of  residents  They are cared for as the deaths they once barely escaped are bearing down again Some have always lived in a fog of fear Others are grateful to be alive to the point of exuberance and still others are guilty to have survived for no reason other than luck None are like the other aged residents here facing death in its expected time They have spent too long already staring into the abyss  Rabbi Simon Hirschhorn himself the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors said that his multigenerational work with these families is the most satisfying and important work he does As a nursing home clergyman he is always guiding parents and their adult children through what is arguably the most difficult transition of their lives Some of the elderly survivors cry inconsolably but wordlessly incapable or unwilling to articulate anything about the past Others often dryeyed incessantly discuss the terrible things they saw and had to do to save their lives And they often flip all but overnight from one way of coping to the other as the end of life approaches Their adult children Rabbi Hirschhorn continued struggle more than others with the guilt of placing a parent in an institutional setting  particularly one that may evoke memories of confinement  Those who wound up in one of the camps with gas chambers the rabbi said are often traumatized by the congregate showers in some nursing homes How could they not be At Auschwitz internees were given shards of soap and towels and told the showers were for the purpose of delousing them Then deadly hydrogen cyanide spewed into the chambers Survivors children grow up from the time they are little with the unconscious wish to make it better to take away the pain said Rabbi Hirschhorn who is also an analyst in private practice Charlotte Dell the head social worker at the Hebrew Home and also the child of Holocaust survivors said I remember from the moment I could understand things that I couldnt understand this Isnt it beyond comprehension that something so atrocious could happen She read everything about the horrors her parents lived through and carried a feeling of inadequacy of not doing enough There has always been for her an overwhelming feeling of responsibility that there is no additional suffering By contrast she said without judgment her sister six years younger does not want to hear to know to talk Its just too painful and thats her way of coping                   Ms Dells late father wouldnt speak of the Holocaust through most of his life by the time he wanted to Alzheimers disease had muddled his ability to open up  Growing up Ms Dells mother bombarded her daughters with information about that time She speaks less of it now Ms Dell said speculating that advanced age and Parkinsons disease have made her too vulnerable too focused on surviving in the most immediate sense of the word  Surviving in the camps and long afterward in the company of others like themselves has been a solitary ordeal She and the rabbi had hoped that support groups for the resident survivors would help them be present for one another Instead the groups degenerated into a nasty competition Suffering at Auschwitz trumped suffering at Dachau Tattoos became perverse status symbols Recently the rabbi looked west from the patio where the sky was turning pink  All of these people will have to be said goodbye to and soon he said Then we have to shift from witness to memory
