Whats the big fuss about Guinea worm a parasite that now infects just a few hundred people Well the public health community finally has the nasty bugs back against the wall There were only  cases of Guinea worm worldwide last year the Carter Center   this week Thats  percent less than in  And its a mere blip compared to the  million cases back in  It means the Guinea worm hunters are very close to totally wiping out the disease from the face of the Earth Thats happened only once before when small pox   in   is the only other disease close to eradication with only  cases in  Most of us arent familiar with   but its a little akin to a reallife  event from the movie   The Guinea worm larva like to hangout in fresh drinking water When someone accidentally swallows one it matures and eventually makes its way to the surface of the skin and creates a blister Overtime a to feet worm emerges from the wound usually on the leg or foot The whole process is extremely painful and debilitating It keeps people from going to work and kids from attending school The Carter Center a nonprofit organization started by President Jimmy Carter and his wife in  has been leading the efforts to stamp out Guinea worm for almost  years Theyve wiped out the parasite in  countries and only four countries are left South Sudan Chad Mali and Ethiopia Some  percent of the cases in  occurred in South Sudan so the focus of campaign is there Though there were only  infections in Mali last year itll also remain an obstacle to eradication because of the   there Our people cant get in and our volunteers cant be trained President Carter   at a Google Hangout Ernesto RuizTiben who heads up the Carter Centers   tells Shots that their work in Mali came to a standstill back in April Where the rebel groups are those are where Guinea worm exists he says Now theres an open conflict and the security is much worse and dire for people going to do public health So its just not going happen One case of Guinea worm in a village can turn into  or  cases the following year without prevention President Carter said at the Hangout Theres no cure or vaccine for it so the campaign depends on grassroots efforts to teach people how to avoid the worm by   their drinking water and to keep it out of water sources when infections do occur This strategy has kept the cost of eradication low RuizTaben says especially compared to the cost of stopping polio Weve probably spent about  million so far he says The polio campaign has cost many many millions more Theres no comparison between the cost of the two campaigns
