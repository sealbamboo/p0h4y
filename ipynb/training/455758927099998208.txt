In July  the National Institutes of Health   defining it as a body mass index of  or greater for adults The cutoff had been  for men and  for women so suddenly about  million Americans who had been considered normal became overweight even though they hadnt gained an ounce The change based on a review of hundreds of studies that matched BMI levels with health risks in large groups of people brought the country in line with definitions used by the World Health Organization and other health agencies But it also   of BMI and to note its potential drawbacks labeling some healthy people as overweight or obese who are not overly fat and failing to distinguish between dangerous and innocuous distributions of body fat More recent studies have indicated that many people with BMI levels at the low end of normal   And some people who are overly fat according to their BMI are just as healthy as those considered to be of normal weight as discussed in a new book The Obesity Paradox by Dr Carl J Lavie a cardiologist in New Orleans and Kristin Loberg Unlike readings on a scale BMI is based on a persons weight in relation to his height   by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared or for those not metricsavvy weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared and the result multiplied by  According to current criteria those with a BMI below  are underweight those between  and  are normal those between  to  are overweight and those  and higher are obese The obese are further divided into three grades Grade  in which BMI is  to  Grade   to  Grade   and higher Before you contemplate a crash diet because your BMI classifies you as overweight consider what the index really represents and what is now known about its relationship to health and longevity The index was devised in the s from measurements in men by a Belgian statistician interested in human growth More than a century later it was adopted by insurers and some researchers studying the distribution of   in the general population Though never meant to be an individual assessment only a way to talk about weight in large populations BMI gradually was adopted as an easy and inexpensive way for doctors to assess weight in their patients At best though BMI is a crude measure that actually misses more than half of people with excess body fat Geoffrey Kabat an epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine   Someone with a normal BMI can still be overly fat internally and prone to obesityrelated ills Calling BMI an imperfect predictor of a persons health risks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions doctors against using it as a diagnostic tool For one thing body weight is made up of muscle bone and water as well as body fat BMI alone is at best an imprecise measure of how fat a person may be When Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr Universe his BMI was well in the obese range yet he was hardly fat Another problem the distribution of excess body fat makes a big difference to health Those with lots of abdominal fat which is metabolically active are prone to developing insulin resistance elevated blood       premature cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of   and   But fat carried in the hips buttocks or thighs is relatively inert while it may be cosmetically undesirable it is not linked to chronic disease or early death Furthermore a persons age gender and ethnicity influence the relationship between BMI body fat and health risk Among children a high BMI is a good indicator of excess fat and a propensity to remain overly fat into adulthood But for an elderly person or someone with a chronic disease a BMI in the range of overweight or obesity may even be protective Sometimes  after a heart attack or major surgery for example  extra body fat   An added layer of fat can also   On average women have a higher percentage of body fat in relation to total weight than do men but this does not necessarily raise their health risks And AfricanAmericans who tend have heavier bones and weigh more than Caucasians face a lower risk to health even with a BMI in the overweight range Physical fitness too influences the effects of BMI   last year Dr Steven B Heymsfield and Dr William T Cefalu of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La noted that cardiorespiratory fitness is an independent predictor of mortality at any level of fatness While experts continue to debate whether a person can be fit and fat Keri Gans a dietitian in New York and former spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics points out that   and a healthy diet tend to offset the risks of being overweight You dont need to be thin to be fit she said At any weight fitness can reduce the risk of developing heart disease lung disease diabetes or high blood pressure At the other end of the weight spectrum people with a lownormal or belownormal BMI less than  face a different set of health risks They may lack sufficient reserves to survive a serious health problem and they are prone to   infertility and serious infections resulting from a weakened immune system Last year a widely publicized metaanalysis covering more than  million people and  deaths found that those whose BMI indicated they were overweight and those with Grade  obesity   And a   by researchers in Australia concluded that for older people being overweight did not increase mortality but the risk rose for those at the lower end of normal with a BMI of less than  
Although BMI is a reasonable measure of fatness for the average sedentary person there are several potentially more accurate methods But doctors rarely use them because they are more timeconsuming and thus more costly and some require equipment rarely found in medical offices The simplest is a tape measure around the waist and hips Divide the waist measurement by the hip measurement a result above  for men or  for women indicates abdominal   and an elevated health risk Almost as simple is a skinfold caliper used to measure fat beneath the skin It updates the old pinch at the waist more than an inch between the fingers and youre too fat A more sophisticated measurement called bioelectric impedance analysis uses a special scale that measures resistance to the flow of an electric current to estimate fatfree body mass and body fat percentage Its accuracy depends on how much water you retain in your body The socalled gold standard of body fat measurement   takes about half an hour costs up to  and involves being weighed while submerged in a tank of water Finally a   like that used to measure bone density improves on the accuracy of water weighing It divides the body into fat and fatfree tissue and can analyze the distribution of body fat
