Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden has said his organization will soon be implementing new health screening procedures at US airports Its part of an ongoing effort to control the spread of Ebola Well be strengthening our screening procedures both at the source and at entry Frieden said at a news conference yesterday His comments echoed calls for steppedup screening by President Obama and Texas Gov Rick Perry What will these screenings entail And will they make Americans safer Its difficult to say because the CDC hasnt released many details yet Larry Gostin a professor of global health law at Georgetown University says the new requirements will likely mirror procedures already used in some West African airports travel history looking for signs for illness and a temperature reading When it comes to the likelihood of these interventions benefiting public health Gostin is skeptical Fever screening can be unobtrusive but lets not have the false impression that this is a triedandtrue method and its going to keep Ebola out of the United States he says Its just not the case In fact theres little evidence that fever screenings for arriving passengers do much to prevent the spread of Ebola or other diseases Consider the case of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan who traveled to the US from Liberia and is now in critical condition in a Dallas hospital He would not have been detected either in Africa or the US because he was not exhibiting any signs of the virus Or consider the case of   The countrys airports screened more than  million incoming passengers for the airborne virus and found  with elevated temperatures They held those travelers for additional testing but no one turned out to have SARS Singapore and Canada saw similar results millions of passengers screened and few if any SARS cases detected Meanwhile thousands of people saw their travel plans disrupted and in some cases were quarantined for a week or longer Plus Gostin says many people know how to game the system During the SARS outbreak Gostin was on a flight to Beijing when the airline flight attendants began handing out Tylenol to firstclass passengers They were encouraged to take the medicine to be sure they passed fever screenings And he worries that false positives could divert money and manpower away from actual Ebola cases Just the other day at Newark airport someone came in with vertigo He claims that highlevel officials spent hours dealing with that one false alarm Its kind of not what you want Given this lack of evidence why are new entry screenings being implemented Gostin says it might have to do with an ageold tradition The public gets scared and demands that the government protect them And governments even if they know better will sometimes reply to that political outcry Gostin says Theyre under a lot of pressure to do something to make the public feel reassured even if it really doesnt make them safer
