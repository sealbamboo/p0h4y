A merged NHS and socialcare budget in England is needed to stop vulnerable people falling into the gaps between the two services experts say The Barker Commissions interim report said an ageing population and rise in illnesses such as dementia had blurred the lines between the two It said this was creating increasing friction between the NHS and councils over which was responsible for care The result was people faced delays getting care or went without it added The commission  led by former Bank of England monetary policy committee member Kate Barker and set up by the Kings Fund think tank  said only a new settlement would solve the problems The two systems were created after World War Two The NHS was set up to offer a universal system free at the point of need funded from a ringfenced budget Whereas councils were given responsibility for social care which includes care homes and domiciliary care such as help in the home washing and dressing as well as the support given to younger adults with disabilities  They only provide this to the least welloff and those with the greatest needs But the commission pointed out that in recent years the funding squeeze had meant the numbers getting publicly funded social care had dropped by a quarter between  and  Ms Barker said a pooled budget would create a single seamless health and care system The current systems rub up against each other like bones in an open fracture This is not sustainable  we need a new settlement fit for the st Century she added But the report did not commit to how this could be funded who would be in charge of the budget or how you align a meanstested system with one that is free at the point of need  These issues will be addressed in the final report which is likely to be published in September However the interim document did make a number of suggestions including providing free social care at the extreme end  in cases such as advanced dementia or endoflife care Another option would be to introduce a cap on NHS costs to mirror what the government is doing for social care from  Merging the two budgets is something that has been discussed by Labour but is yet to become formal party policy Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said integration was the right approach But she added It cant happen until the social care funding gap is filled and politicians in every party need to recognise this and commit to action as an urgent priority Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said the government was already trying to encourage a more joinedup approach  Next year a bn integration fund will be created  mainly from taking money from the NHS  to encourage councils and health services to work together He said this would help people to live independently getting them out of hospital more quickly and preventing them from getting ill in the first place
