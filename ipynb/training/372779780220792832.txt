For athletes few sounds are more ominous than the percussive pop that can signal a ruptured knee ligament Tears to the anterior cruciate ligament sideline more athletes for longer periods of time than almost any other acute injury Seasons even careers end when the ACL tears Until recently however researchers couldnt explain why torn ACLs were so difficult to treat But studies recently completed at Boston Childrens Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital in Providence help to elucidate why the ACL almost alone among ligaments doesnt heal itself The findings also shed light on how that situation could potentially be changed and blown knees more easily repaired  The particular problem with the ACL  which runs diagonally through the knee helping to maintain joint stability  is that it is a tiny tissue asked to handle intolerable loads when an athletes knee violently twists and torques during contact sports or tumbling falls The American ski racer Lindsey Vonn tore her ACL during a competition last winter and is still rehabilitating her knee in preparation for the  Winter Olympics  The more puzzling aspect of the ACL though is that it doesnt get better Other ligaments in the knee including the medial collateral ligament which is often torn along with the ACL reknit after an injury But the ACL does not and so past attempts at what doctors call primary repair or fixing the torn ligament by stitching it back together have generally failed  In the past few decades surgeons have instead replaced torn ACLs with new rejiggered tendons formed from other portions of the persons own leg or from cadaver tissue Known as ACL reconstruction this surgery provides patients with a wellfunctioning knee but not the knee they once had It is also possible to skip surgery and live without an ACL although most athletes opt for reconstruction Earlyonset knee arthritis is common in people with a reconstructed ACL  in part researchers speculate because no matter how carefully the replacement tissue is braided onto the knee bones the joints architecture changes causing slight alterations in gait and balance that may eventually wear away cartilage  So the holy grail of orthopedic sports medicine according to an editorial in this months issue of   has remained finding a way to repair a persons own damaged ACL  First though scientists had to determine why repairs failed which became the driving mission of research by Dr Martha Murray an orthopedic surgeon at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School and her colleagues The team began by studying the knees interior microenvironment and noting that the ACL was constantly awash in synovial fluid which lubricates the knee  They then picked apart the synovial fluid microscopically and found that it contained an enzyme that dissolved blood clots This attribute is desirable you dont generally want blood clumping inside your joints  But blood clots can also speed healing because they provide a bridge between the torn edges of damaged tissue over which new tissue can grow repairing the tear Dr Murray said The knees medial collateral ligament for instance which is not bathed in synovial fluid develops a blood clot after a tear and repairs itself No such clots cling to a torn ACL and it never becomes whole  So Dr Murray and her colleagues set out to make a blood clot that could be made to stick to the torn ligament They found that by dripping blood onto a tiny sponge they could build a clot that when covered by a natural collagen matrix was shielded from synovial fluid Sutured to both ends of a torn ACL this matrix could provide the scaffold needed to allow healing  So far the procedure has been successful in animal studies with Yucatn miniature pigs In the newest study from Dr Murrays lab published this month in   a group of these animals had their ACLs surgically cut and then either left unrepaired reconstructed with other tissue or repaired with the bloodclot scaffolding After  months the equivalent Dr Murray says of at least five years for people the knees of the pigs with repaired ACLs were healthier than those of the animals whose ligaments had been untreated and as stable as those of the pigs with reconstructed ligaments  More important the animals that had received the bloodclot scaffolding showed less cartilage damage and incipient arthritis in their knees than did the joints of the pigs that had undergone reconstruction surgery Of course pigs are not people They are fourlegged for one thing and not very reliable about following rehabilitation schedules Their ACLs had also been neatly slit not torn and frayed as often happens in human injuries  It is also important to note that experiments in people using similar scaffolds to repair torn rotator cuffs  which like ACLs do not heal on their own  have produced mixed results Still Dr Murray is optimistic that this procedure could one day allow injured athletes and others to retain their natural knee ligament and heal more rapidly and with less risk of later knee problems than is currently possible As a surgeon she said I go into the clinic and see  kids every day whove torn their ACL They all want to return to sports and full activity she said and I want to be able to offer them something better than we have now  She hopes to be able to begin a human trial next year
