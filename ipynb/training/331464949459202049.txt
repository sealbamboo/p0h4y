The patient who made Dr Eleni Linos wonder about the way we treat small nonthreatening skin cancers in the elderly was  years old He was truly suffering recalled Dr Linos a dermatologist at the University of California San Francisco He had undergone multiple surgeries to remove these basal cell and squamous cell cancers even though these kinds of skin cancers are usually asymptomatic The vast majority are small Dr Linos explained They generally grow very slowly They dont metastasize They dont affect mortality or quality of life The deadlier skin cancer is melanoma In fact even though one in five Americans  most of them older adults  will be diagnosed with one of these lowrisk skin cancers people often dont notice them But someone had spotted them on this patient probably to his sorrow He had a lot of pain Dr Linos said He had wounds that wouldnt heal on his legs He ended up losing his ear He died at age  of unrelated pneumonia  In the last year of this mans life we put him through so much she said The patient inspired the study that Dr Linos and her colleagues published in JAMA Internal Medicine last week looking at   for these common growths For more than a decade the team tracked all patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers more than  of them seen at the dermatology clinic at the University of California San Francisco and the San Francisco VA Medical Center over two years A subgroup of  patients was characterized as having limited life expectancy either because they were over age  thus statistically likely to die within five years or because they had three or more very serious chronic diseases like congestive heart failure metastatic cancer or endstage liver disease a combination that also predicts death within five years Dermatologists treat these skin cancers in three ways They may perform one of two types of outpatient surgery under local anesthesia Socalled simple excision takes about an hour with a few stitches afterward Mohs surgery takes much longer because the surgeon keeps removing tissue analyzing it under a microscope then removing more This takes anywhere from three to eight hours Many patients are there all day Dr Linos said It also costs twice as much as simple excision which may help explain a  percent increase in Mohs operations among Medicare recipients over the past  years Its also possible to destroy these small cancers by scraping or freezing them off or applying a topical cream You could also do nothing or do nothing for six months while watching to see what happens But thats not the socalled standard of care and it rarely occurs American medicine is not good at doing nothing Besides for someone active and healthy going through a little skin cancer surgery to get rid of it is something we wouldnt think much about Dr Linos said And since nonmelanoma cancers can eventually grow it makes sense to remove them from patients likely to live long enough to worry about it For those who are sick frail or very old though it makes less sense Not only can even supposedly minor procedures have complications   percent of the limited life expectancy group reported pain numbness itching or healing problems afterward  but the cancers grow so slowly that theyre unlikely to cause problems in the patients remaining years Unless they are bothersome  and nearly threequarters of this group said they werent  why mess with these cancers at all In addition to medical complications old and sick people and their caregivers will also have to deal with multiple medical appointments insurance paperwork and wound care at home At the least you would think that those in the short life span group would get less invasive treatments than other patients But they didnt Seventy percent of those expected to die within five years had surgery fairly evenly distributed between Mohs and excision Twentyfive percent had the cancers destroyed in other ways Only  percent werent treated There were no significant differences between them and the younger healthier group Were treating everyone the same regardless of age or life expectancy or health Dr Linos concluded Were treating tumors not patients This may not come as particularly shocking news given what we know  forgive me for repeating this wellworn New Old Age theme  about overtesting and overtreatment Older Americans undergo       on and on Its unlikely   in the journal pointed out that patients near the end of life were fully informed that a less invasive form of treatment was most appropriate for their condition given that such cancers rarely recur So the responsibility for questioning dermatologists about less aggressive treatment or no treatment falls again to patients and families We might even want to stop calling these small bumps cancers a term that alarms people since they dont behave like other cancers Maybe if we called them abnormal cell clusters we would respond to them more thoughtfully
