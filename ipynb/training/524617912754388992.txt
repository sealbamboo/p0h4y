Maybe its something else Thats what you tell yourself isnt it when an older person begins to lose her memory repeat herself see things that arent there lose her way on streets shes traveled for decades Maybe its not dementia And sometimes thankfully it is indeed some other problem something that mimics the cognitive destruction of Alzheimers disease or another dementia  but unlike them is fixable It probably happens more often than people realize said   a neuroscientist at Duke University Medical Center But he added it doesnt happen nearly as often as family members hope  Several confounding cases have appeared at Duke A woman who appeared to have Alzheimers actually was suffering the effects of alcoholism Another patients symptoms resulted not from dementia but from chronic depression Dr Doraiswamy estimates that when doctors suspect Alzheimers theyre right  to  percent of the time   even in specialized medical centers is more haphazard than you would hope Perhaps another  percent of patients actually have other types of dementia like   or frontotemporal  scarcely happy news but because these diseases have different trajectories and can be exacerbated by the wrong drugs the distinction matters The remaining  to  percent usually have conditions that can be reversed or at least improved Dr Doraiswamy said In trying to tell the difference  not a job for amateurs  one key consideration is age said Dr Ronald C Petersen director of the Mayo Clinics Alzheimers center Dementia is highly agerelated he pointed out In a yearold memory problems might very well have some other cause But the likelihood that a yearolds becoming forgetful over six to  to  months is due to something treatable and fixable is low Dr Petersen said But not zero Which points to another key question speed of onset Dementia tends to develop slowly family members often realize in retrospect that an older person has shown subtle cognitive decline for years When a persons mental state changes suddenly over a few days or weeks however thats not the usual picture of a degenerative disease Dr Petersen said That means looking for something else The list of other causes for dementialike symptoms runs surprisingly long Among the leading culprits Dr Doraiswamy said are depression and anxiety Like dementia they can interfere with the ability to concentrate and remember He looks next for thyroid deficiency Thyroid problems are very prevalent and thyroid has a huge effect on the brain at every age he said Usually this can be relatively easily tested for and relatively easily fixed with daily medication Vitamin deficiencies probably qualify as the most hopedfor scenario Cognitive problems caused by lack of vitamin B thiamine or B are reversible with pills or injections  also causes memory loss If you stop drinking if its not too late the brain can repair itself Dr Doraiswamy said After years of alcoholism you may not be able to repair the damage but you can keep it from getting worse Sleep disorders and in particular   can take a cognitive toll on older people Their cognitive function may become slower with poor attention and concentration Dr Petersen said When patients with apnea use a CPAP machine they come back the next year markedly improved Sleeping pills     and a variety of other drugs especially in combination frequently cause dementialike symptoms too Theres a long list several hundred drugs both prescription and over the counter that can impair memory Dr Doraiswamy said He rattled off a bunch medications for nausea and urinary incontinence older antihistamines like Benadryl cardiac drugs painkillers certain antidepressants and antianxiety medications  yes including   Selectively deprescribing may help clear a patients head Theres more Head injuries that lead to the blot clots called subdural hematomas High blood pressure Diabetes Infections A condition called     that develops during hospitalization Plus older people can have any of these problems along with actual dementia Treating the other causes may at least slow though not stop cognitive decline So it makes sense Dr Petersen said to tell patients and families  many already terrified of dementia  that other causes exist We shouldnt just dismiss them he said We scan the brain do blood tests We look for these other conditions Thats common and not inappropriate On the other hand I want to be realistic he said I do it softly at first but I introduce the notion that we might not find something else Because even though the list of other possibilities is long so are the odds against restoring a patient to normal functioning When it looks like dementia sadly most of the time it is
