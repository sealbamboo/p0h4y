I have no idea who this woman is Gee thought She felt herself slipping into a sort of cognitive abyss Remember our sons went to school together the woman said We did playground duty together Gees mind was dark She began to panic I tried to act like I sort of knew who she was became visibly upset and just left the store she said recalling the scenario years later It was horrible just terrifying That painful interaction was the first sign of Gees early stage Alzheimers disease which genetic tests later confirmed  Her memory lapses mounted Gee would find herself for a few seconds at a time forgetting where she was while driving familiar roads She would walk away from conversations with her husband midsentence She would be reading and unable to relate moments later even a shred of what she had just read The idea of a long painful descent into Alzheimers was too much to bear Gees initial fear after her diagnosis metastasized to hopelessness   I seriously considered suicide she said    affects as many as  million Americans It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and there is no cure  Yet a very small study out of UCLA is offering a glimmer of hope for those with what is often a hopeless diagnosis Nine out of the  patients involved in the study who were in various stages of dementia say their symptoms were reversed after they participated in a rigorous program The program included things like optimizing Vitamin D levels in the blood using DHA supplements to bridge broken connections in the brain optimizing gut health and strategic fasting to normalize insulin levels  A few months after starting the extreme program patients in the study aged  to  noticed their cognition had either improved or returned to normal Only one patient a  yearold female who was in the latestages of dementia when she began the program continued to decline  The results published this fall in the journal Aging support the idea that addressing the many contributing factors of Alzheimers disease as a group rather than one at a time could potentially reverse the diseases early progression said study author Dr Dale Bredesen director of the Mary S Easton Center for Alzheimers Disease Research at UCLA    Those factors include  potential deficiencies imbalances and sources of inflammation Each one of these things contributes a small piece of the puzzle said Bredesen Its like a roof with  holes in it Some people have a big hole in say exercise and maybe a smaller hole in another area  The  patients in the pilot study underwent a battery of tests including having their blood drawn and brains scanned and had neuropsychological evaluations Bredesen said that most of the study participants had between  and  problems that needed correcting   The effect of focusing on so many targets at once runs counter to what Bredesen said is a prevailing  and flawed  notion of identifying single targets to treat a disease caused by many factors  Drug companies tend to come up with a really good patch for one hole said Bredesen founder and CEO of the Buck Institute Its not a surprise they dont work Peter a patient in Bredesens pilot study was  years old and had been struggling with progressive memory loss for  years when he began the program  Around age  the normally bright and unflappable medical professional found he was losing his ability to recognize faces An ability to quickly add up columns of numbers was eluding him He would be midway through a book before it dawned on him that hed already read it  One day I went to my locker at the gym and I could not remember the combination said Peter I stood there worked on it in my mind and couldnt remember Finally I cut that thing off   About a year later Peter had a brain scan that indicated a pattern of damage consistent with Alzheimers disease   I thought Crap Im going to lose my drivers license in two or three years Ill be a burden in five  he said  For years he hid his symptoms as best he could while mentally preparing for his inevitable decline By the time he was introduced to Bredesens program last year he was considering giving up working  The study outlines some of the changes Peter implemented Eliminating simple carbohydrates and processed foods from his diet taking probiotics and coconut oil rigorously exercising and sleeping as close to eight hours as he could He added herbs and a raft of supplements to his diet along with several other changes Between four and six months later he said his acuity with numbers and faces returned And at age  he continues to work  I would say Im in better shape now all the way around than I was a few years ago said Peter I think Im about as good as Ive ever been  But anecdotal studies like this one are far from generalizable and larger studies must be done to prove whether the program will work for more than the scant number of people in this study These study results should be interpreted with a lot of caution primarily because of the small study group  and because the participants had a range of diagnoses resulting in different interventions James Hendrix director of Global Science Initiatives at the Alzheimers Association explained in an email statement Outside of a supervised research setting no one should adopt these specific ideas to try to improve their or a loved ones memory and thinking he said We simply dont know what the effect would be Not long after her memory problems began Gee found out she carries two copies of the APOE allele Simply put this gene hampers her brains ability to heal itself dramatically increasing her risk for developing Alzheimers disease   It was the final straw   Gee threw herself into reading studies gathering information and implementing any lifestyle change that might slow down her disease Later she said she sought help from a wellknown neurologist Dr David Perlmutter who helped her to refine those changes   As it turns out Perlmutters advice in many ways mirrored Bredesens program   Gee began by adding fish oil and other supplements to her daily regimen In several studies people who took the supplements performed better on memory tests and had bigger brains She also started meditating twice daily and sleeping seven to eight hours each night adequate sleep and exercise improve blood flow to the brain and instigate neuron generation Hormone replacement therapy is indicated for women who have a hormonal imbalance that may be affecting brain function so Gee started that too  She fasts for more than  hours between dinner and the next days breakfast making sure there are at least three hours between dinner and bedtime The idea behind fasting said Bredesen is that with the break the body begins a process called autophagy which can help destroy amyloidbeta a problematic protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimers patients   Gee has also cut out processed foods from her diet including sugar grains and other starches since they can stir up inflammation in the brain Her rule of thumb I dont buy any packaged boxed or canned food    A typical dinner for her includes mostly raw organic vegetables drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and wild caught fish Occasionally she replaces the fish with grassfed lean meats She has integrated more fermented foods into her diet  research is beginning to correlate gut health with brain health   Piece by piece I was going down the protocol she said My mental acuity improved the more elements of the program I began doing The overhaul Gee and others did would be dizzying for most people but Gee said it had the converse effect of simplifying her life She said cutting out so much processed and other inflammatory foods is freeing  Within a few months of beginning the protocol she said she experienced a dramatic cognitive turnaround Gee had been testing in the th percentile on an online brain training website before the program Months afterward she was scoring above the th percentile  Before this protocol the notion was you were going to die with this disease said Gee who started a   to provide support and hope for others in the same genetic situation There was a lack of specificity about what to do Now we have this prevention protocol  Hendrix with the Alzheimers Association said one sound element of Bredesens study given the complexity of Alzheimers disease is its focus on addressing multiple risk factors  He cites as an example a twoyear person clinical trial out of Finland the results of which were presented earlier this year at the Alzheimers Association International Conference  Among study participants engaging in nutritional changes physical activity brain training social activities and management of risk factors for heart problems cognitive performance improved Bredesen stresses that identifying the culprit for early Alzheimers symptoms must be based on a patients specific deficits and imbalances He said he will continue testing his protocol on earlystage patients  including members of Gees APOE online group  to find the ideal stage of cognitive decline to introduce this program and how long improvement can be sustained   We are now looking at what is causing illness in order to make a big impact on it said Bredesen who added that many elements of his program could be implemented in asymptomatic people as a prevention strategy  If youre not deteriorating its a good idea to do what our moms told us to do Exercise get sleep keep stress down and dont eat junk food He hopes that normalizing early stage Alzheimers patients cognitively might provide a better platform on which to test future drugbased therapies  One silver bullet drug doesnt work with  holes in the roof said Bredesen The argument is maybe you need to patch some of those holes before trying another drug
