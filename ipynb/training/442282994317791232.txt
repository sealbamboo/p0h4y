For the Affordable Care Act to be considered a success years down the road Ezekiel Emanuel believes that all Americans must have access to health coverage and it must be better quality and lower cost And I think its well within our grasp he says A special adviser to the Obama White House in medical reform Emanuel was instrumental in advising the health care overhaul Hes just published a new book called  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect No but its a pretty good structure to go forward he tells NPRs Scott Simon Lets fix the problems that it has and move onto other improvements we can now recognize It   complex but the health care system is complex And I do think it actually has improved the system  Its gotten a lot of people insurance that didnt have it  people under  on their parents plan Its gotten  million  probably in the end itll be  million people this year  on insurance and its created a structure for getting insurance to everyone Its reduced a lot of infections already its reduced hospital errors reduced readmission so its had an improvement in quality And actually for the last few years costs have been under control Not all of that is the Affordable Care Act but certainly some of it is It has sort of colored peoples view that the government cant do anything right but that wasnt inherent We didnt have to have that kind of mistake You only need to look at a place like Connecticut thats had a very good rollout  similarly in Kentucky California and other states Theres still a lot of room to go And as I like to say this is an ecommerce website its like Amazon except for health insurance and so theres going to need to be constant attention constant management constant efforts to improve it to make sure its using the latest technology giving people the best health care options and choices Health systems are going to begin offering coverage and so youll buy your coverage from the same organization that delivers the care kind of like more Kaisers in this world Similarly health insurance plans are going to begin employing doctors hospitals and organizing them to deliver the best kind of care So I think insurance companies are going to get into providing health care as well as insuring and hospitals are going to begin providing insurance as well as providing the care Youre going to see these what I call integrated delivery systems thats going to be the dominant mode So youre going to buy your insurance from maybe Cleveland Clinic maybe Mayo maybe Johns Hopkins instead of from an insurance company
