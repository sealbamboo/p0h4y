The study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology is an exercise in health economics that seeks to generate a fuller picture of a diseases cost That calculation gives insurers hospital administrators and public health officials a better  and hopefully more humane  basis for deciding which treatments are most costeffective If a treatment for stroke  the costly administration of the clot buster called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA for instance  saves people from dying when properly used as it does thats a plus But if it also reduces disability and allows more stroke patients to return to fuller function than they would have without it thats even better The treatment has not only added years to life it has added life to years and that makes it a better treatment So what on the other side of the ledger does stroke cost The authors of the latest research followed for five years  patientsÂ who had arrived at a hospital in Britain suffering from a first TIA and  patients who were diagnosed as having had a fullon stroke for the first time They found that in the five years after the event patients who suffered their first stroke lost on average  years due to early death and  years due to reduced quality of life If the stroke had never happened the patient would have had in principle five good years the stroke by this measure robbed him or her of  years leaving  good years The severity of the stroke obviously resulted in differences within this broad group Patients judged to have had a mild stroke lost  qualityyears those who suffered a moderate stroke lost  good years severe stroke victims forfeited  good years Patients who suffered their first transient ischemic attack fared better on average They lost an average of  of the next five years to early death the researchers found But the patients assessed that over the five years following their TIA their lost quality of life equaled almost a full good year or  years to be exact The result was that their TIA left them  of the five good years they might otherwise have expected Finally in stroke physicians emphasize that time is brain the quicker you recognize the   and the faster you get to a hospital the more you stand to claim of the five good years ahead Dont drive to the hospital or let someone else take you Call
