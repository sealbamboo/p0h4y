When I was growing up my mom gave me a multivitamin every day as a defense against unnamed dread diseases But it looks like Mom was wasting her money Evidence continues to mount that vitamin supplements dont help most people and can actually cause diseases that people are taking them to prevent like cancer Three studies published Monday add to multivitamins bad rap One review found no benefit in   heart disease or cancer Another found that taking multivitamins did nothing to stave off   with aging A third found that   didnt help people who had had one heart attack avoid another Enough is enough declares an   accompanying the studies in   Stop wasting money on vitamin and mineral supplements But enough is not enough for the American public We spend  billion a year on vitamin supplements and are projected to spend more About  percent of Americans take multivitamins the editorial says Even people who know about all these studies showing no benefit continue to buy multivitamins for their families Like uh me They couldnt hurt right In most cases no But  billion is a lot to spend on a worthless medical treatment So I called up   a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins who has written about Americans love affair with vitamins to find out why were so reluctant to give up the habit I think this is a great example of how our intuition leads us astray Salzberg told Shots It seems reasonable that if a little bit of something is good for you then more should be better for you Its not true Supplementation with extra vitamins or micronutrients doesnt really benefit you if you dont have a deficiency Vitamin deficiencies can kill and that discovery has made for some great medical detective stories Salzberg points to James Lind a Scottish physician who proved in  that citrus juice could cure scurvy which had killed more sailors than all wars combined It was not until much later that scientists discovered that the magic ingredient was vitamin C Lack of vitamin D causes rickets Lack of niacin causes pellagra which was a big problem in the Southern US in the early s Lack of vitamin A causes blindness And lack of folic acid can cause spina bifida a crippling deformity Better nutrition and vitaminfortified foods have made these problems pretty much history Now when public health officials talk about vitamin deficiencies and health theyre talking about specific populations and specific vitamins Young women tend to be low on iodine which is key for brain development in a fetus according to a    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention And MexicanAmerican women and young children are more likely to be iron deficient But even in that group were talking about  percent of the children and  percent of the women Recent studies have shown that too much   and   can cause cancer and its long been known that excess  can cause liver damage coma and death Thats what happened to Arctic explorers when they ate too much polar bear liver which is rich in vitamin A You need a balance Salzberg says But he agrees with the   editorial  enough already The vast majority of people taking multivitamins and other supplemental vitamins dont need them I dont need them so I stopped Im still struggling with the notion that mother didnt know best But maybe when the current bottle of kids chewable vitamins runs out I wont buy more
