As its last official action before leaving for a fiveweek summer break the House today voted  for the th time    of the federal health law But it was something that happened late Thursday night affecting members of Congress and their staffers own health insurance that attracted more attention around the Capitol Back in  when Congress passed the health law Republicans basically dared its Democratic sponsors to require that members of Congress and about  of its staffers   and join the new health exchanges starting in  Democrats took the dare writing it into the law Only they forgot one important piece  which was to specify whether those lawmakers and staff could take with them their employers contributions to that health insurance Right now the   pays about  percent of the cost of workers health insurance the employee pays the other  percent It prompted something of a   on Capitol Hill The question that was on the table said Bradford Fitch of the   a nonpartisan think tank that studies the workings of Congress was whether or not congressional staff in essence were going to have any kind of reasonable health care or whether they were going to have to pay for it all themselves It was more than a minor concern for many members of Congress says Fitch and not just because it might cost them more out of their own pocket Theyve been worried about key staff literally walking out the door We have been hearing from chiefs of staff over the last five or six months and they were expressing concern over the impact of this particular provision on congressional staff Fitch said Many were worried that it might lead to a brain drain especially among senior staff who would be incentivized to retire at the end of the year Thats because if they retired they could keep their federal health benefits Enter President Obama who   earlier this week promised he was personally involved in the effort to resolve the problem And then Thursday night White House officials   that yes next week the Office of Personnel Management would announce that members and staff will be able to keep their government insurance contributions when they buy their coverage on the health exchanges NPR separately confirmed the story Friday Fitch says that while the action may solve one problem it raises others  including the possibility that staffers may end up with unequal benefits For example if youre a senator from Mississippi will you have your Washington staff on the DC exchange and your Mississippi staff on the Mississippi exchange he asked Will that lead to a disparity in health care benefits among employees who are working for the same member of Congress Still House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pronounced herself pleased with the solution at her weekly news conference Its part of staffers compensation here is that they would have health insurance and now they will under the Affordable Care Act through the exchanges she said But not everyone thinks what the administration is doing  or about to do  is within its authority No one so far whos really looked at this sees a legal way for them to do this said Ed Haislmaier Hes a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation and a coauthor of a   arguing that the administration cant fix the problem Only Congress can But theres legal  and theres political Obviously if Congress were to fix their own problem but not somebody elses problem says Haislmaier they would have a huge political blowback Haislmaier says in many ways the problem with the congressional coverage provision mirrors other problems with the health law The argument is well it was badly written he said Well yes but so was a lot of the rest of it as were finding out They say its unworkable the way its written Well yeah were discovering that a lot of the rest of it is unworkable Just to be clear members of Congress and their staff arent getting special treatment when it comes to their health insurance Theyre just keeping the employer contribution every other federal employee gets But they are definitely getting preference when it comes to fixing their own special glitch in the health law
