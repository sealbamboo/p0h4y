Ive been curious for a while now about TRX exercises using the straps that are suspended from above It seems like a good workout for everyone because it uses a persons body weight and gravity to challenge various muscles By adjusting your position you control the resistance for each move And with just two straps it seems simple But Ill add Simple is not necessarily easy  Body Blast TRX class  S Spring St   Serious gym lots of equipment and buff men and women showing lots of muscle Various classes plus nutritional guidance and a wellness spa Music from hiphop to Talking Heads  Big I was drenched by the end of the class and climbing the stairs back to the street from the basement gym was just an early sign that my thighs had been put through their paces  The teacher Jennifer Wyatt made it clear she meant business but everyone worked at their own pace because the exercises were timed so that each person did what she could Wyatt repeatedly stressed that form mattered more than repetitions and she helped me when I couldnt figure out how to get into one of the positions We switched from the straps to kettle bells   unlimited group classes with  monthly membership and other packages available If you have suggestions for classes please let me know by email or Twitter
