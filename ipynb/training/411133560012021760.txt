A landmark study shows a drug can more than halve the development of breast cancer in highrisk women   A trial on  women   showed anastrozole was more effective cheaper and had fewer side effects than current medications It stops the production of the hormone oestrogen which fuels the growth of the majority of breast cancers Doctors and campaigners are asking health services to consider offering the drug to healthy women Some countries already offer the drugs tamoxifen and raloxifene to prevent breast cancer  They both block oestrogen activity however they also increase the risk of cancers of the womb deep vein thrombosis and hot flushes Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole stop oestrogen being produced in the first place and are already used as a treatment for breast cancer The study at Queen Mary University of London has followed women with a high risk of breast cancer based on their family history for an average of five years  It showed that out of  highrisk women given no treatment there were  cases of breast cancer in the study But in the same number of women given anastrozole there were  cases with virtually no sideeffects Lead researcher Prof Jack Cuzick who also pushed for the introduction of tamoxifen told the BBC I think this is an exciting moment breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women and we have a chance to reduce cases He added This class of drugs is more effective than previous drugs such as tamoxifen and crucially it has fewer side effects Prof Cuzick said there was now enough evidence to consider offering the drug Prof Montserrat GarciaClosas from the Institute of Cancer Research in London who led the worlds largest study into the causes of breast cancer told the BBC This is a very significant and very important finding The question now is will it reduce mortality and that will require longer term studies But it adds very important evidence for recommending the drug as an alternative to tamoxifen we now need to identify those women at highest risk who will benefit the most from this treatment Both tamoxifen and anastrozole are cheap as the patents have run out on the drugs For five years of treatment tamoxifen would cost  and anastrozole  However anastrozole cannot prevent the ovaries producing oestrogen so it would work only after the menopause Tamoxifen works both before and after In  the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales said highrisk women over  should be offered tamoxifen or raloxifene The decision affected around  women Cancer Research UK estimates that  of them would be suitable for anastrozole Prof Mark Baker from NICE commented We will certainly consider this research  along with all other available evidence  when the NICE guideline on familial breast cancer is next updated But he cautioned that tamoxifen was recommended for just a relatively small percentage of people so far Dr Caitlin Palframan the head of policy at the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer commented The challenge will be ensuring drugs like these are actually offered on the NHS as many eligible women still dont have access to the riskreducing treatments already recommended in national guidelines  Kate Law the director of clinical research at Cancer Research UK which part funded the study said This landmark study shows that anastrozole could be valuable in helping to prevent breast cancer in women at higherthanaverage risk of disease  We now need accurate tests that will predict which women will most benefit from anastrozole and those who will have the fewest sideeffects
