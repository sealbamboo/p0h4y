The other one whose symptoms began  hours after exposure was admitted to the same hospital officials said Tuesday at a press conference Were just waiting for the results from the testing that was done yesterday to decide about discharge Crespo said  The two health care workers are among  in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient and they are being tested for the virus officials said They were all notified and told to stay home and not work for  days Crespo said They also should monitor their temperatures and check for possible symptoms such as a cough sore throat and fever  Five health team members who may be at risk have been identified at Orlando Regional Medical Center and  at Dr P Phillips Hospital Crespo said  They were all evaluated for signs and symptoms that would be consistent for MERS Samples were sent to the state lab for testing said Dr Ken Michaels medical director for occupational health at Orlando Health Im glad to report that Ive spoken to most of these team members today They all report that theyre doing great Michaels said  On the th day everyone involved will be brought back for further testing Once medically cleared they can return to work officials said Initial testing should be back within the next day or two Michaels said  The confirmed MERS patient visited Orlando Regional Medical Center on May  accompanying another person who was having a medical procedure officials said  I think the risk is negligible to those in the waiting room or the radiology area at Orlando Regional Medical Center said Dr Kevin Sherin of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County The MERS patient was admitted to Dr P Phillips Hospital on May   Before the patient came to the hospital he was not having a cough Crespo said He was not having respiratory symptoms So we believe that that makes less risk of transmission to other potential contacts Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating the MERS case During a White House briefing Tuesday press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS situation in the United States and that the CDC is taking the lead The  was reported this month in Indiana That patient was released from a hospital Friday into home isolation according to state health officials The Indiana patient was an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia and was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia said Dr Anne Schuchat assistant surgeon general with the US Public Health Service and director of the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases She said that he is not a US citizen and that the Florida case is not linked to the Indiana one  The US Transportation Security Administration will post   at more than  US airports to alert travelers about the virus  Although there are no recommendations to change travel plans the signs will advise travelers to the Arabian Peninsula to avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often They should contact a doctor if they develop symptoms such as fever shortness of breath and coughing the CDC said  We think its really critical to avoid overreacting in the community but also avoid underreacting in the health care environment Schuchat told CNN The reason for the signage is so that we can promptly identify potential cases so that they can be separated from other people As of Friday there have been  cases of MERS in  countries including  deaths according to the World Health Organization Schuchat said The virus is also known as MERSCoV since it is a coronavirus the same group of viruses as the common cold It attacks the respiratory system according to the CDC Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS Doctors said they believe the Indiana patients quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better The risk to the general public remains very low Schuchat said In some countries the virus has spread from person to person but only in close contact such as a person who was caring for an ill person This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings she said Out of an abundance of caution the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS Schuchat said No cases of MERS have been diagnosed as a result of transmission on a plane the CDCs Dr Marty Cetron said The yearold Florida patient traveled on May  from Jeddah Saudi Arabia to London then from London to Boston Boston to Atlanta and finally Atlanta to Orlando The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah with symptoms including fever chills and a slight cough Schuchat said Family members of the patient have been tested as well Crespo said  The patient has been doing very well Crespo said The patient had a lowgrade fever of  on Monday night but has a minimal cough and he is in great spirits
