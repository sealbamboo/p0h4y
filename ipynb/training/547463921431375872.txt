Imagine you live on a floating lake house Open air Chirping crickets Clear starry nights Everything seems great until you need to use the bathroom The natural instinct might be to make a deposit in the water But that wouldnt be safe Microbes in your feces would contaminate the water and could cause outbreaks of deadly diseases like cholera A group of engineers in Cambodia wants to solve that problem for the floating villages of   the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia Over a million people live on or around it Exposure to wastewater spawns diarrhea outbreaks each year In Cambodia diarrheal diseases cause  in  deaths of children under age  To help clean the lakes water engineers at the company   in Phnom Penh are developing plantbased purifiers called Handy Pods The pods are essentially little kayaks filled with plants They float under the latrine of a river house and decontaminate the water that flows out Heres how it works When a person uses the latrine the wastewater flows into an expandable bag called a digester A microbial soup of bacteria and fungi inside the digester breaks down the organic sludge into gases such as carbon dioxide ammonia and hydrogen Some microbes in the waste survive that first step but then theyre washed into a pod filled with water hyacinth The hyacinth roots have a large surface area to which the remaining bacteria stick The water that runs off the roots into the lake is clean enough to play and swim in Wetlands Work founder   says But the water is still not safe enough to drink During a pilot project in  Hand and his team gave pods to  houses in a village on Tonle Sap Lake The pods reduced   in the ambient water by  percent Hand says That wasnt as good as the pods performance in lab tests where they cut levels of   by more than  percent Hand thinks thats because real lakes have other sources of contamination besides latrines At the top of that list Pigs Pigsties around Tonle Sap Lake produce a tremendous amount of waste Hand says The floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake are one of the most challenging contexts for sanitation in the world says environmental engineer   of Georgia Tech who isnt involved with the project Handy Pods are potentially a useful way for processing human excrement in this context But the floating toilets still have a ways to go before they are widely distributed For starters Brown says its unknown whether the pods filter out viruses and parasites that cause diseases   remove these pathogens he says so theres a possibility the hyacinth roots could also do it Another roadblock may be cost Each Handy Pod costs about  Most villagers on the lake make less than  each year Hand thinks solving the pig problem is crucial to the overall success of the pods   recently gave Wetlands Work a  grant to adapt Handy Pods for pigsties The company will also use the money to distribute the pods to  more villages Hand isnt stopping there His ultimate goal Total world domination of floating village sanitation he jokes But he does hope that one day the pods could be used for overcrowded floating communities in places like     and
