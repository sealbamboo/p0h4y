Drink enough soda and your teeth could deteriorate so much that they look like the teeth of a methamphetamine or crack addict Thats one of the messages of a   published in a recent issue of   the journal of the Academy of General Dentistry The author   a researcher and professor of dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia insists hes not trying to scare soda drinkers But in two decades of examining patients in dental clinics in Philadelphia and in Appalachia where he worked as a volunteer he says he has observed striking similarities between the lesions on the teeth of crack and methamphetamine addicts and those on the teeth of people addicted to soda  In his paper he describes three cases of severe dental erosion One person had been using methamphetamine for three years a second had used crack cocaine for  years and a third person a woman reported consuming two liters of diet soda daily for the past three to five years All three were adults who lived in cities with fluoridated water and had similar socioeconomic backgrounds All three had lesions on their teeth that had almost identical features Bassiouny writes Appalachia according to Bassiouny is ground zero for soda addiction Some people he treated consumed more than a dozen ounce cans of soda a day he says What I saw in Appalachia really crystallized for me the extreme erosion associated with the acids in the beverage Bassiouny tells The Salt But even people who wouldnt consider themselves soda addicts are at risk of dental erosion he says if they exceed the recommended intake limit of one ounce soda per day And Bassiouny says that its also the cumulative impact of the chemicals in certain beverages that matters Citric acid a preservative that enhances flavor and shelf life in soda is the main culprit It erodes the enamel and eventually the dentin  the core of the tooth As weve reported before energy drinks and citrus juices   a lot of citric acid though beverage companies arent required to disclose exactly how much on drink labels It all contributes to the damaging effect on dentition says Bassiouny And it means that even if you limit your soda intake to one can a day you should avoid other beverages that could contain citric acid The American Beverage Association wont concede that beverages are ruining peoples teeth To single out diet soda consumption as the unique factor in her tooth decay and erosion  and to compare it to that from illicit drug use  is irresponsible the ABA wrote in a   this month in response to Bassiounys study The body of available science does not support that beverages are a unique factor in causing tooth decay or erosion
