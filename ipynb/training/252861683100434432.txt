When theres something really wrong with a published study the journal can retract it much like a carmaker recalling a flawed automobile But are the errors that lead to retractions honest mistakes or something more problematic A newly published analysis finds that more than twothirds of biomedical papers retracted over the past four decades were the result of misconduct not error Thats much higher than previous studies of retractions had found We found something that is very disturbing   the coauthor of   looking into this phenomenon that was published Monday by   tells Shots This kind of stuff has the potential to do damage to science But we need to expose it to clean our own house Casadevall a microbiologist and immunologist and his partners looked at the more than  retracted biomedical research papers since  They found that more than  percent had to be retracted because of fraud suspected fraud duplicate publication or plagiarism Only  percent of the retractions they looked at were the result of error Casadevall says the reason his teams findings differ so much from   is that his team independently verified why each paper had been retracted He says the previous research had relied on retraction notices  explanations published in journals about why studies are being retracted But Casadevall says when you retract a paper most journals allow the authors to write the notice That gives the authors the chance to spin the message For example the authors of a   published in   were found to have falsified and fabricated their data Their retraction notice makes no mention of this only stating that some experiments have not been reproducible That might technically be true but it leaves out the fact that the authors original findings may not have even been producible in the first place Casadevalls team didnt take the authors words for it They brought in information from the federal   as well as from independent media reports Not only did they find that twothirds of retracted articles involved misconduct they found that the more highly influential a journal is the more of its retracted articles involved fraud or suspected fraud Casadevalls team verified some of their retraction notices with help from the blog   created two years ago by health journalists   and   While the economic pressures of conducting biomedical research will always lead some scientists to cut corners Oransky says journals need to force those scientists to own up to their mistakes These unclear opaque notices really distort the scientific literature he says They dont allow for a full picture of whats happening in science The bloggers behind Retraction Watch have seen perhaps as well as anyone how scientists can get things wrong But Oransky says hes optimistic that Casadevalls study will bring about change Its one thing for bloggers to bang on about something and make the same conclusion every week he says But its another for the peerreviewed literature with a carefully done wellconstructed study to do the same thing Its harder to ignore
