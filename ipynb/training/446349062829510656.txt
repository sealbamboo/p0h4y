In a brave new world in which weve all had our whole genomes analyzed and know about our genetic predisposition to certain diseases heres a helpful finding Dont eat a lot of fried food if you happen to carry several of the genetic variations linked to obesity And heres some more good advice Dont eat a lot of fried food even if you carry few or none of the single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs that confer a higher risk of obesity Why Well because people who eat a lot of fried food  especially away from home where fried foods tend to be deepfried  are highly likely to pack on weight a new study finds The same study finds however that people who carry many of the  known obesity SNPs in their DNA  frequently eat fried foods tend to pack on  weight than do the big friedfood consumers with less genetic propensity toward obesity So avoiding fried foods makes good sense really Even in a world in which we have not all had our genomes scanned The new research  Wednesday in the journal BMJ comes from a collection of researchers from Boston University and Harvard Universitys schools of medicine and of public health In October  they   the finding  in the New England Journal of Medicine  that frequent consumption of sugarsweetened beverages results in greater weight gain among those with higher genetic predisposition to obesity than it does among those whose genetic vulnerability is less pronounced The studies findings are not as obvious as they may seem Both aim to explore how genes and behavior interact to drive obesity in large populations And both suggest that while obesogenic behaviors such as eating too much and exercising too little make people fat they have a magnified effect on those whose genes program them to burn calories more efficiently to accumulate and store extra calories as fat and to consume more food when its available That magnifying effect isnt huge But spread across vast populations  all of which are eating more fried foods and drinking more sugarsweetened beverages  it can become very huge indeed and with it come increased rates of Type  diabetes heart attacks and strokes and certain cancers In the more than  men and women of European ancestry who made up the population of the current study those who ate fried foods four or more times a week on average weighed more than did those who indulged least frequently  less often than once a week Frequent consumers of fried foods were also more likely to smoke watched more television drank more sugarsweetened beverages and less alcohol and engaged in less physical activity than lessfrequent consumers of fried foods But the researchers adjusted for those behavioral differences and still saw significant differences But heres the bottom line The BMI difference between light and heavy friedfood consumers was bigger  as much as twice as big  when those consumers were at highest genetic risk for obesity than when they were at low risk On a scale of zero to  a calculation of genetic obesity risk placed all the studys subjects between  and  And among those whose genetic predisposition to obesity was on the low end the difference in body mass index between frequent friedfood consumers and infrequent consumers of fried food was less than half a point Among those with the highest genetic risk of obesity a difference of between  and one full BMI point separated the least frequent friedfood consumers from the most frequent In an editorial two obesity experts from Imperial College London said the findings were unlikely to change the way that physicians counsel patients and treat obesity Thats mainly because having even several of the SNPs that predispose to obesity appears to be far less influential in whether one becomes obese than more obvious factors such as overeating and a sedentary lifestyle But it would be a great shame wrote Alexandra IF Blakemore and Jessica L Buxton to assume that genetics can be ignored in the management of obesity For starters they wrote there are genetic contributors to obesity that are not nearly as subtle as the  SNPs measured in this study and a mutation in just one of those genes called MCR is thought to cause  in  cases of severe child obesity Beyond that wrote Blakemore and Buxton a physician might be guided toward more personalized treatment of an obese patient if armed with the knowledge that the patient carries a heavy genetic vulnerability to the condition As knowledge of genes role in obesity advances some genetic variations may be found to say disrupt the brains appetite control system at the molecular level In such cases a physician might conclude that calling for more selfrestraint or a reversible measure such as lapband surgery are unlikely to work
