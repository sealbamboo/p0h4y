In hospitals people are bathed with soaps containing the antibacterial triclosan to reduce the risk of serious infections in surgery But that doesnt necessarily mean we should be using triclosan soap in the kitchen and the bathroom the Food and Drug Administration says The agency on Monday took a step toward restricting the use of triclosan and other antibacterial chemicals widely used in soap deodorant cosmetics and hundreds of other consumer products The FDA told manufacturers that they would have to prove the chemicals are safe for longterm daily use and that they do a better job of keeping people from getting sick than   with plain soap and water The agency said that so far there is no evidence that antimicrobial soap products keep kids healthier or reduce the spread of colds and flu more than regular soap The only study showing health benefits in consumer products has been with Total toothpaste where triclosan reduced the risk of gingivitis If manufacturers of other products cant come up with evidence of health benefits the FDA   in a proposed rule they would need to reformulate or relabel products to keep them on the market The rule gives manufacturers a year to compile the data The companies will supply those data according to a spokesman for the American Cleaning Institute a trade association We are perplexed that the agency would suggest there is no evidence that antibacterial soaps are beneficial Brian Sansoni   The Associated Press Our industry sent the FDA indepth data in  showing that antibacterial soaps are more effective in killing germs when compared with nonantibacterial soaps Theres some evidence suggesting that widespread use of triclosan which is used in liquid soaps and triclocarban which is used in bar soaps could lead to the development of germs that are   Other studies have found that exposure to these chemicals disrupts hormone cycles in animals But its not known whether they have the same effect in humans This is one of those areas where we dont have complete medical information says   executive vice president at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre NY and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America But there really is very little evidence that this is truly going to make any difference with hygiene Glatt told Shots Given the theoretical risks and little proof of benefit Glatt says it makes sense to skip the antibacterial soap We dont know the risks and we dont really know the benefits I dont think that its rocket science You make a commonsense decision You do the least harm The FDAs proposed rulemaking doesnt affect the use of these chemicals in hospitals where they are used in higher concentrations In the operating room you want things more sterile than in your office Glatt notes The question of whether triclosan should be in consumer products has been asked almost since the introduction of the products back in the s The FDA issued a draft back in  but didnt issue a proposed rule until Monday In  Food and Water Watch and other environmental groups   the FDA to ban triclosan in consumer products Theyre moving a lot more slowly than were asking for but at least theyre doing something Patti Lovera the groups assistant director told Shots Monday Earlier this year the governor of the state of Minnesota signed an   phasing out the use of products with triclosan by state agencies The Environmental Protection Agency which regulates the use of triclosan as a pesticide last reviewed the safety of triclosan in  It   it is starting another review of the issue
