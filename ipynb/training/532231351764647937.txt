 As chief executive my role is to provide leadership and strategic direction to the charity Freedom from Torture supporting people who are survivors of torture and campaigning to stop torture  It is in my genes I had a wonderful role model in my mother who was a nurse and social worker in Glasgow  I want to see more collaboration and less competition and mental health services given the same priority and resources as physical health  I had the privilege of working for Marie Curie Cancer Care for  years and I am proud of the part I played in doubling the number of people able to achieve their wish to die at home  not having enough money and resource to meet the needs of all torture survivors in the UK and having to turn people away who desperately need help and support  Where do I start The first challenge is the scale of change and upheaval we are currently going through the second is the demographic time bomb and finally the arbitrary division between health and social care  inspirational because they are survivors of torture I admire their dignity resilience and optimism  Freedom from Torture is a unique charity which brings together work with individuals and the ability to influence national and international policy on torture We bring together three different areas of medicolegal work psychological support and human rights work  am too passionate about my work They are right But my friends and family keep me grounded and real  focus on providing services to our clients which are relevant accessible effective and sustainable  from the experience of our clients the human spirit is capable of overcoming the darkest of pasts and making a positive contribution to our society  The need to do the best for our clients but the truth is we need to raise a lot more money to provide the services our clients deserve meanwhile we have to live within our means and up our game to generate more income  always listen to your inner voice and stay true to your values  proud of the difference I was able to make to the experience of torture survivors in the UK  Meaningful engagement with our clients I am always moved by their spirit of generosity despite their experiences and I learn something new from them every time  The saddest thing about my job is that our asylum and welfare systems leave some victims of torture destitute I am ashamed of this and I wish we could do more to prevent it Freedom from Torture offices are filled with wonderful art work by our clients demonstrating their creativity resilience and hope  There are difficult choices and decisions to be made I want and need to be sure I am making the right ones in the interests of our clients and the longterm future of the charity
