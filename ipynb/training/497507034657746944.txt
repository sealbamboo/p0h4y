SAN JOSE, Calif.—International Business Machines Corp. is claiming a major advance in emulating the brain in silicon.. The technology company has developed a microchip that simulates functions of neurons, synapses and other features of the brain to perform calculations. IBM says the chip, a sharp break from the fundamental design used in most computers, excels at chores like recognizing patterns and classifying objects while using much less electrical power than conventional hardware.
