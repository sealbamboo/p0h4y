There is no direct connection between violence and autism None I dont break things I dont hit my dogs I keep a small Tupperware container in the house to catch insects so I can transport them safely outside before my cats or wife see them I dont disparage hunters but I could never kill another creature I just dont have it in me   For the most part I am just like you just a bit quirky All right a lot quirky I am pedantic I usually have no expression on my face or in my speech I cannot look you in the eye Ive learned to look people in the mouth or nose I cannot have a conversation of more than a few words with you but I can lecture you ad nauseam on US atomic bomb tests the Cleveland Browns beagles Japanese society  When you speak to me and I look away intently I am parsing your words and running through scenarios based on your request or statement in an effort to understand you Please bear with me  Because I still have a deathly fear of offending someone or talking about something way offtopic I often hold my hand over my mouth in meetings to keep from speaking Being called on to speak is sheer terror  And those are just some of my oddities Your childpartnercoworker with Aspergers has some similar peculiarities Thats why kids with Aspergers get bullied  I was lucky I didnt get bullied in school because I wasnt diagnosed and therefore not labeled I wasnt diagnosed until I was  And when the doctors asked what course of action I wanted I said none I had made it that far so Id like to continue working it out on my own  In fact until today most of my coworkers and friends didnt know I had Aspergers So Aspies can grow up to have families and be productive and contributing members of society  I cannot say this will get you through life and some of my advice may be wrong for you But heres what helped me  Targeting someone to pattern my social behavior after changed my life He was a coworker and friend who was outgoing popular and genuinely nice I mimicked him for years to learn how to approach people and how to act appropriately Im not there yet but Im not an outcast I dont think he ever knew Thanks Scott  Yes I know youre uncoordinated but you can teach yourself coordination I spent years throwing a ball against the garage developing a throwing motion building the ability to catch a ball and eventually hitting that ball By the fifth grade I was playing third base in schoolyard pickup games  and I was no longer picked last My selfesteem skyrocketed and the tough kids accepted me   Take all those thoughts in your head and put them down on paper or a computer screen Reread them a day a week a year later Show them to someone you trust Ill bet he or she thinks a lot of the same things Accept your peculiarities and take advantage of those you can the ability to focus aboveaverage intelligence  Be brave get out there a bit Take your obsessive gardening hobby and use it to socialize by checking out a gardening club or volunteer to help spruce up the neighborhood Learn a bit of selfcontrol but go ahead and make mistakes Apologize and have a laugh Neurotypical people can be quite forgiving given the chance Bullies are more socially flawed than you are  Thats how we all learn He or she is likely quite intelligent Let your child know youre pleased when he or she has spoken up to say Yes please or Thank you when the situation called for it We can be quite trying so please be patient
