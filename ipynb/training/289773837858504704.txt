Why would the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  the people who helped bring the world stealth fighters and GPS  fund research into manmade proteins that could make it easier for some Americans to eat pizza Thats what we wondered when we read that the Pentagons geewhiz research arm provided support for work on a drug to treat celiac disease a condition that interferes with the digestion of gluten in wheat and other foods So we asked Mildred Donlon a DARPA program manager told Shots the agency has no interest in developing a treatment for celiac disease But in a strange twist of scientific fate student researchers tried to crack the celiac puzzle with tools developed with DARPA funding How did it happen Between  and  DARPA invested in computerized methods to find medical defenses for chemical and biological warfare threats like   and   Now deadly anthrax spores and gluten are certainly threats on a very different scale but researchers believe they both could be vulnerable to carefully designed enzymes DARPA funded computerized techniques to develop better enyzmes faster Designing proteins including enzymes is the   of   at the University of Washington in Seattle The lab used some DARPA money to fund its work including development of a program called   which enlists researchers and citizen scientists to figure out which among many possible protein structures is the best one to solve certain biomedical problems According to researchers who published a   last month in the   a group of undergraduates at UW used FoldIt to come up with an enzyme that could break down gluten in the stomach The idea is to develop an enzyme pill that would eliminate gluten before it triggers a damaging immune response in people with celiac disease and to help people with the condition absorb nutrients better Nearly  in  Americans suffers from celiac disease   the University of Maryland Center for Celiac Research in Baltimore But currently the only treatment is a   which can be difficult for many people to stick with So theres likely a market for a pill they could take with meals the way people with   can take the enzyme lactase before consuming dairy products The idea is you would pop your pill and then drink your beer eat your pizza and cookies and be quite happy says   an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine at the University of California Davis and an author of the paper According to   a microbiologist at University of Washington and another author of the paper the students found an enzyme that could withstand stomach acids They then tweaked it to go after gluten It worked so well in the test tube that Siegel and Pultz have founded a company Proteus Biologics to try and bring it to market Siegel says theyll need to show in a clinical test that the protein can degrade enough gluten fast enough in the complex environment of the gut to be useful to people with celiac disease Theyll also have to prove that it doesnt have any toxic effects when eaten But dont expect an antigluten drug on the market anytime soon  even if Siegel and the other researchers decide to market it as a supplement like a lactase pill which would require far fewer trials than a drug It could still take years to prove its safe
