One spring morning during the second year of my surgical residency I learned that two of my classmates junior residents like me had suddenly been fired  Their dismissal left just four of us to cover two hospitals and the work of six junior residents I quickly did the math in my head We would have to split up into pairs and we would have to work through every other night for the rest of the year  The prospect of such a grueling timetable inspired us to come up with equally extreme solutions One month we tried power s working a hour shift every other weekend so that the other of the pair could have at least one full days break  That experiment didnt last long But my most enduring memory of that year is not the exhaustion it is the panic and anxiety that enveloped us as we struggled to cover far more work than four people  however willing  could reasonably complete Our lives had been distilled down to a simple math equation with three variables the work to be done the time needed to complete it and the number of people available to do it We worked longer hours not because our senior surgeons told us to but because that was the only way we could balance the equation  If only doctors in training these days had it so easy Over the   in response to   about medical errors arising from fatigue the   the organization responsible for accrediting American medical residency programs has been progressively limiting the number of hours that trainees can work The   which took effect in  is the most stringent and deals most specifically with interns These youngest doctors are allowed to work no longer than  hours in a day and residency programs that violate the restriction risk losing their accreditation In response to the hour mandate and faced with a Rubikscube conundrum of covering all the work with the same number of interns working fewer hours training programs across the country came up with several innovative scheduling configurations Some created complicated and overlapping shifts where outgoing doctors signed out their patients passing off their responsibilities to the incoming shift Others adopted a night float system that meant a resident just a year out of internship had to carry the work of as many as  interns at night looking after more than  patients and fielding questions about those patients at best every  minutes and at worst every    Now two years after the hour mandate was established studies on the outcomes are being published and the results reveal one thing Maybe we should have thought a little harder about the arithmetic Contrary to expectations these studies have shown that interns have not been getting   Moreover they   nor are they   In one   nearly half of all doctors in training disapproved of the regulations altogether   interns were spending less time in educational activities because the additional time required for such conferences and lectures would push them over the hour limit  In addition there has been   in the quality of care since the work limits took effect In   doctors had to scrap the night float system because the nurses thought the care offered by trainees on that schedule was so poor Another   interns confessed to having more concerns about making serious medical errors after the mandate than before  The problem Trying to do the same amount of work in fewer hours Fatigue is bad but overwork is worse said Dr Lara Goitein lead author of a   and a pulmonary and critical care physician at Christus St Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe NM  Health care trends over the last two decades have only exacerbated young doctors workload Admissions to teaching hospitals   from  to  in that same period the number of doctors in training available to do the work   And because insurers are pushing for shorter hospital stays only the sickest patients many of whom require complex care remain hospitalized  Its as if you told airline pilots that they could only work a certain number of hours but they had to fly  percent more flights Dr Goitein said  The   the findings from these studies but one important message is clear More funding needs to be devoted to increasing the number of doctors in training and finding ways to lighten their workload While these efforts may cost more initially   already indicate that giving these doctors more reasonable workloads can result in significant improvements in quality It could be a shortterm investment for longterm gains  You cant keep asking these young doctors to do more and more work in less time without affecting patient care Dr Goitein said Until we address the problem of overwork were just playing a shell game
