The majority of Americans now live in cities which means we have very little to do anymore with the production of our food But theres a reversal of that trend afoot as more city people decide that they want to cultivate crops and raise some livestock After all there are few things more satisfying than biting into a bunch of tender red radishes you grew yourself or a fresh egg from the   According to   just released by the National Gardening Association the number of Americans growing food in urban areas increased  percent between  and  from  million to  million people But many of these citydwelling gardeners still arent aware of how to grow food in urban soil safely according to a   by researchers at Johns Hopkins Universitys Center for a Livable Future Most gardeners understand that the soil in big cities is often    and know to get their soil tested But the researchers interviews with  urban gardeners in Baltimore revealed that most are pretty clueless about how to avoid other types of contaminants  like heavy metals and asbestos  from getting into their vegetables Part of the problem is that there might be contaminants that gardeners cant test for says   a program officer at the Center for a Livable Future Most soil tests look for lead cadmium and arsenic he tells The Salt But they dont test things like petrochemicals left behind by cars or cleaning solvents which might have seeped into the soil from an old laundromat Many of these chemicals  including the cleaning solvents laundromats used back in the day and chemicals found in the exhaust of cars  are carcinogenic and theyre dangerous to ingest or even breathe in Asbestos left over from a building demolished years ago can cause lung problems as well And children are especially vulnerable to all of these substances Kim says So if youre thinking of starting an urban garden Kim says once youve have found a plot of land you should learn its history Whats now an empty plot or a backyard might once have been a parking lot a gas station or the site of a chemical spill he says Knowing the site history will give you some clues about what might be in that soil he says And testing the soil and investigating the lands history are crucial whether or not youre planning on using raised beds People tend to think raised beds are going to solve their contamination problem Kim says But contaminated soil could easily get kicked onto your plants especially if the beds are low to the ground Another consideration is you have to be careful about the materials that youre using to build a raised bed Kim says Recycling wood from an old construction site might seem like a good ecofriendly idea But that wood could be treated with chemicals you dont want touching your fruits and veggies Kim says Even after taking all those precautions gardeners can never be  percent sure that theyre in the clear Kim says So its always a good idea to use gloves while gardening and wash all your produce thoroughly And if your young kids like to help out in the garden you might want to clean them up as well All of this advice applies to all urban gardeners Kim says whether youre in charge of a small backyard plot or a giant operation like acre   in Detroit According to the report in Baltimore over a quarter of the gardeners were relative newbies with less than five years of experience Kim says theres no quick way to bridge the knowledge gap but providing gardeners with the right resources is a first step He and his colleagues have created an urban gardening   Baltimore residents can also check out an interactive   of the city which highlights sites where the risk of contamination is high Other great resources include the US Department of Agricultures online  I see these urban growing spaces as these oases in the middle of these urban environments Kim says They bring communities together and they help people save money on fresh produce Urban growing spaces are amazing he says Lets keeping doing this but lets do it safely
