Eventually  when I was  my parents started to pick up on it which led to a doctor visit My mother and I were told that I had significant hearing loss and that the hearing I had left was not guaranteed to stay  My mother had a hard time dealing with the news at first It was one more obstacle that we were going to have to deal with as a family and she knew it was bound to cause a hard time for me at school When it came time to decide whether to go to a school for the deaf or continue in public school I made the choice to stay where I was My mother was a bit uncomfortable with the situation but my fear of being labeled as different played a big part in my decision  I also decided I was just going to keep my hearing loss to myself Eventually my friends figured it out It didnt really change anything between us but from time to time some other kids would make fun of me  One day in middle school a kid started making fun of me and mocked his own stereotypical idea of what a deaf person would speak like One of my good friends Chad Foster stopped me from thinking or doing anything negative and told me it wasnt worth it He said there will always be ignorant people like that in life and I just have to brush it off  to be me and thats all that mattered He also told me he had my back  But I still had trouble looking at school the same way That incident brought reality into my life at an early age so I kept to myself with my close friends  My career as a DJ began in college My parents owned a restaurant and my father gave me the opportunity to DJ a party one night I immediately fell in love with the turntables and began to DJ more and more From there I started DJing at clubs in the tristate area from New Jersey to New York to Connecticut and eventually also in Atlanta and Chicago  I started to get a following in those states even as I continued to attend Kean University to get my bachelors degree in biology Then I had to drop out of college my junior year due to financial trouble in a bad economy  However I stuck with my passion of spinning music and after nearly a decade I was granted a great opportunity HewlettPackard took notice of what I was doing and what my movement stood for We shot and aired a global commercial which began a positive snowball effect for my career Doctors tell me there is a procedure that could restore my hearing One day when I have the time and money to get my hearing fixed I probably will have the procedure done But right now I need to be on the forefront with my team fighting for the issues in society that are too often overlooked I intend to do so through my career in music and philanthropy  Plus there are just some things in life better off not being heard  When it comes down to it lifes not about all the small negative things you encounter Its about being yourself and doing what you love to be happy If you love something so much and have great passion for it then just go for it My team and I like to use the expression Why not    Just ask yourself why not
