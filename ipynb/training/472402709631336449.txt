The painful disease has been around for centuries but began a dramatic upswing in the s In the   the annual number of cases has boomed from  in  to  million in  With the World Cup coming up in midJune host country   that carry dengue pronounced DENGgey Heres what we know about dengue  fever  A flulike disease caused by any one of four closely related types of dengue viruses carried primarily by female  mosquitoes usually found in the tropics and subtropics In the more northern regions the disease is transmitted by the   which can withstand cooler temperatures Humans cant infect each other  but they can infect mosquitoes which pass the virus on both to their female offspring and to human bite victims The infection is most prevalent in South and Central America where the tropical weather is perfect for mosquitoes and is a problem as well in Southeast Asia Africa and the Western Pacific Cases have also been   in parts of Europe Russia and even the US in Florida and near the Mexican border  About half of people infected are asymptomatic according to the   The other half arent so lucky Four to  days after being bitten they may experience fever up to  degrees along with severe headaches joint and muscle pains and pain behind the eyes It can feel as though your bones are breaking hence dengues alternative name breakbone fever Half a million patients are hospitalized each year but most people recover after two to seven days Some develop dengue hemorrhagic fever after the initial fever declines  a more severe form of the illness that can cause organ damage severe bleeding dehydration and even death But with early treatment the mortality rate for all dengue fever is currently fewer than  of  people  Patients are given medication for their symptoms and told to drink lots of water No cure yet but researchers are testing vaccines  Once you survive your first dengue infection youre immune to that particular type of virus  but not to the other three types Many countries are home to all four types and someone who is reinfected is more likely to develop extreme symptoms To make matters worse mosquitoes that carry dengue can also carry yellow fever and   one bite could pass on multiple infections The   estimates  million to  million infections a year although a   suggests the number may be as high as  million Blame it in part on globalization Mosquitoes can hide and breed in goods that are traded An infected traveler can also spread the disease to mosquitoes in a new region In cities where construction and the lack of piped water leads to standing pools of water mosquitoes thrive Researchers also believe the spike is partly the result of better surveillance Efforts focus on spraying streets and neighborhoods with pesticides   mosquitoes and encouraging people to ward off mosquito bites with bug spray nets and longsleeved shirts and long pants Our sources epidemiologists Luis Gerardo Castellanos at the World Health Organization and   at Duke University
