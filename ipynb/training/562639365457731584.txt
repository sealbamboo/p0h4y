The controversy then comes when the antivaccination movement gets large enough to reverse advances in the reduction or elimination of certain diseases  Thats what is happening with the measles How bad can it be Here are some guideposts to the issue in context  In simplest terms as of January  there were  of measles reported across  states  The majority of these cases are related to one outbreak linked to Disneyland in California  Last year there were  cases of measles reported  This years pace is striking One month into the new year the number of measles cases is nearly onesixth of last years total A closer look makes this years measles outbreak look even worse Last years  measles cases is an outlier compared to the previous decade The number of measles cases in  was the highest since   Between  and  the median number of measles cases reported per year was  During that period the highest number of cases in a single year was  and the lowest was   Heres the glasshalfempty view So far this year there are already more cases of measles than during an entire typical year Those are the words of Dr Anne Schuchat assistant surgeon general and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases No this is not the first time the United States has witnessed an uptick in measles cases since the invention of the measles vaccine  A brief history of measles in the United States according to the CDC  Before the introduction of a live measles vaccine in  the average yearly number of measles cases was  Nearly  deaths per year were attributed to measles  Once the measles vaccine was introduced it was a onedose shot there was a huge drop in measles cases  Then between  and  there was a resurgence in measles cases There were  cases and  deaths reported during that period  Those getting sick were mostly unvaccinated children But there were also people who had the vaccine and were getting the disease anyway  In  the medical communitys recommendation was updated to recommend a twodose vaccination regimen  The use of two doses was effective In  endemic measles was declared eliminated from the United States  It is a pretty big deal that the United States can say it eliminated measles This doesnt mean that measles doesnt exist here but that there is not a constant presence of it in an area  There is the risk that measles could reestablish itself in the United States  Schuchat the assistant surgeon general told reporters the spike in measles cases is troubling  This worries me and I want to do everything possible to prevent measles from getting a foothold in the United States and becoming endemic again she said  The CDC points out that people who refuse to vaccinate usually live in the same community When measles finds its way into these communities outbreaks are more likely to occur and controlling the disease becomes harder  Measles is not a virus that Americans typically spend time worrying about because for a long time it has not been prevalent But it is a serious disease It is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air  Measles starts with a fever runny nose cough red eyes and sore throat  This is not a problem with the measles vaccine not working  Schuchat said This is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used The research on the effectiveness of the measles vaccine is welldocumented But anecdotes have a powerful sway  The antivaccination crowd got a boost when a British study alleged a link between autism and childhood vaccines The study was later retracted and called an   Nonetheless   of people who   for autism or other conditions in children find an audience among wellmeaning parents  One Arizona cardiologist Dr Jack Wolfson has become a face of the antivaccination movement because he is a doctor who refuses to vaccinate his children  Its not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals Wolfson told CNNs Erin Burnett  The bottom line of course is that no matter what the recommendations are no person or institution can force people to vaccinate their children Schools and other institutions often have immunization requirements but there are ways to opt out for religious or personal reasons  During the last school year  of California kindergartners  about    according to the CDC The vast majority of exemptions were due to personal beliefs Journalists at Silk a platform for creating data visualizations took California Kindergarten vaccination rate data and found  school districts with vaccination compliance rates at  or lower  Scientifically there is no debate The measles vaccine is effective Most of those who contract measles unsurprisingly are those who are unvaccinated  But a conversation about the current measles outbreak brings up other ideas  on personal and religious freedoms skepticism of scientific findings reach of government regulations  that are inherently political And here is where the arguments arise  Some   though they walked a fine line  Kentucky Sen Rand Paul told radio host Laura Ingraham that he is not antivaccine at all but added most of them should be voluntary New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said he vaccinates his children to protect their health and the public health but that he understands that parents need to have some measure of choice as well The science is clear which policies to craft with that knowledge is what remains to be discussed
