Ancient humans used toothpicks nearly  million years ago a study of their teeth has revealed  A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia  the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick  the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles or jaws  Ani Margvelashvili lead author of the study at the University of Zurich Switzerland said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individuals age Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individuals lifetime These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species she told BBC News  The individual who was using a toothpick was young as his or her teeth were not worn down We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum There was a small cylindershaped lesion  in this area if you place a toothpick it goes through The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of wellpreserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world  The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa  Its not very often you have one site with four mandibles It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum  This included horizontal scratches on a lesion visible on the root surface of one of the teeth  Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is Prof Lordkipanidze coauthor of the work told BBC News  It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were Experts once believed it was   who first ventured out of Africa   But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tallstanding and bigbrained   Instead the Dmanisi individuals were short longarmed smallbrained and thin browed The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as  s Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum London said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania  This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation  Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas US said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils  Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period but this clinical forensic approach is new and potentially useful   Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been moreorless limited to anatomically modern humans and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology Prof Ungar added
