Republicans may have promised to repeal or at least do a big makeover of Obamacare now that they control both the House and the Senate but most experts believe its lip service only The  Affordable Care Act is in full force across the country with internetbased health insurance exchanges up and running expanded Medicaid in  states and strict new requirements for health insurers Here are five reasons the GOPled Congress wont be able to change much This is the big one President Barack Obama still has veto power Republicans may have a majority in the Senate but they dont have the  seats needed to override a Democraticled filibuster or a presidential veto And Obamas not going to allow his signature piece of legislation to be gutted Republicans actually like a lot about Obamacare Its great business for health insurance companies which in turn give plenty of money to Republicans Republicans have also always agreed that more Americans need to be covered by health insurance They just havent always agreed on how to get there The five major national health insurers have all seen their stock price at least double  one has almost tripled  since the ACA was enacted and theyve all been raising their earnings estimates says Jay Angoff who helped construct health reform at the Health and Human Services department before returning to private law firm Mehri  Skalet Republicans are not going to try to repeal a law that has been such a boon to insurers They are still a Republican constituency group Ask voters if they like Obamacare and many will say no   percent in the latest NBC News poll But ask about specific provisions and theyre very popular People like laws that prevent insurance companies from pulling their insurance just as they become really sick and need it They like provisions that allow young adults to stay on their parents plans And they really like government subsidies  already have health insurance on the exchanges The Congressional Budget Office projects that  million people will buy health insurance on the exchanges by  and that  million people will   for Medicaid in the states that choose to expand their offerings by  It would be difficult to take insurance away from that many people There are several provisions that Republicans can get support from Democrats on including perhaps introducing some really cheap plans called copper plans that wont cost much and also wont cover much loosening the requirements that most employers provide health insurance and perhaps changing the definition of parttime worker from the current  hours a week and perhaps allowing people to renew barebones plans that dont comply with the healthcare laws requirements None of these items will stop the House of Representatives from voting to repeal Obamacare and it may be one of the first actions taken in January At some point next year well move to replace Obamacare House Speaker John Boehner promised Thursday But the House has already voted more than  times to repeal the law with zero effect And of course the Supreme Court just might   for the GOP with its   a suit filed against the federal subsidies If the court rules next year that the subsidies are unconstitutional the administration will have to scramble to find another way to help people pay for health insurance
