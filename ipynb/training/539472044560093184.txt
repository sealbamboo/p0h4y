Heres an Ebola puzzle for you If the virus isnt airborne why do doctors and nurses need to wear full protective suits with face masks while treating patients After we dug through studies and talked to scientists the answer slowly emerged Ebola   spread through the   But not through the   Oh goodness No wonder theres been such a kerfuffle about how the virus is   The story began quite innocently at Harvard University way back in the s William Wells was a hotshot engineer there at the time He was figuring out a slew of important ideas about infectious disease like the fact that UV light kills bacteria One day in  Wells discovered that pathogens he was studying bacteria get trapped in tiny droplets of fluid  maybe some mucus when you sneeze or some saliva when you cough The pathogens stay alive in the fluid and can move through the air inside these droplets Clearly this is one way infections spread But Wells didnt stop there He knew that liquid drops dont last for long in the air They take one of two courses  Large droplets fall to the ground because of gravity Just like rain  Small drops start evaporating as they fall Eventually they become so light that they float in the air Just like fog It appears therefore that transmission of infection through air may take one of two forms depending upon the size of the infected droplet Wells   in the  in  He gave these two routes names    The pathogen falls to the ground in large droplets The pathogen doesnt make it very far away from the source of the fluid but if you intercept the drops path you could get infected  Airborne route The pathogen is lifted up into the air inside tiny droplets The pathogen floats and can move long distances with air currents If you inhale this mist you could get infected Over the years the first term didnt really stick with the media or general public But the second one sure has And what weve ended up with is one term that often gets used to describe both routes of transmission But oh how they are different Viruses that move through the droplet route usually travel only about  feet and no more than  feet They stay in the air for less than a second So to catch these viruses you have to be within  feet of a contagious person Ebola spreads through the droplet route Theres no doubt of that A splash of Ebolainfected fluid to your face can be deadly Viruses that move through the second route  the airborne route  can travel more than  feet and can stay in the air for minutes even hours when the humidity and temperature are right That means you dont even have to see the person to catch a virus from him or her An infected person could sneeze walk out of the room and leave an infectious mist behind A few viruses such as measles and chickenpox spread this way thats why they have such high   What about Ebola In the lab scientists can   monkeys with Ebola virus through the airborne route They essentially stick a monkeys head in a plastic tube and spray the animals face with a mist infused with Ebola If the humidity and temperature are right in the tube the monkey can get Ebola But scientists havent found evidence that Ebola spreads through the airborne route in real outbreaks with real people Does that mean Ebola never catches a ride on tiny floating droplets No As Wells wrote nearly a century ago Failure to discover airborne infection  doesnt prove its absence But if Ebola does transmit through the airborne route the process is highly inefficient and contributes only an infinitesimal amount to the viruss total spread Take the   of Patrick Sawyer Back in July the LiberianAmerican businessman boarded a plane from Monrovia to Lagos Nigeria He was clearly very sick  and very contagious  with Ebola He even vomited while on the plane There were about  other passengers on the flight None of them got infected
