Many of us think of death as the worst possible outcome for a terminally ill patient but Judith Schwarz disagrees Schwarz a patient supporter at the nonprofit Compassion  Choices says prolonging death can be a far worse fate For many patients good palliative or hospice care can alleviate suffering yet a small but significant proportion of dying patients suffer intolerably Schwarz writes Compassion  Choices is an organization that helps terminally ill patients and their families make informed and thoughtful endoflife decisions to hasten a patients death These decisions are not made impulsively Schwarz tells  s Terry Gross Nobody makes this choice unless the burdens of living have so consistently day after day outweighed all benefit Schwarz notes that her organization does not help patients kill themselves and their work should not be confused with assisted suicide They are dying she says They are on a dying trajectory The only choice they have is the circumstances of their death and what kind of disability they will be suffering as they approach that time Compassion  Choices supports the right to die but does not work outside the limits of the law which varies from state to state There are now three states  Washington Oregon and Montana  where in certain instances it is legal for doctors to prescribe medication to hasten death As patients and their families make these excruciating decisions they consult with doctors who evaluate their endoflife options Making decisions to hasten death requires a tremendous act of love on the part of the family Schwarz says Because actually what this patient is doing is leaving them and leaving them perhaps sooner than their disease would require People who think they want to be able to for example take a lethal amount of medication to end their life  they speculate that thats how they are    feel but they actually dont know how they are going to feel when they get to the point where their quality of life is so diminished that they really wish they were dead that they would not wake up the next morning But to take that step to take that final step to cause your own death in one very  dramatic act is very very hard and most people dont do that The Oregon Death with Dignity Act has been around for  years now and the  primary reasons for patients asking their physician for this prescription have remained consistent over all of those years Its not about pain pain can actually be managed  thats not why people want to hasten their dying They do it because theyre not able to do any of the things that theyve always enjoyed doing  that give them any kind of pleasure They cant do those things anymore And they have a complete loss of autonomy theyre dependent upon other people to care for them and they feel that theyve lost all dignity You have to understand Terry this doesnt matter for everybody but for those people that it does matter to it matters profoundly This is really what we really think of  as sort of existential distress  the meaningless of having to just wait for this death to occur I suppose thats a comforting position to take but it doesnt really speak to the nature of suffering and it doesnt speak to a patients wish to be treated with dignity and to be heard We talk about ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence that death is deemed the worst possible outcome that should be prevented at all costs Well I beg to differ There are many people for whom death is not the worst thing that could happen to them In fact prolonging their dying is the worst thing that could happen to them and the notion of healing in that environment strikes me as a bit of a onesided understanding of the relationship
