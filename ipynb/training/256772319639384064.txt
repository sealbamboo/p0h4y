The Viral Storm  once called virologist Nathan Wolfe the worlds most prominent virus hunter Wolfe the director of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative spends his days tracking emerging infectious diseases before they turn into deadly pandemics In   Wolfe describes how most of those emerging infectious diseases originally start out in animals before making the jump to us Almost all of them start from an animal virus an animal microbe that jumps over to humans says Wolfe Thats actually the same with most of the major diseases of humanity These things actually start with animals In Central Africa where Wolfe has worked for over a decade hundreds of thousands people still hunt and consume tropical wild game called bush meat The practice has allowed viruses like HIV to leap from wild animals to humans  and then spread rapidly across populations Wolfe and his colleagues in the region stress the health hazards of bush meat But he tells  s Terry Gross that its difficult to change hunters behavior without providing alternative sources of protein Were actively working to come up with animal protein solutions he says There are organizations around the world that were in active discussions with on ways we can introduce novel sources of animal protein that will allow people to have different sources protein so theyre not forced to hunt animal game But most of our mission is to understand whats crossing over from animals to humans and to catch it early Wolfe regularly receives dried blood samples from animals and hunters in the region The blood spots are taken to a lab where they provide a quick map of the viruses that are in each region that can potentially to jump to humans We see new things all the time he says We see new retroviruses out there  which is the category that HIV falls into  and were very very concerned because this is the part of the world where HIV jumped from chimpanzees to humans Theres no reason why other viruses in that same class wont have the capacity to leap to humans  Weve found new species of malaria  and were really starting to burn through this massive collection of blood spots to determine just whats out there Wolfe also recently traveled to Asia where the first cases of the HN flu were spotted several years ago HN has killed hundreds of people around the world since it reemerged in  The original strain of HN explains Wolfe jumped directly from birds to humans Other viruses meanwhile make the leap to domestic animals before infecting humans that mixing can then introduce deadlier strains of unknown viruses into the world So what happens is you have a particular pig out there and it could get infected with two different viruses  maybe one thats been in human and one thats been in the original reservoir of a bird  and they can mix and match their genes and create mosaic daughter viruses that will have completely novel properties he says Thats where things can get particularly deadly Wolfe says he thinks of viruses as having two dials one for how transmissible they are and one for how deadly they are The HN virus which spread to over  countries in  and  is considered to be extremely transmissible  but not extremely deadly Meanwhile a different strain of bird flu  the HN  is incredibly deadly but didnt spread as effectively as the HN strain Wolfes team tracked people who had HN but he says they were more interested in people with the deadlier strain And the reason why was because we were really scared that these H and H viruses would come together in a particular human or pig and create one virus that was off the transmissible and deadly dials he says And thats of course the devastating pandemic were trying to avoid He points to HIV which existed for decades before humans first became aware of it Are we willing to live in a world just waiting for viruses to go global before we catch them he says I think thats one of the things were trying to change  The earlier we detect these things the more we have the potential to save lives in the future Wolfe That year a number of chickens had died And Captain wanted to help out with the tasks and he carried some of the sick chickens during the outbreak that they had A few days later he came down with quite a severe illness  and sadly he died He was the first death that country had from HN Wolfe If you look now at air traffic maps you see basically a plate of spaghetti There are incredible connections  airlines and boats are moving humans and animals around the globe The features of globalization have huge consequences on pandemics It just connects us so much more closely  And as a consequence every one of these viruses that passes from animals to humans has the capacity to infect all of us Wolfe If we were to count the number of cells between the top of your head and the socks on your feet we would find that  percent of those cells are not human cells Ninety percent of those cells belong to various microorganisms that exist primarily in your gut and on your skin but also in many many parts of your body Theres tons and tons of microbes out there
