Childrens heart surgery in the UK  often the source of bitter controversy  has improved significantly a report has concluded The mortality rate within  days of an operation has fallen from  in  to  a decade later  In that time the number and complexity of the cases both increased   The NHS in England is continuing its review into how child heart surgery should be organised Repairing the hearts of children born with congenital defects is one of the most complex procedures in the NHS The study showed the number of procedures increased from  in  to  in  The discipline evokes strong passions which erupted when plans were announced and then shelved to cut the number of hospitals providing the delicate surgery in England from  to seven Then in  surgery was suspended at Leeds General Infirmary amid concerns about death rates  Later   found the decision was based on invalidated and incomplete data The suspension was also prompted by concerns raised by families and doctors at Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust where child heart surgery is also carried out Professor Martin Utley who conducted the UKwide assessment of death rates at University College London said the ongoing controversies meant we had lost sight of the fact these are very good outcomes internationally He added I think one of reasons for concern is we are one of the few countries that are able to produce these numbers and publish them The study showed that death rates had halved despite an overall rise in cases complexity Prof Utley told the BBC News website The mortality rates are low theyve been falling and it is time to start looking beyond shortterm survival  Many of the children who have these operations would not survive if they didnt have them Its lifesaving lifeextending surgery Thirtyday survival is a very useful measure it is something concrete but the outcomes that are really important are longterm survival and the function those kids have how they get on at school and the extent to which they participate in life  He said the improvements were driven by lots of small incremental improvements across a range of procedures A spokesperson for NHS England said NHS England is undertaking a review of services for children and adults with congenital heart disease to ensure all patients receive high quality care wherever they live   We want consistent services across the country that meet the highest standards and are able to offer resilient  care Professor Jeremy Pearson from the British Heart Foundation said Surgery for children born with heart defects has dramatically improved in the UK over the last  years from a position where very few babies survived to one where almost all do This review of progress over the last ten years is highly reassuring
