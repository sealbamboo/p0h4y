The top hospitals dont always live up to their reputations when it comes to handling surgery according to a new report released on Wednesday Consumer Reports used newly available federal government data to look at how patients fared after surgery at nearly  hospitals in  states The report found some of the bigname hospitals did not always do well in preventing infections and other measures of quality care while some busy urban hospitals that care for the poorest and sickest patients often did surprisingly well It also breaks down detailed findings for five common procedures back surgery hip and knee replacement angioplasty to clear out clogged arteries of the heart and carotid artery surgery to unplug the neck artery Consumers have very little to go on when trying to select a hospital for surgery not knowing which ones do a good job at keeping surgery patients safe and which ones dont Lisa McGiffert director of Consumers Unions Safe Patient Project says in a statement They might as well just throw a scalpel at a dartboard Some of the surprise findings Two of Washington DCs flagship hospitals MedStar Washington Hospital Center and Sibley Memorial Hospital both get the poorest overall rating for patients receiving surgery Johns Hopkins Hospital  associated with one of the countrys most prestigious medical schools  only gets an average rating Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston  one of several hospitals associated with Harvard Medical School also gets the poorest rating In contrast top ratings go to the Greater Baltimore Medical Center other bigcity hospitals like Mount Sinai and NYU Langone Medical Center in New York as well as some regional hospitals like Nebraska Heart Hospital in Lincoln and Abilene Regional Medical Center in Texas Dr Peter Pronovost senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins and one of the leaders in the fight to improve hospital quality applauds the idea but says the data the report is based on is flawed I really applaud the Consumer Report effort to get information to consumers about complications he said The overall concept is spoton Pronovost told NBC News One of the concerns is they measured these complications using administrative data which is completely understandable but we know its not completely accurate Unfortunately he said theres not much better data out there yet One of the measures  infections among patients fitted with a catheter  is only right  percent of the time when calculated using billing information filed to Medicare Pronovost says What we need to do is keep working to get better performance measures he said Dr David Bates chief quality officer at Brigham and Womens agreed that billing data is often less than accurate Hospital rankings are a complex and important topic and better performance measures are needed to provide a true picture of the quality and safety of hospitals nationwide Bates said in a statement In addition to Johns Hopkins NBC News also reached out to officials from Brigham and Womens Hospital and MedStar Washington Hospital Center but they were unable to provide immediate comment on the findings Sibley Memorial Hospital is affiliated with Johns Hopkins Many of the biggest and most famous hospitals arent listed Consumer Reports used Medicare reporting data for its report and could only include hospitals that reported data in a certain way The ratings are based on the percentage of a hospitals surgery patients who either died while in the hospital or who stayed longer than would have been expected based on national averages for each procedure considered Research shows those measures are correlated with complications and some hospitals themselves use this approach to monitor quality Consumer Reports said in a statement It is unfortunately the best we can do using billing data says Doris Peter manager of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center We dont have ratings for Veterans Affairs hospitals and hospitals that see mostly Medicare Advantage patients such as many Kaiser hospitals because they use another reporting system the group added in a statement Consumer Reports will   The nonprofit is one of several organizations that now rate hospitals and doctors US News and World Report   as does   the   the   and   Some experts have pointed out   and give at best a distorted picture in no small part because hospitals dont release this information publicly And Medicare has only just recently begun to do so No one had the information needed to make accurate estimates of just what was going on medically with patients in hospitals Peter says this report is unique This is a measure that looks at patients who died or who stayed in the hospital longer than required for their procedures I dont think there is anything out there like this for anyone she said in a telephone interview There have never been hospitallevel results published to the public Leah Binder CEO of the LeapFrog Group a patient safety organization calls the report a breakthrough It is one of the first reports Ive seen for the public that uses newly available Medicare data Binder said in a telephone interview In the past Medicare data was not made public for use by researchers After quite a bit of struggling and political battles by groups like mine and Consumer Reports it has been publicly released She says consumers should have a look before they choose a hospital for surgery  but notes no single report gives a full picture of what a hospital does Hospitals are complex places Binder said I think it is reasonable that there might be several different perspectives on how they do It is not like rating even a restaurant Hospitals do surgery they save lives they make mistakes There is a whole array of incredibly complex services they provide to the public Peter says theres still no onestop shopping for consumers trying to get information about hospitals Unfortunately all this data isnt in one place that is easy to digest she says And anyone considering surgery should speak to the surgeon You can ask your surgeon for rates of death You can ask how many of those procedures they have done before she said Surgeons who wont give that information might not be the right surgeon to do the work It really does work Peter says Some surgeons especially cardiac surgeons are used to tracking their performance They already know Groups from LeapFrog to the Commonwealth Fund and the independent Institute of Medicine have been pressing for hospitals to improve their safety records There have been reports like the landmark  study from the IoM which documented that up to  people died every year in the hospital because of mistakes And the  Affordable Care Act aims to lower costs and improve care by forcing hospitals to report and correct their mistakes One of its first targets is readmission rates  the number of patients who have something done in the hospital and come back days or a few weeks later because of a mistake such as an infection or a failure to prescribe the right medication  The beauty of this approach is that preventable complications correlate with postoperative length of stay Dr Arnold Milstein director of the Clinical Excellence Research Center at Stanford University said in a statement This is about as good as complications measurement can be when using existing claims data
