Youd think that someone who is a science correspondent and is as allergic to poison ivy as I am would have heard of urushiol but no I didnt recognize the word when I saw it a week or so ago Now thanks to my new beat   Im allowed to dig a little deeper into stories and what I learned about urushiol is pretty amazing It all started with a press release I received from the American Chemical Society highlighting an   in the  Urushiol is the oily sap on poison ivy leaves that causes all the problemsAnd its not only poison ivy which doesnt grow in California Poison oak poison sumac and poison dogwood all contain urushiol and will also give you a nasty rash In the paper Rebecca Braslau and her colleagues at the University of California Santa Cruz describe a nontoxic spray that will fluoresce in the presence of urushiol Braslau has gotten the rash more times than shed care to remember She knows how to avoid the plants herself but she has a problem My husbands a geologist He tramps around in the Santa Cruz mountains she tells Shots Her husband is one of those lucky people who isnt allergic to urushiol When we first got together he wasnt very careful about it and so he would get it on his arm and he wouldnt even know it Braslau says And then hed put his arm around her and shed break out So Braslau got to thinking Theres got to be some way to deal with this and I just had this eureka moment because I thought about it for a couple years The eureka moment involved a class of chemicals known as nitroxides Braslau was able to develop a nitroxidebased solution that would react only with urushiol By adding a fluorescent dye that would show up only when the reaction occurred she could spray her nitroxide solution on a surface and if the urushiol was there the surface would light up She says until there is thorough safety testing its probably best to use the spray on inert things like shoes or backpacks to see if the oil is there Ultimately I would love to be able to spray it on my arm or my husband or my dog and find out where this stuff is she says The compound Braslau describes in the article is just a proof of concept She says she needs to find a better dye maybe even one that will light up without having to shine a fluorescent light on it Shes got a patent and would be happy to hear from potential investors So OK Braslaus spray lets you know youve been exposed to urushiol Then what I asked her TecNu she replied TecNu is a waterfree cleanser There are other soaps that work getting the oil off  for example that stuff called Goop car mechanics use to degrease their hands Braslau says and some dishwashing detergents But she relies on TecNu  a chemist at Oregon State University works on TecNu for its manufacturer   of Albany Ore I asked him why TecNu was so good at removing urushioll from someones skin and he said it was because it contains a benzene ring which has ortho hydroxyls and then para to that off of that benzene ring is a long alkyl unsaturated chain  to  carbons Not quite the simple explanation I was hoping for After he explained it a bit more the idea seems to be the chemicals in TecNu can mix with urushiol so you can wash it off your skin One other interesting thing about urushiol Its harvested from the Japanese lacquer tree and prized as a lacquer for artwork Antoine Wilmering is an expert in   as it is known at the Getty Foundation in Los Angeles He says you apply multiple layers of the lacquer with a brush cure and polish each layer and then you get these really beautiful shining surfaces The good news is if you properly cure the lacquer it not only hardens but it also loses its allergenic properties But an object covered with improperly cured urushiol lacquer can still cause a rash
