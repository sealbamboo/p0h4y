They are the miracle pills that shouldnt really do anything Placebos come in all shapes and sizes but they contain no active ingredient And yet mysteriously they often seem to work Over the last couple of decades there has been a huge amount of research into what dummy pills can do and how they work  We know that in the right situations they can be very effective at relieving selfreported conditions like pain and depression  But the latest research suggests they might even be able to help relieve the symptoms of a major neurological disorder as Paul Pattison found out In many ways Paul is just like anyone else with a love of the outdoors  He spends much of his spare time cycling in the hills on the outskirts of Vancouver where he lives  And every day he walks his dog through the pine forest that starts where his garden ends  But theres one big difference between Paul and your average outdoorsy type Whether hes walking or cycling Paul needs medication to help him do it because he has Parkinsons Disease Without his drugs even walking can be a major struggle Parkinsons is caused by an inability of the brain to release enough dopamine a neurotransmitter that affects our mood but is also essential for regulating movement  Luckily for Paul his medication can give him the dopamine he needs to keep his symptoms under control  Given everything we know about the disease its hard to believe that a placebo  a dummy pill with no active ingredients  could do anything to help someone with Parkinsons  And that makes Prof Jon Stoessls experiments all the more remarkable He is the director of the Pacific Parkinsons Research Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver  A few years ago Paul took part in a trial that Prof Stoessl was conducting It required him to stop taking his medication  The next day he headed into hospital his symptoms in full flareup  He explains Thats when they gave me this capsule and they gave you a halfhoura normal period of time for the meds to kick in And boom  I was thinking this is pretty good my body becomes erect my shoulders go back Theres no way that I could be like this without having had my medication Except that Paul hadnt been given his medication  hed been given a placebo  I was in a state of shock There are physical things that change in me when I take my meds so how could a blank thing a nothing create those same feelings Prof Stoessl has conducted numerous experiments with dozens of patients and is in no doubt that a placebo can sometimes relieve the symptoms of Parkinsons  In Parkinsons as in many other conditions there is an important placebo response and that can be measured with clinical outcomes What is new about Prof Stoessls work though is that by scanning the brains of people with Parkinsons disease when they experience a placebo effect hes been able to shed light on how a dummy pill can possibly make a difference  He has found that when someone like Paul responds well to a placebo it isnt the case that hes simply coping better with his symptoms or somehow battling through them Instead the placebo is triggering the release of dopamine in his brain  And it isnt a small amount of dopamine that a placebo can release  What we found is that in somebody with Parkinsons disease a placebo can release as much dopamine as amphetamine or speed can in somebody with a healthy dopamine system So its a very dramatic response That dramatic response only appears to last for a short while  a placebo certainly isnt a miracle cure And even if it was doctors could hardly start lying to their patients and replacing real drugs with placebo pills  Its also unclear exactly how a placebo is able to spur the brain into producing more dopamine given that Parkinsons is caused by an apparent inability of the brain to produce enough  But what is certainly clear is that the dopamine isnt coming from the placebo pill itself theres nothing in it The dopamine is coming from our brains And that goes to the heart of how a placebo works Theres now a strong body of evidence that a dummy pill can activate the brains natural ability to produce the chemicals that we need  Prof Tor Wager at the University of Colorado is a neuroscientist who studies what happens in the brain when people receive a placebo that they think is a painkiller  When weve given people a placebo treatment what we see is the release of endogenous opioids which is the brains own morphine  What that means is that the placebo effect is tapping into the same pain control circuitry as opiate drugs like morphine It seems that a dummy pill can do different things according to what you expect it to do  It can potentially encourage the release of dopamine if you think its a dopamineboosting Parkinsons drug or it can relieve pain if you think its a painkiller In many ways of course our brains are natural pharmacies constantly giving us chemical hits of one form or another  to stop pain or to feel it to energise us or to calm us down and it seems to be this inbuilt pharmacy that a placebo can trigger  In fact the drugs that we buy in a real pharmacy are often mimicking the chemicals that our brains produce themselves  As Prof Wager puts it The placebo effect taps into our natural pharmacy  Drugs work because we have receptors for the drugs and that means that theres some endogenous chemicals that our brains are producing that act on those receptors  the receptors evolved to respond to those natural chemicals Research into the power of the placebo is still in its infancy  There is still an enormous amount that we dont know what exactly are the mechanisms by which it works Why do placebos work on some people and not others  But research in the field of placebo studies has boomed over the last decade and the evidence is growing that a placebo effect can be a powerful thing  Prof Stoessl says The placebo effect is real quantifiable and in fact youre doing quite well with an active therapy if you can get as good a response as the placebo response And the more we understand it the better our chances of harnessing the placebo effect and making the most of the medicine in our minds  Horizons
