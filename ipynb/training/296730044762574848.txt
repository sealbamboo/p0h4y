When a   in lower Manhattan earlier this month ambulances took dozens of people to hospitals around the island  took in  passengers but they all had minor injuries The most seriously hurt patients from the crash went elsewhere Dr Suzi Vassallo said thats because Bellevue still cant handle serious traumatic injuries Superstorm Sandy   in October The hospital got back in business in December but only partially We dont have an operating room yet Vassallo said And you always have to have that kind of backup for any critical trauma Recently Dr William Goldberg arrived at his ER shift and found that a stabbing victim had been transferred to another hospital He was probably fine but because we dont have the resources we normally have they basically packed him up and shipped him over to Cornell Goldberg said referring to New YorkPresbyterians   the areas only other trauma center Its a point of pride among staffers that Bellevue usually takes all comers  whether they have a bad stomach ache or a gunshot wound Goldberg says not being at full capacity even temporarily stings a little Ambulances dont bring the most serious cases here and when people walk in the door who might be suffering a heart attack or a stroke doctors and nurses stabilize them and send them to a fullservice facility For the moment Bellevue doesnt have an upstairs where it can send patients for surgery or keep them overnight for observation     To operate on patients house them overnight monitor them in the intensive care unit or deliver their babies hospitals need rocksolid electrical and fuel systems They need heating and cooling They need pumps to move water and fueland elevators to move peopleup and down the story complex All of these were lost for Bellevue in Superstorm Sandy Hundreds of people are working to restore the systems Belllevues chief engineer Patrick OBrien gave a tour of the basement where the problems started Flooding wrecked the water pump motors leaving the hospital no way to replenish four gallon rooftop towers that supply water to the complex Only one of the pumps has been restored just enough to get things going pending a longerterm solution Eventually a new system will place two pumps on the second floor presumably out of harms way from flooding The room with the fuel pump had a heavy steel and rubber submarine door so that even in the event of a flood the fuel pumps could still send oil up to the backup generators on the th floor and keep the hospital running But when Sandy came these pump motors also got soaked and failed Reconstruction is costing hundreds of millions of dollars and has proved to be a series of compromises between what can be done now and what will have to wait While some large systems are being moved out of the basement to higher ground others such as the air handlers that cool and heat the buildings will stay put  and could be damaged in the next storm At some point you have to just make priorities you just cant move every single thing its just not feasible OBrien says Bellevues reopening will be welcomed by nearby hospitals which have seen their emergency rooms slammed by seasonal flu New YorkPresbyterians CEO Dr Steven Corwin says Cornell is seeing twice the usual number of trauma patients in its ER putting a strain on the hospital during emergencies Take for instance a serious car accident You could be talking about  or  doctors allied health personnel in a trauma room to stabilize somebody to have multiple operations Corwin says So thats a big burden on an emergency system especially if youre getting routine visits and influenza visits as well State health inspectors visit Bellevue next week to test newly repaired systems Theyll declare whether Bellevue is ready to take in patients and keep them overnight If not then OBrien and others will need to keep working around the clock and the ER staff will keep dispatching patients to other hospitals
