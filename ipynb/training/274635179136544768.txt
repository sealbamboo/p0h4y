The World Health Organization   a new coronavirus has killed two people in Jordan  the third country where the novel microbe has been traced That brings labconfirmed cases to nine with five fatalities The latest cases are actually the oldest known so far They push the SARSlike viruss timeline three months back from the   involving a yearold man who died in Jedda Saudi Arabia last June Jordans cases were found through new testing of blood and tissue samples from patients in a cluster of pneumonias of unknown origin that occurred last April at a hospital in Zarqa near Jordans capital of Amman Until now known cases have occurred further south in Qatar and Saudi Arabia The Jordan cases are also significant because theyre part of an person cluster of pneumonia that involved seven nurses and a doctor Its unclear whether either of the two new SARSlike cases involved health care workers or whether the new coronavirus has been ruled out yet as the cause of the other pneumonias in that outbreak But whenever diseasetrackers see clusters of infection involving caregivers that raises their suspicion that a microbe has spread from person to person  most likely from patient to caregiver It doesnt have to mean that Health care workers and patients could have acquired the infection from a shared environmental source But if the new virus is able to spread from person to person even if inefficiently that raises the possibility it can become more mobile moving through human populations Even if the cases in Jordan were humantohuman spread  and we dont know that  it wasnt sustained WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl   The possibility of persontoperson spread is also suggested by a cluster of coronavirus pneumonias   on November  involving members of the same household in Riyadh Saudi Arabia Four men in that family fell ill with respiratory symptoms and two tested positive for the new coronavirus The two others one of whom died are considered probable cases No one thinks that the new coronavirus is as big a threat as its notorious cousin the one that precipitated the   in  that quickly spread around the world and killed  people For one thing health officials havent found any cases of the new coronavirus among the millions of pilgrims who attended this falls annual Hajj in Mecca near the place where the Saudi man died in June On the other hand nobody knows how big a problem the Arabian coronavirus may be  or even whether it is likely to be restricted to Arabia The WHO is   medical and public health workers around the world to investigate clusters of unexplained pneumonia for a possible link to the new virus It isnt calling for individual cases to be tested The agency is convinced that whatever the source of the virus is it is probably not unique to those countries science journalist Helen Branswell   in   Genetic testing suggests that the new virus is   But that doesnt necessarily mean all human cases had direct contact with bats There may be an intermediate carrier and victims might have eaten food contaminated with dust urine or feces from an infected animal At this point it appears that researchers will find more human cases of the new virus Each case or cluster of cases increases the chance that the source and mode of transmission will be found That effort will be accelerated by the development of a blood test for the virus which   may come in the next month or so Right now diagnosis relies on a geneamplification test called PCR which is cumbersome and sometimes hard to interpret And it cant tell if someone had been exposed to the virus in the past but recovered
