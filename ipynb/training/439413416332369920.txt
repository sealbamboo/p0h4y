A new patch could let people ditch needles and give themselves the flu vaccine  opening the possibility of getting your annual flu immunization in the mail instead of at the doctors office Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology developed the patch and found it works well when people give it to themselves People were able to use the device correctly with little instruction and said they liked it a whole lot better than a flu shot Our dream is that each year there would be flu vaccine patches available in stores or sent by mail for people to selfadminister said Mark Prausnitz a professor of biomolecular engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology People could take them home and apply them to the whole family We want to get more people vaccinated and we want to relieve health care professionals from the burden of giving these millions of vaccinations The patch is covered with an array of  tiny needles needles that barely penetrate the skin and this initial study was testing how people used the patch not how well it delivered vaccine But other research by the group suggests it may be even more effective than a flu shot The researchers think it not only would save money  most of the cost of a shot is paying a doctor nurse or pharmacist to deliver it  but it should also greatly increase the number of people getting flu shots Right now fewer than half of all Americans who should get a flu vaccine actually get one In this study  percent of people said theyd get a flu shot but  percent said theyd use a patchbased vaccine Rudy Garcia says he hates needles but he didnt mind the patch so much He is one of the  volunteers who tested it It actually feels better than having a needle go in he told NBC News Each volunteer tried pressing three patches into his or her own arm and a staffer applied a fourth None contained real vaccine Everyone also got a dummy shot of saline solution delivered via syringe People did a better job of using the patch when they used an applicator that made a clicking sound but most did well enough to be allowed to use the vaccine on their own the team reports in an upcoming issue of the journal Vaccine It was awesome said Christy White a yearold legal secretary who took part in the trial It did not hurt not at all Georgia Techs James Norman tried it on himself I found it to be less painful and the sensation passed by much more quickly than having a oneinch needle go in and out of your arm he said On a pain scale of  to  the volunteers gave the patch a  rating and they gave the needlebased injection a  The volunteers also answered questions about how the process went and whether theyd use a patch in real life Among those who intended to get vaccinated  percent said theyd prefer to put on a patch at home  percent said theyd like a healthcare worker to do it and  percent said theyd like to do it themselves with a healthcare worker present Twentyfour percent said theyd rather get a flu shot This means that  percent preferred microneedlepatch vaccination over shots and that  percent preferred selfvaccination over vaccination by a healthcare worker the researchers wrote If this holds for the population as a whole that would have a tremendous impact on preventing disease and the cost associated with both influenza and the vaccination process said Paula Frew an assistant professor in the Emory University School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study The researchers are working with a company to start tests with a real flu vaccine early next year We have a major vaccine manufacturer who will provide the vaccine but we are not free to disclose the company name yet Norman said Other studies from our group have shown the patch may be more effective than regular flu shots because the vaccine is delivered to the skin Norman added The skin is loaded with immune cells and while not all vaccines work well when given into the skin studies do suggest that flu vaccines can The patch could also be shipped and stored at room temperature unlike flu shots Its exciting to see how one device could help protect more people against flu and reduce costs at the same time Norman said I was thinking about kids If they could have their vaccines with this little patchy thing it would be great for the kids White said Public health officials Americans to get their annual flu vaccines and many agree that alternative vaccination methods may offer a way to help get more people to do it Garcia is one of the more than  percent of Americans who do not get a recommended flu shot every year Hes not sure hed get one just because it was delivered by patch and not as a shot but hed consider it If it were delivered I think being able to selfadminister it and not having to do a doctors office visit is nice said Garcia a Los Angelesbased insurance consultant I would send it to my kids agreed White Theyre always saying theyre not going to get the flu vaccine but maybe if I had it delivered to their homes they would do it Several groups are working on   and of course there are oral polio vaccines oral drops to protect against rotavirus and a nasal spray called FluMist for influenza
