Skipping breakfast to take a medical test is nobodys idea of fun And its one reason why many people never get around to having a cholesterol test So its good news that some doctors are now saying that for most people a nonfasting cholesterol test will do just fine But who gets to take a pass on the unpleasant skipyourbreakfast routine To find out Shots called   Shes a cardiologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School The bottom line If you dont already have   more than  milligrams per deciliter of blood and youre not diabetic forget the fast Enjoy your breakfast This seems so utterly different from what weve been told for so many years we had to know more Why diabetics Their triglycerides tend to be high Mora says And triglycerides are the blood lipids that shoot up after eating a fatty meal Still Mora says youd have to eat a really fatty meal to move the triglyceride level much Steak and french fries within a couple of hours of your test could do that she says For most people though triglycerides arent the most critical number In recent years cardiologists have shifted to looking at the ratio of different fats in the blood rather than the individual numbers anyway So for instance your doctor might want to know the relationship between    the highdensity lipoprotein thats the socalled good cholesterol That ratio tends not to shift very much even right after eating So some doctors have started questioning the need for the fasting cholesterol test which in most cases requires a morning visit to a blood lab after skipping food for  to  hours Black coffee thank goodness is usually allowed Still the deprivation and inconvenience can discourage people from getting their cholesterol tested and make it harder for doctors to follow up Some Canadian doctors decided to look at whether the fast makes a difference They analyzed lab records of more than  people who had cholesterol tests in Calgary last year The people had eaten anywhere from one hour to  hours before the blood test The relationship between total cholesterol and HDL changed very little based on fasting time the researchers found The levels of lowdensity lipoprotein or LDL the socalled bad cholesterol varied about  percent and triglycerides varied about  percent The findings   Monday in the   This is hardly the last word on cholesterol tests In the Calgary study most of the people had fasted for at least  hours and the nonfasting people were younger and healthier And although the   says either nonfasting or fasting tests will do most doctors still think of fasting tests as the gold standard Whys that We doctors like to have things standardized Mora says with a laugh But shes already started changing her practice telling patients they can eat or not as they please If they just have a piece of toast and a cup of coffee its not going to change their results Mora is unabashedly probreakfast she cowrote a   on the  s study arguing that point If theres a cholesterol test in your future talk with your doctor ahead of time about whether its OK in his or her book to eat before your blood gets drawn
