The pot industry isnt being cultivated with grow lights behind blackedout windows anymore Despite federal drugenforcement and tax laws that render it illegal  and hard to turn a profit as a mainstream business  the economics of pot are becoming closer to what one advocate dubs Big Marijuana Its been an industry for a long long time Its just been an underground industry said Jeffrey A Miron a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University Pot has a trade association and is planning its third annual lobbying day in Washington DC for this week signaling that the industry is growing up said Betty Aldworth deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association  The most interesting thing about whats happening to the marijuana marketplace right now is its moving from the underground to essentially being just any other commodity thats sold in a regulated market she said So youre going to see the same kind of business and political functions that happen with any other product And its not just the activists taking an interest Hedge funds and venture capitalists are starting to see the potential pot offers as a business opportunity in spite of occupying a legal gray area  Private equity and venture capitalists bring expertise raising money making money and lobbying for the interests of their business in the political arena said Ethan Nadelmann executive director of The Drug Policy Alliance More and more of the players are coming out of the hedge fund world the real estate world he said and applying the same skills theyve used to grow other industries This experiment in democracy thats taking place in Washington and Colorado is going to continue to evolve in other states its just a matter of time and waiting for the federal government and bureaucrats and politicians to catch up to the changing tide of American public opinion predicted Brendan Kennedy CEO of privateequity firm Privateer Holdings which focuses on the marijuana industry  Its a mainstream product and our investors see that and they also see its inevitable that it will be legalized and its inevitable that there will be a real industry Kennedy said There is a broader cultural shift under way Americans attitudes about marijuana are changing a survey published last month by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found For the first time a majority of Americans support legalizing pot Half of Baby Boomers and roughly twothirds of millennials say marijuana should be legalized and just under half of Americans say theyve tried it You do have a lot of people saying the genies out of the bottle despite what the federal government does said Chris Walsh editor of Medical Marijuana Business Daily  Professional investment capital means the industry can shed stoner stereotypes and tiedye clichs Kennedy said and start implementing quality standards cohesive marketing and branding strategies and industrywide leadership  Its still an industry thats remarkably young Kennedy said Pot is a fragmented decentralized business with very little standardization  not unexpected in a field where entrepreneurs can get their start palming baggies at music festivals  Former Microsoft executive Jamen Shively wants to turn pot into a national branded commodity in one fell swoop Last Thursday Shively held a news conference in Seattle accompanied by former Mexican President Vicente Fox to announce that he is raising  million in startup capital to build a chain of retail marijuana stores a down payment on what he said would be a  million investment in three years Yes we are Big Marijuana Shively said He outlined a plan to build a national brand of retail marijuana stores which would be supplied by regulated trade with Mexico  If Shively found pots illegal status to be a bit of a buzzkill he didnt show it We believe the writing is on the wall that marijuana will become legal in the entirety of the US in the next decade or so says the website of Shivelys firm Diego Pellicer  Shivelys announcement came two days after Colorados recreationaluse legislation officially became law As voters in more states pass referendums legalizing medicinal and less commonly recreational pot use states are interested in the revenue potential that could come from legalizing and taxing marijuana  A report published last month by the Colorado Futures Center at Colorado State University said recreational pot use in the state is a  million market that will generate  million in state tax dollars for fiscal year  In  Miron estimated that nationwide pot could generate  billion in federal and state tax money annually if it were taxed like other vice products such as alcohol and tobacco But he is skeptical that Big Marijuana is on the horizon in the immediate future I think a lot of people are putting the cart before the horse Miron said Its still an illegal commodity Starting a pot business even in states where its legal is an uphill battle Aldworth said sera tax code legislation prevents marijuana dispensaries even in states where they operate legally from being able to deduct many of the standard expenses other small businesses can And since banks or credit unions generally wont work with them pot businesses are cash operations without the access to financing sources other businesses take for granted Pot might have been the catalyst behind Harold and Kumars fateful trip to White Castle but when it comes to making pot as ubiquitous as fast food Its going to be a lot harder than some people make it sound Walsh said It will really depend how the federal government responds he said But even if early efforts like Shivelys fail to bear fruit Walsh said This is a good thing for the industry It attracts the interest of the investment community and it is starting the conversation he said People have been talking about a tipping point for years They could be right this time
