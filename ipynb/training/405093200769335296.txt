You dont need to be an expert in the regulations covering medical tests to know that the Food and Drug Administration has just about had it with Silicon Valleys   The agency told the seller of a personalized genomic test to knock it off in a sternly worded warning   The andMe spit kit and personal genome service or PGS are being marketed without FDAs blessing the letter says Therefore andMe must immediately discontinue marketing the PGS until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization for the device the agency concludes The   if your kids are at risk for a range of inherited health conditions your own genetic health risks and even how youre likely to respond to certain drugs That last claim really peeved FDA Peoples genes can affect how theyll respond to blood thinners and cancer drugs such as   But how accurate are the tests results And even if they are spot on what if someone taking one of the drugs stopped or adjusted the dose after looking at the test results and before consulting a doctor Changes like those pose a serious risk of injury or death the agency says andMe has filed paperwork with the FDA about the tests but evidently not enough to satisfy the agency And to make matters worse the FDA says it hasnt heard from the company since May What does the company say Spokeswoman Kendra Cassillo emailed Shots The company also   on Facebook And commenters quickly weighed in most of them in strong support of andMe Pathetic   The FDA has no right to tell me what I can learn about my own genetic information But   responded to Williams on Facebook Since  the FDAs letter says the agency has had more than  facetoface and teleconference meetings hundreds of email exchanges and dozens of written communications in which the agency has explained what it wanted and given andMe feedback on its work The final FDA gripes are about a bunch of new ads this year that expanded the companys marketing claims when there had been no progress on getting the old ones squared away Its pretty clear that in the FDAs view andMe has run out of time to show that its tests are up to snuff FDA is concerned about the public health consequences of inaccurate results the agency wrote and it wants to ensure that the tests work The company has  days to respond to FDAs letter
