Hard on the heels of the announcement of the devolution of NHS powers in Greater Manchester comes news of the first wave of   for the new care models programme heralded last October by Simon Stevens   These frontrunner sites are meant to lead the way for better integration of health and social care  There are three types of model MCPs multispecialty community providers concerned with moving specialist care out of hospitals and into the community PACs primary and acute care system with single organisations providing hospital GP and community services and enhanced health in care homes with no apparent acronym as yet but lets call it HICH These models are meant to offer more joinedup care health and rehabilitation services Some  million people could benefit from the first wave of transformation As Stevens noted in his forward view there is considerable consensus about what needs to change to improve care and health The traditional divide between primary care community services and hospitals  largely unaltered since the birth of the    is increasingly a barrier to the personalised and coordinated health services patients need Few would argue with this analysis but while the debate around integration is longstanding the focus on new care models actually moves things up a gear Successive governments over at least the last three or four decades have lamented the structural divisions between care and health  Recurrent attempts since the s to restructure the machinery of joint working to create new incentives and sometimes penalties for collaboration and to enable enhanced flexibilities for those eager to innovate all testify to the continued challenge of fragmentation  The conclusions from most research point to the importance of both structural and process factors but also underline the conclusion that too often collaboration and partnership have become ends in themselves rather than means to wider ends The   for example remarked in  It is difficult to identify the extent to which pooled funds and other joint financing arrangements have directly achieved better value for money or have made a tangible difference for service users  focus has tended to be on process rather than outcome The latest attempt to achieve better integration and to explore options through the new care models arguably starts from a different standpoint The central objective is not just closer working but better integration and coherence around the needs of the patient This is a qualitative shift in values and objectives  The test of the pilot schemes will be if they are able to achieve a better experience for patients and families Can they offer more integrated personalised care that enables people to achieve greater independence Are they able to avoid hospital admission where possible and timely discharge where not to have more treatment closer to home rather than visiting consultants in hospitals and to postpone or avoid permanent residential care Of course making better use of resources and achieving savings will also be priorities Many of the pilot schemes are developing in sites that are advanced in their quest for new models of working and there will be challenges  as with any innovation  in moving from the enthusiasts to mainstream working Criticisms are also being made by those who see the proliferation of new ways of working as incompatible with the concept of a national health service and who fear widening the postcode lottery by stealth It will be important to monitor the impact of the models and evaluate costs and benefits comprehensively  How for example are we to assess requirements around equity and universalism while recognising that a one size fits all model is unlikely to be personalised or flexible Whether it makes sense to consider options for health communities with similar characteristics remains to be proven  The timing of this development is not ideal With a general election around the corner there will be plenty of accusations of opportunism The support for the programme with a m transformation fund will be vital There will also be some major challenges  not least because the new models threaten wellestablished ways of working the relative autonomy of hospital consultants and operating with delegated budgets across local populations NHS England describes the new models as potentially offering the complete redesign of whole health and care systems  It would be tragic if this latest attempt goes the way of previous efforts and gets bogged down in structural reorganisation and administrative process It could achieve innovative models of support that integrate care and health seamlessly around the needs of patients  For the moment it is too soon to judge But a topdown centrally driven model of running the NHS must not be replaced by a new model dominated by clinicians and frontline staff We need one care system that enables genuine partnership with patients families and wider communities
