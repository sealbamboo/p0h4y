Low birth weight affects a childs risk of having an autism spectrum disorder ASD according to a study conducted by a Northwestern University researcher    After studying  pairs of twins that include one twin with an ASD Northwestern researcher Molly Losh learned that a weight difference of at least  percent or  grams made the smaller twin three times more likely to have an ASD    Losh directs Northwesterns Neurodevelopmental Disabilities Laboratory and teaches at Northwesterns School of Communication    The twins were born between  and  and are part of the Swedish Twin Registrys Child and Adolescent Twin Study which is directed by Paul Lichtenstein at Swedens Karolinska Institute The twins in Loshs study were the same sex but included both identical and fraternal pairs    This is the first study of its size that links low birth weight with the potential for autism said Losh Looking at twins is a good way to study autism because the unaffected twins serve as the controls    The causes of autism are complex but this study gives scientists one more clue said Losh We already knew the genetic link that you are more likely to have autism if you have a family history of it or have relatives that family members described as antisocial and aloof This study helps us narrow down the environmental factors But there are still a lot of unknowns    ASD is an umbrella term that includes developmental disabilities that can cause significant social communication and behavioral challenges according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Lack of social interaction is the common thread although severity ranges from mild to severe    The syndrome is an equalopportunity condition crossing racial ethnic and socioeconomic lines Its various forms are four times more common among boys than girls They affect  in  children the CDC said    Children diagnosed with an ASD are more common today but the CDC said scientists are not sure if that is due to better diagnoses or an increased rate of the disorders    Years ago said Losh parents were blamed for autism Mothers were called refrigerator moms because they were accused of being cold with their babies she said In fact I see just the opposite These parents are doing all they can to help these children    Loshs study will be published in a spring  issue of the journal Psychological Medicine
