As the flu season grinds on from news cycle to news cycle theres some flu news of a different sort Federal regulators have approved a nextgeneration type of flu vaccine for the second time in two months The two new vaccines are the first fruits of a   to hasten and simplify the laborious production of flu vaccines But alas theres no firm evidence that either the newfangled flu vaccine approved last November called   or the even newerfangled one the Food and Drug Administration greenlighted this week called   will be any more effective in preventing flu than ordinary vaccines This seasons conventional flu vaccine prevents illness   of the time among people who get it  certainly better odds than no vaccination but not great Protection is even poorer among people over  whose immune systems are weaker Flucelvax was the first approved flu vaccine to be made in cell culture rather than eggs In Flucelvaxs case the cells come from dog kidneys Flublok uses cells taken from the ovaries of   in the pupal stage to crank out its active ingredient  a piece of the flu viruss outer coat Conventional vaccines use the whole virus The advantage of this technology the   is that it offers the potential for faster startup of the vaccine manufacturing process Thats because the new vaccines dont require eggs to grow up its active ingredient For decades flu vaccines have been made this way The Flublok manufacturing process starts with the gene for   the protein that flu viruses carry on their coat and use to get inside human cells Hemagglutinin or HA is one of the shapeshifting proteins that require flu vaccine makers to tweak their product every year Once Fluboks maker isolates the HA gene from an emergent virus scientists insert it into another virus that infects only insects Then they use this   virus to infect billions of cells derived from the fall armyworm a wellstudied agricultural pest The infected worm cells obligingly churn out quantities of the desired HA protein which the manufacturer then purifies for insertion into that seasons vaccine Once you have the genetic code of HA within  days you can be in production   of   Flubloks developer tells Shots Thats roughly three months faster than a conventional flu vaccine she says The FDA says in studies involving  people Flublok was  percent effective against all circulating influenza strains in that season not just the particular strains against which the vaccine was matched Cox says no data are available yet on how well Flublok does against flu strains against which it is specifically targeted The new vaccine costs around  a dose somewhat above conventional vaccines But flu guru   says the vaunted matchiness yardstick might not matter Hes director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota Osterholm notes federal health officials claim that the current seasonal flu vaccine is an especially good match with the circulating viruses  yet its effectiveness is not significantly better than usual A match doesnt tell us how well a vaccine is going to work Osterholm tells Shots Its almost meaningless He says whats needed is a gamechanging vaccine that protects against the flu  or  percent of the time Thats scientifically feasible he maintains but it will take a billion dollars or more to develop and bring to market Meanwhile its probably safe to say that the new cellculture vaccines are no more effective than the current vaccines Fluloks fast turnaround time is absolutely a good thing Osterholm says Its better to have more of this vaccine faster when we really need it But is it a seachange Absolutely not Its incremental at best
