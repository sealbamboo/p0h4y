Wendy Williams used to love the McRib and she hid eating it She hid eating a lot of things and also engaged in unhealthful behaviors to try to combat her weight Thats all changed Now the syndicated talk show host embraces her body type and uses exercise and healthful eating to look great for the people who really matter herself and her husband And she doesnt hide her occasional indulgences any longer I spoke with her the day after Hurricane Sandy hit New York and she was having a natural disaster binge day sharing treats from the fridge with her family just in case the power went out and things spoiled Ive been battling weight since first grade My mother did things like give me mustard in my tuna fish instead of mayo and make sure the tuna was always packed in water because it had less fat in it I grew up in a house where my mother and father never had weight issues And my own parents called me fat My mother would bring cookies home for my brother and Id bribe him to give me some of them Once I got my drivers license I could go to McDonalds and eat a couple of McRibs and then go home for dinner and act like it never happened I took weightloss pills like Dexatrim or would take a fistful of laxatives And in my late s there was a couple of years when I made myself throw up after eating I really think that everything changed when I became a mother I weighed about  before I got pregnant and during the pregnancy gained  pounds because I was on bed rest After giving birth I realized that this just wasnt right for me The goal was to be a great example for my son and decide to get in the best shape I can ever be Also my husband is a gym rat He watches his weight My mentality now is that I only have one body and its been good to me in spite of some of the bad decisions Ive made I go to the gym at least two or three times a week and work out with my trainer Ann for an hour each time Its mostly about cardio and some yoga I do work with some weights but its all about my arms The upper arms start to fall like snow when you reach a certain age I work a lot with the elliptical machine because it does arms and legs at the same time And I can watch TV and talk to my trainer I need to be able to talk when Im exercising I went through a few trainers to find one that was a good psychological fit for me Prior to her they had all been men but Ann is also a mother and weve got lots of things in common to talk about We have a good rapport so the time goes really fast I try my best to eat clean There is nothing I dont eat pork beef chicken and fish Cheese is my kryptonite and I have to monitor it I like kale chips instead of potato chips and poured egg whites instead of full eggs I love sardines as long as you dont look at them because theyre so ugly Im a foodie And I drink a lot of water Another thing is that I get on the scale only when I go to see my endocrinologist Thats the only time I weigh myself My doctor has me on Levoxyl for my thyroid condition and taking vitamin D I also take Caltrate to keep my bones strong plus fish oil a multivitamin and B each day I want to keep myself together first and foremost for me I want to be viable and attractive And my husband is right on board with this My son is into working out too and playing basketball Really the three of us have a fitness lifestyle Now at  I have it under control Im not meant to be skinny but I can be healthy Im  foot  and weigh  and feel fit as a fiddle Im very comfortable with my height now and with who I am I own it I love myself best when I am naked when I get out of the shower because in my opinion I look good Being on TV is third or fourth on the list for looking good I want to be hot for me and for my husband I dont have unrealistic expectations
