Fruits and vegetables are unquestionably essential to a healthful diet But theres another side to some of these plants that thankfully most people never see the tiny amounts of toxins within them The minute amounts of poison found in many seeds leaves and roots are the result of the protracted arms race between plants and the animals that try to eat them Its the reason why youve never   a cashew the shells might make you break out in a poison ivystyle rash or eaten green potato fries read on for details Most of the time the human body manages to dispose of the toxins with minimal effort But every now and then an edible plant can be a problem The recently revisited case of Christopher McCandless the subject of Jon Krakauers bestseller   reminded us of this plant duality In  McCandless was found dead in the Alaskan wilderness Because he had so little fat left on his body the coroner concluded that hed died of starvation But the yearold may have died from eating the seeds of the wild potato   an edible plant As Krakauer   on   last month the plants seeds contain a neurotoxin that is harmless to healthy people but can cause paralysis in a nutrientstarved body like that of McCandless who was already lean and weak from months of trying to live off the land  Turns out people eat plants like that all the time Over the centuries humans have come to recognize the dangerous side of these dinner options and have often found safe preparation methods to get around them Odds are youve eaten them before without a second thought Heres a look at just a few commonly eaten plants that can sometimes turn their defenses on us Because its almost drought resistant the hardy grass pea   is   as a safety crop by subsistence farmers in places like India and Ethiopia But the proteinrich seed contains the same toxin ODAP found in the wild potato that McCandless ate Its harmless in small quantities especially if its been soaked in water for a long time But a steady diet of grass pea seeds over a threemonth period can cause a neurological disorder called lathyrism Thats what Jewish inmates of one Ukrainian concentration camp   The camps Nazi officers provided inmates with flour made from grass pea seeds It was death by bread Within months many became paralyzed in the lower body Like Chris McCandless the inmates were malnourished and physically exhausted  Generally in order to   lathyrism someone would have to eat grass peas for two or three months and the plant would have to compose at least a third of the total dietary intake But there is   in how much of the toxin one grass pea seed contains and also in how people are   There are good reasons why the FDA tells consumers not to   Potatoes are related to   While a white brown or even Peruvian purple potato is fine to eat the green patches and sprouting stems on a tater are not The green color comes from chlorophyll and indicates that the plant has been exposed to enough light and heat to get enzymes kicking that lead to the   of two toxic chemicals solanine and chaconine Cooking doesnt get rid of them Excessive heat will kill the enzyme that produces solanine but not the toxins themselves In  James B Matheney of Vandalia Ill had gathered about  to  pounds of potatoes to feed his family not realizing that many of them had turned green from being left out in the sun A week later his wife and daughter died A  issue of   magazine reported on the two fatal cases of potato poisoning  An average person would probably   about  pounds of fully green potato to get sick Cassava   is a major root crop for millions of subsistence farmers in subSaharan Africa According to the FAO after rice and maize its the   most important source of calories for people living in the tropics But wild species can contain   levels of toxins Cassava leaves make a chemical called linamarin which meanders down to the roots where it produces toxic hydrocyanic acid or cyanide when the root cells rupture In the human body linamarin can come in one end and go out the other intact but if it gets broken down during digestion and runs into the enzyme linamarase it will produce cyanide in the gut Counterintuitively the key to   cassava safely is to encourage the cyanide to form often by grating it into little bits and then soaking fermenting and evaporating the bad stuff out before cooking thoroughly Sweet cassava roots usually contain less cyanogen than bitter ones so they require less preparation  just peeling and thorough cooking tends to be enough For the more toxic breeds of cassava   can take days If its done wrong things can go badly as it did with three people   in Nigeria in  after eating a cassava tapioca More commonly repeatedly eating poorly processed cassava can cause a neuron disorder called    Most cassava tubers   between  and  mg of hydrogen cyanide per kilogram In the short term the human body is good at   cyanide But   that chronic ingestion of cooked cassava can over many years cause cyanide accumulation in blood plasma And its best not to munch on the raw root False morels also known as beefsteak mushrooms   grow in idyllic forest settings often underneath big pine trees and surrounded by mosses Theyre ugly things reminiscent of goopy brains The toadstools have a chemical in them that produces a toxic compound called monomethylhydrazine or MMH If youre trying to launch a rocket into space MMH is really useful  NASA likes to put it in its   because it ignites spontaneously when it runs into other propellant ingredients In the body the known carcinogen can   with neurotransmitters and can render the eater   Spain   the sale of these mushrooms for this reason but Nordic folk go wild over false morel   which is also a delicacy in Eastern Europe and the Great Lakes region of North America Chefs parboil the mushrooms repeatedly pouring off the water each time to get rid of the poison MMH is a cumulative toxin  its levels build up in the body after repeated consumption  so its hard to determine a lethal amount Theres a saying among mycologists There are old mushroom hunters and there are bold mushroom hunters but there are no old bold mushroom hunters Oxalic acid is great for   bleaching fabrics and sanitizing toilet bowls The acid also lurks in the leaves of rhubarb   the stalks of which often get paired with strawberry for a delicious pie The stalks are all good but steer clear of the   The oxalic acid in them leaches calcium from the blood As rumor goes the Brits   this during World War I when food shortages got people to be creative with recipes Across the pond at about the same time the   reported a   in  of a Mrs A in Montana who ate a lot of fried rhubarb leaves and died the next day after a horrible miscarriage and unstoppable nosebleeds and vomiting Oxalic acid content ranges wildly and can   on factors like the air temperature outside Your best bet Just dont eat those leaves To treat animals that have eaten them veterinarians can   to neutralize the acid a trick thats also suggested in a few rare   for human consumption
