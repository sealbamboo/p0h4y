If anyone can handle the stress of parenting in the teen years youd think it would be a high school teacher Thats how Amy Myers felt She teaches high school English in a suburb of Boise Idaho where she says she has pseudo parented about  teenagers who I have talked to given advice to guided directed even lectured about teenage issues she says So Myers  felt pretty prepared for her own childrens teenage years That is until her oldest son Kamron turned  Suddenly their close relationship turned sour Everything I demanded he fought back Advice He didnt need it Conversation He didnt want it It was hands down the toughest journey of my life so far and that is coming from someone who has raised two children alone from day one and has worked for and earned two degrees she says NPR recently conducted a   with our partners at the   and the   looking at the extent of stress in America We found that about onethird  percent of those who live with one or more teenagers said theyd had a great deal of stress in the past month Once we saw these results we wanted to know more about the stories behind these numbers So we put out a call on   Hundreds of parents wrote to us From Marion Iowa Ann Brendes  who has two sons  and  and a daughter  writes that its mindblowing how stressful having teenagers is JoAnn Zeise whos raising a yearold son and a yearold daughter says the stress she feels now is a lot different than what she felt when the kids were young Once I controlled the big decisions in their life says Zeise  who lives in Columbia SC Now they make decisions that can have drastic consequences I feel like I am running out of time to teach them the important lessons they need she writes And numerous parents wrote to us about the difficulties of teenage defiance When it comes to stress parenting a teen is inherently stressful even in the best scenarios according to   a clinical psychologist professor at Marywood University in Scranton Pa and creator of the blog   He says it essentially boils down to a teenagers quest for independence And that is understandably stressful for parents who used to be driving the bus he says Now he says theres someone in the back seat saying or yelling No dont put the blinker on here take that exit what are you thinking This constant questioning and challenging can be stressful for parents of course but Palmiter says its actually a healthy part of growing up and it often means parents are doing everything right Amy Myers son Kamron is  now and headed off to college But the past three years she says have been extremely stressful for a number of reasons She worried about his driving about parties about alcohol and drugs And there were many late nights for Myers because like many parents she just couldnt fall asleep until she knew Kamron was safely home And like JoAnn Zeise her biggest worries even now continue to be about her childs future Shes scared that Kamron might make a mistake that just cant be repaired I love this child more than I love myself and I know whats around the corner and Im trying to tell him and hes just ignoring me and I really cant say or do anything about it I just have to let him experience it and hope and pray that its not a lifechanging mistake Myers says Many psychologists say the best parents can do is making sure they have instilled positive values in their children and then just hope for the best As for dealing with their own stress Palmiter suggests parents seek support from other parents not just about their concerns but also about decisions He also promotes special one on one time with your teenager This means being there completely cellphone unplugged talking with your teen or observing them do an activity they enjoy like drawing shooting basketball or playing an instrument Just one hour a week of this special time can repair major differences Palmiter says and bring muchneeded calm to households with teens
