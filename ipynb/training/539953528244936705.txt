Hundreds of thousands more babies could be born outside hospital each year under new NHS guidelines for England and Wales The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE said home births and midwifeled centres were better for mothers and often as safe for babies The advisory body said it was important to offer women the options The Royal College of Midwives said more midwifeled units were needed to offer all motherstobe this range of choice About  babies are born each year in England and Wales nine out of  in doctorled obstetric units in hospital However the new guidelines state  of women are at extremely low risk of complications and may be better off giving birth elsewhere  NICE specifically advises England and Wales but its recommendations are often picked up by Scotland and Northern Ireland It said women should be offered the choice of a home birth an obstetric unit in hospital a midwifery unit next to a hospital or a midwifery unit in the community In all circumstances there should be one midwife per woman in labour it added For those having their first child the number giving birth with no medical interventions was higher for home births and in midwifeled units than in hospital But there was a higher risk of serious medical problems for the baby including stillbirth for home births In women who already had at least one child again there were fewer medical interventions outside hospital And there was no difference in the number of medical problems in the baby between the different settings It is not entirely clear why there are high rates of interventions in hospital It is thought to be a combination of women being more comfortable in a familiar environment and with midwives they have met before There is also concern some doctors might be too keen to use clinical interventions  Susan Bewley professor of complex obstetrics at Kings College London and part of the team that developed the guidelines said Midwiferyled settings have better outcomes for mothers than the traditional obstetric units and labour wards They may be particularly suitable for all women because the rates of intervention are lower   However she stressed the emphasis was on choice There isnt a onesizefitsall model for all women and thats why a range of settings providing different support for women with different needs gives you better safety overall she added The guidelines apply only to women at low risk of complications  factors that raise the risk include Cathy Warwick chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives told the BBC News website that she welcomed the guidelines  as do the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists  She said The evidence shows that if women dont have any complications in their pregnancies theyll have better outcomes if they are able to make these choices She said there would have to be significant changes in the way the NHS provided maternity care   There are about  midwifeled units based on hospital sites and a further  located elsewhere  What the NHS needs to do is provide the facilities outside of hospitals that will allow about  of women expecting babies to plan their birth in different facilities she added We need more midwiferyled units then we may find that we dont need so many obstetric units  But Lucy Jolin of the Birth Trauma Association told BBC Radio s Today programme it was not always safe for women to give birth outside hospital  She said Things can go wrong very easily and we do feel this advice could be dangerous
