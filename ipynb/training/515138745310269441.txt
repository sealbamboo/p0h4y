The research suggests that people who feel they are forgetting more things may need to be concerned even if bigger issues arent yet showing up on cognitive tests Participants who reported memory problems at the beginning of the study were more likely to have dementia down the road than those who did not Now we have more evidence that this is something we should watch from appointment to appointment Loepfe said There is no blood test or definitive way to diagnose Alzheimers at least not when the patient is alive An autopsy can provide a diagnosis because the brain of someone with dementia has physical signs of the disease But of course that test comes too late for any kind of prevention Doctors rely on  a battery of memory tests to diagnose dementia The tests are simple exercises that ask patients to name animals or verify where they live The method is a good way to measure memory over time but it has its limits especially in early stages of the disease This new study suggests doctors should pay closer attention to selfreported memory complaints from their older patients Researchers watched  people over  years at the University of Kentucky The participants were considered cognitively intact when they were enrolled Each year scientists asked them if they felt any changes in their memory since their last visit to the doctors office They did autopsies on participants who died to see if their brains showed physical signs of dementia More than half the people enrolled in the study  reported some memory complaints Scientists found that those who reported struggling to remember things were more likely to have dementia down the road than those who did not report memory troubles Mild cognitive impairment on average happened about  years after participants first noticed a problem  People who smoked developed memory problems sooner than nonsmokers Women who took hormone replacement therapy staved off dementia longer   Other studies looking at selfreported memory complaints have shown similar results What surprised the studys lead author   was how long someone felt they had memory problems before they were  diagnosed with dementia Not everyone who has memory complaints ends up with impairment Kryscio said But if we can get some hints that there is something going on here and treat people early on there may be some hope for prevention  Right now we are catching this in the midstage or when people already have Alzheimers and we dont have a lot of tools in our arsenal yet to help you We have to find a way to get out there in front of the disease  who specializes in geriatric psychiatry in the Crozer Keystone Health System and has written studies about risk factors and prevention methods for Alzheimers and dementia said this study shows it can be a decade before serious memory problems start There is something you can do about it to minimize your risk factors Steinberg said  Research has shown that people who exercise eat a proper diet people who stay mentally engaged and people who manage their diabetes or high blood pressure can keep some dementia at bay   In her research Steinberg has seen people who have three or more drinks a day also eventually have problems with their memory People with depression anxiety and stress can also struggle with memory problems so can people with a poor quality of life or people who dwell on their past rather than making goals for the future   There is a whole long list of things you can do to decrease your risk that these memory complaints can turn into something more serious Steinberg said What people should take away from this study is it is never too late to change your behavior to be healthier in the long run
