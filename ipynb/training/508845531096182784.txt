After a routine test of her blood sugar eight years ago Randi Sue Baker a seriously overweight yearold learned that   was bearing down With that test result she joined the  million Americans over the age of  who have prediabetes Up to  percent of them will go on to develop   but  percent dont even know they are at risk In fact as many as  percent of adults with fullblown diabetes dont know they have it according to Edward W Gregg a senior epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Ms Baker who lives in Brooklyn considers herself lucky to have been forewarned She realized that while she was still relatively healthy she could make a concerted effort to stay that way For the last several years she has kept track of her caloric intake the kinds and amounts of the   she eats and the overall healthfulness of her diet She exercises five days a week walking for  minutes and then swimming for an hour at the local Y She is down  pounds from her top weight Ms Baker also daily monitors her blood sugar or glucose level and takes a drug called metformin to help keep it within a normal range Periodically her doctor checks her blood level of     another indicator of diabetes to be sure it hasnt risen Could Ms Baker do more If she were willing to undergo bariatric surgery perhaps The operation has risks but has been shown to cure diabetes in about a third of patients But what Ms Baker already is doing to keep diabetes at bay is far more than most people who are likely to develop it do Diabetes is now an outofcontrol epidemic responsible for a devastating toll in health lives and medical care costs In  the condition accounted for  billion in health care expenses about one in five health care dollars Among its serious complications are heart disease stroke   nerve damage eye disease which can lead to   foot damage which can lead to amputations and   Diabetes is the No  cause of blindness   and amputations Dr Elizabeth Seaquist an endocrinologist and diabetes expert at the University of Minnesota said in an interview The condition even has been linked to   including   The two primary causes of Type  diabetes    and inactivity  have thus far resisted countless efforts to reverse or prevent them National data from  to  show that about   an increase of up to  percent since the late s Dr Gregg and his colleagues recently reported If this tsunami continues to roll forward experts predict that by  the number of adults with diabetes   The risk of developing diabetes rises with age Currently about one in four Americans ages  and older has diabetes and the number will grow as the population ages In theory it is possible to avert the impending health crisis Because complications typically take  years to become apparent identifying people at risk of diabetes early and taking corrective action could delay onset of the disease and its devastating consequences perhaps for the rest of their lives The American Diabetes Association has created a simple sevenquestion test to help people assess their risk a paper copy can be found at   Important factors include a family history of the disease prior   being overweight or obese physical inactivity and older age A dozen years ago in its journal Diabetes Care the association   growing evidence that at glucose levels above normal but below the threshold diagnostic for diabetes there is a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death A person with prediabetes has a blood glucose level higher than normal but not yet in the range of diabetes While not everyone with the condition will progress to fullblown diabetes over time prediabetes can cause much the same underlying damage to body tissues and organs The trouble starts even before glucose levels begin rising when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin the pancreatic hormone that regulates how much glucose circulates freely in blood Insulins main job is to move glucose from the blood into cells to be used for energy or stored for future needs Insulin resistance the portend of prediabetes prompts the beta cells of the pancreas to produce more and more of this hormone to keep blood glucose levels normal Gradually pancreatic cells wear out setting the stage for rising blood glucose prediabetes and diabetes The risk of developing diabetes is highest among AfricanAmericans Hispanics and Native Americans but no ethnic or racial group is spared While excess weight is the leading risk factor even people of normal weight can develop the disease if they carry too much fat in their abdomen Socalled central obesity may explain why the Japanese and others of Asian descent often develop diabetes at weights well below the range of obesity Dr Seaquist said She called prediabetes a wakeup call and emphasized that modest weight loss can help You dont have to lose  pounds to prevent diabetes A loss of  percent to  percent of body weight can be effective Nor do you have to become an   fanatic Moderate activity  minutes a day five or more days a week is helpful and can even be broken up into minute segments Dr Seaquist said More is better but its a place to start She also offered advice for Americans in general Probably we all should consider ourselves at risk We eat too much more than we need and thats not healthy even if we dont get diabetes We should be avoiding drinks that are high in calories she added They make it too hard to regulate food intake Drinking water is safest all around  its natural and organic Â
