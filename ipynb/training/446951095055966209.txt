People often blame food additives like dyes preservatives emulsifiers and flavor enhancers for chronic hives and other skin eruptions But a new randomized trial shows that they are almost surely wrong Over     years researchers conducted   tests in which patients ingest a suspect food and wait for a reaction on  people who had been suffering from skin irritations with no known cause for six weeks or longer  what doctors call chronic urticaria They tested  of the additives most commonly implicated in allergic reactions including aspartame monosodium glutamate yellow dye No  nitrites and nitrates Fortythree of the patients said they had had allergic reactions to such additives In singleblinded tests in which the doctor knew what substance was being tested but the patient did not two patients developed a skin reaction But neither had a reaction in a subsequent doubleblinded test in which neither doctors nor patients knew what substance was being tested  No other patients had responses to any of the  additives and there were no gastrointestinal respiratory or other symptoms The    If you have chronic urticaria you dont need to avoid certain foods because of food additives said the lead author Dr Jessica P Rajan of the Scripps Clinic in San Diego Those things are unlikely to cause exacerbation
