Its not easy being a wonder vitamin these days Just when it looks like youre the solution to every health problem some doctors come along and burst your bubble Now its happening to vitamin D The supplement has been widely promoted to prevent   and fight a host of other ills But recent studies havent found much benefit for bones or for general health This latest review looks at    involving more than  people to study vitamin Ds effect on bones Vitamin D which is converted into a hormone by the body makes it easier for us absorb calcium in the intestines So its easy to presume that more D would lead to stronger bones But this review found that for middleaged people taking vitamin D supplements for two years didnt affect bone mineral density in the spine hip arm bone and skeleton overall They did find increased bone density in the neck of the femur bone where it often breaks in the elderly The review also found no relation between bone density and taking calcium supplements peoples overall vitamin D levels length of treatment or age The conclusion Continuing widespread use of vitamin D for osteoporosis prevention in communitydwelling adults without specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency seems to be inappropriate the researchers wrote The   was published online in   It could be that bone mineral density in middleaged women is a poor predictor of who will eventually have osteoporosis according to an accompanying   by   an osteoporosis researcher at the Maine Medical Institute But two other recent analyses also found that vitamin D didnt help prevent fractures Or it could be that vitamin D and calcium need to be taken together and that they help only when a person is really low on either or both Recent research on vitamin Ds role suggests that as long as theres enough calcium circulating in the body adding D doesnt send more calcium to the bones Its only when someones lacking circulating calcium from food or supplements that the body steals it from the bones That finding Rosen writes suggests that supplementing both vitamin D and calcium could help prevent hip fractures in the elderly but probably doesnt build up bones in healthy middleaged people Thats pretty much the tack taken by the Institute of Medicine In  the independent body which sets federal guidelines for dietary intake   that children and adults need  international units of vitamin D daily People over age  need  IU the institute recommended The body makes its own vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight Some foods  notably fatty fish  contain vitamin D and others like milk are routinely fortified with D But advocates of highdose vitamin D say that taking high doses of supplemental D   to  IU a day  can prevent cancer heart disease and other chronic diseases The Institute of Medicine said theres no evidence thats true The panel also found no evidence of widespread vitamin D deficiency in Americans The US Preventive Services Task Force an independent group that advises the government on evidencebased medical treatments is looking into the broader health effects of vitamin D supplements so stay tuned Earlier this year the task force said that theres no evidence that taking   and up to  IU of vitamin D daily protect bones in healthy people That recommendation didnt apply to people who already have osteoporosis or people over  who are at risk of falls
