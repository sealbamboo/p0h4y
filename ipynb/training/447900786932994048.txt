Major pharmaceutical companies are racing to launch breakthrough drugs in the next 18 months to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer..  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Roche Holding AG and Merck & Co. each are working on a potential blockbuster "immunotherapy" drug that would use the body's immune system to fight the cancer. If approved, the three drugs could be launched between late 2014 and late 2015. AstraZeneca PLC has an earlier-stage candidate in development.
