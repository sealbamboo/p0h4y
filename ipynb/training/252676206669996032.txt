Do you bite your nails For  years I did We nail biters can be pathological groomers  people for whom normal grooming behaviors like skin picking or hair pulling have become virtually uncontrollable But psychiatry is changing the way it thinks about pathological grooming and these changes will be reflected in the American Psychiatric Associations   short for   A   is coming out early next year and it puts pathological grooming in the same category as another disorder youve probably heard of   or OCD This rethinking gives pathological groomers some new ways to think about those behaviors I can tell you the exact moment I became a nail biter I was  years old watching my mom get dressed for work She paused to mull something over chewing on a nail My reaction How cool How grownup I think Ill try it I never stopped It was embarrassing  like wearing your neuroses on your sleeve At parties I learned to wrap my fingers all the way around my wine glass so that my nails faced my chest I hated filling out forms in public places Recently something happened that made me finally quit biting my nails Ill get to that in a bit But I was feeling quite pleased with myself when I showed them to   a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco Your cuticles are pushed back Its not bad Looks like youre a recovered nail biter is what Id say she pointed out Mathews specializes in pathological grooming  a group of behaviors that includes nail biting hair pulling called   and skin picking known as   They are behaviors that stem from normal grooming  the kind of thing that most animals do and is evolutionarily adaptive right says Mathews But in pathological groomers those behaviors go haywire Instead of being triggered by say a hangnail the pathological nail biter is triggered by driving reading or feeling stressed out After a while the behavior becomes untriggered says Mathews It becomes just an automatic behavior that has no relationship to external stimuli at all Until recently the DSM treated pathological grooming a bit like an afterthought and put it in a catchall category called not otherwise classified But the new DSM   to lump together pathological groomers and those with mental disorders like OCD That includes people who wash their hands compulsively or have to line up their shoes a certain way These behaviors have a lot in common In both cases its taking a behavior thats normal and healthy and putting it into overdrive doing it to the point of being excessive But in at least one way OCD and pathological grooming are also very different In OCD the compulsion is really unwanted says Mathews People with OCD   to be washing their hands or checking the stove over and over again There is no fun in it Theres fear  fear that if they dont do something something else thats very bad will happen to them But from her pathological grooming patients Mathews hears a very different story They enjoy it Its rewarding It feels good When you get the right nail it feels good Its kind of a funny sense of reward but its a reward she says I can relate to that And in my household Im not the only one My daughter Cora is  and shes why I decided to quit I didnt want Cora to learn to bite from me the same way I learned from my mom So for three months I wore acrylic fingernails and spent many long hours at the manicurist maintaining them And it worked I lost the urge But apparently it was too late I dont want to put my fingers in my mouth I just do it even though I dont want to Cora explained to me But was she just mimicking me or was there something else going on  something deep and strong enough to make nail biters out of at least four generations of women in my family including my grandmother Thats where   a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York comes in A few years ago a colleague came to Lee with a mystery A mouse  bred with a specific gene mutation  was behaving very oddly I was dumbstruck recalls Lee It was just repetitively moving its front paws over its eyes and ears  a behavior he instantly recognized from studying people Mice bred with this mutation groom so much they give themselves bald spots Theyve removed the hair around their eyes they actually look like they have little white rings around their eyes says Lee In these mice the genome is destiny Every mouse that has this particular mutation  even if its separated from its mother early on  eventually will become a pathological groomer And the grooming isnt all Lee says these are some of the most anxious mice hes ever seen He even said to his colleague at the time That is one crazy mouse People of course are a lot more complicated There are some genetic mutations that seem to crop up in people with OCD and in people who groom pathologically But just because you have the mutation doesnt mean you get the behavior In fact with OCD its more likely you wont says Mathews As genetically determined as OCD is the risk to a family member for someone who has OCD is only  percent So its  percent chance of not getting it she says Which brings me back to my own crazy mouse As a parent there are ways I could lower the chances that Cora will grow into a biter When Mathews works with young kids she does things like put BandAids on their fingers to help them notice when theyre biting or pulling Then she sets up reward systems to try to steer them away from the behavior Id already started to do a clumsier version of this gently batting Coras hand away from her mouth whenever she started to bite But it had come at a price one I wasnt entirely comfortable with I had to decide what was worse making Cora feel bad about herself for something she couldnt help or just letting her grow into a nail biter which while certainly not the worst thing in the world had given me some grief  a psychiatrist in San Francisco who specializes in anxiety disorders seemed to offer a third option She bites her nails and like me she has a yearold daughter Foose has a whole different take on it  probably a much better one Nail biting is just part of who she is Shes even proud of it You know my mom bites her nails She was an artist So I think I associate it with being cool and being older and working on something important she says During her residency Foose met a patient at the ER one night A lovely middleaged mother of several kids who came in and looked scared out of her wits she recalls This woman had become fixated on a perceived blemish on her face She had picked at her cheek to a level where she was bleeding profusely says Foose It was   to be specific She truly could not control herself despite the pain that it was causing despite the disfigurement And nail biting sort of forever fell off my radar says Foose Nail biting is not life threatening On the scale of human failings it barely lifts the needle Its not to say Cora wouldnt be better off not biting her nails But says Foose there may be a better way to talk about it Just as Foose had removed the stigma and guilt for herself maybe I could do that for my daughter You can go to the place of giving kids information Like Oh I see you biting your nails Mommy bites her nails too You know why we shouldnt bite our nails Because there are germs that live under our nails  explains Foose A way that frames it in other words as a choice One thats hers to make  even if it takes having her own kids one day to make it
