Bacon and bologna are hardly health food But a huge new study offers the strongest evidence yet that eating processed meat boosts the risk of the two big killers cancer and heart disease A multinational group of scientists tracked the health and eating habits of baconloving Brits wurstmunching Germans  aficionados in Spain as well as residents of seven other European countries  almost a halfmillion people in all They found that people who ate a lot of processed meats  more than  grams a day the equivalent of one thin strip of bacon  were much more likely to die of heart attacks and stroke and also had a higher cancer risk The more processed meats they ate the greater the risk Thats not a huge surprise Processed meats are notoriously high in fat which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke And this study squares with others on the risks of processed meats including one    that found that people who ate one serving of processed meat a day increased their risk of death from cancer and heart disease by  percent while people who ate red meat once a day increased their risk by  percent compared with people who ate very little meat The new European study didnt find the same risk from red meat which is a bit of a surprise Study leader   a professor of epidemiology at the University of Zurich said that may be because the salt smoke and nitrate used to preserve meats can increase the risk of cancers The study followed its many participants from the s to the s It was   Wednesday in the journal   It could also be that sausages and other preserved meats can have amazingly high amounts of fat  some salamis are  percent fat But its not just about salty fatty meat its about lifestyle too People in the study who ate sausages and ham tended to eat less fruits and vegetables and they also were more likely to smoke drink alcohol and skip exercise The researchers tried to account for that but say they might not have captured every nuance in diet differences between highmeat and lowmeat consumers If you need more proof this follows hot on the heels of a   that found that the Mediterranean diet  lots of olive oil nuts fish and veggies and very little red meat  reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke OK OK we got the message Does this mean renouncing the joys of bacon and eggs or bangers and mash Rohrmann is sympathetic My recommendation is to limit meat intake in particular processed meat intake she told The Salt via email However we know that meat is rich in some vitamins and minerals and thus my recommendation is to limit the total amount of meat to about  to  grams a week Thats a little over a pound at the upper limit And what about bacon that lovely salty fatty substance thats been dubbed   Id say its fine to eat bacon and sausages says Rohrmann but not in high amounts and not every day
