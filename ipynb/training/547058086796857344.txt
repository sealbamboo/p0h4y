After months of anticipation, the hepatitis C price wars are finally getting under way. As of today, Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the U.S., is making the newly approved treatment from AbbVie its exclusive option for patients with the most prevalent form of the chronic disease, which is known as genotype 1. This covers about 75% of the estimated 3.2 million Americans who are infected.. The decision will quickly change the calculus for one of the most closely watched markets in the pharmaceutical industry, since other payers will now look for similar deals. Some Wall Street analysts expect worldwide sales of hepatitis C treatments, led by a pair of medications sold by Gilead Sciences, to reach as much as $20 billion in revenue next year thanks to pent-up demand for new treatments.
