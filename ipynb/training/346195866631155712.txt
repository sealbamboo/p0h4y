If theres one word we might use to describe modern fatherhood it would be busy In an average week modern dads are spending nearly triple the time on direct child care and more than double the time on housework than their fathers or grandfathers did in the s according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau data on how Americans spend their time  Theyre no slouches at the home office farm or factory either If they are employed chances are they are putting in more than  hours at work too Fathers are much more involved today in their childrens lives than they were five decades ago said Wendy Wang a research associate at Pew Research Center who coauthored the   The shift has come as more moms have started working but that doesnt mean dads feel like they are obligated to take on more childrearing duties  Instead Fred Van Deusen senior research associate at the Boston College Center for Work and Family said his research has shown that many dads want very much to be involved in their kids lives Theyd like to spend more time with their kids but they also feel the pressure to succeed at work Theres still a lot of societal pressure on dads to be breadwinners Van Deusen said The Pew analysis found that in an average week in  dads with children under  in the home spent  hours a week on direct child care which would include things like changing diapers to helping with homework That compares to  hours on average in  Meanwhile they spent an average of  hours a week on housework in  up from about four hours a week in   Dads also worked an average of  hours a week in  compared with around  hours in   Wang said the drop is mainly coming from a decline in the number of dads who were working as compared to  because of the weak job market and other factors Employed dads worked  hours a week on average in  down slightly from  hours in  Taken together dads on average are now spending about five hours more per week on child care housework and paid work than they did in the s Nevertheless moms still are doing much more child care and housework than dads and dads are still doing much more paid work than moms There is still a significant gap  even though we see the roles of moms and dads are converging Wang said All this comes as no surprise to Carl Poff Poff  jokes that he has about  minutes of free time a day  which would be his roundtrip commute to and from his job as a corrections officer One recent afternoon he finished up his shift at the jail and immediately hopped in his car to go pick up his yearold stepdaughter from the bus stop From there it was off to his inlaws to gather his yearold daughter followed by a quick stop at the grocery store before getting homework done making dinner and getting the girls to Tball  His wife typically gets home between  pm and  pm after a day that includes at least two hours commuting to and from her job at the corporate offices of a major telecommunications company Together they have dinner and get some quality time with the kids before they go to bed  After the kids are asleep the Easton Pa couple turns to other chores like dishes and laundry  Its just how our schedule works Carl Poff said His wife Jennifer  said the household wouldnt function if they didnt have a partnership in which Carl regularly did things like laundry making lunches and ferrying the kids to sports practices  Its just part of him being a dad Thats what he does she said Still Jennifer said her husbands daily involvement still seems unusual in their neighborhood where other moms often compliment her for finding such a helpful husband   A lot of dads dont do that and I like absolutely love him for it she said Chances are Jennifer also is busier than moms were in  In an average week in  modern moms spent more time on child care than they did in   hours a week on average compared with about  hours a week in  Modern moms also spent about  hours a week at paid work on average up from about eight hours a week in  But the amount of time moms spent on housework fell by nearly half from an average of  hours per week in  to  hours per week in  Even as dads are taking on more responsibility around the house Van Deusen the Boston College researcher said societal expectations about mom and dads roles have been slow to change That could explain why even now relatively few dads stay home full time There were about  stayathome dads to kids under age  in  according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau That compares with more than  million stayathome moms with kids under  Van Deusen who has   said many couples decide the husband should stay home because he makes less money and were happy with the arrangement   It turned out it was working pretty well for them but the people around them had a lot more difficulties than they did Van Deusen said
