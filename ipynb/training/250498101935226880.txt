Sara Terrys first clue that something was wrong with her son Christian came just three weeks after he was born We went to check on him just like any parents go and check on their kids just to make sure theyre breathing says Terry  of Spring Texas And we found him in his crib and he wasnt breathing He was blue She and her husband were horrified They rushed Christian to the hospital and learned he had several medical problems That terrifying night was the beginning of a long frustrating odyssey For the next six years Sara Terry and her husband went from doctor to doctor trying to figure out what was behind Christians strange constellation of problems developmental delay low muscle tone sleep apnea and a heart murmur among others The Terrys got every test every specialist could think of but no one could answer the big question Whats wrong with Christian With a child who goes undiagnosed you dont know how to treat it and you dont know maybe what their life expectancy is or what you can expect from this child Terry says Or how you could push them or what you can do with them So it can be very difficult And you dont know if youre doing everything you can for them The Terrys finally ended up at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston A doctor there told them about something theyd never heard of whole genome sequencing which can test for every genetic syndrome thats known The Terrys agreed and sent off their sons sample for testing  and waited Until recently genetic tests only scanned small parts of someones DNA such as the parts carrying genes that can cause Huntingtons or Alzheimers or breast cancer Whole genome sequencing spells out the entire genetic code  all  billion letters For those of us in the field it is sort of a holy grail says   who chairs Baylors genetics department We now have the ability to get very complete genetic information about individuals and interpret in the context of whatever problems they may have It wasnt all that long ago that it took hundreds of scientists years and billions of dollars to do this on just one genome But now a few lab techs using highspeed sequencers   anyones DNA for just thousands of dollars in weeks To me its a spectacular advance Beaudet says It changes everything in the sense that we really begin to understand at an individual patient level exactly which gene is altered and we can begin to think about ways to intervene So far doctors are using sequencing mostly on two kinds of patients The first are patients like Christian with mysterious illnesses no one can seem to sort out Any patient who has one of these rare diseases will tell you about the misery and the agony of this process which is going from doctor to doctor undergoing test after test after test and getting equivocal answers to whats wrong with them or their child says   of the National Human Genome Research Institute This process can take months or years of a patients life says Biesecker And sometimes at the end of that odyssey you still dont have an answer And its a miserable process for patients to go through The second big group of patients getting sequenced includes cancer patients like Jamie Zweig Hes been fighting esophageal cancer for more than two years Doctors at the Mayo Clinic sequenced his cancer to see if they could target treatment at the precise genetic mutations that caused his tumors They discovered that his cancer was vulnerable to a drug normally used to treat breast cancer I feel much more on the track of beating this disease than being subject to the disease Zweig says This is all very new but its becoming more and more common Physicians now want to use sequence in the same way that they had used Xrays MRI and CAT scan says Jonathan Rothberg of   which makes highspeed sequencers They want to use it as a normal part of the practice of treating cancer patients But there are lots of issues that need to be worked out before whole genome sequencing starts being used a lot many experts say Well have to worry when youre sequencing a kid with an unknown syndrome and also checking the parents to see what he inherited from which of his parents says   a bioethicist at Stanford University That can be really medically useful but we have to worry about How accurate is the sequencing How good is our interpretation And how well are we conveying an accurate message to the patients Its far from clear how often it will yield truly definitive useful information The danger is scary but vague results will send patients down long frightening dead ends filled with lots of tests and useless treatments that themselves could be dangerous and expensive Another fear What if doctors stumble across something they werent even looking for After all when a child is sequenced it reveals a lot about their parents genes too So another question is Should we even be looking for other stuff A huge question in front of the genetics community right now is If you do sequencing for one purpose what is your obligation to look and to report on findings elsewhere in the genome says   an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School While the experts try to sort all that out whole genome sequencing is helping to save lives and providing more patients with answers theyve been seeking  often for years Terry remembers the day doctors called to tell her the results of sequencing Christian I was just kind of speechless And I just kind of sat there for a little while thinking Am I dreaming Like did I really just get a phone call We were just so happy to have a diagnosis and to know that theyd found what we had been searching for all these years Terry says Doctors discovered Christian has something rare called a Noonan syndromelike condition Christian is now  years old Theres no miracle drug that will cure him But his mother says the diagnosis helps in lots of ways Doctors know they can safely give him shots to help him grow better The Terrys know he wont suddenly develop a fatal complication And they now know that its not something thats likely to affect any kids they might have in the future This has made such a huge difference in our lives she says I cant even tell you We are just so relieved
