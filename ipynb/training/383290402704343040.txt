Burger King has announced a new addition to their French fry lineup called Satisfries By trimming  percent of the calories and  percent of the fat from regular fries this potato makeover provides the same taste and flavor as the higherfat regular fry with a bit of a health boost This new realitybased approach to fastfood choices is a step in the right direction for consumers Despite health recommendations to limit or skip fast food millions of people eat in these restaurants every day And one out of two consumers add French fries to their order The new Satisfries can be a good choice for consumers  but only if the serving size is controlled That is the main health advantage for those looking for fries Supersizing because the calories and fat are lower than the standard fry is a big health negative So is mistakenly bartering for a highercalorie item as part of the meal because of the calorie and fat savings in the fries  Because food selection is based primarily on taste  and not nutrient content  these fries need to taste like the originals And Burger King spent nearly  years developing this product The concept sounds simple enough develop a different batter coating for the French fries that absorbs less oil when the potatoes are in the fryer Remember these are not NOcalorie fries  they are just a healthier version A small order of Satisfries still has  calories and  grams of fat thats compared to  calories and  grams of fat in a small order of regular fries A difference of  calories And the advertised calorie serving size Thats the miniversion about  ounces found in a kids meal What about the taste Many consumers cant tell the difference which is good news to Burger King To avoid any confusion the Satisfries are crinklecut and look different But will consumers continue to buy them if they cost more These will cost  to  cents more per serving except when part of a kids meal While no fried potato will ever be considered a nutritional powerhouse compared to a plain baked potato this new addition to the French fry family can help consumers who are already looking for a healthier choice in a fastfood restaurant With these and other kinds of healthier options continuing to be added to fastfood menus consumers can choose better options for nutritional balance Whether they do so is another question
