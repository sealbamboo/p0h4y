Weve survived the stretch between Thanksgiving and New Years Day when rich sweet treats come at us nonstop Now is the season of reform when gym memberships   and weightloss plans sell like gangbusters The cycle has become so predictable and disheartening as our collective motivation to change our ways dissolves by February like a sugar cube in a glass of champagne Ive certainly done my fair share of January foodrestriction experiments that fizzled at the first sign of a Valentines Day candy heart For me its refined sugar pure and simple that over time Ive identified as the food I would most love to be able to resist This year I vowed to seek out new ways to stay out of the drawer my colleague keeps stocked with chocolate bars of all brands and sizes   an alluring stash stored right next to my desk Im not alone in singling out sugar and the undue power it wields over me according to researchers Over the last few years scientists who study the way food influences our brains and bodies have been moving toward   that sugar is addictive Not everyone agrees or is willing to come out and say it yet But as antisugar crusader Robert Lustig of the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco   in a recent piece for TheAtlanticcom the research is suggesting that we want sugar even more than we want fat  a neuroscientist at Columbia University has shown in lab experiments with rats how overeating of palatable foods like sugar can produce changes in the brain and behavior that resemble addiction About  percent of the population meets the criteria for food addiction Avena says  and most say theyre hooked on carbohydrates To make the case to the general public Avena has just published a book   which she wrote with John Talbott an author who recently went from borderline obese to fit by cutting sugar and most starches from his diet They offer a simple explanation for why many of us fail in our efforts to reform Were addicted to refined sugars and carbs and we dont have a good enough plan to fight them They then lay out an eightstep plan for freeing ourselves from the vise and surviving the perilous withdrawal period  a psychologist at the University of Michigan who runs the Food and Addiction Science and Treatment lab is a bit more cautious about comparing sugar to drugs like nicotine and alcohol She says the addiction jury is still out on sugar We still need to better understand whether people addicted to sugar experience tolerance and withdrawal in the same way they would with drugs she says But she says the conventional advice of moderation will definitely not work for everyone The majority of people will be able to moderate sugar says Gearhardt But many people repeatedly fail when they try moderation Those people according to Avena and Talbott are good candidates for their plan which boasts the prospect of a permanent breakup with sugar Eliminating sugar from the diet forever may sound draconian to some given just how prevalent desserts and sweet treats are in our environment and our culture But Gearhardt agrees with Avena that for some its better to make a consistent lifestyle change than to flipflop What we see from the animal models is that the most potent way to train the brain for addiction is when things become intermittent says Gearhardt For those with strong sugar cravings she says the allure can be like gambling  the fact that you dont do it every day makes you more likely to doubledown when you do get the opportunity Youre flipping between extremes Some selfidentified sugar addicts have managed to eliminate it from their diets and those who are successful swear by it I have not had refined sugar or flour in about  years and I do not feel deprived   a journalist who writes and speaks on food addiction tells me I just found that life was better without it Health authorities agree that Americans   habit of consuming an average of  teaspoons or  grams of sugar per day is too much The American Heart Association suggests that women consume no more than  teaspoons  grams a day and men limit themselves to  teaspoons  grams a day I doubt Im consuming  teaspoons a day  Im not a soda drinker nor do I binge on cookies or ice cream But regardless of whether the quantity you consume is excessive by these standards if youre like me the frequency and strength of the sugar cravings alone may be enough to drive you to seek helpWhen I eat sugar I can feel something devilish turn on in my brain a voice saying More more more So I asked Gearhardt and Prager for their tips on how to conquer sugar cravings I also referred to Avena and Talbotts book   Many of their tips overlapped so Ive compiled them here Still these strategies may not work for everyone If you feel like youre whiteknuckling it and its just too hard Geardhardt recommends seeking professional help from food addiction specialists
