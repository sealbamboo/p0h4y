UK pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline says its Ebola vaccine will come too late for the current epidemic GSK is one of several companies trying to fasttrack a vaccine to prevent the spread of Ebola in West Africa  But Dr Ripley Ballou head of GSKs Ebola vaccine research said full data on its safety and efficacy would not be ready until late  The World Health Organization WHO says more than  people have been infected and more than  have died  Health workers are struggling to contain the spread of the virus which is mostly affecting people in Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone  The WHO has warned there could soon be  new cases a week Leading experts who have previously tackled Ebola believe the only way to contain the outbreak is with a vaccine  Prof Peter Piot director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine first discovered Ebola in  He is worried that the outbreak could last well into next year Then only a vaccine can stop it but we still have to prove that this vaccine protects we dont know that for sure he said There are several vaccine trials under way The Public Health Agency in Canada has started human testing and a Russian project is planning to do the same At GSKs vaccine research laboratories outside Brussels they are trying to compress trials that would normally take up to  years into just  months  They have already given the vaccine to volunteers taking part in the trial in Africa the US  where they are working alongside the National Institute of Health  and the UK  Volunteer Nick Owen was injected two weeks ago at the centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine in Oxford and will have regular checkups for the next six months  He said he had not hesitated to take part Its a horrific disease its unimaginable what people are going through and it seemed like a really small sacrifice to make he said   In the next phase of the trial the company hopes it will have  doses ready to be tested by health workers early next year   When the outbreak was first declared in March GSK had discussions with the World Health Organization about accelerating the development of the Ebola vaccine Dr Ballou said But they had decided together not to Noone anticipated we would need a vaccine said Dr Ballou And so both internally and I think at the WHO we felt the best approach was to watch very closely  Seven months on with the virus out of control he now concedes I think in retrospect we should have pulled that trigger earlier  But you know it is what it is and we are working very closely with WHO  There shouldnt be any finger pointing around this  Dr Ballou said it would now take some time to assess all of the data to establish the correct dosage and for how long the vaccine was effective He said that could not be done in time for this latest epidemic At the same time we have to be able to manufacture the vaccine at doses that would be consistent with general use and thats going to take well into  to be able to do that he added I dont think this can be seen as the primary answer to this particular outbreak he said but the trials under way could help in the future If it does work then to be able to be prepared so that we dont have to go through this again in five years or whenever the next epidemic is going to break out Even if GSKs vaccine does not work other Ebola vaccines being developed by researchers in Canada and Japan could provide hope for future outbreaks   Listen to File on Four on BBC Radio  on  October at  BST or
