Reiter says these patients are unlikely candidates not having been to West Africa nor having had any contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient But it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it even if it is highly unlikely Reiter said Emergency rooms typically see a small uptick in traffic after a disease has been in the news a lot  A   that looked at emergency room traffic when swine flu was in the news saw a  increase in emergency room visits  Parents must also have been worried about their children catching it as pediatric visits increased  A   showed  of respondents are somewhat worried about Ebola and their personal health  the chief medical officer for disaster and emergency preparedness at Jackson Health System in Miami said officials have not seen a significant patient increase with the Ebola scare  They do however get cases from time to time where people think they may have it  The hospital is careful he said to rule it out Our health department and the media does a really reasonable job of educating the community about how people get it Memon said I think people are listening and we have not seen this rush of people  If someone has had contact with someone who has Ebola symptoms or they have been in one of these countries we want them to come in if they feel sick and we are ready for it We will pay close attention Memon said  The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has topped  the World Health Organization reported Friday  The latest count brings the total number of confirmed probable or suspected cases to  and the total deaths to   The numbers were reported from Guinea Liberia Nigeria Senegal Sierra Leone Spain and the United States But along with news of the rising death toll some suspected Ebola cases around the world  as fears spread across four continents  have turned out to be false  Concerns about protective measures especially for those caring for the infected remain high  A total of  health care workers are among those believed to have contracted Ebola Of those  of have died the WHO says An American aid worker who contracted Ebola in Liberia and overcame the virus was said to have become infected while treating Ebola patients there but she told CNN on Friday that there is no way to be sure   was working with Samaritans Purse in Liberia caring for Ebola patients when she became ill and was eventually   where she recovered  The belief has been that she contracted Ebola while working in a clinic with infected patients but the survivor said that isnt necessarily the point of infection  Well its very possible that I contracted Ebola outside of the medical unit not within Writebol said Of course I came in contact with people outside of our hospital and I remember knowing and being with a gentleman one time that later died of Ebola And its possible that there was you know some contact there We just dont really know  from Emory University Hospital on August  once doctors determined she posed no public health threat Her recovery has been gradual Writebol said but she is gaining strength each day  The lack of clarity about where she became infected is significant as questions are raised worldwide about safety precautions at hospitals and communities as the outbreak stokes fears The sole person to be diagnosed with the virus on American soil Thomas Eric Duncan died this week as new details of his hospitalization were revealed He had traveled from Liberia last month Duncan first went to the hospital on September  but the hospital said he only had a low grade fever and abdominal pain and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever  On Friday Duncans nephew Josephus Weeks told CNN that Duncan in fact had a degree fever when he left the hospital according to the discharge papers  Talking to CNNs Erin Burnett on Friday night Weeks alleged that the fact Duncan was black poor and didnt have insurance affected his care Had that been another or another color he probably would be living today he would have survived it Weeks said And thats whats hurting me the most  They treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin You stand a chance if youre white but you dont if youre back While it hasnt responded to these latest allegations Dallas Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital did issue a statement Thursday explaining and defending its treatment of Duncan Why wasnt he immediately given an experimental drug Because one wasnt available the hospital explained  Why didnt he get a blood transfusion like other Ebola patients in the United States Because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors And as to whether Duncan got inferior treatment because of his nationality or wealth Texas Health Presbyterian said more than  people cared for him and a bed intensive care unit was devoted to his care Our care team provided Mr Duncan with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care the hospital said  We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area On Thursday a test to see whether a Dallas sheriffs deputy had Ebola   state health officials said  Word of the test result was welcome news a day after the death of   The deputy had reported being inside the Dallas apartment where Duncan had been staying and having some contact with Duncans family members Frisco Fire Chief Mark Piland told reporters  spreads through infected bodily fluids  The deputy Michael Monnig on Friday spoke about awaking after having been on duty at Duncans apartment feeling like a truck had hit me  He identified them as flulike symptoms but following the guidance of the county doctor he went to the clinic and explained that he had been in the apartment  At that point I knew all the bells and whistles would start up but at that point it was out of my control because I had answered yes to the question he said  He broke down crying when he learned he didnt have Ebola Monnig said  In Spain where a nurses assistant was confirmed to have Ebola authorities are taking measures to tackle the crisis  The Spanish government will create a special committee to examine the issue Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters in Madrid  The committee which will include representatives from government and health care will coordinate national efforts to control the virus and establish protocols to deal with it she said The nurses assistant Teresa Romero is the first person to contract Ebola outside of West Africa   A nurses union spokesman told CNN that some nurses and other workers from the Carlos III Hospital where Romero is being treated are taking leave for psychological reasons To cover those jobs the Spanish health service is making short term contracts hiring nurses that might be unemployed Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited Carlos III Hospital  The situation isnt a normal situation he said It is difficult but Im absolutely convinced that everything necessary will be done especially from the professionals to overcome this in the future
