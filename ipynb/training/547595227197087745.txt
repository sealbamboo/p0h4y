From the skyscrapers of Wall Street to the factories of northern Indiana cheers rang out for one of the biggest mergers of the year For  billion   and a group of giant   firms agreed in April to sell one Indiana medical device maker to another But possible acts of bribery abroad may have complicated that deal  and raised larger questions about the way prosecutors mete out justice for big corporations according to confidential documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with lawyers briefed on the matter  the medical devices company   to its rival   is suspected of helping to bribe government officials in Mexico and Brazil according to the confidential documents which have not been previously reported An email from an anonymous whistleblower laid bare the problems in Brazil reporting that distributors Biomet had hired to sell its orthopedic devices were paying kickbacks to government doctors The fate of Biomets merger now hinges partly on the outcome of bribery investigations by the Justice Department and the   painful reminders of a separate  federal case that accused Biomet of foreign bribery Although Biomet disclosed the thrust of its problems to Zimmer before striking the deal  and neither company has shown signs of abandoning it  an unexpectedly steep penalty for Biomet could alter the price of the deal Behind the scenes in Washington Biomets lawyers have opened talks to settle the investigation according to the lawyers briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss the case And to safeguard the deal which is set to close in the first quarter of  Biomet asked the government to resolve the investigation promptly The effort may not be in vain Federal guidelines require prosecutors to weigh the collateral consequences of criminally charging a company including disproportionate harm to innocent shareholders In a guidebook about foreign bribery cases the Justice Department and the SEC also noted that in the context of mergers the government often declined to take action against companies that cooperated fully For now even as the Justice Department investigates Biomet employees a steep fallout for the company seems unlikely According to the lawyers briefed on the matter the Justice Department has discussed the possibility of reaching a socalled deferred prosecution agreement with Biomet that would withhold criminal charges in exchange for certain concessions Under that plan prosecutors would impose criminal charges only on Biomets Brazilian and Mexican subsidiaries A settlement like that  one without charges for Biomet in the United States   could provide ammunition to critics who claim that the government enables a pattern of corporate recidivism It was not even three years ago that Biomet reached a deferred prosecution agreement for similar acts of bribery There are good reasons for prosecutors to give new owners a chance to clean up a company said Brandon L Garrett a   law school professor and author of the book Too Big to Jail How Prosecutors Compromise With Corporations But if prosecutors want companies to take foreign bribery laws seriously then they cant keep letting companies violate the law over and over again It is unclear how Biomets merger will factor into the governments case if at all Biomet Zimmer the SEC and the Justice Department declined to comment Typically prosecutors proceed and mergers survive Yet some deals when entangled in federal investigations do come apart A decade ago   abandoned its  billion acquisition of Titan amid uncertainty about a federal bribery investigation into Titan which ultimately pleaded guilty And the drug wholesaler   trimmed  million from the price of a  billion takeover when its target Syncor settled a bribery investigation Foreign bribery investigations have bedeviled many a Fortune  company On Monday the Justice Department announced the largest ever foreign bribery case   from the French power company Alstom Regardless of how the Biomet investigation concludes Zimmers hands may be largely tied Biomet disclosed the investigation to Zimmer upfront Unless those representations were well off base the deal will remain on track Still the repeat nature of Biomets crime could expose it to stifferthanexpected federal penalties which may prompt Zimmer to seek a price cut For example if prosecutors suddenly demand that Biomet and its subsidiaries plead guilty to criminal charges they might set off a temporary ban on Biomets participation in federal health care programs a blow that could sour Zimmer on the deal With the Biomet deal unfinished a sense of uncertainty has crept over the economy of Warsaw Ind known as the orthopedic capital of the world where both Biomet and Zimmer have headquarters In addition to the bribery investigation the companies are addressing concerns from European antitrust regulators leery of combining two huge players Should the deal fall into trouble Biomet would join other big companies taken private in the buyout boom of the mids that have yet to return to the public stock market The private equity owners of   and   which were taken private between  and  have not sold those companies The biggest buyout of all the Texas utility now known as Energy Future Holdings is mired in bankruptcy Biomet was taken private in  when Goldmans buyout arm     and TPG Capital together paid  billion The company has done relatively well under private ownership though it did not turn a profit until its most recent fiscal year The proposed sale to Zimmer offers the companys Wall Street owners a chance to cash out Zimmer has agreed to pay  billion in cash and  billion in stock Weeks after the merger announcement Biomets problems in Mexico and Brazil reached a turning point The company received an SEC subpoena Biomet also publicly warned investors that the Justice Department could take its own action Against that backdrop Biomet in recent months sought to emphasize a willingness to cooperate with investigators It has fired employees viewed as culpable It reported misconduct to the government And in April and then again in May Biomets lawyers from Ropes  Gray delivered presentations to federal investigators highlighting evidence in the case In July Biomet outlined its approach at a meeting with lawyers representing the companys employees according to the lawyers briefed on the matter During the more than twohour meeting one of Biomets lawyers explained that the company was fully cooperating with the government and that one of its top priorities was to do what it could to protect the deal There is some precedent for Biomet receiving leniency When Biomet settled its first foreign bribery investigation in  the Justice Department imposed a  million penalty  percent below what federal guidelines established as a minimum punishment The Justice Department also declined to charge the company criminally deciding instead on a deferred prosecution agreement In the agreement prosecutors attributed their leniency to concerns about Biomets business Biomet would potentially be subject to exclusion from participation in federal health care programs The initial settlement focused on misconduct in countries where health care workers were government employees In Brazil prosecutors said at the time Biomet authorized certain payments that were used to entice public health care workers to buy Biomet products A company that distributed Biomets products orchestrated the payments prosecutors said Biomet eventually tore up its contract with the distributor But in October  the email from the anonymous whistleblower landed in the inbox of Biomet executives claiming that Biomet continued to hire three offshoots of the distributor These offshoots the email contended have been paying kickbacks since they took over an accusation that Ropes  Gray has not verified Senior lawyers at Biomet failed to halt the misconduct as it unfolded the documents reviewed by The Times show When internal auditors drafted a report in  recommending that Biomet ensure that the relationship between the original and new distributors is completely separated a senior Biomet lawyer made significant edits to the entire report according to the documents and deleted the recommendation altogether Within days of receiving the whistleblowers email Biomet discovered unrelated bribery accusations in Mexico The companys customs broker disclosed that shipments to one of Biomets units in Mexico came about in an irregular way a reference to paying bribes to Mexican customs officials An internal investigation traced the problem to early  when a Biomet Mexican unit struggled to import products that lacked valid registrations the documents show To ship dental devices across the Mexican border employees at one of Biomets Mexican units authorized more than  million in payments to a thirdparty broker which then used some of the money to bribe customs officials Biomet also disclosed to prosecutors that it had improperly hired an unlicensed customs broker to import products from Texas into Mexico At the Texas border since it is a land border it is less strict and they do not request all the documents an internal email said
