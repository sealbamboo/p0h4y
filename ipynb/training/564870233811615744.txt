Say hello to advantame aspartames intensely sweet cousin which got the nod to enter the US food market on Wednesday from the Food and Drug Administration Advantame  which does not yet having a catchy marketing name  is the sixth artificial sweetener on the US market to receive the FDAs blessing as a safe food additive Advantame joins five other artificial sweeteners saccharine aspartame sucralose neotame and acesulfame potassiumbetter known by their respective commercial names SweetN Low Equal Splenda and Newtame and Sweet One The sweetener Stevia made from the leaves of the South American   plant has not required explicit FDA approval as it fell under the FDAs generally regarded as safe clause Advantame is  times sweeter gram per gram than table sugar making it the sweetest by far of the bunch By comparison aspartame sucralose and saccharine range from  to  times sweeter than table sugar It is a white crystalline sweetener that flows freely and dissolves in water Advantame does not break down under heat and thus is expected to be used to sweeten baked goods dessert confections jams and jellies and syrups and toppings as well as soft drinks The FDA said it is not for use in meat and poultry Unlike sugar honey or molasses advantame and the other highintensity sweeteners it joins on the US market add no substantial calories to the foods or drinks they flavor They also do not generally raise blood sugar levels in humans The safety of these artificial sweeteners has been widely challenged and some nutritionists maintain the intense sweetness they bring to foods and drinks may confound normal metabolic processes and prime consumers tastes for highlysweetened and often highly caloric products But the FDA on Wednesday declared advantame safe and reiterated its position that other artificial sweeteners on the market with its permission are safe when consumed in concentrations that are customarily used Like aspartame advantame contains phenylalanine which is metabolized with difficulty by people with a rare genetic disorder phenylketonuria But because of its intense sweetness advantame would be used at much lower volumes than is asparatame As a result the FDA has declared that it can be safely consumed by those with phenylketonuria In finding advantame safe for the general population the US Public Health Services Capt Andrew Zajac director of the FDAs Division of Petition Review said the agency took into account the findings ofÂ   studies conducted on animals and humans Those studies explored whether when consumed in expected volumes advantame was harmful to the immune nervous or reproductive systems or to the development of fetuses or children The FDA set the safe daily consumption level of advantame at  milligrams per kilogram of body weightthe equivalent of  packets of advantame The agency has declared  packets per day per kilo of body weight as the acceptable daily intake of aspartame and sucralose Equal and Splenda and  packets per day per kilo of body weight of saccharine SweetN Low It was virtually impossible to find a toxic dose in animals and there were no signs of carcinogenicity reproductive or developmental toxicity or any other systemic toxicity in animals or humans Josh Bloom of the American Council on Science and Health wrote on his blog Wednesday About the only way this stuff could harm you is if you were run over by a truck that was delivering it Purveyors of dietary supplements who routinely warn of artificial sweeteners dangers he added will undoubtedly find something wrong with advantame and offer a natural alternative After all he wrote we all need to make a living
