A female colleague tells you she likes your new haircut Do you a say thank you b smile and share the name of your stylist or c tell her shes insane and that your hair looks like somebody used it to scrub out a gas station toilet For many women  including those depicted in a new    the answer is C As in cant take a compliment  This is soooo true wrote one woman regarding the video which has been watched  times on YouTube I cant remember the last time I simply said thank you after another girl gave me a compliment I always throw something negative in there I wish every woman whos guilty of this would watch this posted another The skit depicts a gaggle of girlfriends tossing out selfloathing remarks every time they receive a compliment When one womans told shes wearing a pretty dress she replies I paid like  for it Its probably made of old Burger King crowns I look like a whore locked out of her apartment Schumer herself says shes so fat she sleeps standing up in a field Warning Video contains graphic language Granted the video is way over the top But it shines a light on a very real problem many women have a hard time hearing and accepting kind remarks from others especially other women Lockey Maisonneuve a yearold   from Cranford NJ says Schumers sketch definitely hit a nerve with her If someone says You look nice today my first thought is Have you looked at my butt Its huge Or Look at my hair Its frizzy she says I laughed so hard at the video because its almost disturbing to see it visually like that This is what we do to ourselves Maisonneuve says her behavior isnt as extreme as that of the women depicted in the skit but its a little too close for comfort When someone tells me something good about myself I always have a reason why theyre wrong she says I think we all feel less than Less than what we should have been Less than what we thought we were going to be Or we listened to people who said we were less than This is a big issue with women  Renee Engeln a psychology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill says it has to do with the mixed messages women receive about what behaviors are desirable or acceptable Were told love yourself but not too much Be confident but practice a style of humility this culture never requires of men Believe in yourself but never admit it out loud lest you make another woman who doesnt feel good about herself feel bad she says If youre raised to think its arrogant to ever say something positive about yourself it makes it hard to accept a compliment  As for the selfloathing oneupsmanship she says that has more to do with trying to convince others were better at humility Were convincing them that we win at the game of crushing our own selfconfidence she says I dont think thats a win though While the video makes for great comedy its also pinpointed a fascinating cultural paradox says Engeln Women receive one set of messages telling them to love themselves to accept themselves and to look in the mirror and see how beautiful they are to know their worth and lean in and ask for what they want she says But we still live in a world that isnt quite comfortable with women who do acknowledge their worth she says We see them as arrogant and often as unfeminine Men on the other hand arent held to the same standards Men dont care so they dont do it agrees Maisonneuve And I give them credit for that I would love to be able to walk into a room and not even once consider whos in the room whos looking at me whos not looking at me if my shoes are as good as hers I dont think men walk into a room and say Look at his shoes I have to start dressing better They dont care and thats a good thing Also a good thing Schumers message says Engeln  Its a message from women to women that says Lets stop this nonsense she says What comes out of our mouths matters What we say affects what we think and how we behave One of the best things we can model for girls and young women is how to accept a compliment with tact and grace
