The debate over whether diet sodas are good bad or just OK for us never seems to end Some research suggests zerocalorie drinks can help people cut calories and   But in recent years the idea that artificial sweeteners may trick the brain and lead to metabolic derangements as one researcher has   has gained traction too Now a new   published in the journal   introduces a new idea Diet sodas may alter our gut microbes in a way that increases the risk of metabolic diseases such as Type  diabetes  at least in some of us In the paper researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel describe what happened when they fed zerocalorie sweeteners including saccharin aspartame and sucralose to mice To our surprise the mice developed glucose intolerance Weizmann researcher   tells us Intrigued by the findings Elinav and his colleague   set out to determine whether this might happen in people as well First they analyzed data collected from a group of about  people who are enrolled in an ongoing   They found that people who were heavy consumers of artificial sweeteners had slightly   a longterm measure of blood sugar  compared with people who rarely or never consumed artificial sweeteners Next they recruited seven volunteers  people who were not in the habit of drinking diet drinks  and asked them to start consuming the equivalent of  of those fake sugar packets during a oneweek experiment What we find is that a subgroup four of the seven people developed significant disturbances in their blood glucose even after shortterm exposure to artificial sweeteners Elinav says For example results of a   found that some individuals blood sugar temporarily shot up to levels that are characterized as prediabetic within just a few days of introducing the artificial sweetener This was a surprise to us Elinav says And how its happening may be even more surprising Their experiments showed that artificial sweeteners can alter the mix of bacteria in the guts of mice and people in a way that can lead some to become glucose intolerant I found this work exciting because to me its a new idea says physician  who directs the Human Microbiome Program at New York University After reading the paper he says I can just tell you  as a middleaged man whos concerned about his diet and his waistline  and as somebody who drinks diet soda  I didnt drink any yesterday While the findings are preliminary the paper could begin to explain why studies of diet soda point in opposite directions All of us have a microbiome made up of trillions of organisms Its extremely complex Everybodys microbiome is a little different Blaser says And the ways our microbiomes respond to what we eat can vary too In the study the Israeli researchers find that as mice and people started consuming artificial sweeteners some types of bacteria got pushed out and other types of bacteria began to proliferate It could be that for some people who responded negatively to the artificial sweetener the bacteria that got crowded out were helping to keep glucose in check How its happening isnt clear and Blaser says a lot more research is needed So thats the next step Blaser says Firstly for researchers to confirm this to see if its really true And the next challenge is to understand the mechanism How does the change in the microbial composition  how is it causing this Lots of researchers agree theyd like to see a largescale study Its much too early on the basis of this one study to conclude that artificial sweeteners have negative impacts on humans risk for diabetes says   director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado He points to a randomized controlled trial   in  that found artificial sweeteners helped to limit the rise in blood sugar in a group of slightly overweight people compared with sugar Hill also points to a study of people on the   that found successful longterm dieters tend to consume artificially sweetened foods and beverages at a higher rate compared with the general population So expect the debate over diet sodas to continue  and also anticipate hearing more about the role of our microbiomes Its clear that our gut microbes are not just passive organisms hitching a ride on our bodies says   a gastroenterologist at the University of California Los Angeles Theyre affecting our health in active and powerful ways Tillischs take on the new research Its hypothesisgenerating She says many patients come in asking about diet sodas Some keep drinking them even while complaining that diet drinks give them headaches or make them feel bloated Her solution Drink water instead
