The Robinson family of Dallas started out pretty excited about their new insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act Nick Robinson had turned to Obamacare after he lost his job last summer He had been working as a youth pastor and the job included benefits that covered him his two young daughters and his wife Rachel a wedding photographer Nick says he wasnt too nervous at first because everyone was healthy Then he recalls they found out Rachel was pregnant Its one of those times where you hear the news and theres this immediate sense of joy and excitement like Yay a new kid Thats awesome  he says But they were also concerned What are we going to do How are we going to pay for this This is intense Nick found a new job fairly soon working as an account manager in retail sourcing But the small firm did not offer health benefits The couple started looking around They applied for Medicaid but didnt qualify in Texas They thought about paying out of pocket but the quotes they got scared them  up to  for a basic hospital birth Summer crept into fall and Nick started hearing the buzz about the Affordable Care Act I was like oh heres the answer This is simple Nick says Its a cheaper insurance plan theres no preexisting condition stuff Rachel was skeptical but Nick went online and started shopping He had trouble getting through the glitchy website at first but eventually he picked a plan just for his wife It was a gold plan HMO through Blue Cross Blue Shield for about  a month In January as soon as the plan began Nick printed out a list of obstetricians from the plans website I handed it over to Rachel fully confident fully feeling like I had accomplished something for her I had come through for my wife he says This whole Obamacare thing was going to work Rachel recalls two days in January when she sat down and called every doctor on the list of  According to her most of the practices told her in one way or another that they didnt take the plan Some would just come right out and say We dont take Obamacare  she says Or the best one was The doctor takes it here at the actual practice but whatever hospital you use  does not take that insurance  She says there were other issues too Some of the doctors said they wouldnt see her because she was too far along in her pregnancy  about  weeks A few practices did take the HMO insurance but they operated as a rotating clinic and couldnt guarantee she would see the same doctor every time Rachel wanted to establish a relationship with her obstetrician It was mindnumbing she says because I was just sitting there thinking Im paying close to  a month just for me to have insurance that doesnt even work So what am I paying for Nick got even more frustrated when he called Blue Cross and was told those doctors should take the plan How could this not be working he says The United States government has set this up Its this whole big deal there are commercials everywhere saying we need to use this And theyre just saying No no no and that just made me so mad Louis Adams a spokesman for   says he went down that same list a month after Rachel had checked He says most of the  obstetricians do take the HMO insurance Were committed to helping our new members understand how to get the most from their coverage and also are working with doctors and hospitals to inform them of the range of coverage options we have available Adams says Even if it was a matter of miscommunication the Robinsons felt lost It was January and their baby was due in April They started considering a midwife an option friends had suggested but that they had previously rejected Our answers to that were Absolutely not  says Nick  Thats insane Were not going to go to some crazy witch doctor lady and make us get in a giant tub Those are the crazy people Were the normal people We want to have our birth in a hospital  It was risky too Rachel had already had two cesarean sections a home birth would mean trying to deliver vaginally But gradually the Robinsons changed their minds Rachel met with a midwife and loved her Out of pocket a home birth would cost only  And so they dropped their new plan they just stopped paying the premium They signed on to be in the midwifes care Nick signed up for a nonprofit   costsharing plan The Robinsons will pay cash upfront and request reimbursement later Were so happy with where we are now says Nick but this is not OK And Im extremely confident that thats not what the architects of this plan had in mind On April  Rachel gave birth  at home in the giant tub with no pain medication The baby is a healthy boy named Cash Nick says thats for Johnny Cash whom they both love  and not for the midwifes fee
