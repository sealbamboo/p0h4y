Sections of a major fault system running beneath Northern California’s Bay Area are ready to unleash large earthquakes, according to a new study that bolsters what scientists have said for years: that the San Francisco region is due for at least one powerful quake.. But geologists involved in the research cautioned that it is impossible to predict exactly when a quake could strike along the San Andreas, a fault zone stretching across much of the length of California.
