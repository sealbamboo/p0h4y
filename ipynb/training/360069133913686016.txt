Opponents of Obamacare say it will kill jobs and they specifically say provisions forcing employers to offer health insurance to workers will encourage smaller businesses to cut jobs and cut hours But a new report finds that if anything fewer people are working parttime this year than the year before  The report from the leftleaning Center for Economic and Policy Research says data show companies have not been cutting hours in anticipation of the law It contradicts business owners who say theyve already started cutting back CEPR researchers found that just  million workers roughly  percent of the labor force work between  hours a week Twothirds of them said they did so by choice not because they were forced to While there may certainly be instances of individual employers carrying through with threats to reduce their employees hours to below  to avoid the sanctions in the ACA the numbers are too small to show up in the data wrote CEPRs Helene Jorgensen and Dean Baker  Earlier this month the Obama administration  that anyone with  or more workers offer health insurance to any of them working fulltime The requirement defines fulltime as  hours a week or more  something constructed to make sure that employers didnt shave a few hours off peoples work weeks to avoid having to provide the coverage Critics of the law known official as the Affordable Care Act ACA leapt onto this as further evidence that it isnt working The White House said it was merely giving confused employers more time to work out the details of the paperwork that will be required But many employers say a delay isnt enough and they say theyll cut both workers and their hours The state of Virginia already has done so  it has capped parttime workers hours at  hours a week State officials have said it would cost more than  million a year to provide them all health coverage Restaurants which employ many parttime and seasonal workers would be especially affected by the law Jamie Richardson a vice president at White Castle System Inc said his burger chain already has been affected by fears about the law White Castles growth has halted Richardson told a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Health Education Labor and Workforce Tuesday In the five years prior to the health care law we were opening an average of eight new White Castle restaurants each year In  we plan to open just two new locations While other factors have slowed our growth it is the mounting uncertainty surrounding the health care law that brought us to a standstill Companies such as Whole Foods and Dominos Pizza have also    although  Darden Restaurants which owns Red Lobster and Olive Garden changed course on a plan to slash hours for many workers last year after an outcry Douglas HoltzEakin president of the rightleaning American Action Forum predicted matters will only worsen The ACA will contribute to slower job growth HoltzEakin told the hearing The law will lead to a greater reliance on a parttime workforce as companies will not be mandated to provide health insurance benefits to parttime workers CEPRs Jorgensen and Baker decided to look at data that might show whether this is happening  If this is the case we should have first begun to see evidence of the impact of ACA in January of  since under the original law employment in  would serve as the basis for assessing penalties in  they wrote Fortunately it is possible to test whether employers are actually reducing hours below the hour hreshold The Current Population Survey CPS provides monthly data on workers usual weekly hours We used the CPS to compare the first four months of  with the first four months of  We looked at the numbers and percent of workers who reported working  hours a week Thats when they discovered that just  million people work those limited hours  While the sanctions in the ACA may provide some marginal incentive to reduce worker hours below the hour cutoff other considerations in setting worker hours appear to be far more important More than half of Americans   million people  currently get their health insurance through an employer The law is designed to expand that number and to help more people get health insurance through marketplaces called exchanges in each state
