Dr Gwen Lowe, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, said: "Hepatitis A is usually a short-term infection that has very unpleasant symptoms but is rarely serious. . "People are advised to contact their own GP or NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47 if they have any concerns about their health or their child's health.".
