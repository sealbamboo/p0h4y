You really dont want to mess with your Achilles tendons Trust us injury to these tendons can take months to heal and even then recovery is often not complete A big reason the Achilles is such a footdragger at getting better is that the tendon tissue we have as adults is basically the same as we had when we were teenagers That finding was   earlier this week in  But how the researchers figured that out is every bit as interesting as the result The scientists used fallout from nuclear bomb tests as biological tracers Recall that during the Cold War aboveground   carried out by the United States and the old Soviet Union resulted in a dramatic increase in atmospheric levels of radioactive carbon According to study coauthor   director of the AMS C Dating Centre at Denmarks Aarhus University this bomb pulse led to a doubling of carbon in the atmosphere from  to  Heinemeier says other scientists have taken advantage of the pulse to carbon date all sorts of things The method is by no means entirely new he says but it hasnt been used much for studying human tissue renewal Plants take up carbon from the air animals eat those plants and we in turn eat those plants and animals In this way carbon can end up in all of the tissues of our bodies By measuring how much carbon is present in certain tissues scientists can get an idea about when those tissues were formed Collaborating with scientists at the University of Copenhagen Heinemeier looked at the carbon content of tendon tissue samples taken from people who were alive during the bomb pulse The researchers found that tendon tissue from people who were children or teenagers then contained high levels of carbon attributable to the bomb blasts What we see in the tendons is that they actually have a memory of the bomb pulse says lead author   a senior researcher at the University of Copenhagen and Jan Heinemeiers daughter This means that the tendon tissue in those samples was at least several decades old From these results the scientists concluded that tendon tissue renewal is almost nonexistent in adults Heinemeier speculates that this is because tendon tissue regeneration is sacrificed in favor of tissue strength If the Achilles tendon needs to be really strong maybe you cant afford to be reconstructing it all the time she says Looking forward she thinks that future research should focus on how to provoke dormant tendon tissue cells to grow in the adult body Tendon tissue regeneration has already been successfully carried out   Jan Heinemeier has a simpler take away message from this study The main recommendation is dont go and injure your tendon he says
