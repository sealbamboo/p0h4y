Thousands of people working across the NHS are doing something different to improve care as part of NHS Change Day Last year  people took part by making a pledge online  and this year the aim is to get  pledges Pledges include a GP spending a day in a wheelchair to better understand disabled patients and a manager helping dementia patients eat their lunch Two doctors came up with the idea for NHS Change Day after attending an NHS leadership course The aim of the day is to encourage those working for the NHS  and those who use it  to make the NHS better by pledging to do something different Last year Dr Damian Roland a paediatrician at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and one of the founders of NHS Change Day tasted the medicines he routinely prescribed to his child patients and realising they were very unpleasant decided to work with his pharmacy to try to improve their taste This year Dr Roland is going to lie on a spinal board for an hour to experience how patients feel in a similar position He said the day was all about making a difference NHS Change Day is about breaking down traditional barriers and recognising that everyone who works in uses or cares about the NHS has the power to make a difference A single pledge might not sound like much on the face of it but when hundreds of thousands of people from every part of the NHS join forces with patients to pledge it can create massive momentum for improvement  This year there have been pledges from everyone from NHS managers and chief executives to nurses doctors and healthcare assistants around the country Pledges range from the simple such as making sure a childs teddy bear is right next to them when they wake up in recovery to the innovative such as helping terminally ill children understand and relate to the cycle of life by growing and nurturing seeds on the ward  A number of NHS staff are using the day to experience firsthand what their patients have to endure In  a GP pledged to spend the day in a wheelchair so he could understand the pressures on his disabled patients In another GP surgery staff pledged to switch off the electronic message board for a day so they could call patients by name and reengage with them This year Pollyanna Jones regulatory performance manager with Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is planning to spend her lunch break helping patients with dementia enjoy their meals Molly Kavanagh service manager for paediatrics in the East of England has pledged to create a storyboard that helps children diagnosed with autism or ADHD better understand the treatment they will receive And Stuart Poynor chief executive of Staffordshire and StokeonTrent partnership NHS Trust has pledged I will visit patients in our hospitals who do not have any other visitors UNISON which represents  health workers is encouraging NHS staff to get involved and make a positive change to the way they work Christina McAnea head of health at UNISON said NHS Change Day is an inspiring idea It challenges the status quo and gives staff across the NHS the opportunity to think out of the box and come up with pledges that they believe will make a difference
