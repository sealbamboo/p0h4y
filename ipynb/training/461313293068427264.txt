Large quantities of antipsychotic drugs are being given to people with learning disabilities who are resident in hospitals or specialist units Figures compiled after the scandal at Winterbourne View care home show almost twothirds of residents are given the drugs on a regular basis rather than when required The figures also show that more than a third of residents are subject to handson restraint Mencap called the findings disgraceful The data comes from the Learning Disability Survey which was carried out in response to the   of shocking standards of care for people with learning disabilities at the Winterbourne View care home near Bristol  This the first time the data has been gathered  Antipsychotic drugs are meant to be used only when required but the survey found that of those being prescribed the drugs just  were being given them solely on an as needed basis The survey conducted by the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed that  people were resident in hospitals or specialised care homes in September  and that Earlier figures released in December from the same survey showed that around one in five residents was staying in a hospital ward km or more from home  Under a government guarantee following the review into proceedings at Winterbourne View councils and clinical commissioning groups have until June to move residents out of those units and into community care closer to home   Jan Tregelles chief executive of Mencap and Vivien Cooper chief executive of The Challenging Behaviour Foundation said That some of the most vulnerable people in our society are in settings where they are regularly restrained overmedicated and kept in isolation is utterly disgraceful In addition the fact that this appalling care is costing the public purse in many cases up to  per week demands that urgent questions are asked and answers provided It is not enough for the government to say it should not be happening It is happening to peoples sons and daughters brothers and sisters and whats more people are continuing to go into these places faster than they are coming out  The failure to stop this happening is an utter disgrace Steve Sollars whose son was at Winterbourne View said It is devastating to hear that this is still happening  My son Sam was restrained  times in a sixmonth period We will never know how much more he was subjected to for the rest of his twoyear time there   When he came out of Winterbourne View Sam was unrecognisable because of what he had been through  He is now flourishing in the place where he is Good care is possible and everything must be done to stop abuse and suffering of people who find themselves in similar places to Sam All the care institutions involved in the survey are registered with regulator the Care Quality Commission   The CQCs mentalhealth lead Dr Paul Lelliott said The Learning Disability Census presents a picture of some unacceptable practices Over half the patients had been subject to at least one incident of restraint or seclusion selfharming an accident or physical assault in the three months prior to the census  Almost half of the patients had no discharge plan in place The report will provide CQC with additional information to support our inspection activity of these services Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said People with learning disabilities or autism deserve the best possible care so the widespread use of antipsychotics and restrictive practices is extremely concerning This is intolerable and needs to change I want to see progress on these issues when the next set of data is published later this year
