Who doesnt know that smoking pot can make you want to pig out Now researchers say it may work the other way around too Children between the ages of  and  who went on eating binges at least once a week were roughly twice as likely to use marijuana or to show strong signs of depression as those who didnt Researchers found that  percent of adolescents who had episodes of binge eating later went on to use marijuana compared with  percent of adolescents who never binge ate Harvards   who studies eating disorders says her team found a strong connection between these behaviors But the exact connection  and whether one behavior is causing the other  is unclear One theory she says is that the same impulsiveness that leads children to binge eat may also be leading them to try marijuana Another theory is that the strong feelings of shame that often accompany binge eating are one of the causes of depression But Sonneville says these are only theories Theres something that may have even preceded the binge eating episode she says We dont know if the binge eating is the start of the chain Precisely defining binge eating can also be a little tricky Sonneville says its not a runofthemill session of overindulgence For an episode to officially qualify as binge eating she says the overeating has to be accompanied by a loss of control  feelings that you couldnt stop eating if you wanted to Its really the loss of control thats terribly distressing to feel like you have a behavior you cannot stop Sonneville says Also these kinds of episodes have to be occurring frequently  on an almost weekly basis  to qualify as a binge eating disorder Much more research is needed to determine the true relationship between binge eating drug use and depression But Sonnevilles findings suggest that binge eating in adolescence could be a flag for other problems to come during the teenage years She says doctors and parents should keep an eye out for this kind of behavior even among children without weight problems Sometimes I worry that were focused so much on the eating habits of obese kids that we overlook other kids she says Thats the bigger nuance Eating habits are not just something were concerned with in the obese population
