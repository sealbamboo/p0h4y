If you went to see the Kings of Leon concert on March  in Seattle lets hope you came home with nothing but great memories A young woman at that concert in Seattle has come down with   which can be spread for days by a person whos infected but not yet sick Thats bad news for the thousands of people who shared the concert hall with her or were at the many other places she went that week And thats why the Washington State Department of Health has published the unidentified womans   online The reason were doing this is that its so highly contagious says   who is chief of communicable disease control for Seattle and King County Public Health which investigated the measles case It can stay in the air for hours after the contagious person has left If we dont treat these people the chain of transmission can continue The young woman became contagious on March  after visiting a family with measles cases that were linked to an outbreak in British Columbia Unaware she was infected she went to work at a bakery filled her car up at a gas station went to the concert went to Pike Place Market and went out for sushi All the while she was spreading viruses in the air So if you were at the Starbucks at  Pike Street between  am and  pm on March  and youre not sure if youre immune to measles the   wants you to see a health care professional immediately You may be in the market for a quick shot of vaccine or immune globulin Most people are protected against measles Duchin notes either through   or because they had the disease as a child But a surprising number of people arent sure about their status And others including babies pregnant women or people with suppressed immunity cant be vaccinated Theyre the ones who are at risk when measles reappears And the disease can kill We continually see measles being reintroduced into our community by travelers Duchin told Shots Its always good to know your measles immune status and be up to date This story isnt over It takes one week to  days after exposure to become ill so people who were at the Key Arena for that concert might still get sick this week Thats probably not what Kings of Leon mean when they sing of being hot as a fever  rattling bones And lets hope that remains poetic license not part of a medical diagnosis
