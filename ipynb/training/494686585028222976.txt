Border immigration and customs staff feel unprepared to deal with people coming to the UK with possible cases of the Ebola virus a union leader says  Immigration Service Union ISU general secretary Lucy Moreton said her members needed more information on the threat But the Border Force has insisted staff have been given guidance on how to identify and deal with suspected cases Almost  people have died in West Africa since the first case of Ebola was detected in February Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the government was taking the current outbreak  the worlds deadliest to date  and the threat to the UK very seriously Ebola is a viral illness  initial symptoms can include a sudden fever intense weakness muscle pain and a sore throat  that can cause internal and external bleeding It kills up to  of those infected but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment Mrs Moreton told BBC News that ISU members were very concerned and needed more information They serve on the front line they are the first point of contact usually for people coming off an aircraft and the concern is what do they do if theyre confronted with someone that doesnt appear well who appears at the border she said There is no health facility at the border there is no containment facility and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all as to what they should do she said on BBC Radio s The World Tonight Most UK airports have measures in place for people who are unwell  starting before they board the plane Passengers who have high fevers or other signs of infectious illness may be advised not to fly though exact policies depend on the individual airline If passengers become seriously unwell while flying advice is sought from any health professionals who happen to be on board and ground control are alerted quickly  Attempts may be made to isolate patients by clearing nearby seats Where possible sick passengers have a designated toilet for sole use and all contaminated surfaces are disinfected  On arrival anyone sitting within two rows of the patient are asked to leave their contact details in case needed  Major airports may have medical experts nearby to examine people with any concerning symptoms And officials often have agreements in place with local hospitals allowing for quick transfer and treatment  Some airports also have isolation facilities for people who need them  A Border Force spokesperson said its priority remained the security of the border which included helping to protect public health We have wellestablished procedures for dealing with infectious diseases the spokesperson said We are currently working closely with partners such as Public Health England to minimise any potential risk and Border Force officers have already been given guidance on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola It is understood staff have been advised that if they identify someone as potentially infected they must refer them to a specialist medical care provider  by ambulance if necessary The guidance also includes instructions to report the case to Public Health England Mr Hammond said the UKs health services had the experience to deal with the threat posed by the deadly virus He said the threat to Britain came from someone contracting the disease abroad and becoming unwell back in the UK but the disease had not yet directly affected the UK  Elsewhere Dr Nick Beeching senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine told the BBC people were not going to catch the virus simply by being on a plane with an infected person This is acquired by close contact with body fluids of people that are infected he said  Its not spread through the air like lets say flu or SARS so its a very different kind of transmission from those infections Several West African airlines have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone amid concerns about the spread of the disease to those countries from Guinea Authorities in Ethiopia and Kenya are to screen all passengers arriving from West Africa Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association IATA said on Thursday that it was not recommending any travel restrictions or border closures after consulting the World Health Organization according to Reuters Any risks would be low in the rare event of an Ebola sufferer travelling by air it added It comes after an infected American man of Liberian descent was found to have flown from Liberia to Nigeria last week He developed symptoms during the flight Schools have been shut and communities quarantined in Liberia in a bid to stem the outbreak A public health emergency has been declared in Sierra Leone Earlier this month Public Health England issued an alert to UK doctors to be aware of Ebola symptoms
