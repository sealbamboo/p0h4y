My father died earlier this year It was sudden and in what some of our friends described as every wifes worst fear my mom came home from work to discover him collapsed on the kitchen floor lifeless  When I first heard the news I felt betrayed because I had always envisioned my dad getting sick in a hospital perhaps from complications of pneumonia or heart failure The hospital was a place where I could use my medical knowledge to intervene to try to save him That opportunity was gone Then again my first reaction really didnt make sense because the death of a parent doesnt make sense Regardless of your relationship with them your parents represent truth and a part of my truth had just died Before I had time to fully digest this new reality myself I had to tell my children As a leukemia doctor I have a lot of difficult conversations Sometimes I have to tell people that they have leukemia or that their leukemia has come back Sometimes I get to tell people that theyre cured  and those are really good days And other times I have to break the news that weve run out of options to treat a particularly terrible variety of leukemia But this was the worst conversation I have ever initiated Despite my years of bedside practice and communication skills training be damned I was wholly unprepared to sit on my sons bed look my children in the eyes and tell them their Poppy had died I broke down after spitting out Guys I have some bad news I should have known better  this was not the first time I realized how hard it could be to swim in my familys waters while wearing my white coat My dad a former journalist had a variety of medical problems and would enlist my help in navigating his conditions and his physicians recommendations as I am the only doctor in our family I quickly learned the distinction though between his asking for advice and his actually following it Ive decided to let the doctor remove my gallbladder he told me toward the end of last year I talked to some friends who say its really no big deal For weeks before this announcement he and I had been discussing his medical options during which I tried to gently dissuade him from undergoing the surgery OK I said slowly once I got over my surprise When are you having it done December th Ill stay overnight and be discharged on Christmas he answered He was pleased that he could have the operation in  so it wouldnt count toward his insurance deductible for the next calendar year Im not sure Im comfortable with your having the surgery and being monitored over a holiday I responded probably a little too quickly Hospitals often have skeletal staffing then so if something goes wrong your doctor may not be on call to handle it Maybe you should wait  He had the surgery on Dec  and made it through the operation just fine  Thinking through our backandforth I suppose he had as much difficulty as I did separating my role as a son from my role as a doctor To my father there probably wasnt much difference between the kid who used to try to convince him to take me and my brother for frozen custard after a day at the pool and the man trying to talk him out of gallbladder surgery  On my end I was certainly taught that I should be a doctor only to my patients This is a safeguard to help ensure I remained objective and made good medical decisions on their behalf Emotions particularly those that steep over years can act like vapors that cloud our judgment despite our best intentions But when your father asks for your help its hard to say no  We werent alone in this confusion over my role At my fathers funeral and at Shiva thereafter a couple of people came up to me to express their sympathy Well you did what you could they said The implication being his health wasnt the best and even a good doctor can only help so much  Years earlier people had made the same comment to me at the funeral of my uncle a retired professor who died of leukemia Because of my specialty his death had hit close to home And while I did steer my uncle to the care of my colleagues and tried to help educate him about his cancer I did not treat him  He wasnt my patient I wanted to shout at both my uncles funeral and my fathers It didnt matter The expectation was still there Fathers and sons can have complicated relationships These are not made easier when health care issues are thrown into the mix especially when one is a health care professional Knowing this a friend of mine asked me how I was feeling after I told him my father had died Its actually really easy to answer the question  I just miss him
