If the Food and Drug Administration has its way an era of food technology will soon end The agency   Thursday it is aiming to ban partially hydrogenated vegetable oils from all food products Margaret Hamburg the FDA commissioner said at a press conference that her agency has come to the preliminary conclusion that the oils are not generally recognized as safe for use in food If the agency makes this decision final it will mean a complete ban on this ingredient Health concerns about the trans fats in the oil have been mounting for years The biggest concern Trans fats raise the risk of heart disease The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that an FDA ban on trans fats could prevent an additional  deaths from heart disease each year and up to  heart attacks each year But it took decades for health officials to arrive at that conclusion Partially hydrogenated oil came on the market about a century ago when food scientists figured out how to add hydrogen atoms to a molecule of oil Typically its soybean oil  a scientist with the Institute of Food Technologists in Chicago says this makes liquid oil more solid and stable Depending on how you add the hydrogen atoms you can make the oil as solid as you like So we could literally dial the needle to as solid as you wanted and get the kind of results we were looking for says Shelke These results include cookies or doughnuts that didnt leave a ring of oil behind on a paper towel and dont start tasting rancid after a few weeks Also this oil doesnt have a strong taste of its own so you can use lots of it without ruining the flavor Its really absolutely perfect and its also perfect for the American style of shopping You buy boxes and boxes of crackers put them in your pantry says Shelke You open this box six months or eight months or a year later and it would still taste and smell just as good as it was on the day you bought it By the time the government came up with laws regulating food additives people had been eating this form of oil for decades with no apparent problems  a researcher at a nonprofit group called Public Agenda in New York says most scientists in the s actually thought this kind of oil was probably safer than lard or palm oil Schleifer wrote a recent journal   on the history of trans fats McDonalds Schleifer says previously used beef tallow for frying People freaked out about beef tallow because it had saturated fat and McDonalds responded to that public outcry by replacing beef tallow with trans fat he says Everything changed in the mids New studies showed that trans fats raised bad cholesterol and increased the risk of heart disease In fact they were even worse than saturated fats In  after a campaign by public health advocates the FDA required food companies to add trans fats to food labels Most companies responded by   their use of partially hydrogenated oil That had a big impact on consumption  Americans consumed around  gram per day in  down from  grams per day in  But not every company has eliminated it from every product You can   trans fats in microwavable popcorn frozen pies and all kinds of massproduced baked goods Often food companies use just a little bit If theres less than half a gram of trans fats per serving they can list the amount of trans fats in their products as zero A complete ban on trans fats would be a big deal for food manufacturers says Shelke She says food companies can drop the trans fats but their products wont be quite the same They have to go back to reeducating consumers that cookies and consumers dont last forever says Shelke The cookies will have a shorter life but consumers lives might be longer
