In my darkest days in the oncology unit I promised myself that if I ever got into remission one day I would become a stronger healthier and better version of my precancer self What could be a bigger inspiration to live a healthier life than surviving cancer I imagined that once and for all I was going to become the kind of person who meditates every morning guzzles green juice does yoga and on occasion even runs a marathon Before my diagnosis with leukemia two years ago at the age of  Id always excelled at making resolutions But I was never as good at keeping them Like a lot of young people I burned the candle at both ends with an ageappropriate dose of invincibility After working hour weeks or more as a paralegal my first job out of college my way of letting loose after a long day was by meeting friends for cocktails after work grabbing fast food on the go and staying up as late as I wanted Resolutions came and went I would get to them later I told myself Then I learned I had cancer and my life and my resolutionmaking were interrupted Suddenly the scope of my worries had changed drastically There was no time or space to stress over something as small as a threeday juice cleanse or a daily exercise program Surviving my next cycle of chemotherapy became my singular concern Today after two years of nonstop chemotherapy treatments Im finally getting some strength back The future has been a place of fear and uncertainty since my diagnosis but with only two monthlong cycles of chemo left Im looking forward to getting a glimpse of normal life And naturally as Ive started to feel better Im also making resolutions again Thats how I found myself signing up to run a halfmarathon just eight months after undergoing a bone marrow transplant a highrisk procedure that my doctors said was my only shot at a cure Sure Id been bedridden for the better part of the past two years And yes I was still undergoing maintenance chemotherapy that left me so weak on some days that even walking my dog around the block felt like a challenge But Id heard the stories of superhuman cancer patients who had radically changed their lives and who went on to climb Mount Everest or run ultramarathons I wanted to be one of them I got a gym membership invested in a pair of fancy new running shoes and threw myself into an intensive workout regimen I was off to the races I even posted a triumphant picture on Facebook There I was one arm outstretched in a fist above my head taking my first steps on a new marathontraining program I learned about from an iPhone app But my big running dreams lasted about  days I began to feel a nagging ache in the arches of my feet and more pain in my shins I iced the affected areas and continued my training but the pain got worse I didnt want to give up as I had with past resolutions Certainly I told myself fighting cancer had made me tougher than a few simple aches and pains But within a month even walking had become excruciating I hadnt just overdone it I had really hurt myself Thats how I ended up back in the emergency room hooked up to a morphine drip  this time not for cancerrelated reasons but to get Xrays of my legs Luckily nothing turned out to be seriously wrong But my doctors who hadnt known about my doityourself marathon training regimen ordered me to stop immediately and to go back on bed rest Was I crazy they asked All I knew was that I was back to square one lying in bed feeling defeated and discouraged as I dug into a bag of jelly beans my favorite In retrospect a marathon so soon after my transplant was never a realistic or healthy option for me It did though teach me an important lesson Surviving a health crisis changes you in real and profound ways but it doesnt magically transform you into a healthier or better person overnight Cancer has made me mentally and spiritually stronger But as my life starts to go back to normal I find that some of my old bad habits are still lurking in the shadows Im still struggling to figure out how to turn my resolutions into longlasting change but Ive learned this much Getting healthy starts with accepting the fact that after two years of cancer treatment my body has taken a hit Getting healthy means listening to my body  and no longer comparing myself with other people at the gym Getting healthy means being satisfied with small sustainable incremental changes to my diet and lifestyle I wanted to go from zero to  but Im learning to accept zero to  For now my only resolution will be to define what my own marathon is Only I can determine that Thats probably not just a cancer problem its a human one too
