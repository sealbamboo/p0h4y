Treating a paralyzing snakebite could one day be as easy as sniffing a nasal spray according to a California researcher who hopes to curb biterelated deaths that claim as many as  people worldwide each year  Dr Matt Lewin an expedition medicine expert with the University of California San Francisco says he has hit on a way to produce a cheap portable firstaid snakebite treatment that could change the way travelers and residents of thirdworld countries respond to the venomous threat Just get rid of the needles said Lewin the director of the Center for Exploration and Travel Health at the California Academy of Sciences  Instead of grappling with cumbersome syringes and complicated directions an unfortunate snakebite victim could sniff a drug called neostigmine which already is recommended for use intravenously to treat paralyzing bites  The research is in its very early stages but Lewin has put out a paper that describes an experiment with a single volunteer a yearold man who agreed to be chemically paralyzed  and then take the antidote Twenty minutes later the deadly symptoms were reversed the paper reports  You only need a few milligrams of the drug to forestall the immediately lifethreatening consequences of a snakebite that causes paralysis said Lewin whose study is detailed this week in the latest issue of the journal Clinical Case Reports Last month one of Lewins colleagues Dr Stephen Samuel of Trinity College in Dublin used the method to treat a woman in India whose face was paralyzed by a krait a deadly snake in a country where an estimated  million people are bitten every year  India is the snakebite capital of the world Lewin said Globally as many as  million snakebites might occur annually    The woman already had undergone a full course of antivenom treatment but it was only after receiving a neostigmine nasal spray that her paralysis was reversed  within  minutes Two weeks after being treated the patient reported having returned to her daily activities Lewin reported  Lewin came up with the idea for the nasal spray after preparing for a trip to a snakeridden part of the Philippines and realizing that neither he nor his companions had a good way to treat paralyzing snakebite in the wild  More than a decade ago   a renowned herpetologist at the California Academy of Sciences died after being bitten by a banded krait while doing research in Myanmar where emergency medical care was not available Antivenoms have been the only solution to paralyzing snakebite but they pose several problems Lewin said Theyre expensive they require refrigeration and they need needles and syringes to administer The dosing can be tricky and some people have bad reactions to the drugs  I thought Theres gotta be a better way to do this said Lewin So I started trying to rethink the problem He recalled that neostigmine is the World Health Organizations recommended drug for treating snakebite albeit in IV form And he also remembered that the drug has been used in nasal sprays to treat myasthenia gravis a neuromuscular disease  So Lewin mixed up a recipe of the nasal spray and began planning his experiment He agrees that it was an unusual way to test a new drug but Lewin insists that the required institutional review board signed off on the plan He wont identify the volunteer for privacy reasons but says the man trusted the experiment implicitly The volunteer was given a drug mivacurium that Lewin said mimics the neurotoxic effects of envenomation from weakened eyelids to the beginnings of respiratory distress that can lead to death Before it got that far he was treated with the neostigmine nasal spray  The successful experiment has garnered Lewin new supporters  and new funding  to pursue more traditional research including drug trials in mice He hopes to test the product in India perhaps in a clinical trial that could be in place by the beginning of the next monsoon season  the worst time for snakebites  starting next May  Other snakebite experts say that Lewins goal is admirable but it will take much more research to ensure that any snakebite nasal spray is safe and effective Dr Richard Clark director of the division of medical toxicology at the University of California San Diego Health System said that the drug may help with muscular paralysis but not with the devastating effects on blood clotting and tissue destruction that snakebite also causes  I think its worth trying but I dont think its going to reduce mortality Clark said  If it works out Lewin envisions a world where neostigmine and other drugs could be administered nasally to blunt the effects of snakebite It might have limited use in the US where  people suffer bites each year but only coral snakes harbor paralyzing venom  But nasal spray made from neostigmine which is cheap and widely available could be a huge boon in places like India Lewin said There  percent of people who die from snakebite do so outside of hospitals usually because of long travel delays  The spray wouldnt replace antivenom but it could buy victims more time he predicted  The best potential for the drug is to forestall an incipient catastrophe Lewin said
