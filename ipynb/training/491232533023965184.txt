The label on my bottle of Natures Bounty Advanced Probiotic  says it contains  probiotic strains and  billion live cultures in each twocapsule dose The supplement provides advanced support for digestive and intestinal health and healthy immune function I have no way to know if any of this is true Like all overthecounter dietary supplements probiotics undergo no premarket screening for safety effectiveness or even truth in packaging Can there really be  billion microorganisms guaranteed at the time of manufacture in those dry capsules that will spring into action in my digestive tract Im not sure what prompted me to try probiotics Perhaps it was to stimulate a sluggish gut or to counter lactose intolerance or as some enthusiasts have suggested to enhance a healthy old age Japan where a womans life expectancy far exceeds ours accounts for half the worlds consumption of probiotics Maybe it was the invitation I received to a coming symposium   convened by Dr   at Harvard Medical School To be sure lay and scientific literature are filled with probiotic promise and I am hardly the only consumer who has opted to hedge her bets The global market for probiotic supplements and foods   with a projected annual growth of  percent or more In the early s the Nobel Prize winner   found that certain healthy bacteria like those that produce lactic acid can have a positive effect on digestion and the immune system Beneficial microorganisms have since been shown to inhabit three main locations in the digestive tract the stomach the lower part of the small intestine and the large intestine To better understand the current enthusiasm for enhancing the bodys supply of these microorganisms some definitions are needed   Prebiotics are nondigestible carbohydrates that stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial microorganisms that is probiotics in the gut They are found naturally in oats wheat some fruits and vegetables bananas onions garlic leeks asparagus soybeans honey and artichokes and in breast milk and they are added to some infant formulas   Probiotics are defined by the   as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host The ailments that probiotics are said to benefit range from infectioncaused diarrhea inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome to asthma allergy and Type  diabetes   Synbiotics are a combination of prebiotics and probiotics They are found in socalled functional foods like yogurt and kefir fermented foods like pickles and some cheeses and in some supplements That probiotic organisms are important to health is not questioned As researchers at the Institute for Immunology at the University of California Irvine   intestinal microorganisms play an important role in the development of the gut immune system digestion of food production of shortchain fatty acids and essential vitamins and resistance to colonization from pathogenic microorganisms Dr Walker has explained that probiotics enhance defensive action by the cells that line the gut When a person takes antibiotics especially the broadspectrum antibiotics most often prescribed many of these beneficial microbes are destroyed along with the diseasecausing bacteria Patients on antibiotics are often told to consume yogurt with active cultures to replenish the beneficial organisms At least a dozen studies most of them in infants or children have found that probiotics can prevent or treat diarrhea For example among  children taking antibiotics for respiratory infections those given the probiotic Lactobacillus GG had   compared with those given a placebo The same bacteria have also been helpful in reducing the risk of travelers diarrhea In an extensive review of the evidence published in  in the journal Pediatrics an expert committee concluded that probiotics might limit the course of viruscaused diarrhea in otherwise healthy infants and children But the committee said there was not sufficient evidence to justify routine use of probiotics to prevent rotaviruscaused diarrhea in child care centers Nor did the committee   and nursing or giving them to infants to prevent allergic disorders in those at risk Only a small percentage of probiotic foods and supplements have the backing of peerreviewed published research They include Dannons Activia yogurt and DanActive drink and the supplements   and Align Although kefir contains even more probiotic strains than yogurt clinical studies have not shown it to be effective in preventing or treating infectious diarrhea The challenge in taking probiotics is to get the microbes past the stomach where most are killed by gastric acid said   a biologist at North Carolina State University Once in the intestines they must compete effectively with the microbes already present Dr Dunn author of   says there is good reason to remain skeptical of probiotics There are hundreds of kinds of prebiotics and probiotics in stores he said As a consumer its almost impossible to figure out what is best What are the specific species in your intestines and how will what you take compete with them Still he added taking them doesnt seem harmful Its a relatively lowcost treatment worth trying if you have a condition like   he said But for most conditions the potential benefit is uncertain There is growing evidence for the role of the appendix in restoring a healthful balance of microbes in the body Though long considered an expendable vestigial organ the appendix is now being looked at as a storehouse of good bacteria Dr Dunn said In a study of recovery rates from   which causes a severe form of infectious diarrhea often following antibiotic therapy patients whose appendixes had been removed   than those who still had appendixes
