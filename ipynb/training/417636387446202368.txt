As Michael Schumacher remains in a critical condition after a ski accident experts warn that even a seemingly minor head injury can have major consequences  Any knock to the head can be dangerous although thankfully most are not  The brain is a delicate blancmangelike organ that is vulnerable  Although it is protected by the skull rapid forward back or twisting movements of the head can send the brain crashing against this bony box Even mild injuries of this sort can produce diffuse injury At first there may be no noticeable damage  at least on the outside  Indeed people who have been in serious collisions may appear lucid and unscathed on first inspection  But it can take up to  hours for symptoms to appear  Anyone who has had a blow to the head should seek immediate medical attention regardless of how mild it might seem  The force of the blow can cause the brain to twist damaging nerves and tissue The skulls sharp interior ridges can tear arteries and veins running through the brain allowing blood to leak As with any injured body part there will be swelling and bruising too  With nowhere to escape the pressure can build and squeeze the brain  This is a medical emergency  Luke Griggs of the charity Headway says There is no hard and fast rule with head injuries  A seemingly innocuous injury can be fatal as we have seen before with the sad situation with Natasha Richardson Liam Neesons wife died from head injuries sustained in a skiing accident She initially showed no sign of injury but about an hour later was taken to hospital after feeling unwell   Mr Griggs says With severe head injuries one of the difficulties we have got is that the symptoms can be delayed  Bruising and swelling does not happen immediately and it may take time for the damage to occur  Thats why it is important to seek medical help even if there are no symptoms Doctors say people who have had a head injury should be monitored for at least two days for any signs that their condition might be worsening  Any drowsiness or loss of consciousness balance problems vomiting or severe headache is a warning that should not be ignored Dr Mike Langran a GP and expert in ski injury research said most ski resorts had medics on hand to deal promptly with these sorts of injuries  Accidents of this nature are thankfully rare events amongst skiers and snowboarders although of course they usually receive substantial media attention As with any recreational activity however it is impossible to completely remove all elements of risk when participating in snow sports He said wearing a helmet could help skiers to avoid or lessen such injuries  Michael Schumacher remains in a critical condition following his skiing accident on Sunday
