Federal regulators gave the green light to a onceaday opioid painrelief pill that is up to  times more powerful than a single Vicodin but is designed to thwart the immediate release of its full  and potentially lethal  payload The US Food and Drug Administrations approval of Hysingla ER an extendedrelease form of the widely prescribed hydrocodone comes amid controversy over the proliferation of powerful narcotic painkillers in the face of an epidemic of addiction and overdose The maximum dose of Hysingla packs  milligrams of hydrocodone the opioid analgesic contained in Vicodin which is sold in  to milligram doses But when taken as directed the new pill releases its medicine over  hours Hysingla is intended to be swallowed whole The FDA expects it to reduce  but not totally prevent  peoples ability to abuse it by chewing it or smashing it into a powder that they snort or inject The tablet forms a thick gel if it is crushed making it difficult to inject But the agency and the manufacturer acknowledged abuse is still possible and an overdose can result in death The approval of Hysingla is part of the FDAs response to mounting overdose deaths involving prescription painkillers The agency is encouraging drugmakers to make narcotic painkillers safer by developing abusedeterrent formulations Dr Janet Woodcock director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said Thursdays approval of Hysingla was a move in the right direction While the science of abuse deterrence is still evolving the development of opioids that are harder to abuse is helpful in addressing the public health crisis of prescription drug abuse in the US Woodcock said in a statement Preventing prescription opioid abuse is a top public health priority for the FDA and encouraging the development of opioids with abusedeterrent properties is just one component of a broader approach to reducing abuse and misuse she said At the same time Woodcock said the agency wants to ensure patients have access to appropriate treatments for pain Hysinglas only active ingredient is hydrocodone Other forms of hydrocodone such as Vicodin and Norco also contain acetaminophen which carries the risk of liver toxicity the FDA noted in its review Mark Timney chief executive of Purdue Pharma said his company was proud to bring patients another pain treatment option Hysingla is the companys third approved abusedeterrent opioid The active ingredient in the others is oxycodone a close cousin of hydrocodone These innovations are an important step forward in helping meet patients needs while also working to deter misuse and abuse Timney said in a statement Hysingla comes a little more than a year after the FDA approved Zohydro ER another longacting form of hydrocodone Designed to last  hours Zohydro is available in strengths of up to  milligrams   times the lowest dose of Vicodin Because Zohydro can easily be crushed its approval prompted criticism from addiction experts and public health officials who feared it would quickly become abused Dr Andrew Kolodny an addiction expert said he feared that it was just a matter of time before addicts figure out how to abuse Hysingla I think its an extremely dangerous product said Kolodny who helped found Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing A pill thats so strong makes me very concerned that this product may be more dangerous than Zohydro Purdue Vice President of Health Policy Dr J David Haddox said it was misleading to suggest that Hysingla is stronger than other painkillers The range of tablet strengths for Hysingla ER is comparable to the strengths of several opioids already on the market none of which have abusedeterrent properties Haddox said in an email Opioid drugs  including forms of morphine methadone oxycodone and hydrocodone  are prescribed for patients who need powerful painkillers But if patients take them for an extended period they can develop a tolerance and require higher and higher doses of the drugs increasing the risk of overdose and other problems Painkiller deaths quadrupled between  and  mirroring a sharp rise in the number of prescriptions for such drugs In  overdoses involving painkillers pushed drug fatalities past traffic accidents as a cause of death And in  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared an epidemic The crisis had long been blamed on pharmacy robberies teenage pill poppers and the black market But a    showed that physicians played an important role in prescription drug overdoses The Times analysis of  fatalities found that drugs prescribed to patients by physicians caused or contributed to nearly half the deaths The Hysingla approval did not immediately affect the FDAs stance on Zohydro but an agency spokesman said it would continue to watch for abuse If a drug is determined to be unsafe the agency can move to pull it off the market Twitter
