Like many men of his generation Larry Faust  of Seattle went to a lot of rock concerts in his youth And like many men of his generation his hearing isnt what it used to be My wife has been bugging me for several years to do something about my hearing said Mr Faust I spent part of the summer of  at Woodstock So that probably didnt help Instead of going the traditional route  buying hearing aids through an audiologist or licensed hearing aid dispenser  Mr Faust purchased a device that is classified as a personal sound amplifier product or PSAP which is designed to amplify sounds in a recreational environment  Unlike hearing aids PSAPs are exempt from Food and Drug Administration oversight and can be sold as electronic devices directly to consumers with no need to see a physician before buying one They   and vary widely in price  And while some hearing professionals have long cautioned against the devices citing their unreliability and poor quality many also say that a new generation of PSAPs that utilize the latest wireless technology are offering promising alternatives for some people with hearing loss The device Mr Faust bought the CS from a Chicagobased company called Sound World Solutions cost  thousands of dollars cheaper than most digital hearing aids While it has many of the same features that highend hearing aids have including  channels to process sound directional microphones feedback insulation and noise reduction it has one capability that hearing aids and other devices on the market currently dont have It comes with software that enables consumers to program it themselves a feature made possible in part by the adoption of the widely available Bluetooth wireless technology rather than the proprietary platforms used by most wireless hearing aids  Rather than having to visit an audiologist to program the device something that hearing aid users must do CS customers can program it themselves by downloading the app to an Android phone or a computer an iPhone version is under development After opening the software users respond to a series of beeps and tones of varying volumes by clicking a button to indicate whether they have heard the sound This selfprogramming feature may make the CS especially useful for consumers in developing countries where Sound World intends to distribute them and where there is no formal distributional model for hearing aids and no audiologists said Stavros Basseas the companys cofounder There are limitations to who can benefit A personal sound amplifier is really designed for patients who have normal or near normal hearing Its not really designed as a hearing device to address significant sensorineural hearing loss said Bettie Borton the president of the American Academy of Audiology It is also important that those with hearing loss be screened for potentially serious medical problems that may be causing the problem  Still despite these concerns the CS which looks and behaves like a cross between a Bluetooth headset and a hearing aid may be a road map for hearing aids in the near future Most hearing aids with wireless capabilities currently use either a proprietary wireless platform or Bluetooths Classic technology an older more powerhungry version of Bluetooth and require an intermediary remotecontrollike device or a bodyworn device to connect the hearing aid to cellphones televisions or Bluetoothcapable speakers In addition to being inconvenient these external devices are also costly ranging from  to  In contrast the CS requires only one external rechargeable battery that fits behind the ear like a traditional hearing aid The concept is catching on Dr Rodney Perkins an otologist who founded the California Ear Institute at Stanford University plans to release a similar device next year dubbed Soundhawk Ms Borton said many patients hesitated to buy wireless hearing aids with intermediary devices Several of them told me Im going to wait and when you have a product where I dont have to wear the streaming device then Ill be back Not surprisingly hearing aid companies are investigating more efficient less powerhungry forms of Bluetooth technology such as Bluetooth Smart  currently used by gadgets like Fitbit and Nike Fuelband  that would enable their products to skip the intermediary device Suke Jawanda chief marketing officer of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group said that several major hearing aid companies have become members in the last year  One of the roadblocks to developing hearing instruments that connect seamlessly with all mobile devices has been the lack of a standard protocol for wireless connection  It is important that we can serve all smartphones and not only a small subset said Stefan Launer vice president of science and technology at Phonak a major hearing aid manufacturer In order to achieve that a standard has to be defined and implemented by everyone involved When this will be the case is hard to predict The technology may bring new functionality to the next generation of hearing aids As with the CS Bluetoothenabled hearing aids could theoretically route Skype computer calls directly to the aid and users could link directly to their Bluetoothenabled smart TVs or digital stereos listening at the volume of their choice without drowning out their nonhearingimpaired neighbors Manufacturers of hearing devices are making progress Recently GN ReSound revealed its Made for iPhone hearing aid the   at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas it uses proprietary wireless  GHz technology and Bluetooth Smart and is expected to be released worldwide in the first quarter of  And rather than a bodyworn device the iPhone itself will serve as the remote enabling the user to switch between alreadyprogrammed environments such as hearing in a restaurant for instance or listening to music With the iPhones latest operating system iOS users with two Made for iPhone hearing aids can listen to music on their iPhone in stereo via the Airplay feature or follow turnbyturn directions in their car Though the company didnt announce a price ReSounds president Kim Herman said that the LiNX will be sold at a premium to another ReSound product the Verso which starts at  and sells for as high as  And in September Advanced Bionics a sibling company of Phonak released a new sound processor   that allows cochlear implants to connect with devices using Bluetooth technology  An online hearing retailer Embrace Hearing is currently developing a device that would jailbreak existing hearing aids that come with Bluetooth Classic technology said the companys cofounder Ross Porter The device and accompanying app would allow users to adjust program settings on their hearing aids themselves There is ongoing debate about whether userprogrammable hearing needs will one day replace the need for costly visits to an audiologist Mr Porter thought that major hearing aid manufacturers want to give a little bit more flexibility to the user but not replace audiologists  But Ms Borton said that even if users could adjust the settings themselves it wouldnt be a replacement for a professional custom fit A successful hearing aid fitting is not solely putting the device on the patient and patting them on the back and sending them out the door she said High quality hearing aid fittings by audiologists involve verifications by various electronic measures and validation Perhaps a larger obstacle to the wholehearted adoption of Bluetooth technology in hearing aids though is the patients themselves the average age of a hearing aid user is   I would say probably  percent of my caseload even if they had Bluetooth programming technology available to them are not perhaps because of their age demographic capable of embracing that kind of technology easily They dont own computers they are not online said Ms Borton  As an IT networking consultant who is comfortable working with new technology Mr Faust is an exception to that rule He is happy to use the CS to make calls and looks forward to the next iteration of the device when the device is able to stream music directly from his phone But for now Mr Faust likes being able to program the CS himself I can really turn it up and I can hear things that other people cant hear he said With the adjustability this easy  its almost like more than a hearing aid
