More than  in  adult Americans say theyve recently suffered a bout of lowback pain Its one of the most common reasons people go to the doctor And more and more people are being treated for it America spends   on back pain treatments But many specialists say less treatment is usually more effective In fact theres   that many standard treatments for back pain  surgery spinal injections and painkillers  are often ineffective and can even worsen and prolong the problem  agrees with that premise He suffered back pain for almost  years He was a young marathon runner  years ago when back pain struck out of the blue I couldnt run It was difficult to sleep he says I wasnt confined to bed but I was hobbling around Groopman a Harvard cancer specialist who writes about medicine for   wanted the problem fixed  right away So he found a surgeon who removed a damaged   the jellylike cushioning between each vertebra The surgery didnt fix his pain Then one day during brunch at a friends house something happened that altered the course of his life I stood up from a chair and just had an explosive electric shock through my lower back he remembers Basically I fell to the floor and couldnt get up His previous pain was severe But this was over the top Groopman could hardly move I was so desperate after almost three weeks that I found a neurosurgeon and orthopedist who said You have spinal instability Well fuse you and in three weeks youll be playing football  In a   surgeons weld together adjacent vertebrae with a bone graft Its an   operation But for Groopman more surgery made things worse I woke up from the surgery in excruciating pain and basically could hardly move my legs he says And I remember the orthopedic surgeon coming by and saying Well I dont know why youre having so much trouble  But you know if it doesnt get better in a few weeks we could reoperate  Some research suggests that   who have surgery for back pain end up having more surgery For some like Jerry Groopman it doesnt help at all Theres   to think that we are overprescribing painkillers overprescribing injections overprescribing back surgery according to   He is an authority on evidencebased medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University who has studied treatment of back pain One reason invasive treatments for back pain have been rising in recent years Deyo says is the ready availability of   These detailed colorcoded pictures that can show a crosssection of the spine are a technological tour de force But they can be dangerously   Seeing is believing Deyo says And gosh We can actually see degenerated discs we can see bulging discs We can see all kinds of things that are alarming That is they look alarming But theyre most likely not the cause of the pain Lots of people who are painfree actually have terriblelooking MRIs And among those who have MRI abnormalities and pain many specialists question whether the abnormality is really the cause of the pain and whether fixing it can make the pain go away Surgery can help for certain conditions such as a   with leg pain called   But most agerelated back pain usually cant be fixed with surgery Research is showing that the pain often has nothing to do with the mechanics of the spine but with the way the nervous system is behaving according to   of New England Baptist Hospital in Boston Its a change in the way the sensory system is processing information says Rainville who is a physiatrist or specialist in rehabilitation medicine Normal sensations of touch sensations produced by movements are translated by the nervous system into a pain message That process is what drives people completely crazy who have back pain because so many things produce discomfort This is a different way of thinking about pain Normally pain is an alarm bell that says Stop what youre doing right now or you may hurt yourself But for many people that pain is a false signal Its not about looming danger its actually caused by hypersensitive nerves Rainville says that about   of patients with acute back trouble get stuck in an endless loop of pain He thinks this chronic back pain is often due to persistent hypersensitivity of the nervous system Genetics may help explain why back pain becomes chronic for that  percent But whatever the underlying cause Rainville and others have discovered that many of them can learn to ignore their pain That process requires around six weeks of regular visits to a   where specially trained therapists gradually increase the intensity of exercises designed not only to increase the strength and flexibility of the back but also to teach patients that its OK to move normally again Janet Wertheimer is a yearold Massachusetts woman who recently completed Rainvilles boot camp She has had severe back pain on and off for  years One recent morning therapist Lisa Childs put Wertheimer through her paces starting with a rotary torso machine that required her to twist her back this way and that against the resistance of a stack of iron plates Next she moved to a back extension device Wertheimer arched her back against the weight stack  by this point in her rehabilitation  pounds of weight Its something most people with chronic back pain couldnt imagine doing Do you feel like you could do  pounds more or  pounds Childs asks You can try  and Ill see what happens Wertheimer says Wertheimer has a sudden twinge in her back But Childs whos trained to evaluate these things says its OK Wertheimer is building strength And along the way shes learning not to be afraid Its learning not to fear the pain learning that you can live with pain Wertheimer says Understand what that pain is but then put it aside Most patients in Rainvilles boot camp and similar programs find that the pain eventually lessens over a few months Sometimes it even goes away For years after his spinal fusion Groopman was never without back pain He tried a long list of things without success Then a friend suggested that he see Rainville Given his long search for relief Groopman was skeptical But he decided to give Rainvilles boot camp a try He was really tough Groopman recalls He said to me You are worshiping the volcano god of pain And I thought What is this about  Rainville explains In primitive cultures if you lived near a volcano and the volcano started smoking and looking like something was going to happen well it was obviously because gods were mad at you And youd start doing silly things  sacrificing chickens or goats or whatever thinking that that would appease the gods In a strange way Rainville says people with chronic back pain do something very similar They sacrifice parts of their life  playing golf or softball running picking up bags of groceries or grandchildren Patients get so afraid of pain they do anything to avoid it They keep putting things onto this altar thinking thats going to change the situation Rainville says But it usually doesnt work Instead they get more paranoid about any twinge of pain and all the while they lose strength and flexibility Eventually that message sank in with the skeptical Dr Groopman It took about two months for me to really buy in that this was the way to go he says Just let it go Dont pay attention to it  And after about nine months I was basically without any back pain It doesnt work that well for everyone Janet Wertheimer still has some back pain But she says after graduating from boot camp she can pretty much do anything she wants to  ski go on mountain hikes walk her dogs And the pain Most of the time she says she blocks it out and moves on
