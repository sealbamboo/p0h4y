 Apples and especially pears are vulnerable to a nasty bacterial infection called fire blight that left unchecked can spread quickly killing fruit trees and sometimes devastating whole orchards Its basically like a gangrene of your limbs Its hard to stop once it takes hold says   a plant pathologist at Oregon State University Its such a big threat that for decades growers have seen two antibiotics streptomycin and oxytetracycline as vital weapons in the fight to control the disease  even on organic apples and pears But their use has raised questions about transparency in organic labeling amid concerns about the overuse of antibiotics in food production This isnt what consumers expect out of organics says   the director of consumer safety and sustainability at Consumer Reports Organic is supposed to be consistent in meaning she tells The Salt Heres the back story When the US Department of Agricultures national organic labeling standards went into effect in  the two antibiotics were   as synthetic materials approved for use in organic apple and pear production Items on that list are revisited on a periodic basis The notion behind the exemption for these two fruit crops was that in between reviews growers would devise effective nonantibioticbased methods for controlling fire blight But the antibiotic exemption is set to expire in October  This week the National Organic Standards Board is meeting in Portland Ore to decide on a petition from organic growers to extend that exemption Consumers Union the policy arm of Consumer Reports is among the groups who say the answer should be a resounding no Antibiotics have been used in American plant and livestock agriculture since the midth century About  percent of all antibiotics used in the US go to livestock  not just to treat disease and prevent infections but also primarily to help animals put on more weight That heavy usage has been widely blamed for promoting the spread of antibioticresistant bugs And resistance can jump from bacteria that infect livestock to microbes that sicken people The problem of drug resistance has led to widespread calls for reining in the use of antibiotics on farms in order to preserve the medicines effectiveness in treating human disease But antibiotic use in plant agriculture is far more limited  just a little over onetenth of  percent of total agricultural use according to Virginia Stockwell a plant pathologist at Oregon State University who studies fire blight management Put another way about   of antibiotics were used in livestock in  By comparison  pounds of antibiotics were sprayed on fruit trees  mostly on pears and apples according to   she compiled from the USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service In the US up to  percent of all apple acreage and up to  percent of all pear acreage get sprayed with antibiotics each year she says citing data from NASS Thats including all organic and conventionally grown fruit Not every orchard gets sprayed every year There have never been any cases where weve been able to link an antibioticresistant pathogen in humans to orchards says Stockwell who recently conducted   of the literature on the subject for the National Organic Standards Board Research suggests both of the antibiotics used on fruit crops are rendered inactive in soils she says minimizing concerns that residues that drift to the ground after spraying would be a problem Any   on fruit she says is minuscule That said fire blight resistance to streptomycin   a concern for growers  its now pretty common in orchards in the Pacific Northwest Thats one reason why growers have scaled back their spraying over the past two decades Stockwell says Everybody is committed to eliminating this use says   a sustainable agricultural specialist with Washington State University who works with organic farmers in his state But before all organic growers can completely give up antibiotics he says they need to have effective alternatives for preventing the devastation of fire blight Aggressive pruning has helped reduce reliance on antibiotic spraying So has the use of biological controls like bacteria that compete with   the microbe that causes fire blight for nutrients on blossoms But its not enough Oregon States Ken Johnson is one of several researchers overseeing field trials of two promising antibiotic alternatives Id say were fairly close Johnson tells The Salt Hes set to testify about these alternatives before the National Organic Standards Board on Wednesday One option called Blossom Protect is a yeastlike fungus that blocks the fire blight bacteria from colonizing the blossom It was registered for use with the Environmental Protection Agency late into last years growing season so this will be the first year lots of farmers can try it The other alternative a copper sulfate that can be applied during bloom times without harming the fruit has yet to be registered with the agency Both are highly promising according to Johnson  but they need more testing So  he says is still a bit too soon to say goodbye to antibiotics Most people he says when their livelihoods depend on it want to see a few years of positive data before theyre convinced that it is the right thing for them
