For  to  minutes they waited anxiously watching on TV as the massive tornado moved within  miles of their location  Then the power went out  We were hearing it and we knew that it was coming for us Barnhart remembers  The tornado ripped through  miles of central Oklahoma At least  people including nine children were killed according to the state medical examiners office The second floor of the medical center was reduced to rubble Lampposts and other items from the streets were hurled through the walls of the ground floor Cars including Barnharts are now piled upside down and sideways in the parking lot It looks a lot like a junkyard Its pretty amazing that we even walked out alive Barnhart told CNNs Dr Sanjay Gupta  One of the biggest concerns in a tornado is shrapnel Gupta says A loose object or anything thats broken by the force of the storms winds can cause a penetrating and potentially deadly injury  Looking at the destruction its hard to believe some patients walked out of the medical center without a scratch The mattresses and blankets helped protect them from the worst of the storm  Huddled inside the hospital Barnhart says she didnt realize how much damage the tornado had caused until she walked outside and saw the bowling alley across the street  or saw where the bowling alley used to be  Barnhart  is a tiny blonde bundle of faith She called her husband as soon as she could get cell reception after the tornado passed to tell him she loved him She says she wasnt really concerned about her own safety during the storm but worried about friends and family  who all thankfully made it through OK  Weve been blessed by that I know there are lots of families that have been devastated by this and we are definitely praying for them she says Barnhart went back to work Monday night at one of the areas other hospitals where patients at Moore Medical Center were evacuated after the tornado passed  Shes received many thanks for her quick thinking but says its difficult to take credit  I was just doing my job and I knew what I had to do she says Its Jesus that helped us and saved us and I know that he was with us
