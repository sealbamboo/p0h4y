Pakistani gunmen staged new attacks Wednesday on health workers carrying out a nationwide polio vaccination program Six workers were killed Tuesday as they went house to house to administer the immunizations to area children in Karachi and the northwest city of Peshawar Although there were additional attacks the Pakistani government vowed to continue the vaccination campaign  and eradicate the disease  even if there is bloodshed Were committed to this program said Altaf Boson who is the national coordinator for monitoring Pakistans polio vaccination program We dont know who is doing this exactly but we wont let them sabotage what we are doing A conference on the polio vaccination program in Pakistan opened Wednesday at a big hotel in Islamabad and as originally envisioned it would have been an opportunity to applaud progress After seeing more than  cases of polio in Pakistan last year this years total is shaping up to be just  cases But instead there was a definite pall over the room because of the news of the six health workers deaths This is such a noble cause for everybody we never imagined this kind of violent incident said Boson We still dont know the real cause of the killing Local police are investigating Of course there are suspicions The four women who were killed in Karachi were gunned down in Pashtun neighborhoods where members of the Pakistani Taliban are thought to be hiding The Taliban have made no secret of their dislike of Western vaccine programs They maintain that the vaccines are a secret plot against Muslims and that the immunizations render children infertile The CIAs use of an immunization program to spy on Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad only added to the wariness Tuesdays health worker shootings were highly coordinated They all happened within an hour of each other  targeting volunteers who were going house to house Witnesses said masked gunmen on motorcycles opened fire in three different neighborhoods in Karachi A similar story unfolded in Peshawar in northwest Pakistan There a yearold female student volunteer and a male health worker were killed by masked gunmen Another vaccination supervisor and her driver were reportedly killed in Peshawar on Wednesday morning according to local news reports It is really a shock in a society like Pakistan where women are usually not targeted said Dr Malik a doctor who used to run polio vaccine programs for the government but asked that only his last name be used so he could be more candid Targeting the women is the biggest shock to me Are we now moving in a direction that now the women will be killed well see the killing of soft targets He is doubly concerned because of how vital women are to the vaccine program If the female workers are going to be targeted it is going to have definite repercussions on the program in the long run Malik said Thats because women make up about  percent of the  health workers trained to administer the oral vaccine that prevents polio They are needed to go into houses and talk to women  something that culturally men cant do Malik said that if female health workers felt their lives were in danger they might not participate Dr Boson the coordinator of Pakistans polio vaccine program said as regrettable as the killings are the government will not be deterred They cant sabotage this activity we are very committed to this effort he said After the polio conference in Islamabad opened there was news of more attacks Wednesday against health workers including the attack on the vaccination supervisor and her driver Wednesday was supposed to be the last day in this threeday vaccination program It is unclear when the next round will be The government of Sindh province where Karachi is located has suspended the vaccine program until further notice
