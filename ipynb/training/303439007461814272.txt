Don Wright got diagnosed with multiple myeloma at what turned out to be the right time It was  years ago when he was  That was at the beginning of a revolution in treating this oncefearsome   which strikes around   every year The malignancy can literally eat holes in victims bones which can snap from the simple act of bending over to pick up a package The first treatment Wright had was   the sedative that caused awful birth defects in the s But it didnt work for long Then he got into a study of a related drug called   Earlier this month the Food and Drug Administration   the drug which will be marketed as Pomalyst Not only has the drug kept the Minnesota man alive far beyond the three or four years typical for newly diagnosed myeloma patients not so long ago But its also enabled him to keep running marathons In the decade since his diagnosis Wright has averaged seven marathons a year Hes training for his st which will take place in March on Cape Cod Yesterday I ran  miles inside of a soccer dome Wright said recently and then came back and shoveled snow for   hours That was a big day Wright was one of the first patients to get Pomalyst back in  For me this has been a miracle drug he tells Shots Its kept the myeloma stable And its just a little pill Pomalyst is the latest of a halfdozen myeloma drugs developed in the decade or so since Wright got diagnosed Another called Kyprolis   last summer Like many socalled targeted cancer therapies coming out these days the new drugs are enormously expensive Pomalyst will cost about  a month or more than  a year Dr   of the International Myeloma Foundation says the availability of these new drugs has been transformative It really has changed the whole landscape for both the doctor and the patient he says Ten or  years ago it was very depressing to see a new myeloma patient because you knew that the life was potentially short and it was difficult to be overly optimistic about what might transpire Wright is among the  to  percent of patients who have a less aggressive type of myeloma But Durie says virtually all patients are benefiting from the new treatment options We can say that  to  percent of the time we can pretty much guarantee we have a treatment that works  that the patient will go into a remission Durie says Thats pretty remarkable But its not a cure Eventually the first drug regimen  whatever it is  stops working and the cancer comes back But researchers think theyre on the verge of blocking myelomas return for good Were close close close says Dr   of the   in Boston Were soon really going to change the natural history of myeloma in a major way Thats doctorspeak for cure Until specialists achieve that cure they have an expanding bag of tricks to keep the cancer at bay New drug combinations and more novel drugs are coming along Durie notes that scientists presented more than  papers on myeloma at Decembers   meeting In addition to the new medicines many patients get   in an attempt to obliterate nearly all the myeloma cells But Anderson is leading an international study to determine whether the new drug regimens are so good that risky transplants arent needed any more If somebody comes and sees us in the clinic Anderson says you can look them in the eye and say You know its highly likely youre going to live a decade or more And frankly with the maintenance therapy it could be quite a lot longer  Marathoner Don Wright has his own definition of a cure The cure for myeloma he says is to hang on long enough to die of something else And that is precisely my hope  and my plan actually You might say hes in it for the long run
