People who have a cynical distrust of others and think their motives are selfish could have a higher risk of developing dementia a study has said  Researchers compared levels of cynical distrust in  people with the incidence of dementia  They said people with high levels of distrust were twice as likely to develop dementia  Experts said any findings that helped understand the disease were important but called for larger studies  Dementia is a syndrome categorised by a decline in memory thinking speed mental agility language understanding and judgement  One in three people aged over  in Britain will develop dementia according to the Alzheimers Society in the UK  In  volunteers with an average age of  were asked to rate their agreement with statements such as I think people would lie to get ahead or it is safer to trust nobody said the researchers   Scientists at the University of Eastern Finland said  people had developed dementia in the following decade Fourteen of the  people who showed high levels of cynical distrust in  had developed dementia in this time compared with nine out of the  people with low levels Dr AnnaMaija Tolppanen at the University of Eastern Finland led the study  She said These results add to the evidence that peoples view on life and personality may have an impact on their health  Explaining the results Dr Tolppanen said People with different personality traits may be more or less likely to engage in activities that are beneficial for cognition such as healthy diet cognitive or social activities or exercise  Or personality may act via morphological changes or structural differences in brains Also inflammation has been suggested as one link between cynicism and worse health outcomes  She said the study was controlled for socioeconomic factors age sex health status and lifestyle such as smoking and alcohol use  But Dr Tolppanen said she had not accounted for people becoming depressed after the first stage of the assessment or that the volunteers depression might not have showed up adequately in questionnaires  She added it was really important to replicate the findings on a much larger scale to prove the link  Dr Simon Ridley head of research at Alzheimers Research UK said With the rising numbers of people affected with dementia any addition our understanding of what might affect disease development is important He said that as only a small number of people in the study developed dementia he would want to see a larger study conducted to be more confident in the proposed link   Dr Ridley said the volunteers with a high level of cynical distrust could have been already beginning to develop dementia and that depression which may be both a risk factor and a symptom for dementia could account for the cynicism  The biggest risk factor for dementia is age by far he said
