Researchers in Oxford have developed a degradable implant which they say has huge potential to improve surgical success rates The protective patch which wraps round soft tissue repairs will be trialled in patients with shoulder injuries  It is hoped in time this approach could help patients with other conditions including arthritis hernias and heart defects The implant has been developed using a mix of modern and ancient technology Kevin Senior experiences pain every time he lifts his right arm He has torn the tendons in his shoulder Mr Senior who is  is a plumbing engineer so this gives him serious difficulties in his work Even combing his hair or shaving causes him problems He is looking forward to having an operation next year at Nuffield Orthopaedic Hospital in Oxford Its very frustrating but obviously youve got to do the best you can Hopefully when its repaired Ill be able to do everything but as it stands now you just struggle on There are  of these shoulder repair operations carried out each year in England and Wales The figure has risen by  in the last decade But one in four procedures is not successful because the tendon tears again The surgeon who will operate on Kevin Seniors shoulder Professor Andrew Carr has led a research project to improve the success rate and ensure a quicker recovery This collaboration between the university and the hospital trust helps move ideas quickly from the lab to the clinic  Professor Carrs team have developed a protective patch  an implant which wraps around the surgical repair like a splint  One side is made of resilient woven material to help it withstand the stresses of movement after surgery  The other side is made of thread spun a hundred times finer than human hair  Its surface encourages cells to grip and bond as they would naturally in a much younger patient Professor Carr says the results in laboratory tests have been encouraging and they hope to start clinical trials in patients soon  Weve used modern technology to produce very fine fibres which have the extraordinary ability to direct the way cells behave and wake up tired and ageing cells and make them want to heal whereas previously they werent being made to want to heal The material in the patch is degradable and disappears after a few months Professor Carr says this is important for patients in their s s and s who want to get back to work and may well live for several decades Once the repair process has taken place we would rather not have a piece of foreign material sitting in someones body for the rest of their lives because experience has shown us that ultimately the body will respond and reject that tissue The project uses the best in modern and ancient technology Alongside the humming whirring and beeping of the latest laboratory gadgetry is the click and snap of a manually operated wooden handloom  perfect for producing the patchs protective cover  One of the team Osnat Hakimi says the loom enabled them to use small quantities of expensive fibre and investigate its properties  Scientists may look very technological but they are very fond of simplicity and crafts Using our hands is something we do a lot in the lab So actually working with a handloom is something that went down quite well Less than  of government funding for medical research goes on surgery but Professor Carr says this approach is relatively inexpensive and has huge potential to benefit patients We might be able to use it for other applications such as early arthritis management where we want to regenerate cartilage repair of hernias repair of bladder walls repair of heart defects
