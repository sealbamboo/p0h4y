Stimulating the brain with a very small electrical current through the forehead could boost a students ability to learn and remember basic mathematics a provocative experiment suggests The work   Thursday by the journal   could help those who struggle with mental arithmetic But the study was small and the longterm effect wasnt profound The study tested something called transcranial random noise stimulation a technique that sends a tiny current to the brain The current generated by a small electronic device is delivered through two electrodes attached to the temple The electricity seems to affect the brains neurons which themselves use electrical signals to communicate with each other The results are preliminary and alpha parents seeking an edge for their children shouldnt risk electrocution Do not try this at home says   a psychologist at the University of Oxford in the UK Some studies suggest that up to  in  of us has difficulty learning basic math according to Thompson Thompson and her colleagues thought that very slight electrical stimulation could help Electrical stimulation has sometimes been shown to boost basic cognitive skills Thompson says To find out if it could help with more complex brain functions the team tried mathematics They took  students and asked them to memorize a series of madeup mathematical equations For example      The idea was to test their ability to memorize sums that they hadnt seen before All the students had two electrodes stuck to their foreheads but only half received the tiny electrical signal The signal was too small to be felt and even the researchers conducting the tests didnt know who had received a signal and who hadnt When they went back and checked they found that those who had received the stimulation appeared to memorize their sums faster and better than those who hadnt Moreover the effect seemed to last for six months after the stimulation But it wasnt as strong Researchers arent quite sure how it works but coauthor author Thompson says that the electrical signal may get brain cells synchronized Kind of like if you have eight rowers in a boat if theyre all rowing together they go faster she says Researchers hope that their new technique could eventually be developed into a tool to help those with learning disabilities or anyone who finds they are severely math challenged But Thompson says that more research is needed to see what method of stimulation works best
