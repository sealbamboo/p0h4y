  When I pick up a packed food the very first thing I do is read the ingredient list And while my training has left me familiar with most I sometimes still spot additives that leave me scratching my head most recently thaumatin a natural sweetener I hadnt yet heard about  My previous modus operandi would be to whip out my iPhone and do a quick Google search but this app from Center for Science in the Public Interest CSPI may offer a shortcut It provides a brief description of over  additives along with an overall evaluation of either safe cut back caution avoid or certain people should avoid Even if I dont always agree with the rating I appreciate the summary so I can make my own informed decision about whether or not to let an ingredient into my grocery cart   I think its always best to go organic when you can but the benefits of fitting in at least five daily servings of fruits and veggies outweigh the risks of consuming nonorganic varieties That said I want to do my best to minimize my pesticide exposure and thats exactly what this app helps me to It lists the Dirty Dozen  the  most contaminated types of produce as well as the Clean Fifteen  those least likely to contain multiple pesticide residues I know many of these by heart but  types is a lot to keep track of so accessing the lists in just a few clicks is super helpful when Im at my local grocery store or farmers market By the way pineapple is one of the Clean Fifteen   This multifaceted app shows users how to select sustainable seafood options both regionally and nationally by using a red yellow or green rating red means either overfished or caught or farmed in ways that harm other marine life or the environment yellow means better and green indicates the best all around options for the environment But my favorite tool is the Super Green list which includes sustainable choices that are also low in common contaminants like mercury and PCBs and high in healthy omega fatty acids Based on the app I see Alaskan salmon in my hubbys future In addition to helping me find healthy alternatives to fast food wherever I am this app identifies healthy food markets juice joints coffee houses artisan food shops vegan options and farmers markets I even found some new spots in my own neighborhood I hadnt heard about yet and I can suggest my own favorites that are missing Love love love What doesnt this app do Fooducates database contains over  products each with a letter grade based on nutritional value along with things to know about a product like if it contains any artificial additives and healthy alternatives Using your phones camera you can also scan a products UPC code to access quick info  I tried it with my unsweetened almond milk and it suggested a DIY recipe for how to make my own which I have done but not in a while so good reminder The app also allows you to search for foods by category or brand name so if Im at a market and want to look for the healthiest mustard for example I can search the app first rather than having to inspect every jar on the shelf   I could spend hours scrolling through this app In addition to charting whats in season each month of the year I love being able to search the produce list alphabetically to access key nutrients and tips about how to select store and prep my favorite plants There are also deliciously simple recipes for each fruit and veggie from grilled radishes to ratatouille sauteed cabbage and pickled beets my mouth is watering just typing this Truly an app that lives up to its name I love to get creative in the kitchen but I also find inspiration from browsing existing recipes From new ways to enjoy staples like quinoa to ideas based on course salads side dishes soups cuisine Cajun Moroccan Southwest or special diet gluten free vegan low sodium this app is fun userfriendly and offers some pretty cool features including shopping lists meal planners and On Hand which provides suggestions based on typing in the ingredients you already have I recently moved to a new neighborhood so Im still getting to know the healthy selections in my area Seamless is making it easier because I can narrow my take out options by the designation healthy or search ethnic cuisines known for healthy dishes like Japanese and Mediterranean  Even better I can sort further based on price rating distance estimated delivery time or new restaurants only and once my order is placed a tracker will let me know when its ready Healthy convenience Because GMO foods arent labeled as such one of the only ways to avoid them is to buy USDA certified organic products But thats not practical  of the time and while GMO seeds and ingredients are not supposed to be used in organic products no testing is required to show whether GMO crosspollination or contamination has occurred  Enter this app which features a list of the brands and products enrolled in the NonGMO Projects Product Verification Program According to ABC News  of those polled believe that GMO products should be labeled and nearly  say theyd be less likely to buy GMO foods If you agree this app takes away the guesswork  search by product type brand name product name and keyword I adore this app Its so simple yet so impactful Simply set your pace from  seconds to three minutes press start savor your food and dont take another bite until the interval has ended and the bite bell goes off  Eating slower has been shown to enhance meal enjoyment boost satiety and result in naturally eating less In my experience with clients it can also help break the habit of multitasking which can lead to mindlessly overeating or disconnected eating which can trigger bloating or lingering cravings  If you tend to eat fast use the app to work your way up from  or  seconds between bites to one minute one and half then two and three Pacing yourself even once a day can result in eating slower at every meal and I bet youll be amazed at the impact
