A cashstrapped NHS trust which provides mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk is not in crisis its chairman has insisted Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust which needs to cut m from its m annual budget over four years is proposing to axe  roles Last month a whistleblower spoke out about   Trust chairman Gary Page said he absolutely rejected union claims that the trust was in crisis He was speaking after Unison officials told BBC Radio Suffolk the trust was absolutely in crisis  About  people are being made redundant as part of the cuts  The trust which employs about  is yet to appoint a chief executive following the resignation of Aidan Thomas in June It was criticised after it emerged some patients had been offered beds    some as far away as Scotland Mr Page said Im not going to sit here and pretend that we arent facing significant challenges as a trust in some parts of our service because we are Were having to make significant savings thats not something of our choosing  Our income is  lower this year it will be nearly  lower in each of the next two years and our costs are going up by  per annum He said some staff who had been made redundant had been contacted about other vacant roles in an attempt to save money I do accept there are challenges out there and we want to work constructively with Unison and others to address those challenges but talking this up as a crisis is not in the interests of our service users and is a disservice to our staff I think theres a real danger that by talking that up we scare some of the most vulnerable people in the county away from accessing the services they need
