Statins the widely used cholesterollowering drugs may have a role in surgical wound healing a new analysis suggests The review   covered  studies of statins and surgical wound healing They demonstrated various mechanisms by which statins can lower inflammation improve the mechanical strength of a healing wound promote the growth of blood vessels and reduce healing time Most were animal or laboratory tissue studies but two were studies in humans In one a retrospective study of  patients having hernia surgery statins showed no beneficial effect but the study failed to account for the use of bloodthinning drugs which may have affected the results The other in six human volunteers showed that statins can reduce the activity of one of the mediators of inflammation  white blood cell production  without affecting its beneficial function in healing The lead author of the review Dr Gerard J Fitzmaurice a cardiac surgeon at Our Ladys Childrens Hospital in Dublin said that most cardiac patients were already on statins before surgery and that the drugs were extremely safe  The caveat here is that the majority of this is animal research he said But a human randomized trial is now merited to properly answer the question If statins are beneficial it could be a big progression in wound management
