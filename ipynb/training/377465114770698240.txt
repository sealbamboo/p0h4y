But a closer look reveals Caroline is feeding yearold Eden Eden cannot talk or walk She needs help sitting up and doing most anything a girl her age should be doing on her own   Eden has a progressive neurological disorder called Mucolipidosis Type IV also known as ML  Its a rare genetic disease that is more common among Ashkenazi Jews or people of Eastern and Central European Jewish descent There is no treatment or cure Edens mental development was halted at  months old She is expected to go blind by age   Doctors say she will not live beyond early adulthood   Edens diagnosis was confirmed just before the Jewish New Year in September  Instead of focusing on the wonderful things the next year would bring Caroline says their familys dreams were shattered   Anything that we had dreamed and hoped for our family at that point was broken Done  ML is preventable So how did this happen  Caroline and Randy struggled with that very question Knowing that one in five Ashkenazi Jews in the United States are carriers for a genetic disease the Golds were screened before they got married Or so they thought  Caroline was screened for just eight of the  Jewish genetic diseases that were being screened for in  Randy was screened for two Proponents for standardized screening say it could have spared or prepared the Golds for what they are going through with Eden  Screening assesses a couples reproductive risk says Karen Arnovitz Grinzaid a genetic counselor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta Couples who are both carriers for the same disease have a  chance of passing that disease onto their children  Many of these disorders are fatal says Dr Stephen Warren the chair of the department of human genetics at Emory and they can severely impact patients quality of life When Randy and Caroline met their love blossomed quickly They dated for eight months before getting engaged and were married three months later  They didnt waste time starting a family either Fifteen months after their walk down the aisle they welcomed Natanel into their lives The Golds now a family were living the dream That dream included a bigger family Eden was born two years later   But when Eden was just  months old Caroline started wondering whether something was wrong with her precious little girl She couldnt quite put her finger on it At first Eden didnt seem to be meeting her milestones on time Then they noticed she had low muscle tone At  months Eden started physical therapy and had surgery to correct her crossed eyes Doctors hoped shed have a better view of the world and everything else would fall into place  The pediatrician continued to reassure Caroline that every child develops at her own rate  At one point Caroline was even told she should stop comparing her second child to her first and just enjoy her daughter   We finally decided that being told Shes gonna be fine or Not to worry so much just wasnt enough Caroline remembers  Against their pediatricians advice they took Eden to a neurologist who did an MRI on her brain Caroline and Randy hold back tears as they remember the phone call from the neurologist at  pm He didnt know what was wrong with their daughter he said but it wasnt good  It was more than a sad moment Randy says It was the beginning of what became a lot of sad moments The neurologist ran more tests before referring Eden to a geneticist  The geneticist thought it might be a Jewish genetic disease but the Golds told him they had been screened  Still when he described ML Randy remembers thinking he had just described Eden They waited two agonizing weeks for the lab to confirm the diagnosis    As difficult as it was to hear the news about Eden the Golds never ask Why us  Instead Randy says We decided to make sure that the tragedy of Edens story doesnt happen to another family  They started by creating a comprehensive education program to teach doctors rabbis and young couples in their community about the risks Then they lobbied insurance companies and medical labs to standardize genetic screening make it more accessible and lower the cost   Their work inspired the Marcus Foundation and Emory University School of Medicine to create JScreen a Webbased national screening program for the  most common Jewish genetic diseases including ML that launched this month While its targeted at the Jewish population the site also offers an expanded screening panel to check for a total of  genetic diseases which may be more appropriate for nonJewish spouses of a Jewish carrier or for those who are unsure of their ancestry    Theres no trip to the doctor or needle needed to draw blood People who are interested in being screened can visit   read about the screening test and request a kit  A box with the saliva test is then sent to the individuals home with instructions and an envelope to return the completed kit to the lab  Approximately four weeks later results are discussed with a genetic counselor over the phone Additional counseling can then be scheduled with a local genetic counselor  The kit costs  for most people with insurance and  if you are uninsured          Unlike directtoconsumer genetic testing offered by companies such as   JScreen is a nonprofit program with an educational component  Every request for screening is reviewed by a genetic counselor at Emory University before a kit is sent out to make sure that the patient fully understands what the results can and cannot tell them  Warren believes genetic testing will be part of routine medical care for every potential parent in the coming years JScreen is just the start he says We are looking at this as a prototype to see how well we can do this for the general population Prevention is the goal says Grinzaid who is also the senior director of outreach initiatives for JScreen In every ethnic group there are diseases  unless you have screening you can have an affected kid  Carrier screening programs for Jewish genetic diseases have seen success in the past she says in the s and s the fatal condition TaySachs was reduced by approximately  But genetics is a rapidly changing field the human body has hundreds of thousands of genes and mutations and new ones are being discovered   New screening tests are also being developed quickly When the Golds were married in  screening tests were available for  Jewish genetic diseases Now scientists can screen for up to   Warren says parents of children affected by these types of diseases overwhelmingly say they would have wanted to know before they became pregnant Armed with the right knowledge a couple may chose to avoid the risk by using alternative pregnancy paths such as adoption or in vitro fertilization If theres a risk a couple could also choose to have amniocentesis or CVS testing done during pregnancy to check the fetus The results could give the parents time to plan for the birth of a baby that will need special care Or they may choose to end the pregnancy says Grinzaid   Aware of their risk Caroline and Randy Gold added a beautiful healthy baby girl to their family last year They used preimplantation genetic testing and IVF to ensure their new little one would not have ML The Golds celebrated the Jewish New Year again last week with their three beautiful children This year they are hoping to encourage  people to get screened for preventable genetic diseases  Eden is here to save lives and if thats what shes here to do there is no life more noble than that Randy says
