Approval has been given for a study where some cardiac arrest patients will be given a dummy drug rather than adrenaline to kickstart their heart There are concerns that adrenaline used for more than  years as a key part of resuscitation can do more harm than good But the study will mean some patients across England and Wales being given a placebo without their consent Experts say the research throws up a number of ethical challenges More than  people suffer cardiac arrests outside of hospitals each year in the UK  During arrests their hearts stop beating properly preventing blood from being pumped around the body Most people do not survive  currently only  leave hospital alive  Paramedics follow a protocol for anyone found without a sufficient heartbeat  this can involve chest compressions shocking the heart with a defibrillator and giving a shot of adrenaline  But over the past decade some scientists have suggested adrenaline could do more harm than good  There is some evidence it may damage the brain by reducing blood supply to the head and could diminish the chances of survival  The Warwick University study will involve  people in London Wales the West Midlands and the South Coast and northeast of England who have a cardiac arrest  Half the patients will receive the dummy medicine and half will get adrenaline  but as they will be unconscious there will be no consent gathered as the drug is administered  Paramedics will also not attempt to get consent from relatives or passersby as the researchers emphasise that time is critical during resuscitation  But they say local residents will be given information on the trial and details about how to opt out Depending on local arrangements this could involve ringing their ambulance service and being put on a computerised register  but details are yet to be finalised After the arrest relatives will not be told whether their family members received the drug or the dummy version Dr Daniel Sokol a medical ethicist and barrister who is not involved in the study said A challenging aspect of this research is the lack of informed consent regarding a lifeanddeath intervention   The question then is Is this research sufficiently potentially beneficial that we can forego proper consent There will always be a drive to update conventional medical practice as science advances And at the heart of modern trials is the idea of informed consent  all participants must agree to take part and be told about the risks   But gaining consent for studies looking at lifeanddeath situations is difficult People who are unconscious  either after a cardiac arrest or in intensive care for example will not be able to give consent while a study is taking place  This raises questions about how to ethically advance treatment for cardiac arrest  which has extremely poor survival rates The results of the trial could save many lives But the researchers feel the only way to get these answers involves testing on a group of patients who cannot be part of the decisionmaking process  And scientists will have grappled with the question of whether to inform relatives about the trial  whether the patient survives or not Researchers stress they have had lengthy discussions with the Oxford research ethics committee that granted approval for the study  Prof Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation said It is important to remember we dont actually know whether this routine use of adrenaline is a safe and effective practice  The concern is it could be doing patients more harm than good The only way to answer this crucially important question is to do a welldesigned clinical trial It is always difficult to conduct a trial in situations where people are too ill to give their consent But there are well established ethical guidelines for undertaking such studies  What is unacceptable is to continue giving a treatment that could be doing more harm than good The study will start in the autumn
