If aging is not for sissies thats especially true if youre homeless You can be on your feet for hours or forced to sleep in the frigid cold or seriously ill with no place to go But increasingly the nations homeless population is getting older By some estimates more than half of single homeless adults are  or older And theres growing alarm about what this means  both for the aging homeless and for those who have to foot the bill The cost to society especially for health care and social services could mushroom As in many cities across the country there are plenty of homeless people in Baltimore Md  about  by the latest count In the early morning hours dozens of bundledup men carrying backpacks and duffle bags emerge from an unmarked door next to a parking garage downtown This is the citys overflow homeless shelter for men and the residents need to be out by  am before office workers start to arrive downtown for the day Paul Behler  says hes been homeless for about a year and a half ever since he lost his job as a concert piano tuner and restorer Behler says some days he feels like hes  years old Havent got to  yet thank Lord he laughs Still he says he had to go to the hospital emergency room recently because he had a bout of severe tendonitis and couldnt walk without a cane The emergency room is a frequent destination for the homeless in every city across the US The list of ailments for those living on the streets is long  blood clots chronic pain exposure diabetes Its even longer for those in their s and s which is considered elderly when youre homeless The life expectancy is only  On a recent chilly morning some men head from the Baltimore shelter to their jobs as cooks or handymen Others go to the citys day shelter to get warm Still others head to a nearby clinic run by a nonprofit group called Health Care for the Homeless which opens at  am About a dozen people spent the night outside the clinic sleeping on the concrete steps Its something of a safe haven Here as in similar clinics across the country a growing percentage of patients are  and older Nursing services coordinator Yvonne Jauregui says many of them are in pretty bad shape by the time they arrive Their priority isnt to get preventive care Its to make sure theres a roof over their head and food in their stomach she says Jauregui notes dental care as an example She says its not a priority at all Its until I cant chew because my tooth hurts so bad and the tooth needs to come out  thats when we see them she says And that makes treatment a lot more difficult There are other challenges for the homeless Diabetics have nowhere to refrigerate their insulin Theyre not allowed to bring syringes needed for such medication into homeless shelters Medication is often stolen And sometimes those with serious foot and leg problems cant get to a doctor They are prone to having a lot of foot issues says Jauregui Plus its like their primary mode of transportation Sixtyfouryearold Linwood Hearne is a case in point He and his wife have been homeless for four years I cant balance myself I cant walk well Im getting very forgetful Hearne says I have prostate cancer I have a lot of mental problems thats going on with me Im a paranoid schizophrenic I suffer from manic depression Dennis Culhane social policy professor at the University of Pennsylvania says individuals like Hearne are increasingly common Were looking at a group of people who are sort of prematurely reaching old age says Culhane whos done extensive research on demographics and homelessness He says the growth in the aging homeless population is due largely to one group  younger baby boomers  those born between  and  He notes that they came of age in the late s and s amid backtoback recessions and a crack cocaine epidemic Culhane says individuals in this age group are almost twice as likely as those in other age groups to be homeless These are folks who have been living on the margins in and out of jail in and out of shelters in and out of treatment programs for the last thirty thirty five years he says Culhane says people are just coming to grips with what that means A few communities have started to build special housing for the elderly homeless Baltimore and other cities are also trying to get those most likely to die on the streets into permanent supportive housing But funds are limited Culhane and other experts say its going to cost a lot more to do nothing Its cheaper to have them in housing than it is to have them be homeless he says But getting housing isnt easy for those with limited means And Hearne like lots of people living in the streets has a history marred with mistakes He was evicted from public housing years ago because he stabbed a neighbor in a fight But he says hes already served his sentence  a threeyear probation  and shouldnt be condemned to life and maybe death on the street Hearne and his wife have slept outside for much of the past four years mostly under a highway across from the Health Care for the Homeless clinic There are blankets bags and mattresses stacked there along a cement wall and a few white buckets used as urinals About two dozen people sleep there every night I know it looks terrible but this was our home Hearne says We shouldnt have to live like this With that he leans over to pick something up off the ground Its a penny A penny a day keeps the doctor away right he asks Thats what they say What they really say is that its good luck And maybe it worked Health Care for the Homeless later found Hearne and his wife a new place to live
