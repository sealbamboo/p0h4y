A dear old friend fits that profile Stooped and finally reconciled to a walker she grieves a husband lost to Alzheimers disease while ensconced in a dated fourbedroom house atop a canyon in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles Ive begged her to move more times than I can count and surely more times than she wanted to hear  She has tolerated my entreaties with probably more forbearance than if she were my real mother not a beloved surrogate Her mind is clear her will strong and her way of making decisions  slow and steady  has always worked for her So shes held her ground  Along the way she has taught me two lessons   Know when to butt out because youre not always right  Move the furniture  The latter is useful shorthand like shift your weight when you get stuck in life But its literal advice too Some will argue that rearranging the chairs is a superficial response to a deep problem Lately Im not so sure Up in the hills of Los Angeles my elderly friend Im not going to name her as I suspect her children might object has succeeded in making changes to her home that have nothing to do with handicap accessibility long ago done and everything to do with emotional wellbeing  On a recent visit I was assigned the master bedroom rather than the small guest room Whats not to like A kingsized bed Sliding doors to the patio Only when the rest of the household was asleep did I permit myself tears  I loved her late husband also like a surrogate parent His favorite books were on the shelves his swimming goggles still on the edge of the sink How could I possibly sleep in their bed  And if I couldnt I realized during my first fitful night how could she So shed moved down the hall to the narrow bed in the guest room where Id slept so many times Now the room had an easy chair and ottoman piled with the books and magazines she was reading The desk was reorganized so she could do her bookkeeping The closet held her clothes The walls were hung with pictures from her life including a poster from her college reunion Tufts class of     Elsewhere in the house I found the changes were less dramatic but numerous The living room had always been used less than the family room Now the furniture in the two had been reversed The nicer couch formerly in the living room now was enjoyed daily not just once in a blue moon It looked brand new its leather unscuffed and it was set at a fashionable angle rather than up against the wall  In front of it a huge glass coffee table also from the living room replaced the narrow woodslatted one that had been there before  The dining room table was laid with rush place mats nothing fancy but a freshening touch In the kitchen new appliances gleamed in economical white rather than pricy stainless steel  A new filter basket to make coffee was metal mesh rather than stained plastic The silverware drawers had been rearranged Cookies and cereal were stored where pots used to be and vice versa  As a longtime guest it took some getting used to and I fumbled to find things Still I came to marvel at her good sense Most of these changes were less dramatic than the bedroom switch I realized but all in service of the same principle Not to forget a dead husband but to remember and move forward at the same time  My first morning there I screwed up my courage to tell her how wrenching it had been to sleep in their bed And how disconcerting to find so much in the house changed  I have to go on she told me It will never be the same and I dont want it to be but I need reminders that this is my life now physical reminders and all this helps And so I have learned yet another thing from her To be more humble giving advice to the elderly about their homes and to keep my big mouth closed unless and until I see theyre at risk  Its a lesson that doesnt come naturally  Before leaving I observed that a trellis attached to the house was rotting Find out if its termites I told her and if the exterminator cant totally get rid of them tear it down before they find their way into the house   Oops  But since then despite high temperatures and high winds in Southern California  fire weather in the canyons  Ive resisted calling to say as I have so many times before that its not safe to be in a house with a shake roof  Shes doing fine figuring things out on her own
