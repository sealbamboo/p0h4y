Patients must be given clearer information before they undergo a common operation for heart disease a London cardiologist has said People with stable angina should be told angioplasty would not reduce death risk or heart attack but may relieve symptoms said Dr Aseem Malhotra This should be clear on patient consent forms he wrote in a medical journal The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society said there was no evidence of inappropriate treatment in the UK  Angioplasty helps ensure a blood supply to the heart using a tube called a stent to open up a narrowed artery  For people who have had a heart attack it can be a lifesaver  It may also be provided for patients before their condition becomes unstable to relieve symptoms of chest pain  People with angina suffer pain caused by restricted blood supply to the heart   If there is an obvious trigger such as exercise it is called stable angina  They may be offered angioplasty if medication does not ease their symptoms  In a commentary in the   Dr Malhotra  a consultant cardiologist said these patients  more than  in the UK each year  were rarely told the operation would not help prevent heart attacks or prolong life  The elephant in the room is that randomised studies have not demonstrated outcomes benefit for stenting stable coronary artery disease in addition to optimal medical therapy despite its widespread use he said Dr Malhotra cited one study in the US that found  of patients having angioplasty thought it would prevent a heart attack  He believes the figure in the UK would be similar He is concerned the system of payment by activity for hospitals in England may incentivise these procedures and there may also be some unnecessary treatment carried out by the private sector Dr Malhotra argues this issue should be mandatory in securing consent to reduce any harm that may be caused by the operations and to curb unnecessary costs   It is imperative to provide patients with all the information before subjecting them to a procedure that still carries a  risk of heart attack stroke or death he said A spokesman for the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society said there was no evidence in the UK that patients has been treated inappropriately  He said changing the consent form was not the best way of ensuring patients understood their treatment  But Prof Terence Stephenson chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges backed the call This is an example of a legitimate debate of appropriate or inappropriate use of clinical procedures or interventions he said  This is an issue of increasing importance to the medical profession It is primarily about providing appropriate good quality care but is particularly important when resources are limited The academy will publish a report on waste in the NHS after the summer
