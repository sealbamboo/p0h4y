 An   instituted a year ago by researchers because of concerns that a mutated form of the virus could fall into the wrong hands has been lifted In a letter published Jan  in the journals   and   the  scientists who first agreed to halt any study of the HN flu virus until safety guidelines were established now say that labs in countries that have since established such measures can resume their work However the United States is not one of those countries so any bird or avian flu research there is still on hold the group said It is believed that all of the conditions the moratorium was initially installed to meet have been met Ron Fouchier of the department of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands said during a Wednesday news conference on   In our opinion in those countries where research can be done safely research should restart The risk of this information in the  Fouchier added Fouchier said his lab would not be restarting experiments immediately but that certainly it will not take months to start Probably in the next few weeks Ending the moratorium is necessary for public health reasons those scientists who signed the letter stated We believe this research is important to pandemic preparedness said Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin Madison Our research to understand how avian viruses adapt to mammals will lead to better surveillance and vaccines The greater risk is not doing research that could help us to be better equipped to deal with a pandemic The furor started in December  when concerns that research into a   or fall into the hands of bioterrorists This prompted US scientific advisers to ask   and   to withhold key details of the groundbreaking research conducted by Kawaoka and Fouchier So far the socalled avian flu strains have rarely been transmitted from birds to humans But the genetically modified virus that was created by scientists in the United States and Holland has been more transmissible in animal experiments potentially setting the stage for a deadly pandemic among humans Last April the US government gave the goahead for publication of two controversial studies led by Kawaoka and Fouchier The research revealed that as few as five mutations are enough to make the HN avian flu virus transmissible via airborne droplets between ferrets considered one of the best animal models to study flu and its impact on humans In countries where research will resume some of the tighter standards will include strict biosafety guidelines for the laboratories where such research is conducted Scientists have also signed documents affirming that they will not share the mutated virus with other parties without permission of the funder In addition to the Netherlands Canada is poised to start research again although discussions are still under way in Japan Kawaoka said Kawaoka said he did not know when research might begin again in the United States The US has been unclear in how long it would take Fouchier added If the US would have said at the National Institutes of Health meeting in November of last year that it would take another three months we probably would have waited But we did not get that answer It may take one two three years he continued Many countries do this research Should all countries really wait for the US and why Dr Anthony Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the United States has done as much as we can as far as addressing the concerns He said a system for evaluating the safety of proposed HN transmission research in mammals up for public comment this month should allow federally funded research within weeks   reported
