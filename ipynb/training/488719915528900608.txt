A few years ago Illinois Medicaid program for the poor noticed some odd trends in its billings for group psychotherapy sessions Nursing home residents were being taken several times a week to offsite locations and Medicaid was picking up the tab for both the services and the transportation And then there was this The sessions were often being performed by obstetriciangynecologists oncologists and urologists  people who didnt have any training really in psychiatry Illinois Medicaid director Theresa Eagleson recalled So Medicaid began cracking down and spending plummeted after new rules were implemented In July  the program   for residents of nursing homes Yet Illinois doctors are still billing the federal Medicare program for large numbers of the same services a ProPublica analysis of federal data shows Medicare paid Illinois providers for more than  group psychotherapy sessions in   more than twice as many sessions as were reimbursed to providers in New York the state with the secondhighest total Among the highest billers for group psychotherapy in Illinois were three OBGYNs and a thoracic surgeon The four combined for  sessions that year more than the total for all providers in the state of California They were reimbursed more than  by Medicare in  just for psychotherapy sessions according to an analysis of a separate Medicare data set released in April Thats not good Eagleson said when told of the Medicare numbers Medicares recent data release has led to a string of analyses showing how waste and fraud is inflating the nations bill for health care This work has echoed the findings of ProPublicas investigation last year into Medicares prescription drug program known as Part D which had fewer barriers to waste and fraud than other government health care programs  and was making less effective use of its own data Of the Illinois OBGYNs billing for group psychotherapy   had the highest number of sessions She was paid for  sessions in  at a cost to Medicare of  In  the state Department of Financial and Professional Regulation   for failing to evaluate a patient undergoing an abortion prior to anesthesia and failing to collaborate with a certified registered nurse anesthetist The terms of her probation didnt prohibit providing psychotherapy Efforts to reach Kamper for comment were unsuccessful A OBGYN named   billed for  group psychotherapy services He declined to comment The thirdhighestbilling OBGYN   charged Medicare for  group therapy sessions In a brief interview he said he doesnt do them anymore Okwuje was barred from Medicare and Medicaid from  to  records show though the reason wasnt immediately available Thoracic surgeon   said he began working with a company that offered group psychotherapy because he had to go on disability and could no longer perform surgeries He had been experiencing episodes in which he temporarily lost consciousness Medicare paid  for more than  of his sessions in  though Lubienski shared a tax form showing he received only about  from the company Unified Therapeutics I basically supervise social workers who run therapy sessions in intermediate and longterm care facilities for people who have psychiatric diagnoses Lubienski said Im there I pitch in I discuss things with the residents and stuff We have a calendar of Medicareapproved topics that we go by And for residents who cant participate in the group sessions we see them individually Lubienski also was paid for  psychiatric interviews to diagnose mental illness Lubienski said he doesnt see a problem with doctors who are not psychiatrists performing these services In certain states its mandated that the facilities have to offer these services yet theres nowhere near enough psychiatrists psychologists doctors social workers to do it he said Unified Therapeutics chief executive Todd Occomy said his company stopped providing the service in  after the Medicaid changes in Illinois and has essentially ceased operations We were just getting squeezed he said It got to the point where we could barely pay our physicians Aaron Albright a spokesman for the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in an email that Medicare has no policy regarding which physicians may perform group psychotherapy During such sessions personal and group dynamics are discussed and explored in a therapeutic setting allowing emotional catharsis instruction insight and support according to rules set out by one of Medicares contractors Group psychotherapy doesnt cover such activities as socialization music therapy art classes excursions sensory stimulation or eating together Typically groups can be no larger than  people Albright said he couldnt comment on individual providers but added that deterring improper payments is a top priority for CMS in order to protect beneficiaries and taxpayers The billings for group psychotherapy reveal other unusual patterns A Queens NY primary care doctor   was paid for more sessions than anyone else in the country   He accounted for nearly  in every  sessions delivered in the entire state of New York in Medicare separate data show He didnt return messages left at his office Another large biller was   a social worker in Detroit She was reimbursed for nearly  group therapy sessions for her  Medicare patients an average of  each She also billed for  individual psychotherapy visits for the same  patients who allegedly would have received an average of  therapy sessions apiece in  Gordon couldnt be reached for comment A Chicago internist named   who billed for  sessions said he served two nursing homes and used books to help guide his discussions with patients We take the subjects from those books and we discuss it he said Zureikat said he no longer practices as an internist but works three or four hours a week providing the therapy sessions and also is president of a local managed care organization It is not that I enjoy it it is something to do and it is useful to the residents and their families and the nursing home Zureikat said To limit group psychotherapy billings Illinois Medicaid   patients to no more than two sessions in a sevenday period with a maximum of one a day It then began requiring that physicians who bill for group psychotherapy complete a psychiatry residency program or be part of one The rules brought immediate results In the year before September  when the first changes were instituted the program paid  million for these services including almost  million to a single urologist In the year afterward the spending dropped by more than twothirds Payments for nursing home residents were cut off entirely in  Asked why Medicare hadnt taken similar steps Eagleson the Illinois Medicaid director said she couldnt explain it Im sure we can always all learn from one another she said Trying to get this more coordinated is certainly one of our goals
