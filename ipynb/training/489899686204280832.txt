The CDC is one of the only places that can diagnose these diseases Shaw said  Hardest hit health experts say may be TB patients  Because of the transfer moratorium some patients have been unable to find out what type of TB they have That means their doctors dont know which antibiotic to prescribe according to Kelly Wroblewski director of infectious disease programs at the    The moratorium was the absolute right thing to do youve got to triplecheck all your procedures said Scott Becker executive director of the association But if this goes on for another week were going to have even more problems  The CDC is one of only three public health labs in the United States that can do quick testing on drugresistant   specimens to see which antibiotic might work the best The other two in California and New York might be able to handle some of the overflow Wroblewski said  The CDC will also be turning away about  samples per week that need to be checked for chikungunya a mosquitoborne disease thats risen to record levels in Puerto Rico the US Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean according to Shaw  Doctors in the area have been sending specimens to the CDC to help diagnose the disease which often has the same symptoms as dengue fever or malaria  Without answers doctors on the ground will have difficulty knowing how to treat their patients and whether they need to isolate them from other people Shaw said  The CDC has also stopped a mosquito surveillance program in Gulf Coast states aimed at detecting whether infected bugs are bringing the disease to the continental US  State labs in the United States also rely on materials from the CDC to test substances such as white powders that are suspicious for bioterrorism The labs have enough materials to last a while but at some point will run out  Internationally labs that are working on the Ebola crisis in Africa and on Middle East respiratory syndrome might see their work slowed down because of the CDC lab situation  Those international labs depend on materials from the CDC to do their work Shaw said they also currently have enough but might run out soon  The  CDC labs under the moratorium are in Atlanta Anchorage San Juan Puerto Rico and Fort Collins Colorado The moratorium will be removed lab by lab as each one can prove that it can operate safely again and some of the CDC labs might be able to transport materials in a few days but others might not not be fully operational for months Shaw said  We shouldnt and we wont be doing this work unless we can do it in a safe way he added As soon as each lab can document that policies and procedures and validated protocols are in place they can resume transporting materials
