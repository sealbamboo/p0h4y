For those who like to track the performance of the FDA, some new metrics have just arrived. Last year, the agency approved 27 novel new medicines, or new molecular entities, in industry parlance. This amounted to 75% of the 36 marketing applications that were received.. Although not all applications submitted in 2013 had been accepted as of the end of the calendar year, the agency estimated that the final tally would amount to 36 applications based on prior experience. While 75% may seem robust, the results trail 2012, when the FDA approved 39 of 41 novel new medicines.
