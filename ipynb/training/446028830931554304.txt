The laboratories at The Aerospace Corp in El Segundo Calif look more like a bunch of stuff from the hardware store than the set from   But physicist John Hurrell gazes at a nondescript collection of tubes with admiration Its a transmission electron microscope This is one of the pieces of equipment which will enable us to get down pretty well to atomiclevel sensitivity he says Hurrell is  years old Technically hes been retired for  years Now he works part time just another one of the scientists here who try to make sure that multimilliondollar satellites stay in orbit and do what theyre supposed to The most prized component we can be having here is a failed part Hurrell says with glee Thats how scientists here can make sure that future parts will not fail Hurrell is whats known at The Aerospace Corp as a retiree casual They may be regular parttimers or just come in for special projects its up to the company But at any given time they make up about  percent of the workforce It is a significant factor in our ability to meet our customers needs says Steven Moss Hurrells supervisor Moss says experience counts especially in an emergency There may be hundreds of possibilities about why a device failed explains Moss So people like John that have seen these kinds of problems over and over again bring a significant amount of value to the table The customers still call for him by name The Aerospace Corp has offered casual work to retirees for  years according to Charlotte Morrison the head of human resources That includes employees from every department including her own One of them does the orientation every Monday for the new hires that come in Another one does some clerical work she says Increasingly older Americans are staying in the workforce longer According to census figures that includes   of people between the ages of  and  A   from the Employee Benefit Research Institute released Tuesday suggests the reason that number is expected to increase Just  percent of Americans say theyre confident theyll be able to retire comfortably And thats an improvement over the past few years But few companies have gradual retirement programs like the one at The Aerospace Corp Anna Rappaport who heads a committee on postretirement needs at the Society of Actuaries says most workers just have to figure out something on their own Some people will work for the same employer a lot of people will work for a different employer some will be in the same field some people will do something entirely different she says But its not just about the money A number of surveys suggest older Americans are equally interested in working because they find it satisfying Elizabeth Fideler a research fellow at the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College focuses on older professionals When she asks them about quitting work cold turkey this is what she hears  I will not any longer have the reason to get up in the morning I will no longer have my colleagues people Ive worked with for years and Ive enjoyed Im afraid my brain will turn to mush and then whatll I do  recounts Fideler So a gradual program can be just the ticket Those fears are shared by a lot of workers who arent doctors or lawyers or professors Tim Driver CEO of RetirementJobscom says those mass market workers are his clients people who during their earlier years earned somewhere between  and  a year Driver tries to find employers who are friendly to older adults and their desire for parttime work Unfortunately he says a lot of employers arent Age discrimination he says is one of the reasons his clients are looking for work in the first place The good news is age discrimination is slowly eroding The bad news is its not eroding at the rate that would be appropriate to welcome back all of these older Americans into the workplace Driver says Thats going to disappoint and frustrate a lot of people A   commissioned by The Associated Press found that more than  percent of workers over age  expect to keep working in what we used to call retirement
