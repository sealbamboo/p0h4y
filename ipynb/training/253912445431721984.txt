How much extra would you pay for   Its a familiar question We face it practically every time we shop for groceries either at the store or at the   But what about food that can save the lives of severely malnourished children Some humanitarian groups are confronting that question The food in this case is a kind of   that helps malnourished children regain their health The organizations are trying to make this food right where its used  in       and   They see   as a way to provide jobs and bring money into impoverished communities But paying the bill is still a struggle Even in poor countries local food often turns out to be more expensive food To understand why well take a closer look at one of these places CapHaitien a city on the northern coast of Haiti Theres a shantytown on the edge of the city called Shada The homes are jammed up against each other with barely space to walk between them And in the middle of this slum Madame Bwa is running a free clinic This is the list of the kids that we provided services to yesterday she says pulling out a ragged piece of paper with  names scrawled on it All of these children she says showed signs of malnutrition Some of them have big belly or yellowred hair Their eyes are white and their skin does not look well The prescription Medika Mamba Creole for peanut butter medicine This peanut butter has a lot of extra ingredients milk powder oil sugar and all the vitamins and minerals a growing child needs After three or four weeks of eating this daily package of energy and nutrients the children will be fine she says This recipe has transformed the treatment of malnutrition A French doctor   came up with it just over a decade ago In much of the world its called   Among specialists its called readytouse therapeutic food or just RUTF Previously treatment of severe malnutrition meant liquid milk sugar oil and sometimes some added vitamins and minerals It required refrigeration in many cases a feeding tube and lots of time in a hospital Yet many kids still didnt get better By contrast the peanut paste can be eaten at home children like it and more survive on it Its now the gold standard treatment all over the world Its a medical triumph But theres also a business side of this story thats still being written This is where we run into the tension between the global and local food production Pat Wolff a pediatrician from St Louis has been living that tension In  she founded an organization   specifically to bring readytouse therapeutic food to Haiti It started small grinding up peanuts in a rented house in CapHaitien and stirring all of the ingredients together The group called its product Medika Mamba and distributed it to local clinics Yet Wolff wasnt satisfied Why do you suppose those kids are malnourished Its because their parents have no money and they have no money because they have no employment she says One day Wolff had an epiphany MFKs product might actually provide those muchneeded jobs if it was made on a much bigger scale By this time about five years ago peanut paste had become big business UNICEF was buying millions of dollars worth of it every year for distribution in Haiti alone But UNICEF was buying it from pristine qualitycontrolled factories far away  mostly in France The leading manufacturer is   based in Normandy The peanuts came from Argentina among other places Wolff decided MFK could become UNICEFs supplier with a factory right in Haiti employing Haitian workers and buying peanuts from Haitian farmers It could be an example that others could follow she thought so there would be more factories like this more factories making other things There would be more people employed instead of just always rescuing Part of this dream is becoming reality The factory just a few miles from the slums of CapHaitien is filled with stainless steel machines spitting out little sealed packages of enriched peanut butter Those packages will go to UNICEF or the World Food Program and then to hospitals and clinics all over Haiti An even bigger impact of this local production might be felt in the countryside among Haitian farmers who grow peanuts Jamie Rhoads whos been living in Haiti since  and working with MFK since  is in charge of the organizations work with farmers As we drive out to meet some of them Rhoads talks about the potential of this area the northern plain of Haiti In colonial times he says it was among the richest agricultural areas in the world The soil fertility is really good theres water everywhere its like this gold mine of agricultural wealth waiting to happen I mean look around you  its totally green They can grow whatever they want here When we get to the farm we walk right into the middle of a peanutharvesting party I see big piles of peanut plants just pulled from the earth Men and women are sitting beside them picking peanuts off the roots and dropping them into buckets The women are singing young men are playing wooden flutes These farmers are growing peanuts for MFKs new peanut butter factory and MFK is helping them do it more cheaply The organization brought in a small tractor to help clear the fields and also sprayed the plants with a chemical that controls fungal diseases As a result the farmers tell me theyre getting almost twice as many peanuts as in previous years This is a big step says Rhoads watching the scene This is the first time Ive been around a harvest where the peanuts look this good Everybody is telling me In my whole life Ive never seen peanuts like this  Its crucial to produce highquality peanuts because one of the biggest problems with local production of RUTF in Haiti is the prevalence of peanuts contaminated with   These powerful toxins are the bane of our existence says Rhoads To make sure their product doesnt contain this poison MFK has to sort its peanuts carefully and test every batch More farmers want to join the program which should mean more peanuts for MFKs factory and more money in farmers pockets Its all great except for one thing economics These local peanuts still cost too much in large part because small Haitian farmers have so little machinery They have to pay people to plant by hand weed by hand and harvest the peanuts by hand So Meds and Food for Kids actually pays more for these Haitian peanuts than peanuts it imports from Argentina and that higher cost is tough to pass along to customers Rhoads says UNICEF and others are very price sensitive and were competing with the international market Other organizations that try to make this food locally in other countries report the same thing Local production often turns out to be more expensive production For now at least UNICEF has agreed to buy local even if it costs a little more  even  percent more But the big longterm goal Jamie Rhoads says is to keep working with the peanut farmers helping them grow more peanuts for less money Rhoads thinks they can do it with some new diseaseresistant peanut varieties currently grown in India and now being tested in Haiti and a little more laborsaving equipment If they succeed he says these farmers wont even need MFKs factory anymore Theyll be able to sell their peanuts for a good price at any market in Haiti Theyll make a lot of money he says and in the end thats the best way to make sure their children wont go hungry
