On a   a New York City taxi driver making a left turn at a light apparently did not see my yearold nephew and his foot father crossing the street at a crosswalk beckoned by a lighted walk sign Whether because of  haste inattention cellphone use or perhaps the poor weather conditions the cab driver drove directly into them My beloved nephew Cooper Stock died instantly His father suffered minor injuries The Manhattan District Attorneys office is investigating the circumstances of Coopers death The first question everyone asked after Cooper was killed was whether the driver was drunk The police reassured my brotherinlaw Dr Richard G Stock who was holding Coopers hand at the time of the crash that a Breathalyzer done at the scene was negative Yet merely looking for alcohol or drug involvement by the driver misses the point During the first  days of  cars killed seven pedestrians including Cooper in New York City More attention needs to be paid to the reasons behind these fatalities Were they true accidents Or was careless behavior on the part of drivers the reason seven people lost their lives Reckless driving circa  is what drunk driving was prior to  it is poorly defined in the law sometimes poorly investigated by police and almost never results in a criminal charge A   reported that at least  taxi drivers have killed or injured pedestrians or bicyclists in New York City over the past five years and only one has been charged criminally Most received only traffic violations and paid a fine The recent spate of pedestrian deaths at the hands of motorists has spurred Mayor Bill de Blasio to start a major new program called    The Mayor announced plans to increase the number of traffic cops create a speciallytrained collision investigation team install speed cameras and form a highpowered Vision Zero panel with the goal of eliminating trafficrelated fatalities in New York City While I support the initiative I also understand the many pitfalls Vision Zero is likely to encounter As the author of a book on the history of drunk driving I know that efforts to criminalize drunk driving were long stymied by a cultural indifference to the problem Well into the s police and prosecutors looked the other way seeing drunk drivers either as diseased alcoholics young men sowing their wild oats or paradoxically victims themselves even if they killed or maimed people Judges and juries  perhaps because they too secretly drank and drove or knew those who did  were reluctant to convict Police told family members that their loved ones  the actual victims  had been in the wrong place at the wrong time Crashes were called accidents Things finally changed in the s when   RID and   MADD burst on the scene Members of these groups had often lost children at the hands of drunk drivers many of whom had several previous arrests and no convictions These parents were viscerally offended when they learned that killers were allowed to plead down to traffic or parking violations This activism affected a sea change Drunk driving is no longer seen as youthful folly but a serious crime Between  and  states passed more than  laws lowering the acceptable blood alcohol level and tightening loopholes Friends we were told do not let friends drive drunk Perhaps the most important lesson learned was that drunk drivers were still responsible for the damage they caused even though the harms they inflicted were unintentional Driving drunk critics said was like walking around with a loaded gun The carnage caused by reckless driving like that caused by drunk driving should also be viewed as criminal We do not yet know all of the circumstances of Coopers death but we know the tremendous loss we all feel in his absence Cooper was a wonder  Everyone loved him  He was obsessed with basketball  especially the Knicks  and had an encyclopedic knowledge of NBA stars back to Wilt Chamberlain But mostly he was just a joy the life of the party even when there wasnt a party to quote a family friend If Cooper died because an impatient or distracted driver made a careless decision then that driver should be as guilty of a crime as someone who drank alcohol or used drugs before driving Lets make destruction caused by irresponsible driving a true crime And lets do it soon Last weekend after the launch of Mayor de Blasios Vision Zero initiative three more pedestrians in New York City died struck by cars as they were crossing the street
