Why people yawn is a mystery But yawning starts in the womb Past studies have used ultrasound images to show fetuses yawning but some scientists have argued that real yawns were getting confused with fetuses simply opening their mouths So   a researcher at the University of Durham in the United Kingdom used a more detailed ultrasound technique to get images of fetal faces that could distinguish a true yawn from just an open mouth They seem to open their mouths widely much less often than they yawn Reissland says Whats more she found that yawning was common at  weeks but then dropped to zero at  weeks according to a   by Reissland and her colleagues in the journal   Reissland believes that fetal yawning may somehow help trigger brain maturation by acting as a kind of selfstimulation for the developing fetus It could be that yawning is something which you need in order to have a functioning brain which is a hypothesis she says adding that she would like to compare yawning in healthy fetuses like the ones she studied with yawning in fetuses that have medical conditions Reissland says she suspects that yawning has a different function for adults than for fetuses Most studies on yawning have focused on its contagious nature But some   suggests that children are immune from catching another persons yawn until about five years of age And Reissland says   showed that babies dont imitate their mothers yawns even though babies do imitate mouth movements such as smiles and pursed lips How is it possible that these babies can imitate mouth movements but they dont imitate the yawning Reissland wonders
