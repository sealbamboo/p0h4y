From many corners of the United States  Los Angeles Philadelphia Mississippi  recent years have brought heartening news about the relentless rise in obesity among American children Several years into a campaign to get kids to eat better and exercise more child obesity rates have appeared to stabilize and might be poised for a reversal But a study published Monday in the journal PNAS suggests that among adolescents the hopeful signs are limited to those from bettereducated more affluent families Among teens from poorer less welleducated families obesity has continued to rise Nationally rates of obesity among adolescents  to  did not rise between  and  But during that period obesity rates among adolescents whose parents have no more than a highschool education rose from about  to  At the same time the teenage  children of parents with a fouryear college degree or more saw their obesity rates decline from  to about  The overall trend in youth obesity rates masks a significant and growing class gap between youth from upper and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds the authors of the latest research wrote That classgap was not evident in younger children  those between  and  years old the researchers said But as children neared the cusp of adulthood the class differences became increasingly stark Disparities between rich and poor in obesity rates are not new and they are only one of many health gaps that make poor patients sicker and more likely to die prematurely than richer ones But if the public health message on obesity has not diffused evenly across the population as the authors of the latest report suggest this disparity could stymie efforts to stem a tidal wave of costly obesityrelated diseases in the years ahead In a detailed accounting of youth consumption and exercise patterns researchers from Harvard Universitys Kennedy School of Government found that physical activity may account largely for the divergent trend in obesity between rich and poor In   of adolescents living with parents who had college degrees  told surveytakers that they had exercised or played a sport for at least  minutes continuously sometime in the last seven days By   said they had done so By contrast  of adolescent children with parents who did not go beyond high school said in  that they had exercised or played a sport for at least  minutes in the last week By  the numbers of those adolescents who had done so had barely budged standing at  Asked whether they had engaged in at least  minutes of continuous physical activity in the last  days  of adolescents with collegeeducated parents said yes But among teens with parents with a high school education or less  of teens said they had engaged in even that minimal level of exercise Kids across the socioeconomic spectrum got the message that they should reduce their intake  and less advantaged kids took in fewer calories to begin with In the broad period between  and  the teenaged children of parents with a college degree reduced their average calorie intake from  calories per day to  In the same period less advantaged adolescents went from averaging  calories per day down to  While genetics metabolism cultural and environmental factors all influence our weight the foundation of it all lies in the energybalance calculation If calories consumed outstrip energy expended in physical activity we will gain weight In a group where almost  in  adolescents is completely sedentary obesity is simply a likelier prospect when average calorie intake is about the same If public health experts are to prevent childhood obesity and thereby drive down future obesity among adults theyll have to figure out why less advantaged kids dont get as much exercise the authors of the latest study say Yes lack of recreation centers playgrounds and streets and sidewalks that encourage walking biking and playing are important they wrote But they added this is not the whole story In research presented in New York this summer to the annual confab of the American Sociological Assn the same researchers found that among children with parents who ranked high on the socioeconomic scale participation in high school sports and clubs has increased But among their peers from families of lower educational attainment and income such participation has declined
