Long John Silvers has gained some notoriety in the past for serving up what the food police dubbed the most unhealthful meal in America aka   But the fastfood chain is out to change its reputation One step in this new direction a quick transition from partially hydrogenated oils that contain bedeviled trans fats Today the chain announced it is moving to a  percent soybean oil that is transfat free Its great news and a big step on their journey to revitalize the brand overall Gary Gerdemann a PR man who is working on behalf of the food chain to promote the announcement told us in an email We are very pleased to improve the health profile of our entire menu and transition all of our fried products to transfatfree soybean oil Mike Kern Long John Silvers chief executive officer said in a news release Whether choosing delicious baked or our classic batterdipped fried fish our guests can order with the confidence that their food has zero grams of trans fat Kern continued So will consumers notice a difference in taste Likely not says Gary Gerdemann Weve been converted now fully since the end of the year he said adding The vast majority of our guests do not notice a change The menu changes earned praise from the Center for Science in the Public Interest  a nutrition and health policy watchdog group that last year gave Long John Silvers the dubious distinction of having the worst restaurant meal in America In a news release CSPIs executive director Michael F Jacobson said We were glad to work collaboratively with Long John Silvers leadership team and are pleased that the company achieved its ambitious goal in six months time CSPI says the FDA can now take note of how much time it should take other food manufacturers and restaurants to make the change to eliminate trans fat As we   last year the FDA has already paved the way for all food manufacturers to phase out trans fats from the food supply Thats because the fat has the dubious distinction of wrenching our cardiovascular systems by simultaneously raising bad cholesterol LDL and lowering good cholesterol HDL Yikes  good riddance
