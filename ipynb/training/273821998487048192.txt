Its a startling trend Many women with cancer in one breast are choosing to have their healthy breast removed too But a   being presented later this week says more than threequarters of women who opt for double mastectomies are not getting any benefit because their risk of cancer developing in the healthy breast is no greater than in women without cancer People want absolute certainty breast surgeon   of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center tells Shots Unfortunately even having a double mastectomy doesnt provide certainty that breast cancer will not recur So its a false sense of security Morrow is a coauthor of a paper that will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncologys Quality Care Symposium in San Diego Another coauthor   of the University of Michigan says double mastectomy does not make sense for about threequarters of the women who are choosing the operation because having a nonaffected breast removed will not reduce the risk of recurrence in the affected breast The researchers looked at nearly  women who had been treated for earlystage breast cancer Of those who chose   instead of   nearly  percent opted to have both breasts removed But of those who chose double mastectomy threequarters had no medical justification Hawley tells Shots In fact many women had a diagnosis of   considered a socalled stage zero breast cancer  a type many say shouldnt really be considered cancer at all The more radical operation makes medical sense Hawley says for fewer than  percent of women with early breast cancer Those include the  percent who have a genetic mutation called   and another  percent who have a strong family history which means two or more immediate relatives whove had breast or ovarian cancer Double mastectomy rates have been inching up over the last decade Hawley says There are no guidelines on who should be getting the operation When the researchers surveyed women about their choice of therapy not surprisingly they found the main factor was fear that cancer would spread to the healthy breast  even though Morrow says its a misunderstanding that cancer spreads from breast to breast One of the biggest fears when you get a cancer diagnosis is if I go through this treatment can I be done can I go on and live my life and not have to worry about it coming back Hawley says I have seen young women who leave the office having signed up for lumpectomy Morrow says and they call back the next day and say Well I was on the Internet or I was talking to my friends and they said Im a young mother dont I want to do everything I can to be there for my child I think I want a double mastectomy  But theres a flaw in that approach Unfortunately thats just fuzzy reasoning Theres another reason cited by many  the belief that a double mastectomy plus breast reconstruction will give a better more symmetrical cosmetic result We would have thought that concerns about body image would lead women away from double mastectomy Hawley says But it may be almost the inverse Morrow says theres no evidence that reconstruction after double mastectomy will lead to a better cosmetic result and there are other ways to achieve symmetry She says theres   among breast cancer specialists about the trend toward double mastectomy The evidence Morrow says is that the trend is driven by consumers  not surgeons She finds that ironic Im old enough to remember the days when surgeons were considered to be horrible mutilators of women when they did one mastectomy no less two Morrow says It took years of pressure from the thennascent patients rights movement along with the evidence from controversial research studies to establish breastconserving lumpectomy as a valid alternative to mastectomy The two operations really are equal  not just in survival but in the risk of cancer recurrence Morrow says That wasnt true  years ago Weve gotten better at lumpectomy we understand more about the biology of breast cancer So at a time when we can decrease the intensity of surgical therapy she continues instead what were seeing is patients who want to be safe choosing the bigger surgery even though in fact its no safer for them
