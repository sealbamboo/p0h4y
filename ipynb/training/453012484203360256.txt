Two drugs from Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co. that employ a new therapeutic approach showed promise in slowing the course of breast cancer, according to early-stage research released on Sunday.. The drug from Pfizer, taken in a 165-patient study together with a therapy currently available, stopped tumors from growing for a median of more than 20 monthsâ€”about twice as long as the current treatment alone, researchers said. Meantime, Lilly's drug showed antitumor activity in 33 of 47 patients.
