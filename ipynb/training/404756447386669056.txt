She refused  However embarrassing this moment was it wasnt enough to prompt Privitera to change A couple of months later in early  the Cabot Arkansas native was put on bed rest because her blood pressure was too high Doctors gave her three  blood pressure medications and an antidepressant I was out of work for about four weeks Privitera remembers They were afraid I was going to have a stroke Before going on bed rest she had bought a wedding dress By the time the dress came in it was too tight to wear Privitera had to have a second dress specially made overseas Instead of a dream night Priviteras wedding in April  felt like a nightmare  I was hot and a sweaty mess she says I was so overweight and so uncomfortable I was miserable I couldnt stand it A few weeks after her wedding Priviteras new motherinlaw asked her to join her in a kilometer run It took her an hour and  minutes to complete  My body was physically hurting I didnt want to do it anymore she says I hit rock bottom After the race Privitera and her husband Justin had an honest conversation He told her they couldnt afford weight loss surgery or food supplement programs and she would have to lose weight the oldfashioned way She agreed and   to lose more than  pounds in just over two years Her first step was to get active Privitera invested in cardio DVDs and started working out at home She felt too embarrassed to go to a gym and felt that personal training was too expensive  The videos showed results that gave me hope so I gave it a shot she says In the beginning she was losing  to  pounds a month She posted her results on Facebook and the overwhelming response from her friends and family pushed her to continue exercising  After losing about  pounds Privitera started to modify her eating habits She started looking up calorie counts for meals before going out to eat in order to make smarter choices at restaurants She also began to create healthier versions of meals at home using better ingredients Privitera was obese her entire life Her parents divorced when she was  years old  Her mother worked two jobs and struggled to make ends meet  A lot of our food choices came out of a paper bag  I lived on fast food she remembers  There were days during her high school years when she would eat McDonalds for breakfast lunch and dinner She recalls being able to eat an entire halfgallon of mint chocolatechip ice cream in one night  She was a yearold who weighed more than  pounds and developed a blood clot in her leg Even with this serious medical issue she still made poor nutrition choices and her weight continued to balloon into adulthood Now more than two years into her weightloss journey Privitera is incorporating new foods into her diet  Ive followed meal plans with food like quinoa and asparagus she says Until recently I had never had Brussels sprouts before  Privitera approaches this journey as exactly that  a journey She allows herself to indulge once in a while reminding herself if she wants something she can eat it just not all the time Instead of focusing on calorie restriction she focuses on eating reasonable portions of healthy foods  You have to balance it out she says You cant extreme diet for the rest of your life She credits her success to the support of her husband and family but also to the community of people around her The majority of her pound loss has come from exercise done right inside her home She has used programs such as TurboFire and Beachbody and is now on her fourth round of PX Shes developed friendships and found accountability partners in the people who use the online message boards for these athome programs  Privitera works out six days a week taking Sunday off and spends anywhere from  minutes to two hours a day exercising She has been able to avoid any physical setbacks by training safely and not overexerting herself  She has continued to use home videos because it keeps her from making excuses to miss workouts I hate being pressed for time she says Working out at home I get up and get started She has faced a lot of mental road blocks that nearly made her give up During these times she has had to rely on people like her motherinlaw to tell her that she has what it takes to keep going and accomplish her goals Her motivators have inspired Privitera to become a motivator for others Privitera says she has helped other women lose a combined  pounds by motivating them on Facebook Instagram and through online communities like the ones she uses She also regularly teaches a cardiokickboxing class at a local community center About a month ago she spoke to a class of high school students She told them that overweight teenagers can make small choices now that will make a world of a difference in their lives  One young lady shared that she eats two double cheeseburgers medium fries a medium Sprite and three cookies from McDonalds every single night Privitera recalls She had no idea how many calories and how much fat there was in it Her weight loss success has inspired the people closest to her Priviteras husband has started his own program and lost  pounds She says this experience has brought them closer together  My husband sees that I have a real passion she says Justin says hes mostly surprised by her new attitude She is more positive upbeat and always looking on the bright side of things he says It inspires me every day to do better Im very lucky to have a wife like her Privitera set out to complete  races in  including three Ks Her th race of the year was in late October and it was a big one her first halfmarathon She completed the race with her motherinlaw by her side the entire time Unlike their first race together this time she wanted to do it and not give up  I
