When I was in high school way back in the days when I skied a friend from school invited me to her familys cabin in Vermont for a winter break ski trip Her mom picked us up from school the station wagon loaded with gear and  food including a few delicious casseroles When we finally arrived at the cabin a few hours later it didnt take long to get dinner on the table We would eat well that week and my friends mom the cook in the family spent as much time on the slopes as the rest of us I remembered those casseroles especially the lasagna as I thought ahead this year to the holidays when there are often extra mouths to feed and sometimes extra hands to help out in the kitchen I like to get ahead with dishes that will keep in the refrigerator and that can also be frozen Lasagna Provenal gratins  substantial because they often contain rice as well as vegetables and eggs  and a whole wheat macaroni and cheese fit this bill perfectly Their appeal is broad children and adults like them and they will satisfy vegetarians and meat eaters alike They are also great vehicles for winter vegetables I packed a lot of greens brassicas and winter squash into this weeks dishes  Even though the gratins and lasagnas require a number of elements each one of those elements can also be made ahead tomato sauce can be made and even frozen vegetables blanched or roasted grains for the gratins cooked Then it is just a matter of assembling and baking I baked cooled and froze all of this weeks recipes except for the mac and cheese which we couldnt resist eating on the spot
