A new study has reignited a debate about whether men should use a baldness drug to prevent prostate cancer The drug finasteride is a generic drug now widely used by men to shrink enlarged prostates and it also has been used to treat male pattern baldness In  a study of  men showed that the drug also lowered a mans   But the Food and Drug Administration never approved finasteride to prevent prostate cancer because of a troubling finding Although the drug clearly reduced the overall risk for prostate cancer slightly more men who used the drug developed fastgrowing tumors compared with men who took a placebo On Wednesday a   in The New England Journal of Medicine reopened the debate about the potential benefits of the drug It showed that  to  years after the men first enrolled in the study survival was the same among men who used finasteride as those who took a placebo That finding based on a review of Social Security death records suggested that the drug was not causing the aggressive tumors Instead it was more likely that by reducing the size of a mans prostate the drug made it easier to find aggressive tumors The results should be reassuring to men that the drug can safely be used to treat an enlarged prostate However the new study also raises questions about whether men should consider using the drug to prevent prostate cancer The studys authors estimated that widespread use could save about  men a year from the emotional and physical trauma of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment Using the drug will not prolong their lives or protect them from aggressive cancer but it will lower their risk for lowgrade prostate cancer As a result that would mean fewer men would receive unnecessary treatment for that cancer which was unlikely to ever cause them harm Dr Ian Thompson director of the cancer therapy and research center at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio and the studys lead author said that because large numbers of men with lowgrade tumors were treated unnecessarily often with treatments that rendered them impotent or incontinent there was a benefit to preventing lowgrade nondeadly cancers It doesnt reduce risk of cancers that take mens lives but lowgrade cancers lead to huge amounts of followup testing and treatment Dr Thompson said With the drug you just dont find as many cancers and thats a good thing Dr Peter Scardino head of the prostate cancer program at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York said he did not expect the finding to prompt doctors to prescribe the drug to prevent cancer However it may prompt some men at very high risk of prostate cancer like those with a family history who undergo regular screening to take the drug It could also pave the way for more research into prostate cancer prevention and treatments for men with earlystage prostate cancer It probably means we should be looking harder at the issue he said We have a biological mechanism that can prevent these lowgrade cancers so it leaves the door open for further study I dont think weve heard the end of this story
