Hard to believe  The website   has more than  million photos of people whove undergone these various types of body modification  And its not just in the United States Other industrialized countries are seeing the body modification trend expand with new and increasingly bizarre treatments In Japan young people are plumping up their forehead by injecting large amounts of saline then pressing their thumb into the middle to create an indentation  This leaves a temporary doughnutlike appearance dubbed the     Extreme body modification procedures are almost never performed by actual physicians  These treatments are more often associated with tattoo parlors than medical offices  In fact Ive never heard of a single plastic surgeon whos admitted to performing extreme body modification  And because actual doctors arent involved the patients dont benefit from modern anesthetics   Yes people have this done without real anesthesia Want to fork your tongue  Take a swig of whiskey apply some ice and try to stay still while the body modification artist slices it in half  Seriously   Although Ive never been asked to fix or treat a split tongue there is one body modification trend Ive been asked very commonly to repair gauge earrings These are circular earrings that function to gradually dilate an ear piercing often to massive size People with gauge earrings may believe their earlobes look stylish when the earrings are in place but they look like limp noodles when the jewelry is removed       Most of my patients whove undergone repair of their stretched earlobes have had it done to improve their job prospects  what works for an interview at a tattoo parlor may not be appropriate when applying for a managerial position Apart from its effect on professional prospects can extreme body modification be a sign of underlying psychiatric issues   One of the most famous body modification subjects Dennis Avner spent years making himself look like a cat  He went so far as to have whiskers implanted into his cheeks and his teeth filed into fangs  About a year ago he    Some have speculated that Avner may have suffered from body dysmorphic disorder a psychiatric condition involving a persons selfimage It has a very high rate of suicidal ideation  As a boardcertified plastic surgeon Im well aware that the patients in my medical field have a much higher rate of BDD than the general population  Plastic surgery is basically a more socially acceptable form of body modification   However there is a big difference between plastic surgery and extreme body modification  Boardcertified plastic surgeons are required to undergo at least nine years of schooling and training pass a slew of rigorous exams and perform their procedures in a safe accredited medical center   So if youre considering extreme body modification think about it very seriously  Surgical procedures should be performed in a sterile medical environment under the hands of an experienced surgeon  Things can go wrong even under the best of circumstances  Also consider that what you want today may not be want you want in the future  Fashion changes  While it may be cool to have Frankensteins bolts in your neck now in  years they may just make you look like a monster
