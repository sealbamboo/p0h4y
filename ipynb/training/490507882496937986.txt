AIDS researchers and policymakers from around the globe are gathering in Melbourne Australia for a major international conference that starts this Monday Theyll be mourning dozens of   who died in the crash of   But the work of the conference will continue and one of the major topics to be discussed is expanding the use of a pill that prevents HIV The drug Truvada has been shown to be highly effective at preventing new infections Public officials in New York are ramping up efforts to distribute the pill widely  but not everyone thinks thats a good idea Truvada has been around for a decade as a treatment for people who are already HIVpositive Its only in the last few years that its also been approved to prevent transmission of HIV Thats why Damon Jacobs an HIVnegative therapist in New York City is taking it I had been newly single after being in a relationship for seven years and found that people were not using condoms in  the way they had been in  he says Jacobs started taking Truvada three years ago for preexposure prophylaxis  also known as PREP Since then Jacobs says he no longer uses a condom every time he has sex but hes not worried about getting HIV I didnt fully understand what it meant to live in fear every time I had sex Jacobs says And it wasnt until about a year after I was using PREP that I had the experience of pleasurable intimacy and realized Im not afraid anymore Studies have shown that Truvada can be more than percent effective against the transmission of HIV as long as its taken every day The drug has been approved for PREP by the FDA and endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention At New Yorks Gay Pride parade last month Gov Andrew Cuomo announced that his state will be the first to make Truvada part of its ambitious plan to cut new HIV infections The state of New York  in many ways was ground zero of the HIV and AIDS crisis when it first started Cuomo said I think its fitting that New York should then be the state that is the most aggressive in eradicating this disease in actually ending this disease Michael Weinstein president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and a prominent critic of Truvada calls this a very dangerous experiment Weinstein points out that Truvada only works when you take it almost every day Hes worried about what will happen to those who dont If people are taking this medication theyre definitely not going to use condoms And if theyre not taking it regularly theyre not going to be protected when they think they are Weinstein says We would have many many more infections in this country  particularly among men who have sex with men  if no one was using condoms And we can do harm by telling people that you can pop this pill But public health officials in New York say that pill could be key to cutting the number of new HIV infections  a number that has held roughly steady for the past decade Daniel OConnell who directs the AIDS Institute at the New York State Department of Health says its time to consider new approaches Were trying to do education and give options to people in terms of staying safe So for some people condoms are that For some people monogamy is that OConnell says But for some people the only answer thats going to work right now is PREP Truvada is not the cheapest option The drug costs  a month though it is covered by most insurance plans and Medicaid But those who are most at risk of getting HIV often have limited access to health care Perry Halkitis a professor at New York University says I will believe that PREP is truly going to be effective in the gay community if it gets in the hands of those who need it most in the gay community young black gay men And I have no evidence to suggest that its getting there right now So far the number of people anywhere taking Truvada for PREP seems to be small just a few thousand nationwide Prominent AIDS activist Larry Kramer a cofounder of the Gay Mens Health Crisis has publicly questioned why anyone would want to put poison into their body when they could wear a condom instead But public health officials like OConnell say the side effects are minor  especially compared to the potential benefits
