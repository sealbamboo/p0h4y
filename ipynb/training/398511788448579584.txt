The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults aged  to  be screened for colorectal cancer but the     million people  have never been properly tested Colorectal cancer kills about  people a year more than any other cancer except lung cancer and early detection prevents deaths Weve been seeing improvements in screening rates said Dr Marcus Plescia director of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the CDC but were seeing some leveling off and it shouldnt be leveling off at  percent The most common screening test is a colonoscopy in which a flexible tube is inserted to view the rectum and the entire length of the colon Another is the fecal occult blood test which can be done at home using a test kit that is then mailed to a laboratory A small number of screens are done with sigmoidoscopy in which only the last part of the large intestine is examined All three screening methods can be effective Dr Plescia said The fecal blood test has the added advantage of being convenient and its being overlooked The best test is the one that gets done
