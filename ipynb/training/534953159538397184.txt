The British nurse who has returned to Sierra Leone after recovering from Ebola has told the BBC he is frustrated by the woefully slow international response to the outbreak William Pooley is back at the heart of the crisis treating patients in the capital Freetown Its am and a queue of desperatelooking people are standing outside the gates of Connaught Hospital in Freetown  The bed Ebola isolation ward run by the Britishbased Kings Sierra Leone Partnership has been at capacity for three months But a bed has become free overnight after another patient a man in his s passed away Its one in one out and the medic deciding who will get a bed first today is British nurse Will Pooley There are four people lying in the recently erected white screening tent Patients are assessed and then put inside the tent if they are suspected of having Ebola All four patients look gaunt and terrified One woman lies on the floor retching She can barely keep her eyes open This morning however she is the lucky one who will be given a bed Many like her have died on the floor of this tent before a space has become free The others will have to wait No one knows how long for and whether theyll still be alive when the next bed becomes free This is the crisis Will has chosen to return to Its really good to be back I never meant to leave Sierra Leone I didnt want to go so being back feels like Im back where I should be I feel like Im doing a worthwhile job Im a nurse and this is where they need nurses It was almost three months ago to the day that Will found out hed been infected with Ebola while he was working at a government treatment centre in Kenema km  miles from the capital He had come to Sierra Leone to work at a hospice in Freetown but when Ebola started devastating the east of the country he went straight to the epicentre to try to help His team was overstretched and he fell sick within weeks of arriving He says he still doesnt know how he became infected Its really hard to say A lot of healthcare workers Ive spoken to that have got sick say you dont know when youve made a mistake or if something has happened or if theres been some exposure from some other route like outside the hospital I would imagine it would have been on the hospital grounds  I expect it didnt happen while I was wearing personal protective equipment It seems like a lot of healthcare workers get infected outside the isolation areas in the surrounding areas But for me I cant pin it down Will was flown back to the UK on an RAF plane on  August and taken to the Royal Free Hospital where doctors treated him with the experimental drug ZMapp I was scared especially on the plane I was scared when I started feeling unwell I had no experience of Ebola patients in a decent care setting The patients I had been looking after in Kenema would die really unpleasantly and there wouldnt be a great deal you could do to stop their suffering So they would suffer horribly before dying I was facing a less grisly situation because I knew that if it went the worst way I still wouldnt suffer in the way patients do here But after receiving treatment in the UK Will says he feels much safer returning to continue the fight against Ebola because he believes he has built some immunity to the virus after successfully fighting it off once I havent been told I have guaranteed immunity because noone knows that for sure But the scientific consensus suggests that Im pretty much covered probably Will is not the only one making the most of his potential immunity Trainee nurse Bilkisu Alfleda  has also started working at the Connaught Hospital after being treated and discharged from the Ebola isolation ward there in August She lost  members of her family to Ebola including her father and brothers She was then thrown out of her family home because the community were scared of her When I go to my house I dont have anyone to talk to even my friends ignore me But when I come to the hospital I feel loved I feel like I belong she says She says working alongside another survivor helps give her the courage to carry on despite being a social outcast  The coming of Will just inspired me because if Will is willing to come and work for my fellow Sierra Leoneans why should I not come We work as a team we feel we are all brothers and sisters  The death rate in Sierra Leone has rocketed since Will left in August particularly in and around the capital A total of  people have been infected in the country  have died and cases continue to rise sharply in some areas Seeing what the situation is in the country is difficult The isolation unit here we are seeing lots of people dying the beds are never empty for a moment says Will So coming back its hard to see all the same stuff I was seeing a few months ago in Kenema is happening now in the capital  This all could have been prevented Were many months down the line now A lot of the response has just been woefully slow It never had to be as bad as it is and its still going to continue and many people are still going to die when  if the response had been better  or if now the response was sped up deaths could be prevented
