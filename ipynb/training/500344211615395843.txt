Mental health issues like depression anxiety and substance abuse often start in adolescence then peak in young adulthood But for young people who dont have steady jobs or stable paychecks getting help can be tough A popular provision of the Affordable Care Act that took effect in  aimed to make it easier for young adults to get access to health care by allowing them to stay on their   until they turn  So are more young adults getting help with mental health issues because of the provision Maybe suggests a   published in the September issue of  Before  just over  percent of young adults with mental health issues said they were getting treatment And that went up by about  percent in the two years after the ACA provision took effect the study found based on data from the   Thats not much of an increase and researchers cant say exactly why the rate went up But they say theres evidence that the ACA provision is at least partly responsible Once it took effect uninsured visits to mental health care providers went down by  percent while the number of visits paid by private insurance increased by  percent And among older adults in the to age group who werent affected by the provision the number seeking care went down One thing that didnt change during this time period was the number of young people getting treatment for substance abuse This is a first glimpse  an early look at whats happening says   an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who led the study We asked Saloner about the work and whats keeping young adults from getting the mental health care they need The conversation has been edited for length and clarity What really surprised us was that the stories were not consistent for substance abuse and mental health treatment We had expected both mental health and substance abuse treatment to go up after the ACA provision passed Were still trying to make sense of why that is I think that speaks to the fact that there are probably very different systems in play for mental health and substance abuse People with substance abuse problems are more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system in many cases When people get arrested do they get care when theyre in jail and prison Colleges and universities are also places where a lot of young adults with substance use problems are right now Are they getting the services that they need If you just focus on the trend among young adults then the uptick is indeed rather modest But we made the assumption that were it not for the ACA provision the trends for the young adults would be the same as the trend for the older adults And that went down  the economy was bottoming out and a lot of people were losing their insurance So its important that young adults were able to maintain some modest improvement while treatment for older adults was going down The policy can be successful even if it only has a modest effect in improving access Thats consistent with what we know from   We know that at any point in time among individuals who screen positive for mental health problems fewer than half of them get any kind of care And when you look at substance abuse that number is much lower  around  percent Some of whats going on is people dont have the resources to pay for treatment The   does a lot to make sure the costs for mental health and substance abuse care is on par with the costs for other medical treatments It was passed in  but its really starting to be implemented now Historically people have had to pay a lot more out of pocket for these treatments Even so copays that might look small to people who are more established and affluent are going to be a real financial burden for a young person who is working part time or whos a student with limited financial resources And its also hard to find treatment providers We need to have the manpower and womanpower  or rather physician power  to meet the needs of this diverse population of young adults Access to health care can help indirectly One of the most powerful agents for getting people into mental health treatment is the primary care provider A young person might go to their doctor just for a physical exam and then it comes up in the conversation with the doctor that Oh by the way Im feeling really down lately A primary care provider can at least help these patients recognize they could benefit from some treatment and even refer the patient to a psychiatrist And bettertrained primary care providers have some awareness of mental health issues and try to screen for them One thing is making sure theres an adequate network of providers who are in health insurance plans And the other thing is making sure people who have transitory health insurance  like young adults who are using their parents plans  can maintain continuity with their providers over time That way people get access to a mental health provider they can stay with the treatment But I think this is something thats going to involve changes within the health insurance system but its also going to require a lot of effort even outside the health care system Theres a lot of stigma We need to do everything that can be done so people feel less ashamed of saying I have depression or I have an anxiety disorder or I have bipolar disorder
