Say a pediatrician notices that one of her teenage patients is showing signs of depression In most cases the doctor will notify parents and prescribe an antidepressant or recommend a therapist The trouble is many of those teens wont go to therapy or wont stick with it And thats part of a bigger problem Nearly twothirds of adolescents who have had a major depressive episode   according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Getting parents more involved is a way to start reversing that trend according to   published Tuesday in the   And pairing depressed teens with a counselor or clinician who can help them follow through with treatment can help as well In a clinical trial researchers from the University of Washington and Seattle Childrens Hospital split a group of  teens who screened positive for depression into two categories Half were encouraged to seek treatment and had their screening results mailed to their parents The rest were treated with what doctors call a   These kids were paired with a   a specially trained clinican who worked with them and their parents develop a treatment plan The care manager also followed up with the teens every week or two and called their parents every month After a year only  percent of the teens who didnt get that extra coaching had enlisted in the recommended treatment while  percent of the collaborative care group got treatment  who led the study says just the process of finding a therapist or psychiatrist can overwhelm teens and their parents Were asking them to go and access a system theyve never navigated before she says The care managers can help get the ball rolling and also serve as mediators when teens and parents have different ideas about treatment Richardson says In some cases she notes the teens really didnt want to go talk to somebody  they really would rather take a pill And most commonly the parents were opposed to that Working through that sort of thing is really important for teens They need to feel heard and they need to feel supported The studys findings are in line with   showing the collaborative care model works well for adults with mental disorders says   an adolescent psychologist and professor at the University of Pittsburgh I think it shows great promise as a model he says But I dont think its an easy thing yet for us to implement In general the primary care system and the mental health care system are still separate in the United States Kolko notes primary care physicians dont get much training in mental health Plus most insurance companies have different reimbursement systems for mental and physical health The medical communitys attitude about the best way to treat mental health problems also needs to change Richardson says The care manager the study employed cost about  per teen she says When we compare that to what we pay for an MRI or any diagnostic testing its not that much If I told you we could have a threefold improvement in cancer outcomes people would jump on that Richardson says I think were a little more skeptical when it comes to mental health she says
