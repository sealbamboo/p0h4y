An inquiry is being launched to check the safety of donor blood amid fears of infection from the human form of mad cow disease The Commons Science and Technology Committee called for the inquiry after studies revealed one in every  Britons could be carrying variant CJD Although these people may never develop symptoms they could spread the disease to others via blood  Donor blood is not tested for vCJD but precautions are taken to cut the risk To limit the transmission risk from blood organs and tissues NHS Blood and Transplant excludes donors whom it deems to be at higher risk of infection such as those who themselves have had a blood transfusion   Donor blood is stripped of white cells to further minimise infection risk And wherever possible disposable instruments are used for retrieving of donor tissues Where this is not possible the instruments are sterilised to kill off any traces of the prion disease But experts are questioning whether such measures are enough  Committee chairman Andrew Miller MP said Variant CreutzfeldtJakob Disease is a terrible condition and we were extremely concerned to hear evidence that this incurable disease still poses a significant risk to public health  Although the risk of developing the disease as a result of eating contaminated beef was long ago eliminated it is possible that the infection could still be unwittingly spread through medical procedures We were told that this may happen through failure to properly clean medical instruments or even more worryingly through widespread contamination of the blood and organ supply  We want to explore whether the government is taking this threat as seriously as it should be Since the link between vCJD and a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE in cattle was discovered in  strict controls have prevented meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain  But people who ate infected meat before the controls came into force may unknowingly be carrying the infection  To date there have been  UK deaths from vCJD Most of these occurred in the late s and early s There has been only one death in the past two years  NHS Blood and Transplant says the UK has one of the safest blood supplies in the world  A spokeswoman said We are constantly looking to increase scientific understanding of risks of disease transmission through blood organ and tissue donation We will submit evidence to this inquiry Scientists have been developing a   but none has yet been adopted for routinely screening donor blood
