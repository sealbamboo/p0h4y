Electronic medical records were supposed to usher in the future of medicine Prescriptions would be beamed to the pharmacy A doctor could call up patients medical histories anywhere anytime Nurses and doctors could easily find patients old lab results or last Xrays to see what how theyre doing The computer system could warn doctors about dangerous drug combinations before it was too late Many of those things are an everyday reality in doctors offices and hospitals across the country But a survey of more than  internists with experience using electronic medical records or EMRs documents what doctors have complained about for years computerized records chew up a lot of time Writing up a patients visit on the computer can take more time than you might expect More than  percent of the doctors surveyed said that note writing took longer using computerized records than before they were implemented One reason There are all kinds of boxes to check that have more to do with the billing department than the patient Overall the survey found that attending physicians the doctors in charge of care lost an average of  minutes a day because of EMRs Doctors in training lost  minutes a day The   first released online in September were published Monday in the latest  EMRs are like democracy says   director of the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science at NYU Langone Medical Center Its the worst form of medical records except for all the others ones Horwitz an internist tells Shots Her own experience jibes with the surveys findings I definitely lose an hour a day but I wouldnt go back Whats wrong with electronic records There are so many ways they are really bad she says It used to be that as I was I sitting with patients I was writing the notes and I would be done when they left the room Now  percent of time I have to stay afterward and Im a really fast typist Horwitz says the record systems are poorly organized and never seem to reflect the needs of doctors and nurses Theres an enormous amount of timeconsuming clicking scrolling and typing The benefits from computerized records outweigh the drawbacks she says but that doesnt mean the record systems shouldnt be a lot better Entering the data is only half the problem The time suck is not just on the doing side its also on the receiving side says   an internist in Augusta Ga When a specialist or hospital sends him a report about a patient its often so full of useless information related to billing medical coding and rote checkoffs that Lamberts struggles to find the nuggets he needs Its like getting a big box full of packaging material and theres a thumb drive in it says Lamberts who accepts no insurance and is paid a monthly fee by his patients Sometimes another doctors EMR wastes his time by automatically sending a report that he didnt ask for and doesnt need A recent fax from a vascular specialist who saw one of Lamberts patients was so laughable he scanned it and tweeted it Lamberts was happy to ignore the fax At least it told him from the start to that was OK The thing I appreciated about this fax was that it was brief
