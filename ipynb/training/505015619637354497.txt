Haitis got talent Tamarre Joseph paces the stage her sleek short blue dress hugging her pencilthin frame She works the hometown crowd rapping  The thousands in the packed stadium jump and sing along An entire section of men take off their shirts and wave them overhead A rain cloud hangs ominously over the national soccer stadium in downtown PortauPrince blocking the view of the mountains beyond At one end of the stadium sits a stage with the words Chante Pou Libete above their English translation Songs for Freedom We will be a country without restaveks This concert free to the public was billed as a way to speak about the unspoken Haitis deplorably large population of restaveks  child slaves Its certainly unusual to have an American Idolstyle competition for songs about slavery And its definitely ironic that this event is taking place in the home of the worlds only successful slave revolt The  Global Slavery Index ranks Haiti second in the world for modern slavery with an estimated  to  slaves Only Mauritania is worse While that number includes adults the vast majority are minors Restavek roughly translates to stay with in Creole avec is French for with Often families from the countryside send young children to live with wealthier families in PortauPrince Haitis capital In exchange for a promised better life and education the child will contribute to household chores like cooking washing clothes and fetching water In thousands of cases children are forced into servitude They take on most if not all of the household work theyre beaten and sexually assaulted they never get the education they hoped to earn In June Haitis parliament passed a bill outlawing human trafficking but the country remains on a US government trafficking watch list because of concerns over whether Haiti will implement the new rules Advocates worry about enforcement in part because of the magnitude of the problem This problem affects millions of people throughout Haiti and it touches on several issues gender inequality illiteracy overpopulation says Joan Conn executive director of the nonprofit Restavek Freedom Foundation Conns organization seeks to bring a better life to these children Her organization pays for tuition uniforms and books for  children now living as restaveks and assigns a caseworker to each child Many of the children were reported to the organization by concerned neighbors The foundation also sponsored Saturdays music contest Haiti has  departments  the equivalent of states Each held its own semifinal and sent a winner to compete in PortauPrince with one exception The more populous West Department had two entrants Underneath the stadium in a makeshift dressing room the  contestants and their backup bands take turns snapping photos and sitting in front of the lone industrial fan Musicians dab sweat from their foreheads pull stray threads from their suits and munch on Pringles all the while sizing up the competition They see me and they know Ill win asserts Nadine Moncher who won the preliminary contest in the Nippes Department with a song called Stand Up for the Restavek Some contestants wrote from the perspective of a restavek others incorporated dance into their performance with young children playing the part of restaveks Some of the contestants focused too much on the show says event judge and music critic Myria Charles Most important were the words Borrowing from beauty pageants the two emcees asked questions of the performers What is the role of parents in ending restavek What is the role of education in ending restavek Can the Catholic and Protestant churches do more to end restavek Marthe Yoldie Saimphort donning tattered clothes that a child slave might wear belted cries for freedom in her forceful song Mande Pou Libete The rapt crowd grew even more excited with her answer to her question from the emcees People have too many children in Haiti Thats the No  problem she says then turns to the audience and its thunderous cheering Parents cant afford all the children None of the contestants was a restavek Theyd seen them in their hometowns but few had ever spoken with them I see them in my neighborhood and at church and I know if I didnt have a mother and father I could be one too Saimphort says I saw them growing up but I didnt know them too well concedes Abdias Noncent My mother was a restavek so Im singing for her says Edriss Neptune a tall singer with a cropped beard His song demands that families take the bucket out of a restaveks hands and replace it with a pencil In PortauPrince Tamarre Joseph says you know who they are because they stay up later and wake up earlier than other children All  contestants perform and answer questions Then the judges retreat to a dimly lit room underneath the stadium One light barely illuminates the coffee table they sit at Curtains block the only window Four armed members of the Haitian National Police protect the room No one explains why protection is necessary After  minutes the judges emerge from their cavern and hand the envelope to the emcee As a drizzle begins the excitable but dwindling crowd starts to chant Rain Rain Rain The top three contestants win cash prizes provided by the Restavek Freedom Foundation Third place is about  second place double that and the grand prize winner about  In a country where  percent of people live on  a day these are serious stakes Third place goes to one of the two PortauPrince contestants Gitanie Guerrier Sporting a bright pink princess dress she smiles as a volunteer accidentally slips the secondplace medal around her neck Runnerup Hedson Lamour does not hide his disappointment In his white tuxedo and tails he looks dejectedly at the ground ignoring his oversize check Hours before he was prancing around the stage singing about a caring onlooker who stopped the beating of a restavek To most in the audience the top prize was a foregone conclusion Marthe Yoldie Saimphort sealed the win early in the evening with her confident answers and thoughtful performance When she exited the stage after her song police in fatigues rushed to snap photos Overwhelmed she cried For the second time this evening she cries  this time wearing a green gown and holding a check for  Restaveks live in fear They want to run away but they know they cant Saimphort says People need to know they can help Later this year shell have the chance to spread the word farther when the Restavek Freedom Foundation flies her to the United States to record an album
