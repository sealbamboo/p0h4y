Short sixsecond bursts of vigorous exercise have the potential to transform the health of elderly people say researchers in Scotland   A pilot study involving  pensioners showed going allout in very short bursts reduced blood pressure and improved general fitness over time The team at Abertay University believe it could help avert the astronomical costs of ill health in elderly people Experts said the study emphasised the benefits of exercise at any age High Intensity Training HIT has attracted a lot of attention for promising some of the same benefits as conventional exercise but in a much shorter time  Instead of a comfortable halfhour jog or a few miles on the bike HIT involves pushing yourself to your limits for a short period of time  The team in Scotland say they were conducting the first trials in older people A group of pensioners came into the lab twice a week for six weeks and went hell for leather on an exercise bike for six seconds They would allow their heart rate to recover and then go for it again eventually building up to one minute of exercise by the end of the trial They were not exceptionally fast but for someone of that age they were researcher Dr John Babraj said The results   showed participants had reduced their blood pressure by  increased their ability to get oxygen to their muscles and found daytoday activities like getting out of a chair or walking the dog easier  Dr Babraj told the BBC the benefits could be huge Weve got an ageing population and if we dont encourage them to be active the economic burden of that is going to be astronomical A lot of diseases are associated with sedentary behaviour  like cardiovascular disease and diabetes  but if we can keep people active and functioning then we can reduce the risk Also on the social side they are less likely to be socially active and will interact with people more More than  million people in the UK are over  and that figure is set to rise  Dr Babraj says older people struggle to exercise as many are fulltime carers but argues High Intensity Training would be easier to fit in  He said people could try it at home but should see their doctor first to ensure there were no underlying health issues Then the easiest way to do it yourself is to run up a hill the steeper the hill the harder its going to be give it everything youve got for six seconds There is an argument that short and strenuous exercise may be safer than conventional exercise  A higher heart rate and blood pressure caused by exercise can be a trigger for heart attacks and stroke Dr Babraj said running for a long time puts a greater strain on the heart overall even if it is worked harder in the shortterm in High Intensity Training Larger trials are now planned Dr Adam Gordon a consultant and honorary secretary of the British Geriatrics Society told the BBC This is a brilliant fantastic piece of work challenging assumptions about what the right type of exercise is in old age but Id encourage them to investigate the benefits in even older and even more frail people  The broad message is that youre never too old too frail too ill to benefit from exercise as long as its carefully chosen  We know even into your s and s theres a benefit from developing a very slight sweat by exercising on multiple occasions per week
