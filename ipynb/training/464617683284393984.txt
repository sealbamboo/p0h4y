The only time Elisabeth OBrien  truly feels like an older mom is when she falls into bed at  pm  if shes lucky Dont feel old Ms OBrien Regardless of age most moms of montholds are exhausted by  at night Last year at age  OBrien became a firsttime mom to a  pound  ounce ridiculously happy and healthy baby boy named Samuel And she also become part of a growing trend among women over age  who are having their first children according to data released Friday by the National Center for Health Statistics part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention We are just all so thrilled says OBrien of Los Angeles I was ready to be a mom The average age for women giving birth for the first time has risen during the past  years  with a veritable baby boom among women age  and older For example the number of women ages  to  giving birth for the first time soared to  per  in  from  women per  in  For women ages  the rate grew to  per  in  from  per  in  From  through   states and Washington DC showed an increase in the first birth rate for women aged  For women age  rates increased in  states as well as Washington DC Some areas including DC Minnesota Nebraska and South Carolina rose  percent or more This trend has been going on for a while and when we see statistics changing it can be a reflection of whats going on in society says lead researcher T J Mathews citing that in  there were nine times as many first births to women ages  and older than there were four decades earlier Women are waiting longer to give birth due to many factors including later marriage educational pursuits and financial reasons says Elizabeth Gregory director of the Womens Gender  Sexuality Program at the University of Houston and author of Ready Why Woman Are Embracing The New Later Motherhood Many of these women took time to finish their educations and establish themselves at work she said Women figured out early on there is a financial return to delay and they could provide for their families better But there is a cost to that delay since fertility drops after age  The chances for chromosomal problems like Down syndrome are overblown in most peoples mind but they overestimate the chances of getting pregnant as they get older or underestimate the chances of miscarrying says Dr Marjorie Greenfield professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center In fact the chance of having a baby at age  is only about  percent without the help of assisted reproductive technologies Yet she is aware too that having a baby when a woman is younger can have a longterm economic effect on the family I understand it cuts both ways since I have watched women who decided to have children really young have no economic security and theyve lost their place in the workforce says Greenfield author of The Working Womans Guide to Pregnancy But it is harder to get pregnant when a woman is older Thats why Elizabeth Bass Cleland  of Richmond Virginia is grateful that she got pregnant without any problems Cleland married in September  and is due with her first child next month I have a perspective and a maturity that I didnt have  years ago and my child will benefit from that says Cleland who figures she got pregnant on her Hawaiian honeymoon But I realize we are very lucky since I see friends my own age struggling with infertility I never took my fertility for granted Indeed older moms believe their maturity bring an added benefit to their children Im a doctor I know how to read statistics and I know about the risks of advanced maternal age but I also know how important it is to bring stability into childrens lives and you generally have that stability when youre older and established says Katy Ferguson a Cleveland Ohio podiatrist who had her first child Benjamin at age  and her second child Alexander at  Ferguson now  says she and her husband may even try for a third child When I look around my sons preschool class all I see are older parents she says I dont feel alone at all Were all over the place Shes only had one little glitch I remember going to buy Benjamin some clothes and the clerk looked at me and asked if they were for my grandson she laughs I was horrified The clerk was mortified when I told her they were for my son
