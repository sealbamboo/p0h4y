School lunch has never been the stuff of foodie dreams Im still haunted by the memory of my elementary school cafeterias brain pizza  a lumpy oval thing topped with fleshy white strips of barely melted mozzarella that clumped together like neurons And it looks like Americas school cafeterias are still turning out the culinary abominations judging by the images on   a fascinating online project showcasing school lunch photos submitted by students across the country The project is the brainchild of Farah Sheikh who manages education campaigns for   a nonprofit group that helps organize young people to take action around social change She got the idea she said while researching student dropout rates Nutrition she noticed has a pretty big impact on student concentration and student performance in school she tells The Salt The project features more than  school lunch photos accompanied by often witty captions  such as objects may taste worse than they appear Some of the meals shown are real doozies  weve gotten a lot of mystery meat Sheikh says Exhibit A   allegedly ground beef The aim she says is not to horrify but to equip young people who are upset with what theyre being served with ways to make change in their school Participants not only get to vote on whether to eat or toss the meals pictured they also can   with advice on advocating for better school lunches in their local district Of course the state of school lunch has been a focal point of the food movement for several years now And one thing that comes through from the photos is that in at least some school districts change has arrived Some of the meals submitted look not just healthful but  dare we say  tasty The transformation to more healthful school lunches hasnt been entirely smooth for school districts As weve   revamped meals have left some kids protesting smaller portions that leave them hungry  a complaint that also pops up in some of the Fed Up images Thats one reason why as school district officials redo lunches students need to be part of the conversation says Sheikh We want to give decisionmakers a sense of what its like to be a student who isnt getting the energy they need from their school lunch she says Indeed while a photo may be worth a thousand words the Fed Up project extends beyond the visual Students who submitted images also filled out a survey with questions like How often do you toss your lunch How nutritious were the school lunches youve eaten over the past four weeks And how do you feel after eating your lunch energetic hungry full sick etc The answers Sheikh says will be compiled in a report summarizing the state of school lunch around the nation from students perspective She plans to share the findings with school districts and nutrition advocates including   the   and the   which advised her on the project The Fed Up site stopped taking new submissions at the end of last week Sheikh and her team are now in the process of analyzing the data But one finding thats already clear she says is that the stereotype that teens just want to eat junk food simply doesnt hold up If a teen says their meal is healthy she says theyre less likely to throw it out over the course of a week But if a teen says its unhealthy that teen is more likely to throw it out
