People who use certain acidsuppressing drugs for two years or longer are at increased risk of vitamin B deficiency which can lead to anemia neurological problems or dementia researchers reported on Tuesday The drugs in question are called protonpump inhibitors or PPIs and histamine  receptor antagonists and they are available by prescription and over the counter under brand names like Prevacid Prilosec and Nexium Nearly  million prescriptions were written for PPIs alone last year People who are taking these medications are more likely than the average person to be vitamin B deficient and its a potentially serious problem said Dr Douglas A Corley senior author of the new study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association This raises the question of whether people taking these medications for long periods should be screened for vitamin B deficiency Dr Corley has received funding from Pfizer which makes a PPI called Protonix He and his colleagues at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland Calif examined the medical records of  adults who received vitamin B deficiency diagnoses between  and  comparing them with  patients without B deficiency during that period Patients who took PPIs for more than two years were   the researchers found Higher doses of PPIs were more strongly associated with the vitamin deficiency as well Twelve percent of patients deficient in vitamin B had used PPIs for two years or more compared with  percent of control patients The risk of deficiency was less pronounced among patients using HRAs long term  percent compared with  percent of nonusers The new study is the largest to date to demonstrate a link between taking acid suppressants and vitamin B deficiency across age groups Earlier small studies focused primarily on the elderly Robert J Valuck a professor of pharmacy at the University of Colorado in Aurora was surprised that the association in the new report was strongest in adults younger than age  Its not safe to assume vitamin B deficiency is only an issue in the elderly he said Currently awareness of B deficiency with the use of PPIs is very low said Dr TS Dharmarajan the vice chairman of medicine at the Wakefield campus of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx who was not involved in the research If physicians read the study a lot of B levels will be ordered in the months and years to come Acid suppressants are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD and ulcers in the stomach or duodenum The authors of the new research do not recommended stopping PPIs or HRAs in people with clear indications for treatment But studies have found the drugs are often overused or used for longer than necessary Its very common for people to start these drugs and stay on for long periods Dr Valuck said He and other experts noted the benefits of PPIs must be weighed against their risks including increasing the likelihood of bone fractures pneumonia C difficile infection and now vitamin B deficiency Although the authors accounted for a number of potential variables factors other than PPI use might explain the link to vitamin B deficiency One is diet vitamin B is found in meat seafood and dairy products so it matters whether patients taking a PPI might also be vegetarian or vegan Dr Dharmarajan said The new report did not address this question Dr Joel J Heidelbaugh an associate professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan commended the researchers for calculating how many people would need to be exposed to a potential hazard before a person is affected If you treat  people with PPIs for two years one of them will have a vitamin B deficiency he said But Dr Heidelbaugh cautioned that its hard to know the clinical relevance of the finding Just because someone is deficient in B you dont know if they will develop a serious consequence he said To see whether study patients were asymptomatic or not researchers did review the charts of  randomly selected PPIusing patients to determine why they their vitamin B levels had been tested Twentyfive percent of that small sample had also been tested for anemia and  percent for memory loss Though there may be many people who have asymptomatic B deficiency that did not seem to be the situation in this study Dr Corley said In light of this new research Dr Dharmarajan argued that when PPIs are not indicated physicians need to play a greater role in their discontinuation including asking patients about their overthecounter use Its so much easier to allow a patient who is happy staying on the drug to do so but you have to consider the unintended harm
