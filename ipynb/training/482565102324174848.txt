On Friday San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge Board of Directors unanimously approved  million in funding to erect a footwide steel net  extending out from each side of the mile  span  to deter wouldbe jumpers The federal government will cover  million of the cost the rest will come from state and local sources  Last year  people died after jumping off the Golden Gate according to the   an organization dedicated to stopping suicides from the bridge The organization estimates that more than  people have leapt to their deaths since the bridge opened in  Where nets have been erected as suicide barriers theyve proven to be  effective thus far said Denis Mulligan CEO and general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District which presented the proposal to the board Suicidal people have stopped jumping at those locations Those locations include the Clifton Suspension Bridge in England and the Duke Ellington Bridge in Washington where after barriers were installed suicide rates went down dramatically Apparently suicidal individuals dont want to hurt themselves they want to die said Mulligan So where nets have been erected people stop jumping The decision to move forward with the Golden Gate plan punctuates a contentious fight that has simmered here for decades On one side of the debate were those who believe a suicide barrier will detract from the bridges beauty On the other side were mental health and other advocates some of whom bore an intimate sense of the potential benefits of such a barrier One of the barrier proponents is Kevin Berthia He stood on the precipice of the Golden Gate Bridge on a cold afternoon in March  He was unemployed drowning in a sea of medical bills and distraught I was hurting a lot said Berthia I was dealing with a lot of issues and I felt like I was dealing with them by myself Almost as soon as he hopped over the foot barrier which many argued makes jumping too easy to the bridges outer railing he was approached by Sergeant Briggs  Briggs had been there before During his year career he coaxed more than  people back from that same railing Two people he wasnt able to save When someone goes over on the other side of that rail its like having a gun to their head their finger on the trigger and the hammer pulled back said Briggs founder of   a crisis management and suicide prevention organization  Theyre ready to go The pain is great  they see no hope For more than  minutes Briggs listened while Berthia talked the biting wind swirling around them As the minutes passed Berthia says the burdens he was carrying slowly lifted Eventually he decided to come back over the barrier I knew things would get  times worse when I came back over but I wanted to give it another shot said Berthia who says it took another eight years to get help for his mental health problems A few years ago the transportation district invited public comment about installing a suicide barrier said Mulligan the transportation district head and opinion was deeply divided  Leave the bridge alone one commenter posted Its not the bridges fault people choose to commit suicide there Another commenter echoed a common perception about how effective a barrier could be Sadly  desperate people do commit suicide and they will find another means to do it if the GG bridge is not available to them An artists rendering from the proposal shows a horizontal barrier that extends from the deck beneath the roadway and doesnt clash with the bridges unique  hue Berthia said a suicide net certainly would have discouraged him from considering jumping that his attraction to the bridge was the ease with which he could perish Very rarely do people who are stopped from jumping go on to commit suicide according to a   by Richard Seiden a researcher at the University of California Berkeley   More than  of wouldbe jumpers who were stopped according to the oftcited study were still alive decades later Berthia and Briggs say the decision to fund a barrier is overdue It should have been there a long time ago said Berthia A lot of lives could have been saved Briggs says that the father of a young man who died after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge summed it up potently for him A view or a life A view or a life said Briggs paraphrasing the father Those few words were what he says convinced him that something needed to be done When asked about advocates argument that lives have been lost needlessly during the years the transportation group assembled its plan Mulligan said With the passage of time I think societys values and understanding of suicide has evolved and so has our boards It will be several years before the net is built said Mulligan Still a plan in motion  even if it takes some time  is of great solace to advocates It has been  years of needless deaths and survivor family devastation Kevin Hines one of the rare people who survived a suicide attempt from the bridge said before the boards vote He said the move toward a safety barrier means the community at last is placing higher value and worth on peoples lives over a piece of bright red iron
