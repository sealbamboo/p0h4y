Why do people sometimes give generously to a cause  and other times give nothing at all Thats a timely question because humanitarian groups fighting the Ebola outbreak need donations from people in rich countries But some groups say theyre getting less money than theyd expect from donors despite all the news Psychologist   of the University of Oregon has some   that may surprise you In one study Slovic told volunteers about a young girl suffering from starvation and then measured how much the volunteers were willing to donate to help her He presented another group of volunteers with the same story of the starving little girl  but this time also told them about the millions of others suffering from starvation On a rational level the volunteers in this second group should be just as likely to help the little girl or even more likely because the statistics clearly established the seriousness of the problem What we found was just the opposite Slovic says People who were shown the statistics along with the information about the little girl gave about half as much money as those who just saw the little girl Slovic initially thought it was just the difference between heart and head A story about an individual victim affects us emotionally But a million people in need speaks to our head not our heart As the numbers grow he explains we sort of lose the emotional connection to the people who are in need But if the dry statistics arent as powerful as the emotional message about the little girl why do the numbers reduce peoples emotional response to the child in need Slovic has done further research that suggests it might not be a case of heart vs head after all but of one set of feelings competing against another The volunteers in his study wanted to help the little girl because it would make them feel good and give them a warm glow But when you mix in the statistics volunteers might think that there are so many millions starving nothing I can do will make a big difference Now if the human brain were a computer the two conflicting feels wouldnt cancel each other out We would still help the little girl even if we couldnt help everyone But the brain is a master at unconsciously integrating different feelings So the bad feeling diminishes the warm glow  and reduces the impulse to give generously to help the child In other words people decline to do what they can do because they feel bad about what they cant do That theory might explain why there hasnt been an outpouring of donations from Americans to the Ebola epidemic The current outbreak triggers feelings of hopelessness theres no cure lots of people are sick and lots of people will die Its really about the sense of efficacy Slovic says If our brain  creates an illusion of nonefficacy people could be demotivated by thinking Well this is such a big problem Is my donation going to be effective in any way Slovics research suggests that the way to combat this hopelessness is to give people a sense that their intervention can in fact make a difference Thats a challenge for charitable groups  and for journalists A reporters job is to tell the truth and paint a picture of everything thats happening But when you paint the bigger picture it could undermine peoples ability to do what they can to help
