Dr Ilse Levin specializes in internal medicine but you could say she really focuses on incarceration medicine Levin works at   health center   that pays a lot of attention to treating people often left out of health care newly released prisoners I have patients whove been locked up for  years Levin says They have no idea how to get refills how to go to a pharmacy Often they dont know how to take their own medications especially things like insulin When prisoners get out they often dont have jobs and therefore dont have health coverage The insurance piece could be changing soon though The eligibility requirements for Medicaid are expanding in  as a part of the health overhaul law Right now Medicaid in most states is mainly targeted toward children families and the disabled After the Medicaid expansion goes into effect single adults who meet income requirements will be eligible even if they dont have kids Some states and the District of Columbia have gotten a head start and rolled out the Medicaid expansion early That means Levin can get reimbursed for the care she provides to patients like Keith Snowden a DC resident who got out of prison last year Snowden had been dealing with uncontrolled high blood pressure for years even before he went to prison in  for selling stolen cars and counterfeit IDs At his first postprison visit to Levins clinic his blood pressure was off the charts The hospital was right next door They wouldnt let me walk next door Snowden recalls I had to have the ambulance come pick me up It was that bad Snowden says he had been taking blood pressure drugs for years to no effect Levin conducted a barrage of tests and eventually discovered the culprit a tumor weighing on his adrenal gland Snowden had it surgically removed recently now his blood pressure is back on the charts It took the free doctor for me to go and figure out my problem Snowden says I really owe my life to her for being so diligent and trying to figure this out Calling Levin a free doctor isnt entirely accurate Her clinic is   run by the charitable nonprofit   Doctors and other caregivers there treat patients regardless of their ability to pay but the kind of lifesaving care Levin provided to Snowden costs money Levin says its much easier to provide appropriate care now that Washington has moved forward with the health laws Medicaid expansion allowing her patients to get health insurance Now everyone gets Medicaid she says And suddenly I can get them their medications I can get them to see a specialist I can get the studies done And it is amazing Its completely changed my practice Not everyone getting out of prison will be eligible for Medicaid however The governors of at least half a dozen states   in the Medicaid expansion because its too expensive
