In July Kathy Murphy received a letter from the Social Security Administration We are writing to tell you that you do not qualify for widows benefits it said You do not qualify for the lumpsum death benefit because you are not Sara Elizabeth Barkers widow or child Well Not only had Ms Murphy shared a modest ranch house in Austin Tex with Sara Barker for nearly  years not only had she cared for Ms Barker through two terrible final years of illness but the two were indeed legally married We always hoped wed be married in the state where we made a home Ms Murphy a native Texan told me But Sara was diagnosed with cancer in  and we didnt have the luxury of time any more So they flew to Boston where they had met and first lived together and were wed in a quiet teary ceremony in a Unitarian Universalist chapel Had they remained in Massachusetts things would be different But the couple went home to Austin where Ms Barker died in early  Social Security wont approve spousal or survivors benefits for samesex spouses in Texas and the  other states at the moment that still dont recognize their marriages Its like getting kicked when youre down said Ms Murphy  Somebody applying for survivors benefits has already suffered loss The last thing you want is someone to tell you your marriage isnt legal and youre not worthy So she and the   are suing the Social Security Administration arguing that denying benefits to married samesex couples represents unconstitutional discrimination It is a major issue for older Americans who are lesbian and gay said  Susan Sommer an attorney at Lambda Legal who filed the lawsuit last month They started to pull down the barriers she said They took risks to live with their spouses They lived to see the Windsor case And now that theyre aging and need benefits the federal government is telling them theyre not married A quick review of recent history In  when Kathy Murphy and Sara Barker said their vows the federal Defense of Marriage Act barred samesex spouses from receiving federal benefits But last year after the   in United States v Windsor federal agencies began gearing up to extend benefits to samesex married couples Today Ms Sommer pointed out gay and straight couples are treated equally for taxation and immigration purposes they receive the same military benefits Federal employees get the same spousal benefits regardless of sexual orientation But the Social Security Administration contends that its statute requires it to follow state laws And it bases spousal benefits not on place of celebration  the state where a couple was married  but on place of domicile the state where they lived Same sex marriage remains unrecognized in Texas so Ms Murphy was not for Social Security purposes a widow In fact even in the  states where samesex marriage became legal last month  after the Supreme Court   striking down state bans  Social Security denies benefits if a marriage was not recognized on the relevant date If a lesbian beneficiary died in say Virginia last summer her widow wouldnt qualify for survivors benefits because Virginia didnt recognize their marriage on the date of death Who qualifies for Social Security benefits concerns nearly all older Americans At stake for couples are not only retirement benefits based on a spouses work history and survivor benefits when a spouse has died but in some cases payments made to a disabled spouse Lambda Legal for instance last week filed suit on behalf of Dave Williams who married Carl Allen in San Francisco in  When Mr Allen died in  Social Security owed him about  in back disability payments But it denied Mr Williams that sum and the  lumpsum death benefit payable to surviving spouses because the couple had lived in Arkansas which didnt recognize their marriage In Ms Murphys case she had originally planned to apply for Social Security benefits at her full retirement age of  But because she retired early to care for her ailing wife she receives a lower pension than anticipated She needed income and wanted spousal benefits to tide her over until she could tap her own Social Security retirement benefits The financial consequences arent trivial If she had qualified for an expected  a month in spousal benefits then applied for her own retirement benefits at  she would have received  a month for the rest of her life Instead denied spousal benefits she began drawing her own benefits early at  and therefore receives less  a month Maybe  isnt a lot to other people but its a lot to me Ms Murphy said If she survives to age  average life expectancy for an American woman who reaches  exceeds  years that difference amounts to about  Finances arent her only motivation of course She thinks Sara Barker would approve of her taking on Social Securitys policies Its a fundamental injustice Ms Murphy said As sad and tragic as losing Sara has been I feel in some tiny odd way this keeps her spirit alive a little
