Tommy Chong thinks pumping iron is far out man A lifter of heavy things from a young age the yearold comedian from Canada has put his entire fitness regimen on hold to lift and twirl a professional dancer on the current season of Dancing With the Stars Although Chong didnt have much experience with dance he had the conditioning from regular exercise that made him capable of tolerating the long hours of preparation it takes to look good beneath the mirror ball He made it through multiple eliminations all the way to the semifinals before having to hang up his dancing shoes after Monday nights performance I started weightlifting when I was  at the Calgary Y Then I ended up in Vancouver when I was  and that was when I started weight training under proper supervision Ive kept it up ever since although my approach has changed over the years One of the reasons I came to Los Angeles in  was so I could live on the beach and train at Golds Gym in Venice I was there when Arnold Schwarzenegger came Golds was where I got in pretty decent shape I trained with a famous bodybuilder named Vince Gironda who got me in shape for Up in Smoke He was really ahead of his time with his training regimen and his diet Yes When I did movies in Europe part of the deal was that the movie company had to have a fully equipped gym for every location I was at Sometimes that would be a squat rack with free weights or other times it would be a machine with all the weights on it And then I would donate the gym equipment to the various jails in whatever area I was in At the time I went to prison they abolished the weighttraining program because the inmates were getting steroids and they were getting so big that the guards couldnt cope with them so they took out the weights But they had chinup bars and a track During that time I got a bit out of weightlifting and more into walking I did some pushups and situps though About five years ago I started doing a weightlifting workout that is more aerobic style Im doing it with a trainer named Tanner Martty He puts me through all kinds of aerobic training balance training using those heavy ropes pushing a sled doing inchworms and burpees I hate burpees with a passion Its all stuff thats built more around functionality I was also told to walk as much as I could for my health so I took up golf I started playing in  and Im getting pretty good at it I take the Tommy Chong approach to golf where its really a battle with yourself I never felt exhausted because I had those years of inchworms and burpees and thats really exhausting so the dancing as a result hasnt been too tough  I love golf but I put that on hold Everything got put on hold for dancing including smoking dope
