The governments latest   shows that  in  children in the US has an autism spectrum disorder Thats a remarkable jump from just two years ago when the figure was  in  and an even bigger jump from  when it was just  in  But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the agencys skyrocketing estimates dont necessarily mean that kids are more likely to have autism now than they were  years ago It may be that were getting better at identifying autism says   director of the CDCs National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities A look behind the numbers shows why the agency is cautious about interpreting its findings and why government estimates are likely to continue rising The CDC figures come from its   which tracks yearolds in  communities around the country Government researchers decide which children have autism by reviewing records from schools doctors social services agencies and other places that work with children who have developmental disabilities But it turns out this approach can still miss a lot of kids with autism Boyle says If a child is not getting services we wont pick them up That could explain why autism rates vary so much among the communities that are part of the CDCs surveillance network For example the latest figures from a community in New Jersey show that  in  children has an autism spectrum disorder while numbers from Alabama indicate the number is just  in  The CDC also found that white children are much more likely to be identified as having autism than black or Hispanic kids even though scientists say race doesnt seem to affect a childs risk of developing the disorder Theres no reason to think that children in New Jersey are at higher risk for the disorder researchers say Whats more likely they say is that in some communities children are much less likely to be diagnosed or referred for services You cant count what you dont see says   an anthropologist at George Washington University who has studied autism prevalence in the US and other countries What all this means is that government autism estimates will probably continue to rise as communities continue to get better at recognizing the disorder Grinker says He thinks that the true prevalence of autism could be twice the current estimate A    by Grinker and other researchers found that in South Korea  in  children met the criteria for autism spectrum disorder The US is on a pace to reach the same conclusion within a few years
