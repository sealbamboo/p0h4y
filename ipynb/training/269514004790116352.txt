Its a question thats baffled evolutionary theorists for decades if survival of the fittest is the rule how have the genes that contribute to serious debilitating mental disorders survived Its   that people who suffer from schizophrenia autism anorexia and other disorders are less likely to have children And yet the genes that cause these disorders arent going away In fact   appear to be becoming more common Evolutionary theory wouldnt predict that Scientists have a few theories that attempt to explain this paradox One is that the genetic mutations that cause these disorders occurred relatively recently so not enough generations have passed to allow the evolutionary process to weed them out Another theory is that the genetic mutations that cause a disorder in one person somehow make that persons sibling more likely to have children In a situation like that the mutation offers a net benefit to a persons family A team of Swedish and British scientists recently tested these theories by comparing the rates at which people suffering from mental illness have kids to those of their siblings The data came from a medical database of more than  million Swedes The researchers found that the siblings of people who suffer from schizophrenia autism and anorexia had on average the same or fewer children than the general public which would seem to confirm the first theory But they also found that the siblings of people who suffer from depression or substance abuse had significantly more children than the general public an outcome more in line with the second theory We talked with   a professor at Kings College London who worked on the study which was published in the journal   Here are highlights from the interview edited for length and clarity A Its particularly the case with schizophrenia which in this paper and in many other papers has been shown to be a disorder that drastically reduces your fecundity  the number of kids you have Its often referred to as reduced fertility but strictly speaking people with schizophrenia arent infertile Its just that theyre less often likely to find a partner and have kids Schizophrenia is estimated to have a heritability of around  percent Same is true for autism So if these disorders are very heavily influenced by genes but the people who have the disorders are less likely to pass on their genes why arent the disorders becoming less common in the population A There are other gene disorders that have selection pressures against them but are maintained in the population A brilliant example of that is sickle cell disease If you have sickle cell disease the chances are if its untreated its going to kill you before you reach early adult life Whereas if you have the sickle cell trait  which is to say you have one copy of the gene not two copies  it protects you against malaria if you happen to live in an area where malaria is rife So theres a selective disadvantage to having the disease but theres a selective advantage to having the trait A The hypothesis would be that the relatives of the people who have the disorder who dont actually have the disorder themselves are compensating by having more children I mean not deliberately compensating by going out and having more children but theres just something about their makeup that makes them have more kids So thats essentially what we were testing in this paper We were looking at the fecundity of schizophrenics which we found to be low as was the fecundity of people with autism The question is do their relatives actually make up for this by having more kids because theyre advantaged in some way And the answer is no in the case of schizophrenia but yes in the case of depression A You need to know youll have an increased risk of getting the disorder yourself compared with the general population The risk in siblings is increased but its not increased so dramatically that it ought to stop you from having kids These arent singlegene disorders These are complex disorders where being a relative is just a risk factor not a certainty factor A It shouldnt make you say that And if you are particularly concerned about it and you have more than one relative affected by it in the family it might be worth seeking genetic counseling from an expert who knows what the risks are
