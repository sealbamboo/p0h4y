Theres just one week left for most people to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act And as people race to meet the deadline they still have questions about the law and the signup process The deadline for this open enrollment period is next   And while previous deadlines have been a little fluid the Obama administration including the   has been firm that this deadline is really the deadline This affects not just the health exchanges After March  you wont be able to buy individual health insurance  unless you have some special circumstance during the year such as losing your job getting married or moving If you miss the deadline you will have to wait until the next open enrollment period Thats not until   And that insurance wont start until next January So if youre uninsured and you can afford insurance you need to get signed up before next Monday or you could find yourself   with next years taxes for not having insurance However the March  deadline does not apply to public programs like Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program If you are eligible for those you can enroll anytime during the year Actually Ms Richardson may be eligible for Medicaid This is a big change a lot of people arent aware of In the past if you had anything beyond the most minimal savings or assets you couldnt qualify for Medicaid But the Affordable Care Act is   starting this year So if you meet the income requirements and youre in one of the states thats expanding the program to adults who dont have children and are not disabled  about   so far youre probably going to be eligible Ohio is one of those states There are a few exceptions to Medicaid expansion most notably for   Starting January  in most cases insurers can no longer refuse to insure people because of preexisting health conditions This is why there is a deadline so people dont wait until they are sick to buy insurance   those in existence as of March   are the only ones that dont have to meet the new rules And those grandfathered plans can only be continued for existing customers not sold to new ones As we pointed out   there are still some noncompliant insurance policies available on the market that allow medical underwriting such as shortterm    That insurance isnt included in the Affordable Care Act requirements For this I actually asked a   whos been working on this issue He said it depends whether the daughter will be   by her parents If not then she doesnt have to count their income And because New York is one of those states expanding Medicaid at least at first shell likely be eligible If she gets a job and that job doesnt come with insurance she may then be eligible for a subsidy to buy coverage from a health exchange And because shes experiencing a lifechange by moving back to the US shell be eligible to buy insurance   Shes one of those people for whom March  is not the deadline to buy insurance With open enrollment coming to an end so is this series So no more questions please But you can find the answers to all of your previous questions on the Affordable Care Act   at our interactive app
