Last we heard the once ubiquitous trans fats had mostly disappeared from packaged cookies muffins and french fries Thats what we reported back in November  when the Food and Drug Administration   it was intending to ban partially hydrogenated vegetable oils from all food products The proposed ban seemed prudent since eating foods with trans fats has been linked to heart disease and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that an FDA ban could prevent an additional  deaths from heart disease each year and as many as  heart attacks in that period But the FDA has yet to issue a final rule requiring food companies to eliminate trans fats entirely In the meantime researchers decided to find out just how many products still contain them Turns out its more than you might think While many food companies have found affordable alternatives to partially hydrogenated oil  in  packaged foods still contain it according to researchers at the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene A lot people think its out of the food supply but its still in a lot of places Christine Johnson Curtis an assistant commissioner at the department and an author of the   tells The Salt It appeared Thursday in the journal  To figure out how stubborn many food companies have been about not removing trans fats Curtis and her colleagues analyzed a database of  topselling packaged foods in the US including baked goods frozen foods and snacks The scientists compared the list of actual ingredients to the nutrition label on each package Of the products found to still contain the problematic oil  percent were labeled as having  grams of it The FDA allows companies to put  grams on the label even if theres up to  grams of trans fat in the food That may not seem like a lot but Curtis says that even consuming low levels of trans fats could pose a health risk We have established that theres just no benefit to consuming them  theyre not healthy for anyone she says But with a zerogram label consumers cant know how much theyre consuming and if theyre eating multiple products over the course of the day labeled zero trans fat it could add up Of all the food products the researchers looked at cookies and crackers were the most likely to still contain the oil The FDA has not indicated when it will issue a final rule but Johnson Curtis says shes hopeful food companies will eventually be required to eliminate trans fats entirely
