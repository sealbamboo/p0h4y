NBC News Kate Snow sat down with Ebola survivor and NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo on Wednesday Here are extra excerpts from their   AM Theres definitely some physical effects of this that I think are going to last a while But I can feel my strength coming back every day And I mean there was a period of time that I was quite sick And you know I was laying in a hospital bed and had no strength Had various pains And and just all kinds of funny stuff going on in my body Right now I feel like theres a little bit of a road to walk before Im  But you know to be honest I actually feel pretty good and very blessed Im just about as fortunate as a human being can feel And there were moments that I didnt know what was going to happen so its nice to be here AM I would liken it to the worst flu that you could ever have I mean I just felt at certain points that everything in my body was under attack And you know there was not so much the physical pain but I would say that the hardest part for me was the fear I was in Liberia And I knew the kind of you know statistical situations that people were facing there I had definitely seen people die in Liberia Ive seen I saw things that I will carry with me forever AM Every day You know my girlfriend in particular thats a person that I love just so deeply And Ill be honest with you As much as I was afraid for my own life the idea of leaving her was just horrific to me You know we have such an intertwined lives with each other I just couldnt even contemplate that That was the hardest thing actually even more than fear of death was the idea of leaving behind someone that I loved that much AM I was in graduate school And there was an open call to do some summer research in one of three countries in Africa And Id actually never been to Africa And I thought Hey you know this sounds interesting Why not give it a shot And I wound up in Liberia and just never looked back You know as soon as I got there I got sucked into the issues that were going on And I felt like the research that I was doing was in an important field that had a lot to do with how its future was going to pan out AM I was looking at natural resources So the you know the economy of the countrys kind of based around exploitations of natural resources And it has a lengthy history of that not going well And I think theres legitimate questions about how well natural resources are being managed now And you can see that theres tensions that have existed between communities and companies And its just something that still needs to be you know looked at And solutions need to be found I feel like it was really useful work And I wound up plugged in with some folks that were you know local activists and local advocates that had been doing work around this stuff for years And they were kind enough to give me a job and to welcome me into their family And it was just an amazing inspirational group of people to work for that you know they knew their stuff they were plugged in with a lot of organizations And I learned a lot with them And they were a great two years AM When I left Liberia the Ebola crisis seemed like it was under control It was the kind of thing that you know folks were living there had been kind of nervous about And wed all kind of known you know Ebola is in Liberia But it seemed like it was under control And then through the summer it started to get worse and worse And I just started to have a really hard time seeing some of these things happening and you know getting some of the media reports and feeling like Okay this country that I have this connection to that this crazy thing is happening And I just felt compelled to go back I have training as a journalist And I felt like I could be useful in heading back and helping to cover the crisis I know how to talk to people in Liberia I had familiarity with the governing situation politically and just the whole environment And I felt like I was going to be able to help raise a spotlight on what was going on and you know get the word out and maybe help with some of the efforts to get the international community to mobilize and send help AM Yeah under the right circumstances absolutely But I think in the immediate future is not going to be the right time And Im actually hopeful that the situation in Liberia is starting to get under some semblance of control These are some of the rumors that Ive been hearing that burial teams are picking up less bodies The ETUs are less filled So under the right circumstances I would think about going back But for right now my priority is just getting my health together AM Absolutely Thats where peoples attention should be Look the reality is that we have an incredible health care system Its staffed by talented professionals who know how to treat deadly diseases And for us I know its hard for people to understand this but we actually dont have much to fear This is something that people who work at a health care facility might have to be prepared for But the average person on the street in America has no need to fear Ebola People who do are the people who actually have the least access to what they need to survive
