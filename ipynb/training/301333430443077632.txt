 Firearm related deaths and injuries are a   in our country A lot of attention has been drawn to this problem since the horrific mass shooting in Newtown Connecticut last December including the article Implementing A Public Health Approach to Gun Violence Prevention The Importance of Physician Engagement published yesterday in   I learned about this problem though a long time ago Im a Marine Corp combat veteran of Vietnam My best friend in basic training was killed by enemy fire in Vietnam along with more than  other US soldiers After Vietnam I became an emergency physician During my residency I was shocked at the number of civilian gunshot wound victims I was seeing  Many of the gunshot victims we treated in the ER didnt make it Others were pronounced dead in the field and werent even brought to the ER And many of the patients who did survive had to deal with the devastating residuals of their injuries for the rest of their lives I soon learned that every two years in our country more US civilians are killed by guns than all the US soldiers killed in the entire  year Vietnam War I decided way back then that I would do what I could to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our country I thought that once the general public and legislators knew the facts about gun violence it would be easy to get policies in place to stop this epidemic just as we had done with the polio epidemic in the s and just as other democratic industrialized countries had done in response to mass shootings in their countries I soon learned though that changing attitudes and policies about guns in the United States was far more difficult than I had at first thought Here are some of the facts that I learned and that I shared with my patients colleagues and legislators After mass shootings in Montreal Canada in Port Arthur Australia and in Dunblane Scotland between  and  the governments of those countries moved swiftly to ban or severely restrict private ownership of handguns and semiautomatic weapons while still allowing legitimate hunters and target shooters to practice their sports In the US though the response has been very different In the words of   who was critically wounded by a gunshot to the head in  at a public forum near Tuscon Arizona In response to a horrific series of shootings that has sown terror in our communities victimized tens of thousands of Americans and left one of its own bleeding and near death in a Tucson parking lot Congress has done something quite extraordinary  nothing at all Since the Sandy Hook massacre much has been written including in medical journals about what we can do both to prevent future mass shootings and to stop the ongoing daily slaughter of US civilians by guns I dont disagree with those who advocate more research on gun violence but more research in the absence of an immediate change in public policy is just going to show more needless firearmrelated deaths Guns are not the root of all evil but the presence of a gun can turn an otherwise harmless moment of carelessness frustration or anger into a deadly tragedy In my  years as an ER doc Ive seen way too many gunrelated deaths and injuries already and most people I know have been touched in one way or another by gun violence You can take some immediate steps to reduce the chance of yourself or of one of your family members from becoming a victim of gun violence These steps include removing guns from your home or at the very least making sure that any guns that you do have are stored unloaded securely locked with the ammunition locked up separately If you have children ask about guns in homes where your children go to play Clearly we need to do much more than just remove or secure the guns in our homes to stop the epidemic of gun violence The American Academy of Pediatrics took the position in the year  that Firearm regulations to include bans on handguns and assault weapons are the best way to prevent firearm deaths and injuries The limited steps proposed by President Obama state and federal legislators gun violence researchers and other policy makers are necessary but not sufficient to prevent future mass shootings and to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our country In the absence of anything short of a ban on handguns and assault weapons its not predictable when and where the next mass shooting will occur but it is certain that more mass shootings will occur and that the rates of firearmrelated deaths will continue to be far higher in the US than in other democratic industrialized countries which have far more stringent gun control laws As the mother of a Sandy Hook Elementary School student stated at a recent congressional hearing  We stop being something to be proud of when we love our guns more than we love our children Firearm related deaths and injuries are a serious public health problem in our country I agree with the authors the  article that we should take a public health approach to this problem including   and other health care providers I believe though that health care providers must work closely with policy makers and the general public and that we dont need to wait for more research before taking definitive action In the ER we try to simplify our approach to critical situations beginning with the ABCs  A for airway B for breathing and C for circulation I suggest a similar approach to stopping the gun violence epidemic beginning with A  dopt similar legislation to that in other democratic industrialized countries that have far lower rates of firearm related deaths and injuries while still allowing legitimate hunters and target shooters to practice their sports B  e bold as   urged at a recent congressional hearing C  oordinate our efforts with other like minded individuals and organizations  all or write our state and federal legislators and above all show that we  are about our  hildren more than our guns
