Autism is much more common than previously thought according to a new government report that estimates that  in  children have some form of the disorder Boosting the rate has become a twoyear ritual since theÂ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a surveillance system more than a decade ago The last estimate in  was  in  up from  in  two years before that As in the past researchers could not say what was driving the increase While the role of environmental factors remains an open question rising awareness of the disorder greater detection and improved access to services have all been shown to be significant factors in the explosive growth in diagnosis over the last two decades To arrive at   CDC researchers do not examine any children directly Instead they comb through health and education records for hundreds of thousands of yearolds looking for indications of autism  either a formal diagnosis or symptoms of the disorder The analysis released Thursday was based on data collected in  from  surveillance areas around the country including ones in Maryland Wisconsin Arizona and Colorado People living in the surveillance areas represent  of the US population Research has long shown that boys are most susceptible to autism and indeed their rate   in   was far higher than the rate in girls   in  But large geographic and racial differences in the rates illustrate the difficulty of relying on records to determine the true prevalence of the disorder Alabama had the lowest rate   in  The highest rate was in New Jersey   in  The rate for whites was  in  which was  higher than for black children and  higher than for Latino children There is little evidence to suggest that such differences have anything to do with biology Rather they probably reflect differences in the degree to which the diagnosis and services have taken hold in different communities In some places doctors and school officials are more likely to make a diagnosis or take note of symptoms and include them in records The CDC analysis found that much of the racial variation stemmed from a high rate of diagnosis among white children of normal or abovenormal intelligence Historically the vast majority of people with autism were thought to be mentally retarded Today that is no longer the case  especially among whites The CDC found that only  of those identified as autistic had an intellectual disability That figure was  for black children and  for Latinos Twitter
