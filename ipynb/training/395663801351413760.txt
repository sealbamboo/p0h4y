Back in April we   Rob Rhineharts experiment concocting something that could give him all the nutrition and none of the hassle of food Rhinehart you see is a yearold electrical engineer in San Francisco whod grown exceedingly frustrated with the time and effort of purchasing preparing and consuming food not to mention the cleanup When he went in search of a cheap nutritious powdered food product he could whip up he found nothing So he decided to make one himself Last week Rhinehart   on his blog that he had raised  million in seed capital from several venture capital and angel investor firms in Silicon Valley including Andreessen Horowitz and Initialized Capital to scale up production of his product called Soylent He added that hed gotten another  million in preorders Apparently his offthewall idea has some legs We were among Rhineharts skeptics well admit We werent sure that a layperson could come up with a meal replacement product equivalent to a diverse diet of real food But in the months since he first announced his project hes gotten a ton of feedback on his formulation Heres   from someone who tried two weeks on Soylent And hes also discovered that there are a lot of people out there likely to buy it Among them are young singles like him who are working plus hours a week and paying off student loans In other words people with no time or interest in cooking and little disposable income for restaurants Since we last spoke Rhinehart has adjusted his pitch a bit Rather than calling Soylent an ideal diet hes calling it a healthier convenient alternative to takeout and rice and beans  the food he used to subsist on and the food he believes his target market consumes regretfully Im not demanding that anybody live on this exclusively he says Its supposed to be an easy staple meal And as for the people who were shocked even rankled by Rhineharts assertion that he knew what the human body needed hes thrown them a bone He now has a team of advisers including a doctor to help him get the nutrient ratios right   at the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University One of the big changes he made was to the amount of omega and omega fatty acids in the formulation Soylents main ingredient is oat starch the rest are industrial nutrients like calcium carbonate and magnesium gluconate Its glutenfree vegan and halal Its supposed to be something anyone can enjoy Rhinehart says The product might still draw criticism for its lack of diseasefighting   found in fresh fruits and vegetables I wanted to keep it to bare essential nutrients says Rhinehart At this point until we know more about phytonutrients its better to stick to strictly essentials Rhinehart has now been consuming Soylent for about  months He says he makes two to four shakes a day during the week His fridge contains only Soylent water and beer he claims On the weekend he goes to restaurants with friends  what he calls recreational eating After a few months of Soylent Rhinehart wrote that he felt better than hed ever felt physically and mentally And today Back then I was coming off a terrible diet but yeah I still feel great he says I still get blood tests body metrics and everything still looks good Come December Soylent will begin shipping to everyone who has preordered it The cost is about  for a weeks supply of meals or about  a meal And Rhinehart will be moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles where warehouse space is cheaper he says And will those famous LA tacos tempt him to give up Soylent during the week we had to wonder I like food I really do says Rhinehart There are just other things I find more interesting right now Food is not nutrition to me its art After I finish paying off my student loans Ill go to more art galleries and Ill eat more food
