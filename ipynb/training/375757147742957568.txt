Heres a bit of news that might make you drop that chicken nugget midbite Just before the start of the long holiday weekend last Friday the US Department of Agriculture quietly   that it was ending a ban on processed chicken imports from China The kicker These products can now be sold in the US without a countryoforigin label For starters just four Chinese processing plants will be allowed to export cooked chicken products to the US as first reported by   The plants in question passed USDA inspection in March Initially these processors will only be allowed to export chicken products made from birds that were raised in the US and Canada Because of that the poultry processors wont be required to have a USDA inspector on site as     adding And because the poultry will be processed it will not require countryoforigin labeling Nor will consumers eating chicken noodle soup from a can or chicken nuggets in a fastfood restaurant know if the chicken came from Chinese processing plants Thats a pretty disturbing thought for anyone whos followed the slew of stories regarding food safety failures in China in recent years As weve   on The Salt this year alone thousands of dead pigs turned up in the waters of Shanghai rat meat was passed off as mutton and  perhaps most disconcerting for US consumers  there was an outbreak of the   among live fowl in fresh meat markets Whats more critics fear that the changes could eventually open the floodgates for a whole slew of chicken products from China As the industry publication   notes The USDAs decision comes with a backdrop of longrunning trade disputes over meat between the US and China In a nutshell China banned US beef exports in  after a case of mad cow disease turned up in a Washington state cow Then when the bird flu virus broke out widely among Asian bird flocks in  the US blocked imports of Chinese poultry China challenged that decision in front of the World Trade Organization which   in Chinas favor in  And chicken lovers brace yourselves Theres more A report suggests chicken inspections here in the US might be poised to take a turn for the worse The Government Accountability Office   this week it has serious questions about the validity of the new procedures for inspecting poultry across the country Basically these changes would replace many USDA inspectors on chicken processing lines with employees from the poultry companies themselves The USDA has been piloting the new procedures which will save money and significantly speed up processing lines in  chicken plants As     the plan is to roll out the new procedures eventually to most of the countrys  chicken and  turkey plants The problem According to the GAO the USDA did a poor job of evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot programs it has in place As a result the report concludes its hard to justify the USDAs conclusions that the new procedures will do a better job than current approaches at cutting down on the number of dangerous bacteria like salmonella that pop up on the birds that will later end up on our dinner tables Still the USDA maintains that the changes will in fact boost food safety In a   published on Food Safety News USDA food safety and inspections administrator   writes If finalized and implemented broadly this new inspection system would enable USDA inspectors to better fulfill our food safety mission Nothing in the GAOs report contradicts this basic fact
