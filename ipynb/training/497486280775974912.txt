As if confined in a sinister maze cancer patients often discover that some routes lead to forking branches It may be impossible to find a way through the bewildering medical labyrinth without feeling lost My oncologist Dr Matei pointing out treatment paths tells me to choose Its up to you she says   When I had to decide between resuming chemotherapy or entering a Phase I clinical trial Dr Matei outlined the pros and cons She realized that I wanted to participate responsibly in selecting a course that would affect me profoundly But my ignorance of complex medical protocols led to fearful qualms as I tried to make an informed decision about the benefits and perils of the options    In part because of the patient empowerment movement in part because of the changing array of available therapies a series of problematic choices confront people dealing with cancer These alternatives must usually be considered under circumstances that are fraught with urgency and anxiety about outcomes   A colleague with prostate cancer was tormented for months by conflicting advice from the specialists he consulted Would surgery or radiation pose a greater threat of incontinence and impotence Breast cancer patients who are offered a lumpectomy with radiation or a mastectomy with chemotherapy may find themselves agonizing over current research as they consider the statistical outcomes and side effects of treatment for their particular tumor type Then theres the vexed issue of reconstruction Debates that swirled around the actress Angelina Jolie prove how fraught decision making can be for young adults who do not have but might develop cancer If one tests positive for a genetic mutation that raises the probability of breast and ovarian cancers is it better to wait and monitor with surveillance or to opt for preventive surgery Not everyone has the privilege of making such a decision but it rarely feels like a privilege   Although MsJolie had double mastectomies breasts can be more easily screened than ovaries which produce more deadly  cancers The journalist Masha Gessen who made the same decision as Ms Jolie lists the side effects of the surgically induced menopause that follows an oophorectomy risk of heart disease high blood pressure osteoporosis cognitive problems and depression  as well as inelastic skin and weight gain For younger women infertility must be added But there is no reliable detection tool for ovarian cancer And doctors specializing in BRCA mutations disagree about whether removal of the ovaries and the fallopian tubes or a complete hysterectomy should be recommended   Because waiting and monitoring can produce false negatives not to mention nerveracking uncertainty and because  prophylactic surgery can go terribly wrong the alternatives put me in mind of my parents phrase alle beide stinken meaning all of them stink     A former graduate student with liver metastases was offered two ways to deal with a stomach swollen by ascites the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity produced by cancer cells She could continue going to a hospital once a week to have it drained or opt for peritoneal tubes connected to an external bottle which would have meant fewer hospital trips and smaller amounts of fluid withdrawn less painfully But they might result in perforation infection leakage or blockage Even though she was exhausted and depressed  hardly the ideal state in which to make a decision  it was up to her Though my student was receptive to palliative aids she had already made the most difficult decision cancer patients confront one which can generate formidable tensions in any family The determination to forgo further curative treatment may ignite distress in relatives desperate to maintain the lives of their loved ones In this context as in the others I doubt that most people would want to return to the paternalism of the past when physicians monopolized medical decision making Yet many of us need the guidance of our doctors whose training and experience make them better able to calculate the brutal risks   The playwright Eve Ensler certainly did and she  asked her doctor why he recommended radiation that would make it difficult  for her to eat or excrete According to her memoir In the Body of the World he said Its up to you Only you can decide When she then inquired What would you do if this were your body he responded Cant say After she pressed again he recited the mantra of the end of the world We like to throw everything at it he said Thats all we know how to do Happily I cannot imagine those words coming out of the mouth of my oncologist While appreciating my values and priorities Dr Matei uses her medical expertise not to throw everything at it but to counsel me We shared responsibility for making what turned out to be a good decision in favor of the Phase I trial   Cancer patients and physicians should engage in serious conversations I always bring my partner or a friend to such a session so the discussions can continue afterward with someone who has listened to the choices their rationales and their potential consequences     Are there other diseases that require this stressful level of patient decision making Given the angst such choices generate I understand why some people refuse them and reject standard care in favor of daily quarts of carrot juice  not my decision but its up to them Whether or not carrots are curative good vision in a savage wood is what we all need
