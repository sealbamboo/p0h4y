Samantha Power the US ambassador to the United Nations just returned from a fourday trip to all three of West Africas Ebolastricken countries Speaking with Melissa Block of   she said she saw promising signs of recovery but had also gained a sense of just how much work must still be done In Liberia Power was struck by the gratitude expressed to the United States for rescuing these countries in their hour of greatest need A Liberian told her America is the only country that is treating us like we are Nina Pham the Dallas nurse recently declared Ebolafree America is hugging us like President Obama hugged Nina Pham The US has deployed  ground troops to help construct  Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Power said the effect is already noticeable She visited a medical laboratory six hours away from the capital Monrovia where the assistance of US troops had helped cut the wait time for results of an Ebola test from a week to just a few hours This means fewer people will become infected by spending days waiting with already diagnosed Ebola patients to find out their diagnosis And more beds will be available for those who actually have the disease The morale of everyone associated with the antiEbola effort is increasing and the recruitment of local workers was increasing Power said The knowledge that there are more beds has all these knockon effects People are more likely to come forward and be a hygienist or a sanitation worker knowing there will be a place for them if protocol is breached and they fall ill She also saw better safety precautions resulting from improved training efforts And employees and volunteers are sticking with assignments longer But Power says these promising signs arent reflected evenly across the infection zone Efforts in Monrovia and Freetown Sierra Leones capital still need to be replicated outside these central cities especially in rural areas where the disease continues to spread It does show you what can be scaled if you have the resources if you have the international health workers if you have the helicopters to get to the more distant areas Power who didnt interact with patients or enter an Ebola treatment unit was screened when she arrived back in the US then allowed to leave the airport She will be taking her temperature twice a day for  days and calling it in to state health workers She supports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggestions for returning health care workers They should visit a doctor who can approve them to return to daily life as long as they continue to monitor their temperature She also warned against measures that would discourage health care workers from working in the Ebola zone The way we will keep the American people safe is we will contribute to ending Ebola in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone and we will mobilize the world to do the same she said Anything that deters or discourages or stigmatizes workers who are part of that solution  is something we want to avoid And she paid respect to the foreign health care workers who have come to help We are going out of the way to remind everybody  of the heroism being exhibited by doctors and nurses who have traveled to these countries
