The job of parenting toddlers aint easy Consider the yearold todo list Get tantrums under control Potty train Transition from whole milk to lowfat milk Speaking from experience only   of these things was easy As my daughter turned  in January we made the simple switch to reducedfat milk Done Dont need to overthink this one right After all Im following the evidencebased advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics The   is based on studies that found children who consumed lowfat milk as part of a reducedsaturatedfat diet had lower concentrations of LDL cholesterol Given the body of evidence in adults linking high cholesterol to increased risk of heart disease it makes sense to keep an eye on cholesterol beginning in childhood And if you take fat out of milk youve also reduced calories which should help protect kids against becoming overweight At least thats been the assumption So heres where things gets confusing A   of preschoolaged children published in the   a sister publication of the   finds that lowfat milk was associated with higher weight Thats right kids drinking lowfat milk tended to be heavier We were quite surprised by the findings Dr   told me in an email He and his coauthor Dr   both of the University of Virginia had hypothesized just the opposite But they found the relationship between skimmilk drinkers and higher body weights held up across all racialethnic and socioeconomic groups DeBoer says their data also show that lowfat milk did not restrain weight gain in preschoolers over time The study included about  children in the United States Parents were interviewed about their childs beverage consumption on two occasions once when the children were  years old and again at  years Direct measurements of height and weight to calculate body mass index were taken by researchers Interestingly this is not the first study to point in this direction In a   researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital reported that skim and  percent milk were associated with weight gain among toyearolds And a    by researchers at Childrens Hospital in Boston which also looked at preschoolaged children found that higher intake of whole milk at age  was associated with a slightly lower BMI body mass index The researchers concluded that switching from whole milk to reducedfat milk at  years did not appear to prevent weight problems in early childhood When you look at these studies together DeBoers findings become more intriguing though its unclear how higher fat could lead to lower weight One theory Its possible that whole milk gives us a greater sense of satiety This is speculative says DeBoer but if you feel fuller after drinking wholefat milk it may be protective if the other food options are high in calories In other words if wholefat milk saves a kid from eating an extra cookie or a second serving of mashed potatoes he or she may end up eating fewer calories overall As the authors acknowledge one of the shortcomings of the new study is that the researchers did not know how many calories the children were consuming overall or what types of foods they were eating So is it time to think anew about switching toddlers to lowfat milk I dont think there is harm in rethinking a recommendation particularly if there werent rigorous data behind it says DeBoer He says he hopes his results lead to further more definitive studies But not everyone is convinced I do think that the  recommendation to give lowfat milk at age  is sound advice says Dr   a pediatrician at the University of Colorado and member of the AAPs Committee on Nutrition I dont think the   between lowfat milk and higher weight makes much sense from a biological perspective he says Some of the earliest studies evaluating diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol did find a link to less obesity among girls And Daniels points out that in the new study the toddlers who were on lowfat milk were already heavier This leaves open the real chance that parents may have been choosing lowfat milk as a weightmanagement strategy for those who were already overweight Daniels says Parents if this leaves you confused one thing to keep in mind is that  whether its whole  percent or skim  milk is probably not a major driver when it comes to childhood weight problems Many studies have shown that sugarsweetened beverages play a much
