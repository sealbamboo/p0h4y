This year’s flu vaccine may not fully protect against the virus because the season’s most common strain has mutated, or “drifted,” from the form the shot targets, federal officials said Thursday.. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is still recommending vaccination for most Americans because the shot will offer some protection. Vaccinated patients who become infected with the drifted strain of the virus will likely experience less-severe symptoms, said Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.
