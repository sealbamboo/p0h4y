A few days after I wrote about   reader Sue Murray emailed me from Westchester County Her subject line Have you heard of  Charles Bonnet Syndrome I hadnt and until about six months ago neither had Ms Murray Her mother Elizabeth who is  has glaucoma and macular degeneration and has been gradually losing her vision Ms Murray explained So at first her family was excited when Elizabeth seemed to be seeing things more clearly Maybe they thought her vision was returning But the things she was seeing  patterns and colors strangers a green man  werent there She insisted that there were people in the cellar people on the porch people in the house Ms Murray said Shed point and say Dont you see them And shed get mad when we didnt Elizabeth and her husband Victor  live in Connecticut in a house they bought  years ago For a while the Green Man as Elizabeth began calling him seemed to have moved in too Shed start hiding things in the closet so the Green Man wouldnt take them Ms Murray said There wasnt any real fear it was just Look at that Elizabeths ophthalmologist promptly supplied the name for this condition   named for a Swiss philosopher who described such visual hallucinations in the th century We were relieved said Ms Murray What they feared of course was mental illness or dementia To have an eye doctor say Im familiar with this its still jarring but its not so terrible Bonnet Syndrome pronounced BohNAY isnt terribly rare it turns out Oliver Sacks described several cases in his  book Hallucinations Dr Abdhish Bhavsar a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a retina specialist in Minneapolis estimates that he has probably seen about  patients with the syndrome over  years of practice Like Mrs Murrays mother his patients with Bonnet Syndrome have reduced vision  usually agerelated macular degeneration glaucoma or cataracts Various European studies have found that approximately  to  percent of older adults with low vision or macular degeneration develop the condition some studies have found higher rates But with about  million Americans over age    thats a lot of people seeing things The numbers are all across the board said Dr Bhavsar who thinks the rate of Bonnet Syndrome is closer to  percent among those with low vision But since these eye diseases occur more often in older adults whose numbers are increasing ophthalmologists will be seeing more cases  if patients arent too fearful to tell their doctors or families what is going on They want to know if theyre going crazy and we say Absolutely not you are not losing your marbles Dr Bhavsar told me in an interview Dispelling that saying its a known phenomenon with a name and that nothing else is wrong with them they immediately feel relieved Even if like one patient they continue to see squirrels popping out of the ground The hallucinations he explained can occur intermittently  a few times a day or weeks apart  or nearly constantly They can last seconds or minutes Frequently they dissipate in a year to  months but not always Most respondents to a recent British survey said their hallucinations   and roughly a third said they had experienced fear and some loss of normal activities That the surveys were distributed to members of a national vision charity might have influenced those findings The problem doesnt originate in peoples eyes but in their brains which appear to misinterpret the reduced visual signals The hallucinations are purely visual someone who also hears things has something other than Bonnet Though there is no effective treatment most of his patients cope reasonably well Dr Bhavsar said Some are amused by what they call their own private movies Counseling at lowvision rehabilitation centers can help people adjust Silence isnt golden in these cases Seeing an ophthalmologist wont stop people from seeing patterns animals and faces but it can provide reassurance that they are not facing diseases most people find much scarier One Minnesota internist thought his elderly patient had schizophrenia and was on the verge of prescribing psychotropic meds until he consulted Dr Bhavsar who explained about Bonnet Syndrome In Connecticut where Sue Murray and her siblings work hard to keep their parents at home the bizarre has become fairly normal There is not much to do but wait it out The Green Man has stopped showing up but theres a woman now and my mothers convinced shes after my father Ms Murray said She says That womans here I say Tell her to go away The Green Man is gone and were hoping the rest will disappear too
