The doctorpatient relationship can be a close one  but in this weeks Scrubbing Up column Dr Naeem Nazem of the MDDUS asks  can that relationship be extended into social media Whether you embrace it or not the vast majority of people use social media as part of their everyday lives  Recent figures show there are a staggering  million  and counting  active Facebook users in the UK while one in four people  million have Twitter accounts  There are undoubted benefits as social media offers a platform for doctors to network effectively share views and develop their own knowledge and expertise  For patients engaging with social media it can educate and raise awareness by giving them greater access to healthcare information But if you would trust your doctor with your life could you be their Facebook friend On the face of it it doesnt seem like an unreasonable question  or request  However patients interacting with their doctors on social media may inadvertently create an uncomfortable and awkward situation  It also risks blurring the boundaries in the doctorpatient relationship which could impact on the quality of care they receive Patients should consider that doctors are bound by guidance from the General Medical Council which states that you should not mix social and professional relationships and that Social media can blur the boundaries between a doctors personal and professional life and may change the nature of the relationship between a doctor and a patient The rise of social media has created some serious ethical challenges for doctors and their relationship with patients  Even with the proper privacy settings in place anything posted online may end up being distributed further than intended  Doctors must keep their relationship with patients professional or they risk becoming too close which can cloud their judgement and affect their objectivity and clinical decision making While Facebook often gives an insight into a persons private life Twitter is more likely to be used in a professional manner with many doctors discussing healthcare issues via a tweet of  characters or less  However when tweeting doctors should ensure patient confidentiality and only share information on Twitter that cannot be linked to an individual patient Doctors and patients should recognise the unique nature of their relationship   Patients trust their doctors with information they may not have shared with any of their family or friends  Doctors have a duty to respect this information and keep it confidential    Patients should appreciate the need to keep things professional with their doctor and understand that social media can complicate or alter the nature of that relationship  During a routine appointment the amount of time allocated to each patient is fairly limited so the doctor needs to make sure they make best use of that time  For example a doctor could make a wrong diagnosis or fail to spot symptoms in a patient and a Facebook friend if they are too busy fielding questions about the barbeque they hosted last Saturday  the patient may have seen the photographs posted on their doctors Facebook page timeline and perhaps noticed a mutual acquaintance  Such a scenario seems harmless enough but the doctor is put in an awkward position and the attention is shifted away from addressing the patients healthcare needs We have encountered a range of cases where doctors have sought advice from us regarding social media issues from critical or abusive posts from patients to hate campaigns It is of little surprise to see the number of cases on the subject grow dramatically over the last few years  Our figures reveal that between  and  there were over four times as many calls from doctors on the subject of social media with the indications that this figure will continue to rise this year Social media is a powerful tool and can offer an insight into a doctor when they are off duty  Perhaps that is why a patient would want to befriend their doctor in the first place  the intrigue of catching a glimpse of their life without the stethoscope around their neck  As a doctor the reality is you are never off duty and their status in the public eye demands a high standard of conduct at all times  By interacting with patients online they are exposing themselves to be scrutinised from their own homes  Patients should also respect that and think twice about requesting access to their doctors private lives for the good of their relationship with their doctor  Patients should feel comfortable in sharing their personal information and their health with their doctors  but not their Facebook status
