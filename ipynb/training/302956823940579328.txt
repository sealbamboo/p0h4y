 Investigational agents that act directly against the   virus HCV may allow previously untreated patients to avoid interferon therapy long a standard of care researchers said Two phase IIa studies reported in the Jan  issue of the   found promising results with different agents either without interferon or with reduced use of the drug Both studies also found less impressive outcomes among patients previously treated unsuccessfully with the standard combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon The development of socalled directacting agents delivered orally has held the promise of eliminating the need for treatment with interferon which is difficult to tolerate and must be administered by subcutaneous injection The development of an interferonfree alloral treatment regimen would represent an important advance argued researchers led by Edward Gane MD of Auckland City Hospital in Auckland New Zealand In an openlabel study Gane and his colleagues gave the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for up to  weeks to eight groups of HCV patients Gane and colleagues have   some of the promising results in the genotype  and  patients but early outcomes among those with genotype  regarded as more difficult to cure were disturbing Specifically as they reported in the journal  of  who had previously failed interferonbased treatment relapsed quickly after the end of treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin On the other hand all of the patients in the first four groups achieved a sustained virologic response at  weeks SVR  defined as no detectable HCV RNA  weeks after the end of therapy  which is usually regarded as a cure And all  patients who got sofosbuvir peginterferon alfaa and ribavirin for  weeks achieved SVR as did  of  who got sofosbuvir monotherapy Importantly  of  previously untreated patients with HCV genotype   or  percent  achieved SVR after  weeks of treatment therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin Taken together Gane and colleagues concluded the data suggest that  weeks of the alloral combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin is likely to be effective regardless of genotype as long as patients have not previously been treated with interferon and ribavirin The results potentially pave the way to an alloral shortduration regimen that does not use interferon Gane and colleagues concluded arguing that the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin deserves further study Investigators on the second study led by Fred Poordad MD of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio came to similar conclusions about a different regimen In a week openlabel study a combination of two directacting agents along with ribavirin yielded good results in treatmentnave patients with genotype  virus but did less well among those who had previously been treated with interferon and ribavirin The investigational drugs were ABT an inhibitor of the viral NS protease boosted with lowdose ritonavir and ABT a nonnucleoside NSB polymerase inhibitor All patients got ABT and ribavirin as well as one of two doses of ABTr   or  mg daily with  mg of ritonavir in either case  for  weeks and were followed for  weeks after the end of therapy The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who reached a socalled extended rapid virologic response defined as undetectable viral RNA from week  through week  By that token Poordad and colleagues reported Poordad and colleagues argued that the findings suggest the regimen will do well among previously untreated patients with genotype  infection but added that larger studies are needed to confirm the results Source
