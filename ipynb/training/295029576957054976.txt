   an hour a day could beat back a genetic predisposition to be overweight compared to those who plant themselves in front of the TV new research suggests The findings dont prove that the   is the specific factor that makes a difference because its possible that something else could explain why those who walked were thinner the researchers stressed Also the difference would amount to less than a pound for many people Still the message is that while we cannot change genes we can do something to change the influence of genes by increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior said study author Qibin Qi a research fellow with the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health Research has suggested that   Qi said As scientists study what makes people fat from a biological point of view one of the big issues is this How can you turn back a genetic tide that may make you more likely to put on pounds just because you were born to a specific set of parents In the new study Qi and colleagues tried to tease out an answer They came up with one although it has caveats The researchers analyzed the results of two studies that tracked about  female and  male health professionals The studies included data about how much time the people spent watching TV and walking in the two years prior to their weight being measured The researchers looked at a measurement called   BMI that analyzes whether a persons height and weight are proportional The formula is kilogramsmeter squared kgmsquared Genes that have been linked to obesity boosted weight by  kgmsquared Those who briskly walked an hour a day had a  kgmsquared decrease in the genetic effect For each two hours a day people spent watching TV the BMI went up by  kgmsquared The differences wouldnt amount to much for many individuals A foottall person who weighs  pounds would have a BMI of  and an increase of one pound would boost the BMI to   a  difference So should you take an hourlong walk every day to beat back our genetic heritage We dont know whether it is   physical activity that reduced the genetic risk or whether a generally healthy lifestyle would have the same effect said Ruth Loos director of Genetics of Obesity and Related Metabolic Traits at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine After all people who are physically active tend to eat more healthily and smoke less etc but in these types of studies the contribution of these different aspects of a healthy lifestyle are hard to tease apart The study was scheduled to be presented Wednesday at an American Heart Association meeting in San Diego Data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal
