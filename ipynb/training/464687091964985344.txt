Aberdeen Ohio Jenessa Moman lives in a cozy onestory house in this town of just  a fiveminute drive from George Clooneys Kentucky hometown Out back there is a trampoline and swingset Momans living room is full of toys houseplants and family photos beside slogans like Live Love Laugh On a quiet weekday her two daughters aged two and nine play word games on the iPad chat about My Little Pony and eat yogurt while her eightmonthold son kicks and coos in his pack n play Cmon baby she says brightly as she picks him up Bouncing her chubby brighteyed baby in her arms Moman  is the picture of domesticity And yet until recently the countys child welfare department was dropping in for semiweekly unannounced visits Moman is one of an increasing number of American women who find themselves in trouble with child welfare authorities or law enforcement after giving birth to babies who test positive for legal drugs prescribed by their doctors Momans saga began on a cold night in  when her younger sister didnt come home Afraid shed been in a wreck Moman went out searching for her to no avail By the time police found the car her sister had frozen to death Moman learned that shed passed by her sisters car but hadnt seen it in the darkness We were right there Moman says I could have saved her life I lost my best friend Moman then the mother of two young girls fell into a deep depression She started taking prescription painkillers and then graduated to something cheaper and more readily available heroin She says she kept her drug use hidden I cant even believe that person was me she says But I was very vulnerable When Moman found out she was pregnant she confessed her drug use to her childrens father with whom shes lived for  years They went to a doctor in Cincinnati a licensed addiction specialist who told her that giving up opiates cold turkey while pregnant could result in a miscarriage He put her on a maintenance program using the drug   another formulation is Suboxone which contains buprenorphine hydrochloride and works to reduce the symptoms of opiate dependence The drug is not without risks but according to a  statement by the   Babies born to women addicted to opioids fare better when their mothers are treated with either the addiction medication buprenorphine or methadone than babies whose mothers are not treated at all That is the course of action recommended by the World Health Organization the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Moman says the treatment has been a lifesaver keeping her on an even keel and without cravings In months when she has been without health insurance she has paid hundreds of dollars a month for it Moman had a normal pregnancy When she delivered her baby on July   he appeared healthy But  hours later he started showing signs of withdrawal including loose stools and crankiness He was diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome   which can manifest itself in a range of symptoms including diarrhea fever and seizures No one wants to hear theyve done something to cause their baby suffering she says crying The baby was successfully treated with methadone and was home after  days He did awesome Moman says And his longterm prognosis is good There is no clear evidence of NAS babies experiencing longterm damage according to  doctors who cosigned a  to that effect last year If you control for the economic situation of the family education and all these things the drug use as far as I know has never been associated with lasting problems for the baby says Robert Newman MD president emeritus of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York But because Momans baby was experiencing withdrawal the hospital contacted the Brown County child welfare agency I understood that they might want to come out and see Moman says But the next day we got a phone call saying they were taking me to court for abuse For five months Moman says she received regular unannounced visits from the department It put a lot of stress on our family she says My nineyearold said Why are these people here Are they going to take me away Im a good mom I just had that problem But during my pregnancy I was good I turned my life completely around Sometimes addicts have to have a reason to get help What better reason is there than that Your own children Pregnant opiate users and addicts say they sometimes hear one thing from health professionals who may recommend they be put on a maintenance program like Subutex or Suboxone and another thing from law enforcement or child welfare agents who may say that mothers who use any drug even Subutex or Suboxone should be investigated This puts many women in the Catch of either trying to go off a drug completely while pregnant knowing it could result in a miscarriage or following their doctors orders and fearing that their baby could be taken away at birth A representative of the Ohio state child welfare agency says that county directors have discretion in accepting referrals in cases where legal drugs have caused problems The impact of prenatal drug exposure on a newborn is not limited to illicit substances he said Momans county is one of many around the country in which the child welfare agency considers NAS grounds for investigation regardless of whether the source is heroin or Suboxone Our position is that upon learning that the person is pregnant that this would be a time that the person would take action to get themselves off of drugs to keep themselves as clean as possible says Mitch Sharp Director of Brown Countys Department of Job and Family Services who could not speak about Momans case specifically but confirmed that his agency has pursued a couple of cases in which women were in a maintenance program There are some doctors some clinics who feel that Suboxone is almost like a therapeutic drug to help them get off heroin but it is still a lowerlevel opiate It will still cause the child to go through withdrawals Sharp says that Southwest Ohio has seen a heroin epidemic over the past four or five years and that addiction has led to a surge in children being removed from their parents care Very seldom do we ever leave a child in a home where we have positive tests and know that one or both parents are using drugs says Sharp The Centers for Disease Control has proclaimed opiate addiction a national epidemic And according to   one in five pregnant women in this country take some form of opiate during pregnancy Some of their babies will experience NAS which may entail a hospital stay that can cost somewhere around five times more than that of a nonNAS newborn and last an average of about  days Rick Massatti research administrator with the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Drug Addiction Services says NAS has hit Ohios healthcare system hard You have kids staying a really long time says Massatti Its not like in a day youre gone Lawmakers have proposed various approaches to this problem some punitive Depending on where they live women who give birth to babies showing NAS symptoms or testing positive for opiates including Subutex may be subject to child welfare involvement mandatory drug treatment or even prison In  states drug use during pregnancy is considered child abuse and in three it is grounds for arrest according to the   Tennessee just passed an especially severe law holding women criminally liable for giving birth to babies who experience NAS Kylee Sunderlin the Soros Justice Fellow at National Advocates for Pregnant Women which provides legal advice and advocacy for pregnant women says shes seen the number of cases like Momans ramp up in the past year or so and that there is no one broadlyaccepted protocol for dealing with them Some people assume the protocol for opiatemaintenance NAS cases is statebystate says Sunderlin Its really countybycounty You can have counties right next to each other where one would not bat an eye at a baby diagnosed with NAS and experiencing withdrawal from Subutex and would allow parents and doctors to proceed as they wish In the next county the baby may be kept from going home from the hospital with the mother There is such stigma that its hard to separate whats fueled by CPS thinking there really is harm and whats just a gross misunderstanding of what medicationassisted treatment is The federal   requires CPS to have a system in place in cases where babies have been identified as affected by illicit drugs or withdrawal symptoms although the law specifically states that such circumstances dont establish child abuse or neglect says Nancy Young PhD Director of Children and Family Futures a Californiabased consulting firm that works on these issues In the case that a mom is being maintained for an opiate addiction with medication and the baby experiences withdrawal there would be a requirement that CPS has a plan to ensure the safe care of the baby if the hospital notifies child welfare says Young If the mom has an opiate addiction you want them on medicationassisted treatment Thats the standard medical protocol Babies arent born addicted They can be managed very effectively through NAS and do fine In New Jersey a woman identified in court paperwork only as YN was receiving methadone treatment for an opiate addiction when she gave birth to a baby boy Paul in  When Paul showed signs of methadone withdrawal child welfare authorities charged his mother with child abuse The courts conclusion Where there is evidence of actual impairment it is immaterial whether the drugs were from a legal or illicit source Susan Neshin MD Medical Director of Jersey Shore Addiction Services who has provided methadone treatment to pregnant women for  years called the case ludicrous This maintenance is the accepted standard of care she said How can you then turn around and say shes committed child abuse National Advocates for Pregnant Women became involved in Momans case in December  and on January th the abuse and neglect charges against her were dropped But theres a twist just months after her baby was born she learned that she was unexpectedly pregnant again Her period hadnt resumed and she hadnt yet received a planned IUD She is also on doctors orders still taking Subutex As Moman waits for her fourth child due in July she wonders what will happen when this baby a girl is born with the drug in her system I even considered abortion even though Im totally against that Moman says She wants the baby but feels guilty that she may need to be treated for NAS and that any complications may lead to CPS involvement This time she is planning to deliver two hours away at a hospital where there is a special program for women in her situation And yet Moman remains anxious Im so scared to put my family through this again
