Voters in Berkeley Calif have passed the nations first soda tax with a resounding  percent of the vote The measure aimed to reduce the effects of sugar consumption on health especially in increased rates of obesity and diabetes More than  cities and states across the country have attempted such a tax but have failed at least in part because of big spending by the soda industry to defeat these measures Across the bay in San Francisco however a similar proposal failed to get the twothirds supermajority it needed Berkeleys Measure D needed only a simple majority to pass It will levy a pennyperounce tax on   and is estimated to raise more than  million per year Proceeds will go to the general fund Measure D calls for the creation of a health panel to advise Berkeleys City Council on appropriate health programs to receive funding Campaign cochair Josh Daniels called Berkeleys win a tipping point I think you will now see many many other cities and communities around the country looking at this as a genuine public policy to address the diabetes and obesity crisis that we face he said While the San Francisco proposition did not pass supporters there declared a victory of their own more than half the voters approved the tax despite millions spent by the American Beverage Association to defeat it So the fact that we were able to overcome  million said Proposition E coauthor Scott Wiener a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and it looks like a majority of San Franciscans  despite that  million  will vote yes is pretty extraordinary Roger Salazar a spokesman for both opposition campaigns funded primarily by the beverage association called Berkeley an anomaly and said that to expect to pass such a tax elsewhere in California was foolhardy Advocates are convinced hes wrong Harold Goldstein executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy called the measures passage remarkable What we learned here in Berkeley he said is that when voters learn the truth about sugary beverages when they learn that they are one of the central causes of the growing diabetes epidemic they want to tax it they want to regulate these products Indeed sugar sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugar in the American diet and that added sugar is linked to increasing rates of diabetes Berkeley has a history of being first to a new cause thats later embraced more broadly said Lori Dorfman executive director for the Berkeley Media Studies Group She noted that Berkeley was the first city to pass a clean indoor air ordinance In the mids Berkeley made the first curb cut and now people in wheelchairs all over the country are not trapped in their homes any more Mexico enacted a soda tax earlier on January  and by summer consumption had dropped  percent  Kelly Brownell dean of Duke Universitys school of public policy first proposed a soda tax in the early s He called the votes in both Berkeley and San Francisco historic and like other advocates predicted other cities will soon follow suit My guess is that inside their boardrooms they know very well these taxes are the beginning of the future he said This is a wave starting to crest Brownell said that half the costs of diabetes and obesity are born by taxpayers through the government health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid Those public costs justify the government getting involved just like tobacco taxes he said
