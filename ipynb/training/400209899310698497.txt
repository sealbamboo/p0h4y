Depression can make us physically older by speeding up the ageing process in our cells according to a study  Lab tests showed cells looked biologically older in people who were severely depressed or who had been in the past  These visible differences in a measure of cell ageing called telomere length couldnt be explained by other factors such as whether a person smoked  The findings in more than  people appear in   Experts already know that people with major depression are at increased risk of agerelated diseases such as cancer diabetes obesity and heart disease  This might be partly down to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as alcohol use and physical inactivity  But scientists suspect depression takes its own toll on our cells  To investigate Josine Verhoeven from the VU University Medical Centre in the Netherlands along with colleagues from the US recruited  people to take part in the study  More than one third of the volunteers were currently depressed a third had experienced major depression in the past and the rest had never been depressed  The volunteers were asked to give a blood sample for the researchers to analyse in the lab for signs of cellular ageing  The researchers were looking for changes in structures deep inside cells called telomeres  Telomeres cap the end of our chromosomes which house our DNA Their job is to stop any unwanted loss of this vital genetic code As cells divide the telomeres get shorter and shorter Measuring their length is a way of assessing cellular ageing People who were or had been depressed had much shorter telomeres than those who had never experienced depression This difference was apparent even after lifestyle differences such as heavy drinking and smoking were taken into account  Furthermore the most severely and chronically depressed patients had the shortest telomeres  Dr Verhoeven and colleagues speculate that shortened telomeres are a consequence of the bodys reaction to the distress depression causes This largescale study provides convincing evidence that depression is associated with several years of biological ageing especially among those with the most severe and chronic symptoms they say  But it is unclear whether this ageing process is harmful and if it can be reversed  UK expert Dr Anna Phillips of the University of Birmingham has researched the effects of stress on telomere length  She says telomere length does not consistently predict other key outcomes such as death risk   Further it is likely that only a major depressive disorder not experience of or even a lifetime of mildtomoderate depressive symptoms relates to telomere length she said
