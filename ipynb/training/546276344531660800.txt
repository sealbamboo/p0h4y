Stepping off the plane in Zimbabwe a quarter century ago was a huge shock A college student on my very first visit to Africa I was surprised how familiar everything felt Like most Americans my image of the continent had been formed by disaster news fliesontheeyes charity commercials and wildlife documentaries Instead I found an energeticifordinary place My welcoming host family of two teachers four children and several adopted cousins aspired for good schools wellpaying jobs and a better life The Zimbabweans I got to know had remarkably similar hopes dreams and challenges as did my family and neighbors back home The skyline of the capital Harare even looked an awful lot like my hometown of Rochester New York The downtown was a modest cluster of weathered highrise office buildings and treelined avenues surrounded by sprawling suburbs of around a million people That one semester abroad left me wanting more I returned after graduation to volunteer and backpack throughout southern and eastern Africa Ive now been to two dozen African countries and have been involved with the region as a professor author and policymaker Over the years what always struck me was the vast chasm between the dynamism and optimism that I witnessed in Africa versus the popular notion of a place stuck in war and famine It was thus heartening to see this image gap begin to close in recent years Buoyed by booming economies and growing confidence Africaasdisaster was being quickly replaced by Africaasopportunity Instead of quizzical looks when I told people what I did for a living I began to get serious questions about the best destinations to visit or where to invest Until Ebola The outbreak has terrified Americans and thrust the continent to the top of the news cycle reviving the old idea of Africa as a primordial catastrophe best kept at bay Yes Ebola is a real threat to Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone Americans should do all they can to help these countries contain the virus and we must take reasonable measures to protect ourselves But Ebola should be put into perspective The virus is affecting a relatively small number of people in a very small number of countries In the United States weve had a total of four cases and one death Influenza by comparison kills   We shouldnt allow irrational fears of a virus distort the real reason that Africans and Americans are closer than ever We share growing interests First of all we have business to do Cities like Dakar Nairobi Lagos and Johannesburg are already major cosmopolitan centers of culture and commerce One of my first projects in the s was investigating the rise of stock markets in Africa I even invested myself and did quite well Today there are  stock exchanges on the continent attracting great interest from American investors The US business community is taking note too When President Obama hosted nearly  African heads of state in Washington DC this summer the top agenda item was private investment Companies like IBM General Electric Walmart and CocaCola announced more than  billion in new investments in Africas emerging markets These brand names are excited because the economies of Nigeria Ethiopia Ghana Kenya Senegal and many other countries are thriving Sadly my beloved Zimbabwe is an exception saddled with a dictator who keeps that country stuck in the past Today millions of African families are making a remarkable transition similar to the changes that Americans experienced in the s and s Theyre buying their first refrigerator their first television their first family car The emergence from poverty to the bottom rungs of the middle class is unleashing   and for the first time creating tremendous new wealth Shared security is another powerful force pulling Americans and Africans together During my time as the State Departments top diplomat for West Africa I saw firsthand how many of the national security threats we now face  terrorism international criminal cartels diseases that cross national borders  require that we work much more closely with our African allies The thwarted  Christmas bomber on Northwest flight  from Amsterdam to Detroit was from Nigeria In  AlQaedalinked extremists took over northern Mali prompting a French military invasion and heightened American involvement in the Sahara Desert Last year AlShabab launched a bloody terrorist assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi These attacks have sharpened US attention on these new mutual security threats Our military now has a fullyfledged Africa Command to manage the increase in counterterrorism operations  a naval base in the Horn of Africa and a growing fleet of unmanned drones in the region Social media is bringing us together too I connect with my host family a quarter century later via Facebook Regular Americans are feeling more connected to the continent through clicktivism Kony rallied millions of people to call for the capture or killing of     captured the worlds horror at the kidnapping of nearly  Nigerian girls last April These incidents may be fleeting but they can have real effect on policy both of these twitter campaigns created public pressure that led President Obama to deploy Special Forces American culture is embracing Africa too My longtime affection for Zimbabwean pop music and   is less of an outlier now that artists like Nigerian author   and Oscarwinning Kenyan actress Lupita Nyongo have gone mainstream In  when I finished writing my novel about an American diplomat in Mali I was told Africa wasnt yet commercial now there are at least halfadozen contemporary thrillers set in the region Deeper economic security and cultural ties make it harder and harder to view the continent through the tragedyonly lens Once Ebola is contained and the news cycle moves on more Americans will come to experience Africa and come to know what I and the growing legions of Africaphiles have learned Africa is a source of progress beauty and life
