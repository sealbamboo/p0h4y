We think of heart disease as a modern scourge brought on by our sedentary lifestyles and our affinity for fast food But a few years ago a team of researchers discovered something puzzling  CT scans of Egyptian mummies   of hardened narrow arteries Further scans of mummies from other ancient civilizations turned up the same thing How could it be that these preindustrial people without doughnuts or desk jobs suffered from   a condition we know to be associated with smoking unhealthful diet and lack of exercise And what does that tell us about heart disease today We may be getting closer to understanding In a study published this week in   researchers conclude that factors like inhaling smoke from open fire pits and inflammation triggered by dirty living conditions may be to blame While inflammation isnt considered one of the main risk factors for heart disease today   have found that its associated with atherosclerosis And ongoing   are testing whether reducing inflammation might help reduce risk of heart disease The researchers behind this report pored over autopsies of mummies from the various communities theyve studied  including ancient Peruvians and Native Americans in the US Southwest as well as in Alaskas Aleutian Islands Many of the mummified people they discovered had endured a host of infections known to exacerbate inflammation  including malaria and tapeworms Since female mummies showed more evidence of atherosclerosis than male mummies the scientists also theorize that exposure to smoke from fire pits played a role In each of the cultures we studied the women were cooking says   a cardiologist who led the study These ancient peoples also used fires to keep warm and ward off insects he says So they were exposed to a lot of smoke In many ways inhaling billowing smoke from a fire pit can be as harmful to the heart as smoking cigarettes or breathing highly polluted air Thomas notes The data presented here are quite provocative says   a professor of cardiology and epidemiology at the University of California Irvine It gives us more of an appreciation for factors we dont think about as much these days The findings suggest that atherosclerosis may be baked into our genes more than we thought Thomas says Its incredible he says that people from both ancient and modern times with a range of different diets and lifestyles all suffered from the same condition Of course in general the atherosclerosis found in the mummies wasnt too severe It was really preclinical Thomas notes Modern humans who want to stave off heart disease should continue to exercise and watch what they eat he says but When I see a patient now who has a heart incident I assure them that this is a problem thats been with us since before writing  so they shouldnt blame themselves too much
