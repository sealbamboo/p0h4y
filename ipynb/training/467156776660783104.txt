Perhaps the biggest new idea in exercise research in recent years has been the   the idea that as humans evolved adaptations in our bones and muscles along with an impressive ability to regulate our body temperature made us good endurance runners As a result our ancestors were able to literally run down and kill game animals providing the highdensity calories and protein we needed to feed our everenlarging brains This narrative has generated all sorts of scientific research in the past  to  years in areas ranging from evolutionary biology to biomechanics It has also spawned popular books and contributed to    But its not a completely new idea 
 In  Michael Baughman a writer living in Ashland Ore   about his attempt to run down a deer in the ranch land and orchards near his home I recently tracked down Mr Baughman to learn more about what motivated him to write that article and his thoughts on the endurance running craze Heres an edited version of our exchanges  The idea came long ago from my greatgrandfather John Brant in western Pennsylvania He was a descendant of   who for good reason fought against the Americans in the Revolutionary War  John Brant hunted deer much this way as a youth early in the th century and told me Mohawks did it long ago This along with my somewhat lengthened account of running the deer down is included in my book   published in   When I moved to Oregon in  I met a World War II veteran named Frank Moore who is a   Frank was tremendously fit he had been a superb wrestler and he told me he had done it several times He is  now     I was about  at the time and in good shape though I wasnt an exceptional runner My best marathon times were in the s and my best mile times were around   I actually tried running a deer three or four times before I was successful Of course one has to be fit but the key to staying with a deer is the country you do it in It has to be open enough so that the animal cant successfully hide and rest  The country I did it in was quite open with occasional willow thickets and fairly gentle hills It was almost always possible to see for hundreds of yards Deer are like sprinters and a conditioned distance runner should be able to exhaust one if the country is open enough It took about four hours and I estimate I ran about  miles It was also about  degrees on that day which probably helped because deer do not do well in the heat I think I became aware of the public interest in persistence hunting pretty early on I havent followed the literature on the subject closely enough to find fault I remember being glad about the interest and the conclusions drawn because many people thought such things were impossible The shoes were probably Nikes of the day Im still in decent shape for age  I work out every day with weights run andor hike four times a week and also do at least two hard workouts per week on an elliptical machine  The only run I enter these days is the Mount Ashland Hill Climb   miles from town to the Mount Ashland summit an elevation gain of a little more than a mile I also write every day My last book   was published in June  about my youthful friendship with a Hawaiian beach boy and also about bumming around the US with a friend in the bad old days of segregation My next book comes out this June Its about money and will offend many who read it  at least I hope so I do get calls and emails about running the deer which is nice because it keeps a fairly distant memory alive So what happened to that deer back in  Mr Baughman provides a poignant account in his Sports Illustrated article
