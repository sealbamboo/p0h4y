The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa will take at least six months to bring under control medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF says Speaking in Geneva MSF President Joanne Liu said the situation was deteriorating faster and moving faster than we can respond to Earlier the World Health Organization WHO said the scale of the outbreak appeared to be vastly underestimated It said that extraordinary measures were needed The epidemic began in Guinea in February and has since spread to Liberia Sierra Leone and Nigeria  On Friday the death toll rose to  after WHO said  new deaths had been reported in the two days to  August There have been  cases reported Ms Liu said that although Guinea was the initial epicentre the pace there had slowed and other countries  particularly Liberia  were now the focus If we dont stabilise Liberia we will never stabilise the region she said In terms of timeline were not talking in terms of weeks were talking in terms of months We need a commitment for months at least I would say six months and Im being I would say very optimistic Ms Liu also called for more action from the international community and stronger leadership from WHO  the UNs health agency  All governments must act It must be done now if we want to contain this epidemic she said Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of a person who is infected  Initial flulike symptoms can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas such as eyes and gums and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure The WHO  which declared a global health emergency last week  recently said the risk of transmission of Ebola during air travel remained low as the disease is not airborne As a consequence Kenya Airways has rejected pressure to suspend its flights to the Ebolahit states of West Africa Mutuma Mathiu in  describes the move as reckless while   says the airline is holding on to its lucrative West African routes as if they were the only business on its portfolio The government needs to get serious An Ebola outbreak would result in serious long termdamage to the national brand it continues   notes that while it makes business sense for Kenya Airways to take advantage of West African destinations the economic escapade could be costly The safety of Kenyans supersedes any profits and must come first However George Bodo in Kenyas   recalls the carriers ailing share prices In calling on Kenya Airways to suspend nearly half of its highmargin flights someone should ideally be ready with some form of compensation Otherwise its stock price will continue being more vulnerable in the coming weeks The WHO   that its staff had seen evidence that the number of reported cases and deaths did not reflect the scale of the crisis Spokesman Gregory Hartl said experts going housetohouse in Kenema Sierra Leone in search of infected people were discovering more cases There are probably a lot of patients out there that we havent traced or contacted yet he said He said that an bed treatment centre that recently opened in Liberias capital Monrovia filled up immediately and that the next day dozens more people turned up to be treated  Liberias Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah told the BBC that a new treatment centre opening just outside Monrovia on Saturday would have about  beds and could be expanded to  Tarnue Karbbar of the aid group Plan International in northern Liberia said medical teams were not able to document all the cases erupting  He said many of the sick were being hidden at home by relatives and many victims were buried before teams could get to the area Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told the BBC on Friday that  people had so far died of Ebola in the country including health workers She rebuffed criticism that Liberia had been too slow in declaring an emergency The government has been doing its best trying to make sure that we get the right supplies getting technical help the expertise that is required to be able to train up people to deal with this and to avoid putting people at risk including health workers she said The outbreak is also affecting the  about to start in China The International Olympic Committee IOC has ruled that athletes from Ebolahit countries will not be allowed to compete in combat sports or in the pool and Sierra Leone and Nigeria have withdrawn from the Games
