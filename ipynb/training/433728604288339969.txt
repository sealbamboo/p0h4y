A yearold woman in Taiwan had a bad earache but even worse was the source of the pain a live fruitfly larva nestled beneath her hearing aid Doctors writing in Wednesdays New England Journal of Medicine said they found the creature crawling deep within her left ear canal The skin over the floor of the auditory canal close to the eardrum was eroded wrote Dr ChengPing Shih of the TriService General Hospital in Taipei  It could have been there for a day or longer ChengPing told NBC News in an email Because the woman used her hearing aid frequently the skin inside her ear was less sensitive than usual The larvae was still alive in the ear while the patient visited our emergent department ChengPing said The bug likely came from the patients home where fruit flies often gather around produce kept in the open rather than refrigerated ChengPing said The patients ear was relatively warmer than the environment perhaps providing a cozy nest Doctors removed the larva easily and treated the woman with an antibiotic ointment  but not before recording a video of the unwanted guest The womans ear was completely healed within two weeks but doctors were surprised enough by the case to submit it to the journal Most cases of animals in the ear canal are the flying objects and cockroaches ChengPing wrote The fruit fly larva in ear canal is relatively unusual To view the disturbing video of the fruit fly larva see the NEJM study
