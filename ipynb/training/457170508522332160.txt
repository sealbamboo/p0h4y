My first course of action was to buy a scale I hadnt been on an accurate one in years The scale in my doctors office would only go up to  pounds Just to be safe I looked for a scale that had a maximum of  pounds I set the scale on my bathroom floor and exhaled as much air as I could as I stood on it  The next few seconds were followed by a rush of emotions  shock disbelief frustration and anger I weighed  pounds  How did I get to this point  As I looked back on the previous few years I realized that I was not a happy person Within a years time I had turned  become a single father and lost my biggest supporter my mom I was disappointed in the direction my personal and professional life was taking And I was using food to cope   I used to read a poem to my student athletes that said You cant fool the guy in the mirror But yet that is what I had been trying to do  I thought I was destined to be a large individual for the rest of my life and I questioned my ability to lose a significant amount weight at my age The self doubt was prevalent in my mind The more I felt sorry for myself the more I ate It was a vicious cycle I realized that this decision to change my life was about more than just losing weight I had to lose my inner critic I had to lose the ropes that were tying me to the past More importantly I had to lose this black cloud hanging over my head  I had only myself to blame and I knew I was the only one who could fix it  Exercise quickly replaced food as my comfort in life Where I once turned to fast food in times of stress and frustration I instead found myself going to the gym The more I exercised the more weight started to drop off  It was a slow climb out of the personal hole I was in but I found that eating right and exercising were the best remedies to change my outlook on life  When I got to the pound milestone I decided to look at my wardrobe I had a closet full of bad memories and BIG clothes  For instance I had a shirt that I wore to my th high school reunion I hated it when I saw pictures of how heavy I looked in it So why did I keep it I didnt have to think twice now about giving it away It took at least two hours to finish cleaning out the closet When I was done I had five heaping garbage bags full of clothes It was a gratifying experience to lose that much clutter from my life  The best part came when someone asked if they could take those clothes off my hands I shared my story with that person when he picked them up Maybe hell be giving them away again in the near future  I firmly believe that if I can make these lifestyle changes that anyone can We all have something to lose
