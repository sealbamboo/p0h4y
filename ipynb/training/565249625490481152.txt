It may ring alarm bells regarding patient confidentiality but founder Josh Landy an intensive care specialist at Scarborough Hospital in Toronto Canada vows that anonymity ethics and patient approval are at the core of the technology He says his objective is the sharing of knowledge  People already share cases through text and email he says  As a medic himself Landy understands the need to seek external opinions when treating a variety of patients One day when looking around his hospital unit Landy realized how commonplace this virtual sharing was among his students as their hands were occupied not with stethoscopes but smartphones They were in search of a second opinion  and now they can get third fourth and fifth opinions in a single click with his photosharing app We looked at how people are using their smart phones he explains having seen many cases being shared between doctors using this medium I wanted a way to present all those cases  to create a global knowledge notebook Launched in May  Figure enables users to take an image remove any identifying information and upload the image for feedback from the community of healthcare users accessing the app Those not uploading use the app as a learning tool to expose them to conditions and symptoms they may not otherwise see Its medical education says Landy In developing the app Landy ensured anonymity would become standard through the removal of any identifying features names numbers or case information when images are uploaded All images undergo additional verification before becoming publicly available and patients must also give their permission for their photos to be shared  Whilst the general public may have interest in medical images Landy stresses the importance of targeting mainly those working in healthcare New users are asked for occupational information upon registering and only healthcare professionals can comment or add pictures The app is now available in  countries and as of summer  there were  users according to Figure The number is expected to be higher today with images in the library being viewed on average  million times a day The greatest popularity lies in the continent of origin with Figure now being used by  of US medical students including Shipes Its classic medicine digitized says Shipes Having used Figure religiously over the past year Shipes readily sings its praises after the app helped her diagnose a patient with an unusual skin disorder causing blisters on certain parts of her body I uploaded it to Figure and someone told us exactly what it was she says The condition turned out to be common to Latin America and Asia but rare in the United States We would never have known that one Now Landy hopes word will spread even further Its overdue for a tool like this he concludes Id like to see it everywhere
