With the current bloom of artisanal smallbatch producers across the country youd think that all you need to start up a new food business is a good idea and a lot of gumption And for the most part thats true But when it comes to artisanal producers working with   you also need something else a Hazards Analysis and Critical Control Points plan Or if you will a HACCP A HACCP pronounced by those in the industry as HASSup aims to accomplish the admirable goal of keeping our food supply safe by planning out critical control points monitoring hazard analysis and all that fun stuff making sure that you dont get a dose of Listeria along with your     For drycured meats which never get a turn in the bacteriakilling heat of the oven and rely instead on critical control of pH and moisture levels this is especially important It may seem surprising that there isnt one universally required procedure But thats both the bane and beauty of the HACCP The USDA Food Safety Inspection Service wants you to demonstrate that the food you make is safe explains Arion Thiboumery founder of the   They put out performance standards but they dont tell you   People have tried a lot of different ways This focus on results rather than process means that as long as you meet the safety requirements at the critical control points you have some leeway in how you get there The brilliance behind a HACCP plan is that its so flexible extols Elias Cairo the cofounder of Portlands   the first USDAcertified charcuterie in Oregon The lack of guidelines lets you produce anything you want in exactly the way that you want as long as you can prove that its safe Cairo is clearly a big fan of the HACCP and the USDA in general whose adaptability has allowed him to produce cured meats that are winning fans across the country But this flexibility comes at a cost Because of the sausage worlds variation in process and recipe each HACCP is uniquely tailored to each smallbatch producers process Sausagemakers have to spend months and months familiarizing themselves with the scientific literature taking classes and exams and providing the USDA documentation for the path theyre taking  or pay significant money to consultants to come up with a plan for them which can cost tens of thousands of dollars And once theyve paid in money or sweat for these plans they dont necessarily want to share their trade secrets But one sausage maker    of Madison Wis  is looking to establish a new model by developing via   an open source HACCP plan template for all to use I think this is a large barrier to people entering the market and if we remove it well see really good products coming out hopes Underground Meats Jonny Hunter If the projects funding goal is reached he aims to work with a third party company possibly the University of Wisconsin to lay out the process and then publish the results under a   The craft is something that takes time but the knowledge of the safety side is something that should just be open and free Hunters mission seems to have struck a nerve in the artisanal meat community  as of this writing the campaign is nearly threefourths of the way to its  goal Thiboumery of the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network notes that with the age of the average butcher like the age of the average farmer continuing to go up every year removing barriers to entry for new young producers could revitalize the industry I think it would be consistent with the mission of a land grant institution  lets use public money to solve a problem that we all agree should be solved But some like Olympic Provisions Elias Cairo are a bit skeptical as to how itll play out The HACCP must be so specific that itd be hard to universalize a sort of bible  beyond providing alreadyavailable general information on critical control points But Hunter thinks that while it wont be a onesizefitsall fix the control points steps and scientific justifications will be a valuable jumpingoff point People would have to tailor it individually  nobody would be able to just download it from the Internet it needs to be specific But if I would have had this five years ago it would have saved me   much time
