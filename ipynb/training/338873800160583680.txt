Three days after her double mastectomy for recurrent breast cancer Elissa Bantug then  needed to feel whole again But when she expressed a desire for intimacy her fianc now her husband walked away leaving her feeling hurt and angry and worried about their future together Weeks later she learned that his rejection was based not on any lost love or attraction but on the fear that he might hurt her physically I was just guessing Ms Bantug said in an interview It would have been really helpful to hear his thoughts fears and concerns But she admits she did no better at expressing her own All through the postoperative ordeal and chemotherapy she said I did a bad job of communicating my needs I would tell him Im fine when I really felt awful and then I would resent the fact that he didnt take care of me It was really hard but we got through it because we love each other she said He finally told me I want you alive I dont care what your breasts look like  Recognizing the importance of honesty and communication when cancer strikes Ms Bantug now  went on to run a   at the   helping other couples through the cancer experience She spoke frankly of her own ordeal with   a professor of psychology at Penn State University Dr Shapiro is the author of a new book And in Health A Guide for Couples Facing Cancer Together His advice can help prevent the diagnosis from damaging ones most important relationship Few know the challenges better Both Dr Shapiro and his wife Terry have survived serious bouts of cancer Cancer he wrote is like a tremor that rattles our walls and finds the fault lines that already existed If were not careful it reaches into our relationships and drags out these subtle differences and magnifies them Dr Shapiro met his wife in his s while undergoing a bone marrow transplant for Hodgkins lymphoma a cancer of the lymph system After they married his cancer recurred and he needed a second bone marrow transplant which saved his life By means of stored sperm the couple had two daughters Then cancer struck again Dr Shapiro admits that when his wife was found to have breast cancer he became nonfunctional terrified that she might die and fearing Id have to raise the two girls by myself But instead of telling his wife I love you a lot  its hard to watch this he tried to protect her from his fears He has since learned that withholding his feelings was a big mistake By not being honest with each other he told me you can create a wedge in the relationship at a time when you both need understanding and support Dr Shapiro wrote that cancer can cause people to lose their bearings and to push away those they love and most need to help them through the challenges of treatment The lessons derived from his own experience and those of  other cancer couples are elaborated in his book a kind of Cancer  for couples Among them  Even without the challenge of a potentially fatal diagnosis like cancer people often have difficulty remembering everything doctors tell them and correctly interpreting the information When couples see doctors as a team with one assigned to take notes and both able to ask questions misunderstandings about diagnoses and treatment options are less likely If doctors fail to adequately address the patients concerns the couple should decide which partner will speak up And when both members of a couple are educated about side effects they are less likely to panic when a symptom develops  Whenever and however you can express and show your love and concern in words actions and touch When faced with cancer Dr Shapiros wife needed him to say repeatedly that he loved her And she wanted me to take the trash down to the street on time without being reminded he added 
Love and support can also be communicated through touch A soft nonsexual touch on the arm or shoulder can be a soothing balm when we feel vulnerable Dr Shapiro wrote Couples must rely more than ever on patience and tolerance Cancer requires a whole new set of skills at a time when most of us are depleted distracted and scared he wrote Each person should go easy on the partner when rookie mistakes occur like forgetting appointments losing things or locking the keys in the car When people are anxious they may blame each other for their ill feelings The psychologist warns against acting on negative feelings that inevitably arise for example when couples are waiting for the results of treatment Rather than take out their anxiety on spouses themselves or anyone else he suggests Do exercise go for walks see a movie talk to friends and distract yourself  Like Ms Bantug patients often expect their partners to know how they are feeling and what they may want then resent it when unexpressed needs are not met A patients ability and energy to perform tasks may change from one day to the next Patients may feel unsupported if their partners expect them to function normally when they feel awful or they may resent having jobs taken from them when they feel well Its better to ask than to assume Both should talk about what needs to be done today and whos going to do it Dr Shapiro advised He encourages spouses to repeatedly check in with each other about various tasks  When Penny Carruths husbands body shut down while he was being treated for lymphoma she didnt know if he would want to be artificially ventilated It seemed like torture  he moaned groaned and tried to pull off the mask His hands had to be tied down she told me In Dr Shapiros book she urges couples to have a conversation about endoflife care making clear their wishes in case a spouse later faces decisions about life support Advance directives are a lasting gift for those you love Dr Shapiro said One woman he interviewed lost her chance to spend the last months with her husband in the way she wanted because the doctors pursued treatment even as he was dying
