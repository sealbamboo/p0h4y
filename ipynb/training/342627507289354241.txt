The chief of the National Institutes of Health is disavowing a   from the government office that oversees the ethics of human research At issue is a controversial   of more than  severely premature infants This spring the federal   criticized the scientists who ran the study for failing to tell parents about the risks their newborn children might face We respectfully disagree NIH director   and two colleagues   in an unusual public disagreement within the government over research ethics At the same time the Office for Human Research Protections or OHRP told the University of Alabama at Birmingham one of the study sites that it was suspending disciplinary action on the matter until ethics guidelines on such studies are clarified The watchdog office also says it wont proceed against sponsors of similar studies for now But it held open the possibility that the Alabama medical center and  other trial sites could still face sanctions The OHRP is an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services the NIHs parent agency In a commentary published by the   Collins and company write that this controversy has alarmed some of the parents of infants who were in the study confused the biomedical research community and befuddled IRBs the   that oversee human research at every clinical center Collins coauthors are   NIHs deputy director for science outreach and policy and   director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development The three say they have a fundamental difference in interpretations over what doctors knew about how to treat preemies at the time the multicenter study was launched back in  The governments research watchdogs say the studys authors should have warned patients that children receiving lower doses of oxygen might be at higher risk of nerve damage and death But Collins and other defenders of the study called   say data available back in  gave no reason to foresee that infants in one study group would have a higher risk of death that would those in the other group The commentary is accompanied by a   roundly supporting the disputed study that is signed by  ethicists and pediatricians The ruling of the OHRP is unfair to the investigators and institutions involved in SUPPORT the letter says Allowing it to stand wouldset a precedent that would impede ongoing and futureoutcomes studies While the letters signatories say the OHRP overreaches in concluding that the study violated federal ethics guidelines they acknowledge that the permission forms could have been improved and the consent process for clinical research can no doubt be improved They did not specify how the SUPPORT studys consent process fell short Collins and his colleagues also say the controversy serves as an occasion for a substantive national dialogue about how best to respect and protect participants in research studies conducted within the standard of care and how to define reasonably foreseeable risks in this setting The phrase standard of care is at the heart of the matter Basically the NIH leaders say the SUPPORT controversy raises issues that apply to any research that aims to test and improve accepted medical practice Thus the case could turn out to have farreaching effects on future clinical research To underscore that HHS announced Wednesday that it   to discuss how federal regulations designed to protect human research subjects should be applied to studies that probe standard of care treatment The upcoming meeting whose date has not been set will address how Institutional Review Boards should assess the risks of studies looking at current clinical practice and what reasonably foreseeable risks should be disclosed to study volunteers OHRPs sixpage   sent Tuesday to Alabama researchers suggests how complicated and subtle an issue this is The letter acknowledges that some doctors treating a premature infant might avoid giving oxygen at levels at either end of the range used in the SUPPORT study But by enrolling their infants in the study parents were waiving their childrens right to such individualized treatment Ultimately the issues in this case come down to a fundamental difference between the obligations of clinicians and researchers the OHRPs Lisa Buchanan writes Doctors are required even in the face of uncertainty to do what they view as being best for their individual patients Researchers do not have the same obligation As a crucial tradeoff in doing clinical research Buchanan writes society requires that researchers tell subjects how participating in the study might alter the risks to which they are exposed Another effect of the controversy HHS plans to set up a process for researchers and institutions to appeal the rulings of the Office of Human Research Protections in those situations in which reasonable people disagree about the actions taken Currently there is no appeal from the Offices rulings   of Public Citizen an advocacy group that first complained about the SUPPORT study says the OHRP letter is an important step toward addressing a highly unethical trial But Carome said HHSs decision to allow current similar trials to continue  is an abject and unacceptable failure to protect human subjects in clinical trials
