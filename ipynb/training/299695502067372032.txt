Longacting methods of    such as intrauterine devices IUDs and implants  can dramatically reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and   if they are provided at no cost to patients says a new study which appears online in  Researchers report that open access to longterm contraceptive options could cut the numbers of unintended pregnancies at rates between  and  percent A lot of women dont know about these methods IUDs and implants says Gina Secura the project director of the Contraceptive Choice Project at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis which conducted the study on  women between the ages  to   For the pill patch and ring we saw much more   In the fiveyear long study participants received counseling on available birth control options which included shortacting hormonal methods like the pill patch and ring in addition to longacting devices Around  percent of the women in the study chose IUDs or implants Secura says the majority of women under  selected implants while those in the older age cohort favored IUDs Teens enrolled in this free birth control program had an annual birth rate of  per  participants compared with the national rate of  per  for girls in the same age demographic The authors say the abortion rates among study participants were also significantly lower than typical rates in St Louis where the study was conducted IUDs and implants are clinically reported to have the lowest failure rates among reversible contraceptives currently on the market According to a  study published in the journal   both devices are more than  percent effective compared with   percent for birth control pills and  percent for condoms Each year in the United States around  percent of pregnancies are unplanned half a result of skipping or misusing contraceptives In the duration of the study the authors report annual   among study participants ranged from  to  per  women per year They say the national rate is currently  abortions per  women in  which are the most recent figures available But while IUDs and implants are said to be nearly foolproof   they are also the most expensive among reversible options In the United States IUDs and implants can cost as much as  which includes the price for insertion Though these devices are a good investment over the duration of time for which they are effective  an average of three to five years  they also typically must be paid for in full at the time of insertion a financial burden for many patients The longer you use it the more costeffective it is says Secura Its women who are using other hormonal methods who are stopping sooner But Secura also says healthcare providers are not typically educating and encouraging their patients to consider IUDs and implants as a viable option Theres some retraining that needs to happen she saysWell see a shift as women demand them and providers become more familiar with evidencebased practices
