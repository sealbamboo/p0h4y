Pretty much every medical organization has told men to back off on screening for prostate cancer because it can lead to unneeded treatment including surgery that can leave a man incontinent and impotent But its hard to resist a robot Men who have been diagnosed with lowgrade prostate cancer increasingly choose expensive newer treatments including robotic surgery and a radiation treatment called intensitymodulated radiotherapy or IMRT even though they are not likely to benefit from those treatments according to a   in   the journal of the American Medical Association Use of the newer treatments rose from  percent to  percent between  and  among men with low PSA test scores or other indications that their prostate cancer was slowgrowing and didnt pose a threat Use also increased among men who were older or in poor health and were likely to die of something other than the cancer Their use of robotic surgery and radiation therapy almost doubled from  percent to  percent Men older than  with lowgrade prostate cancer have a  percent chance of dying of the cancer in the next  years compared to a  percent chance of dying from something else the researchers said Robotic surgery and   are marketed heavily as offering fewer side effects and easier recovery but as with most new treatments theres  that they are better than established treatments Earlier this year the nations gynecologists said women shouldnt have   because theres no evidence the robots do as good a job as other forms of surgery The new treatments for prostate cancer are much more expensive than traditional forms of surgery and radiation and are drawing increasing scrutiny from payers like Medicare The data for this study came from Medicare records of treatment for more than  men who had not been diagnosed with other forms of cancer So cost is a concern But more troubling is the idea of men choosing treatments they dont need robot or no robot that can have harmful side effects For men with low risk observation would be preferred to intervention whether with robotic surgery traditional prostate surgery or IMRT says   a researcher for the Veterans Administration who studies treatments for prostate cancer but wasnt involved in this study Despite that he notes patients are receiving and doctors are recommending treatments that are no more effective no safer and much more costly One way to avoid the lure of new treatments is to screen for prostate cancer less frequently Wilt tells Shots The more we look the more we find The more we find the more we treat Because we look so hard we find things that might never cause problems Last year the US Preventive Services Task Force said that no men should have   with the PSA test because lowgrade prostate cancer is so common and the risk of being given unnecessary harmful treatments is so high And last month the nations urologists   the   isnt needed for most men suggesting testing only in men at high risk and those ages  to  Even those men should get tested no more than every two years the urologists said rather than annually But men who have been tested and found to have lowgrade prostate cancer may find it hard to resist the lure of treatment especially if its being touted by a physician Even though most doctors say watchful waiting is a good strategy for lowgrade prostate cancer twothirds of urologists and radiation oncologists recommend treatments rather than observation according to a  study A primary care provider can help sort out the pluses and minuses of prostate cancer treatment versus observation Wilt says Theyre not selling a procedure he says He adds Its really important that medical care is driven by good science and that we should be cautious about assuming that something must be better just because its newer Tell that to the robot
