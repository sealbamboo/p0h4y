Maybe we should rewrite that quote usually attributed to Benjamin Franklin Nothing is certain except death taxes  and arthritis the leading cause of disability in the United States  Dr C Thomas Vangsness Jr an orthopedist and chief of sports medicine at the University of Southern Californias Keck School of Medicine has just published with coauthor Greg Ptacek The New Science of Overcoming Arthritis   I asked him about the most common form osteoarthritis in which cartilage wears away causing joint pain swelling and stiffness  Ive edited and condensed our conversation  It sounds like were all headed for osteoarthritis eventually  Pretty much  If youre  or over you have a  percent chance  By  almost everyone has some symptoms 
 
  Do you find that people dismiss it because its seen as a normal part of aging  Yes Besides it doesnt kill people  Its more of an achey breaky nuisance and it doesnt hit the radar  If a couple of senators wives died from this disease theyd make more effort to fund research   Why do you say the prevalence of arthritis will get worse before it gets better  The pervasiveness of obesity is one issue  if youre heavy it affects your joints Plus were living longer so we take more steps and use our joints more and they wear out over time  And theres some genetic component  Absolutely Some people are predisposed to arthritis  Well know more about that in time  Your recommendations emphasize diet and exercise which sometimes seem like the prescription for everything  You lose weight by picking the right grandparents or by eating right  Exercise by itself wont cause weight loss But exercise is still important   Every time you do a heel strike that puts shattering force up through the bones increasing the wear and tear  If the muscles stay strong they decrease the force across the joint  They take up some of that pounding sort of like shock absorbers  Also joints like to be lubricated  Movement helps slosh the synovial fluid in your joints around and that nourishes the cartilage    What kind of exercise do you recommend for people with arthritis  Nothing pounding  I use an exercise bike youre still putting weight on your joints you get the aerobics but its not like a treadmill  Less stress on your knees Jogging isnt as good an idea Swimming is the best  moving your joints in a weightless environment    Every supermarket sells dietary supplements that claim to decrease arthritis pain  Do any of them work  Theres conflicting scientific evidence  Good unbiased randomized controlled studies dont exist Even for glucosamine and chondroitin the studies are financed by the manufacturers and theyre flawed But they suggest that glucosamine and chondroitin can be helpful and theyre not harmful or expensive   The scientific rigor I look for as a medical school professor says that the evidence is not there but my patients tell me they feel better  So I say great continue taking them  but lets not kid ourselves  We dont have FDA regulation for these supplements  Green tea  Flaxseed Herbs  Wheres the beef  Show me the studies    How good are the drug options  I tell patients they fan the smoke away from the fire but the fire is still there  At this point theres nothing we have that can resurface cartilage  Acetaminophen  Tylenol  just works on the pain The NSAIDS  nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  work on the inflammation Celebrex is a little different pathway and its safer for your stomach but a lot more expensive We have new drugs coming down the road probably in the next decade   Youre a surgeon so not surprisingly you see surgery as a good option  On younger patients we can transplant cells or do whole cartilage grafts  harvest cartilage cells grow and expand them and replant them We can also do partial knee replacements and thats been a big improvement In an older patient the inclination is to do the definitive single operation the hip or knee replacement  The risks of surgery are higher with age  blood clots infections  So one operation and then theyre done   Your book sounds very optimistic about stem cells  You did your own doubleblind trial using a stemcell treatment  To me its one of the more promising approaches  We injected stem cells into peoples knees to try to regrow torn and removed meniscus tissue  We had it grow back nicely at the oneyear followup at two years that didnt hold up statistically   But we found that the procedure was safe and that people with arthritis had a big response  And that improvement lasted  Now Im starting a study of injecting stem cells into the knee for arthritis relief I hope to start in the next five or six months    Do you see any role for alternative therapies like acupuncture chiropractic or meditation  Chiropractic unproven and unrelated to nonspine osteoarthritis But to have a health care provider touching patients might make them feel better  We dont know how acupuncture works I wouldnt rule it out but I wouldnt use it for an extended period Do I think meditation will decrease inflammation No but it may decrease your perception of pain  I live in California  I advise people to see what works
