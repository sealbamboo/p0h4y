The globe is facing a tidal wave of cancer and restrictions on alcohol and sugar need to be considered say World Health Organization scientists It predicts the number of cancer cases will reach  million a year by  but half could be prevented The WHO said there was now a real need to focus on cancer prevention by tackling smoking obesity and drinking The World Cancer Research Fund said there was an alarming level of naivety about diets role in cancer Fourteen million people a year are diagnosed with cancer but that is predicted to increase to  million by   million by  and  million by  The developing world will bear the brunt of the extra cases  Chris Wild the director of the WHOs International Agency for Research on Cancer told the BBC The global cancer burden is increasing and quite markedly due predominately to the ageing of the populations and population growth If we look at the cost of treatment of cancers it is spiralling out of control even for the highincome countries Prevention is absolutely critical and its been somewhat neglected  said the major sources of preventable cancer included For most countries breast cancer is the most common cancer in women However cervical cancer dominates in large parts of Africa The human papillomavirus HPV is a major cause It is thought wider use of the HPV and other vaccines could prevent hundreds of thousands of cancers One of the reports editors Dr Bernard Stewart from the University of New South Wales in Australia said prevention had a crucial role in combating the tidal wave of cancer which we see coming across the world Dr Stewart said human behaviour was behind many cancers such as the sunbathe until youre cooked evenly on both sides approach in his native Australia He said it was not the role of the International Agency for Research on Cancer to dictate what should be done But he added In relation to alcohol for example were all aware of the acute effects whether its car accidents or assaults but theres a burden of disease thats not talked about because its simply not recognised specifically involving cancer The extent to which we modify the availability of alcohol the labelling of alcohol the promotion of alcohol and the price of alcohol  those things should be on the agenda He said there was a similar argument to be had with sugar fuelling obesity which in turn affected cancer risk Meanwhile a survey of  people in the UK by the World Cancer Research Fund WCRF suggested  do not know that diet increases the risk of developing cancer  A third of people said cancer was mainly due to family history but the charity said no more than  of cancers were down to inherited genes Amanda McLean general manager for the WCRF said Its very alarming to see that such a large number of people dont know that theres a lot they can do to significantly reduce their risk of getting cancer  In the UK about a third of the most common cancers could be prevented through being a healthy weight eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active  These results show that many people still seem to mistakenly accept their chances of getting cancer as a throw of the dice but by making lifestyle changes today we can help prevent cancer tomorrow It advises a diet packed with vegetables fruit and wholegrains cutting down on alcohol and red meat and junking processed meat completely Dr Jean King Cancer Research UKs director of tobacco control said The most shocking thing about this reports prediction that  million cancer cases a year will rise to  million globally in the next  years is that up to half of all cases could be prevented People can cut their risk of cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices but its important to remember that the government and society are also responsible for creating an environment that supports healthy lifestyles  Its clear that if we dont act now to curb the number of people getting cancer we will be at the heart of a global crisis in cancer care within the next two decades
