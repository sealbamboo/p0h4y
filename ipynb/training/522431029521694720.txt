The LA Fitness Expo to be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center next weekend is always a good showcase for innovative farout and just plain weird new fitness products Heres a preview of four standouts that tackle fullbody and upperbody workouts  A fullbody stretchcord resistance suit makes every movement harder and makes you look like a medieval Terminator Its composed of eight lengths of rubber tubing attached to a chest harness and ankle knee and elbow straps  It works  and its exhausting The Mass Suit adds resistance to squats pushups overhead presses rows throwing punches and almost anything else you can think of It turns the common jumping jack into a rep torture test After you take a couple of minutes to figure out how to put it together its easy to take off and on and change the cord positions for different exercises A carry bag and manual are included  None really except that it does not come with a DVD although you can get good workout ideas from the website and manual   The oddly beautiful pound inchlong chrome hand weight has two rotating handles  Surprisingly different and effective Although the Speedbag and its handful of movement patterns endoverend lateral wristrolling and onehand gun slinging seem a bit ridiculous at first glance it delivers a serious burn in your arms and shoulders in as little as  seconds Its hard to do them for more than a couple of minutes The movements provide a legitimate though limited upperbody endurance workout  Even being creative you might struggle as I did to invent more than a few exercises boredom might set in quickly   pound plastic model  pound chrome model     Stretchcord device that effectively lightens your body weight and helps you do a pullup Its simple and works great ideal for newcomers to CrossFit and other highintensity programs that use a lot of pullups Its easy to set up Just hang it on a pullup bar grab the bar and step into the stirrup to begin your pullup A adjustment strap lets you give yourself more or less support  The cords do not provide uniform assistance through the entire range of the pullup as do the hulking pullup assist machines in the gym The cord assists you most at the bottom of the movement and very little near the top     Walking poles have a builtin telescoping spring action that provides upperbody resistance when pushed  Pushing down on the poles as you walk the streets for fitness is a fun and effective arm pump to a point The company claims the pole provides  pounds of resistance which may be satisfying for some new or older exercisers The poles are length adjustable form  to  inches  The Halsas are not nearly as effective as solid poles which provide a much better upperbody workout during fitness walking because they allow you to propel your entire body And Halsas do not lighten the load and relieve stress on your legs as solid poles do
