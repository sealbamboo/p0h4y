 On Valentines Day single men are far more likely than   to splurge on a loved one a marketing expert from Harvard Business School says Compared to men who have already tied the knot unmarried fellows run up a  percent higher tab on gifts professing their admiration and devotion his new small study finds They are trying to signal their wealth to prospective partners Michael Norton an associate professor of marketing at Harvard who has researched who spends what on Valentines Day  and why Whether they are conscious of their intentions is unclear Studying  men and women married and single on the heels of Valentines Day  Norton found single men spent  on average Married men shelled out  on average and single women  Married women parted with the least just  Whats up with unmarried guys They need to let the woman of their dreams know theyre solvent tapping into womens longstanding attraction for wealthier men regardless of their own wealth or lack of it according to Norton I give therefore I have is the theme of his as yetunpublished report But thats only part of the story driving preFeb  purchases according to Norton Besides asking about their Valentines Day outlay Norton asked participants to report what he calls their subjective wealth  how well off they felt after spending on VDay They also revealed their monthly income and rated their satisfaction with the relationship Greater spending was linked with feeling wealthier he found even after taking into account the givers income and relationship satisfaction That finding echoes the results of some of his other studies Norton said which found that donating money to charitable causes is likely to make people feel better off and in turn happier The thinking he said goes something like this If I can give money away I must be doing OK Thats true even for those who are far from wealthy Courtship gifts serve a similar wealthsignaling purpose as charitable giving he said A single guy displays his wealth by his generosity and in the process signals wealth to his sweetheart and to himself he said Could the unmarried mans spending be fueled at least a little by anticipating his partners joy Norton cant say because his study was designed to evaluate such intentions The study findings come as no surprise to Vladas Griskevicius associate professor of marketing and psychology at the University of Minnesotas Carlson School of Management If he is finding this kind of thing happens closer to Valentines Day that would make a lot of sense Griskevicius said I find that men especially single men tend to signal wealth when they have   on their mind he said In one of his studies he asked male college students to look at photos of beautiful women or beautiful architecture Later men indicated how much money they would spend on various products such as a car watch and vacation The men who had looked at photos of women spent more money he said The picture is different Norton and Griskevicius agreed for married men and their spouses You wouldnt expect having romance on the mind to lead men in committed relationships to want to show off their wealth to others Griskevicius said Nortons study confirms that Married men in general are spending less on their partners he said maybe because theyve sealed the deal which is a little sad Norton suggests single women and married spouses who spend a little more this   might feel a little happier That ties in with his previous research in which he has found that the feelings of subjective wealth after giftgiving are soon followed by feelings of happiness But dont lose sleep over the findings of the new study Until published in a peerreviewed journal data and conclusions are typically considered preliminary  Copyright     All rights reserved
