Kathy Del Tonto started cooking school food  years ago in the   school district at the foot of Colorados San Juan Mountains Back then the cafeteria workers made everything from scratch My first kitchen that I managed was a little country school out south of town and we made our own ketchup and everything she says But times changed Families started eating more fast food and processing companies started offering schools fastfood kinds of choices The companies would take the food that the US Department of Agriculture gives to schools turn it into chicken nuggets and other processed items kids want and then send it to cafeterias  for less than cooking it on site would cost Del Tonto went along with it By doing processed food you can cut your labor because you dont have to do the hard cooking or youre just reheating and that kind of thing she explains Increasingly though the   to reduce childhood obesity by improving what kids eat in school has changed the game It means schools are now required to serve more fresh fruits and vegetables And theres a movement within the movement that promotes the retro notion of cooking meals from scratch And that takes a change in the hearts and minds of those behind the lunch line  a chef from Boulder Colo wants Del Tonto and all other cafeteria workers onboard He says with a little training food staff can cook the food on site I ask them if they cook chicken at home and theyre like Of course I cook chicken at home and I say Is it difficult No I do it all the time  says Shethar And so I think about transferring the love you give your food at home  why shouldnt it be in the schools Despite the rap that its more expensive to cook Shethar believes it can be done for the same price as having the food processors do it Shethar travels around Colorado with a group called   which teaches districts like Del Tontos how to switch to more healthful food Think of it as a boot camp for the lunch lady set At first Del Tonto was not pleased I didnt like somebody coming in and telling me I was doing it wrong We were giving kids what they loved We had huge lunch counts they were happy Nobody was complaining she says That was two years ago Del Tonto was in charge of food for all  schools in her district and she had them serving processed foods almost exclusively But by the end of the school food training she was a changed woman When I sat there in that classroom and knew the obesity rate had increased  percent when I saw photos of kids and knowing that that generation doesnt have the life expectancy that their parents have  as a mom thats a shockandawe moment she says I remember thinking in my head if its not me whos it gonna be thats going to take that on And if not now when Two years later Del Tontos schools have switched from mostly processed foods to making  percent of what kids eat from scratch But it wasnt easy It required training staff members educating them about healthful eating and lots of repetition to get the kids to make the more healthful choices Those challenges and others are more than most schools want to take on says Joe Pawlak a school   It takes money new equipment and retraining cafeteria staff Del Tontos school had   Del Tonto remains committed to serving nearly all meals in her schools cooked from scratch She says lunch ladies feel better serving things theyve made themselves Just knowing the love and the care we put in that food hoping that it makes a difference for some of those kids
