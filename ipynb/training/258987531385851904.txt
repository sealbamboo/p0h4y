The humanity of India washes up at its train stations Passengers sprawling among vagrants wait for trains while sweepers halfheartedly shuffle brooms in the heat Its Sunday Day  of Immunization Week During national campaigns which occur twice a year  million volunteers fan out to Indias train stations bus depots temples churches and mosques armed with vials of polio vaccine Checking progress at a city slum Delhis Polio Eradication Program chief Dr CM Khanijo says the vaccine must be kept at around  degrees Fahrenheit  even when the temperature outside is  degrees The quality of the vaccine remains better if it is maintained in the cold chain he says And the cold chain is maintained by keeping ice or ice packs Khanijo says that in just  minutes enough vials to cover a large area of Delhis old walled city are distributed and in place By  am an army of vaccinators is dropping medicine into little mouths Families bring their squirming children to the booths where they are given oral polio drops containing a weakened form of the wild polio virus which only humans carry India has  million children aged  and younger and all of them are tiny targets in this massive national immunization project that since January  has made India free of a disease that has afflicted it for millennia It must remain poliofree for three years before the WHO will certify that India has eradicated polio This is kind of a mission But ultimately the purpose is that we need to reach each and every child says Dr Ajay Khera the deputy commissioner of Indias Ministry of Health and Family Welfare who directs the countrys polio eradication program In  when we started the program we used to get roughly around  polio cases every year And every village everywhere people used to find a polio child Khera says So people  imagine kind of a disabled child and nobody wants that disabled child to be there in the community Trucks blast messages encouraging families to vaccinate their children part of Indias mass publicawareness campaign The nations polio chief says the aim is to vaccinate as many children as possible on Sunday the first day of the campaign and then have vaccinators go house to house for the next five days Dr Kiran Kathuria oversees  teams that go house to house in central Delhi during National Immunization Week and during supplementary or SubNational weeks The poorer less developed north of India which includes Delhi is more prone to polio than the richer south and so vaccination weeks are more frequent there Kathuria recalls working as a young doctor in the countrys diseaseafflicted slums The suffering she saw made eradicating polio her passion Every second house had a  polioaffected child They were roaming around on the road limping legs  I have seen lots of deaths due to polio says Kathuria who has been working against the disease since  Back then she mapped the slums for the vaccinators noting down any landmark she could find  from temples to pigsties I had put in my map that from this pigsty to this mosque the team will travel and cover  houses in two days Thats how I made my maps That was the beginning she says with a laugh Today Kathuria calls herself a general in a war on polio One of the biggest worries health officials have is that the virus will jump across the   where the disease is endemic Extending her war analogy Kathuria compares Indias polio campaign to the  fighting between India and Pakistan in Kashmir That time we did not allow the Pakistani army into India This time we will not allow a   to come to India In fact I call all my team members I call them soldiers she says Her troops  mainly women  cover a middleclass district where families have just one or two children and she closely monitors their work Santosh Sharma a stout  year old has gone door to door in Delhi since the program began in the s At this door shes told that the mother of the house is bathing Santosh says shell be back and moves to the next apartment This immunization in September was the sixth this year for Delhi and like most of the ones preceding it Santosh finds yearold Jasmit Singh at home with his mother Rupinder When Rupinder says her child was not vaccinated Sunday the veteran volunteer reaches for the vaccine Santosh has administered many of the polio drops young Jasmit has had which amount to dozens over the years Kathuria translates for Rupinder saying the mother is proud that India is now gaining a good name in the world because it is poliofree Kathuria translates for Rupinder saying the mother is proud that India is now gaining a good name in the world because it is poliofree Santosh a foot soldier in that effort interjects A dangerous disease is being thrown out of the country A dangerous disease attacking our children is being eradicated The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has advised Indias polio program providing money and expertise The foundation also supports NPR   notes that with Indias success the world has never been closer to eradicating polio and he says that the remaining hot spots should draw on Indias experience Indias success is really phenomenal Gates says You probably wouldve guessed they would be the toughest country because of size the number of kids who move around the sanitation challenges up in the north migratory populations And so absolutely the lessons from India can now be applied in the two toughest countries that remain  Pakistan in Asia and Nigeria in Africa   When a Pakistani delegation traveled to India this summer to see how its archrival had defeated polio it saw a level of detail and logistics it had not seen before The presence of Pakistanis in India usually sparks a media buzz and this was no exception When a zealous minder steps in to end an impromptu news conference the Pakistani delegation leader   gently brushes him aside We appreciate what you are doing Shahnaz Wazir Ali tells him before turning back to the reporters We have also greatly appreciated the monitoring system that the Indians have Monitoring and monitoring of monitors And the surveillance system It is polio as diplomacy two foes that have fought three wars finding new common ground  Gates Foundation senior program officer says bridging India and Pakistan over polio knits together not just program strategies but the chance to seize a historic moment for global health Polio eradication is not going  to keep coming back as many different opportunities This is our time The world has only ever really gotten rid of one disease that affects human beings and thats smallpox he says Back in her clinic Dr Kathuria expresses the belief that Indias success will spur Pakistan Im sure Pakistan will have the courage that they can eradicate polio after seeing us she says If India can do it why cant we Im sure they will have that feeling
