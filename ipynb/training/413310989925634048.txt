A new study of black men suggests that living with both parents in childhood reduces the risk for high blood pressure in adulthood Previous studies have found an association of hypertension with childhood poverty but this analysis   is the first to find a link between high blood pressure and a childhood spent in a singleparent household Researchers studied  black men older than  between  and  More than half of the men had high blood pressure and about onethird never lived with both parents After adjusting for age family history of hypertension and other variables they found that compared with men who never lived with both parents men who had lived with both parents at any time in their lives had an average systolic blood pressure that was  millimeters of mercury lower Among those who had lived with both parents for between one and  years the average was  millimeters of mercury lower The authors acknowledge that living with both parents may be connected to higher socioeconomic status which could influence blood pressure and that the study can draw no conclusions about causality Still the lead author Debbie S Barrington a senior research fellow at the   said it is a provocative finding The magnitude of the effect is very large she said even stronger than the effect of certain blood pressure medications
