Children may be getting chest Xrays they dont need doctors reported Wednesday A look at the chest Xrays taken at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota showed that the great majority did absolutely nothing to tell doctors what was wrong with a child while exposing the kids to radiation Chest Xrays can be a valuable exam when ordered for the correct indications said Dr Ann Packard a Mayo Clinic radiologist whose findings were presented at a meeting of the Radiological Society of North America However there are several indications where pediatric chest Xrays offer no benefit and likely should not be performed to decrease radiation dose and cost Packard and colleagues looked at chest Xray exams ordered for  babies children and teens between  and  at the hospital They found  percent of the scans did not change how the child was treated Theyd been ordered for unexplained fainting dizziness or vomiting mostly Another  showed pneumonia bronchial inflammation or an injury While Xrays dont deliver very much radiation theres still a worry Children are young their tissues are more vulnerable to damage and they have a lifetime to develop cancer A more powerful form of Xray called a CT scan is more worrying  some studies have suggested that kids who get too many really do have a higher risk of cancer I would like this research to help guide clinicians and deter them from ordering unnecessary exams which offer no clinical benefit to the patient Packard said
