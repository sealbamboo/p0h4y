And no one could tell me why Finally two years ago a doctor provided me with the answer I had been in search of for most of my life He diagnosed me with a rare genetic disorder called   a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by frequent attacks of fever stomach and chest pain and swollen joints The downside to learning the answer was the realization there was no cure The doctor prescribed medication to manage my symptoms but I still experienced a lot of pain and discomfort So I began doing my own research on treating inflammation  Inflammation is the root cause of many illnesses according to Dr Reza Ghorbani medical director of the Advanced Pain Medicine Institute and author of   Cardiovascular disease Alzheimers arthritis and several digestive disorders have all been linked to chronic inflammation Inflammation is a natural part of your immune system it occurs when the body is fighting against harm or infection However chronic inflammation hurts the body instead of healing it because the immune system is essentially attacking healthy cells   In his book Ghorbani outlines several methods for treating inflammation Ive seen a trend among patients looking for alternative and natural treatment Ghorbani says I think a lot of consumers whether its in pain treatment the food they eat or what they provide for their family the trend is to look for something that is safer This year for the first time ever at the annual American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain ASRA conference experts held a halfday session dedicated to alternative treatments for chronic pain Physicians are slowly beginning to recognize the importance of looking at pain holistically says Dr Asokumar Buvanendran a boardcertified pain management specialist and professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center There are a lot of remedies that are available outside of the traditional means of treating patients Buvanendran says  Its not all about herbs and acupuncture An overall healthy lifestyle including eating healthy foods and getting the proper amount of exercise plays a big role in managing chronic pain experts say I was intrigued by the stories I found about the potential healing properties of food and the mind Skeptical I started integrating the things I learned into my daily life  Nearly two years after my diagnosis my health has been transformed Each persons experience is different but these holistic remedies have helped me achieve a better quality of life If you are living with pain and feel that you havent received the proper treatment dont give up Ask your family friends and colleagues for recommendations I think patients need to understand that there are alternatives to what doctors normally prescribe for pain treatment says Ghorbani Dont just take the doctors word for it  do your homework too  I spent most of my life looking before I found the right doctor Keep searching until you find a doctor you feel comfortable with  someone who can help you get the treatment you want  Getting the proper amount of sleep helps the body fight inflammation pain and disease A   published in the medical journal Sleep found people who get less than six hours of sleep or have disrupted sleep have higher levels of Creactive protein in the body which causes inflammation  As a journalist working rotating shifts I was not getting proper sleep and my health suffered because of it After I was diagnosed I made adjustments to my lifestyle to allow for enough sleep I feel healthier and stronger when I have slept sufficiently  Research has shown the many health benefits of meditation Studies suggest meditation can reduce blood pressure inflammation pain response and stress hormone levels all while increasing concentration and improving sleep   funded by the National Institute of Health showed mindful meditation can help with pain regulation through cognitive and emotional control   I began meditating shortly after I was diagnosed in January  It has been a significant part of my recovery and improved health There are various websites books and guided meditations available online It can be as simple as taking  minutes a day to sit in stillness   Managing stress is a significant part of healthy living When stress goes unmanaged it causes inflammation in the body In a   researchers showed that people who dwelled on stressful events in their lives had higher levels of Creactive protein Meditation is a helpful tool to help manage stress and it is available to everyone What you eat has a direct impact on how you feel According to a study   women who eat a diet high in red and processed meats sweets desserts and refined grains foods known to promote inflammation have higher levels of Creactive protein than those who ate a diet full of fruit vegetables legumes fish poultry and whole grains   Ive incorporated many natural antiinflammatory foods into my diet including ginger turmeric and cinnamon I eat fruits and vegetables that are powerful antiinflammatories such as pomegranates blueberries and blackberries  I also do my best to eliminate foods that are inflammatory such as sugar one of the biggest culprits I can feel the difference because of these changes There is an abundant source of books available on the topic   and Secrets to a Pain Free Life are a good place to start You can take control of your pain and your life by eating right No one should accept pain as a normal part of their life Ghorbani says  Both Buvanendran and Ghorbani believe another big part of treating chronic pain is addressing the psychological impact it has on patients  The physiology of pain is really connected to the emotional part of it Ghorbani says It really can exaggerate when you get upset anxious and depressed and in turn increase your pain level  Buvanendran says mental health professionals can help patients navigate the emotional terrain of managing chronic pain  Patients are sometimes reluctant to see a therapist but once they see them they find the benefits to be extraordinary Oftentimes loved ones may not fully comprehend the emotional toll that chronic pain can take on you A therapist can offer the support and guidance that you may need to help you cope with chronic pain  Your insurance company may provide coverage for a mental health specialist Do your research and use all the resources available to you I found a therapist who specialized in patients with chronic illnesses She helped me realize that I needed to accept my illness something I hadnt been able to do before I could really begin the healing process I was struggling with the loss of my health and she helped me to understand that it was OK to feel that way  Once we were able to work through that I was able to find gratitude in my new life and begin to move forward
