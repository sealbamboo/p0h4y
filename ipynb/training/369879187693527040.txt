The old man was in the hospital dying when family members were handed discharge papers The prospect of taking the patient home was overwhelming his family wanted him cared for in an institution that could address his complicated needs What could they do and where could they turn for help There is a simple answer although its known to few caregivers In every state   or QIOs will step in when an elderly person or that persons representative wants to appeal a discharge from hospital rehabilitation home health care hospice or skilled nursing services QIOs also handle complaints about the quality of medical care and can help resolve nonurgent problems for Medicare beneficiaries from difficulty getting followup medical appointments to concerns about providers who are not communicating clearly Our role is to be an advocate on your behalf said Dr Adrienne Mims president of the American Health Quality Association which represents QIOs nationally and medical director of Alliant GMCF the QIO in Georgia  For a list of QIOs across the country    In the case of the elderly man described above a relative made a call and a social worker at the QIO quickly identified the problem the family had selected a hospice agency that did not have a contract with the hospital for inpatient services The social worker asked if the hospital would sign a contract with the hospice agency and it turned out this solution was acceptable according to Therese Canaday manager of beneficiary and familycentered care at Telligen the Illinois QIO that handled the matter The older man stayed in the hospital and died soon thereafter So how does the process work Lets start with the hospital Before you are discharged staff members are required to give Medicare beneficiaries a document that describes their right to appeal and to have their case reviewed by a QIO Ideally patients should get the document two days in advance but in practice hospitals often distribute it closer to the time of discharge If you think you are not ready to leave the hospital  and many patients do research shows  contact your states QIO with a request for an appeal no later than  pm on the day of your proposed discharge Once you do so   until the appeal is resolved Also Medicare will cover the extra time you spend in the facility excluding any deductible or coinsurance charges for which you are responsible   A call is all thats needed to get the ball rolling  If you do not reach someone during business hours leave a message on the QIO phone line and staff members will begin working on your case the next day They will ask that your medical record be faxed  its required that the records be sent by the close of business on the day of the QIOs request forward that record on to an independent medical reviewer and resolve the appeal within one day of receipt of that record If the QIOs medical review determines that a discharge is not advisable because a patient is too sick or because plans for transferring the patient to another setting are not adequate we overrule the discharge plan and our decision is binding Ms Mims said That means Medicare will continue to pay for the hospital visit The process is similar for appeals from other types of facilities including skilled nursing home health rehabilitation and hospice services  In each case you should receive a notice two days in advance advising you that services are set to be terminated and letting you know how soon an appeal should be filed Again you cannot be forcibly discharged while an appeal is under way decisions regarding these services are rendered  hours after an appeal request  For home health care a letter from a physician stating that this patient continues to needs services is also required    What is different are timelines for these appeals  You will need to challenge a proposed discharge from a nursing home or home health care before noon of the day before the planned discharge date according to Nancy Borgstadt director of review services for CFMC the QIO in Colorado But if your appeal is denied and the original discharge date is upheld you will have to pay the cost of the extra time you spent in home health care rehabilitation hospice or the nursing home out of your own pocket which can be considerable Asked what she would like the elderly and their caregivers to know about QIOs Ms Borgstadt said We are here to listen to them and give them a voice    Later this week Ill write about how these organizations can intervene in all kinds of thorny situations and help improve the quality of care for older patients
