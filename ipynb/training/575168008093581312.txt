Nearly  million people in the United States have migraines and three times as many women as men have them 
                   
                  Migraines are pulsating headaches often on one side of the head Physical activity may intensify the pain but symptoms can vary from person to person and from one attack to the next 
                   
                  In patients who have migraines were going to treat all of their headaches as potential migraines says Anne Calhoun MD partner and cofounder of the Carolina Headache Institute in Chapel Hill NC 
                   
                  Here are  ways to identify migraines Some people with a migraine experience aura 
                   
                  The most common auras are visual such as flickering lights spots or lines You may see a little jagged linethat will develop some cross hatches and it might sort of move in a curved direction Dr Calhoun says 
                   
                  Auras typically last between five minutes and an hour with a minute skip phase before the headache pain sets in she says 
                   
                  Some patients have auras without a migrainetype headache or any headache at all Mood changes can be a sign of migraines 
                   
                  Some patients will feel very depressed or suddenly down for no reason Dr Calhoun says Others will feel very high Dutch researchers recently reported a possible genetic link between depression and migraines especially migraines with aura 
                   
                  Data presented at the American Academy of Neurology  annual meeting suggests that moderate or severe depression increases the risk of episodic migraines becoming chronic Waking up tired or having trouble falling asleep are common problems in people with migraines 
                   
                  Studies have shown an association between lack of restorative sleep and the frequency and intensity of migraines 
                   
                  When migraines strike its tough to get a good nights sleep A lot of people will have insomnia as a result of their migraine says Edmund Messina MD medical director of the Michigan Headache Clinic in East Lansing This inability to sleep can be the start of a vicious cycle as research suggests that lack of sleep can also trigger migraines Some people with migraines have sinus symptoms such as stuffy nose clear nasal drainage droopy eyelids or tearing Dr Messina says 
                   
                  One large study found that among people who complained of sinus headaches nearly  were having migraines The study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline which makes migraine medicine Before a migraine attack occurs some people crave certain foods 
                   
                  A common craving is chocolate Dr Messina says Pulsating pain is a classic sign of migraines The throbbing is often felt on one side of the head 
                   
                  In an online survey of patients with migraines the National Headache Foundation found that  always have throbbing on one side while  say they frequently have this symptom Migraine pain often burrows behind the eye 
                   
                  People will blame it on eye strain and many will get their eyes checked but that wont make their headaches any better Dr Messina says A lot of people will say My neck gets stiff and then I get a headache Well its probably the early stage of the migraine Dr Messina says Or after a migraine theyll get that neck symptom or theyll have throbbing pain at the back of their neck 
                   
                  In an online survey the National Headache Foundation found  of migraine patients always have neck pain and  frequently have neck pain during migraine headaches The Foundation receives support from GlaxoSmithKline maker of migraine medicine If you have to go a lot it can mean a migraine is coming 
                   
                  Its one of the many symptoms people experience just before a migraine These warning signs also known as the prodome phase of a migraine can arrive as little as an hour or as much as two days before the start of headache pain Yawning a lot is another tipoff that a migraine is about to strike 
                   
                  Unlike regular Im tired yawning it may be excessive and occur every few minutes 
                   
                  In one  study in the journal   about  of migraine patients reported yawning was one of the signs of an impending migraine Some people with migraines have sensory aura 
                   
                  They may have a temporary lack of sensation or a pinsandneedles feeling typically on one side of the body moving from the fingertips through the arm and across the face According to data from the American Migraine Study II a mail survey of more than  people with migraines  experience nausea and  have vomiting The study was funded by a drug manufacturer 
                   
                  A recent analysis of the National Headache Foundations American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study found people with frequent migrainerelated nausea have more severe pain and more trouble getting relief from medication than migraine sufferers with little or no nausea In the throes of a migraine attack the migraine sufferer tends to seek refuge in a dark quiet place Bright lights and loud noises can trigger a migraine or intensify the pain The same is true of certain odors 
                   
                  Once youve already got a migraine smells can seem more intense and make it worse Dr Calhoun says But a smell can also trigger a migraine in someone who didnt have one before he or she walked past the perfume counter Â  Routine activities such as walking or climbing stairs can make migraine pain worse 
                   
                  Some migraines are induced by exercise running weightlifting or exertion sexual activity People with exertioninduced headaches require a thorough workup to rule out underlying causes such as a brain aneurysm Cant get the words out Speech difficulties can be another sign that a migraine is on its way 
                   
                  A lot of people with migraines will feel like theyre blithering Dr Messina says Its a common description by patients If you are experiencing speech problems for the first time contact a doctor to make sure the problems are not related to a more serious issue such as a stroke When an arm goes limp it can be a sign of a migraine 
                   
                  Some people experience muscle weakness on one side of the body before a migraine attack This can also be a sign of a stroke however so consult a doctor to rule out any other causes One type of migraine called a basilartype migraine can cause dizziness double vision or loss of vision 
                   
                  Some people with migraines may experience balance problems too In a recent study Dr Calhoun and colleagues found a link between migraine intensity and dizziness or vertigo The stronger the migraine the more likely patients were to have these complaints 
                   
                  Our best conclusion is that its actually part of migraines she says Its a migraine symptom After the migraine passes a person may feel like her body has been pummeled 
                   
                  In a recent study researchers interviewed migraine patients and found that they commonly experienced symptoms such as fatigue trouble concentrating weakness dizziness lightheadedness and loss of energy during the postmigraine period 
                   
                  It can be very fatiguing Dr Messina says
