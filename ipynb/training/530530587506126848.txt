Stem cells can be used to heal the damage in the brain caused by Parkinsons disease according to scientists in Sweden  They said their study on rats heralded a huge breakthrough towards developing effective treatments  There is no cure for the disease but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms Parkinsons UK said there were many questions still to be answered before human trials could proceed The disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine which helps to control mood and movement  To simulate Parkinsons Lund University researchers killed dopamineproducing neurons on one side of the rats brains They then converted human embryonic stem cells into neurons that produced dopamine These were injected into the rats brains and the researchers found evidence that the damage was reversed There have been no human clinical trials of stemcellderived neurons but the researchers said they could be ready for testing by  Malin Parmar associate professor of developmental and regenerative neurobiology said Its a huge breakthrough in the field and a stepping stone towards clinical trials A similar method has been tried in a limited number of patients  It involved taking brain tissue from multiple aborted foetuses to heal the brain Clinical trials were abandoned after mixed results but about a third of the patients had foetal brain cells that functioned for  years Using embryonic stem cells may be preferable as it is easier to get hold of the large numbers of cells needed for transplant by growing them in the laboratory  It also opens up the possibility of using less ethically charged sources of stem cells such as those made from adult tissue The charity Parkinsons UK said the research could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinsons Its director of research and development Arthur Roach said This important research is a key step along the way in helping us to understand how stem cells might shape future Parkinsons treatments There are important potential advantages of these cells over the foetalderived cells used in past cell transplantation work This study could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinsons but there are still many questions that need to be answered before this development can be tested in people with the condition
