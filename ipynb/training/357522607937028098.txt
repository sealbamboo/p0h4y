West Nile virus looked like it was waning as a health threat with the number of cases dropping each year Then last summer it roared back The number of people infected with the mosquitoborne illness suddenly spiked in  And Dallas was hit hardest of all People showed up in emergency rooms with   and paralysis unable to breathe on their own Officials scrambled to launch a massive program to spray insecticides across the city But by the time planes hit the air in August it was a little too late All told almost  people got sick from   in Dallas about half of them with the most serious form of the disease which can leave people permanently paralyzed Nineteen people died Health officials were baffled The virus first appeared in the United States in  and though it has spread throughout the continental US outbreaks have subsided over the past decade In  and  just one person had fallen ill from West Nile in Dallas each year Im embarrassed to say I and many others thought that West Nile was gone says   director of epidemiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and senior author on a study of the outbreak Everybody thought it was gone Even CDC was saying well I guess we can move on and do something else But by looking closely at the Dallas outbreak Haley and other scientists say theyve found the clues they need to solve the mystery  and perhaps save lives in the next outbreak Dallas got lucky in one way Unlike many urban areas the county had a network of mosquito traps to monitor populations and test for West Nile In  mosquitoes infected with West Nile started showing up in mosquito traps much earlier than usual in late May Sick people started showing up in emergency rooms much earlier than usual too in early June When Haley and his colleagues looked at weather data for the winter of  they found that it had been unusually mild with very few days below freezing That was also true for the winter before the citys secondworst outbreak in  And the summer of  was rainy with lots of chances to create the tiny standing puddles West Nile mosquitoes need to reproduce This gives us a new tool for determining in what year were going to have a big epidemic of West Nile Haley told Shots The  were published in   a journal of the American Medical Association Knowing that a mild winter followed by a rainy summer makes for a more dangerous West Nile season could help predict future outbreaks nationwide Since theres no vaccine for humans the only way to prevent West Nile infections is to keep people from being bitten by mosquitoes That requires knowing when its going to be a bad mosquito year and when to spray Using a   developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Dallas scientists were able to pinpoint when enough mosquitoes are infected to spark an outbreak  the West Nile tipping point And it tells us that three to four weeks before you see the human cases occurring Haley told Shots Youre able to intervene right when the first infections are being acquired Deploying mosquitocontrol measures at that point Haley says could help prevent most West Nile infections Last year Dallas didnt start a concerted spraying effort until midAugust By then the outbreak was waning on its own so the  million spraying effort was largely wasted The researchers calculate that if that spraying had started in early July  cases of West Nile could have been prevented and  lives could have been saved The Dallas data revealed one more surprise  the outbreak affected the rich more than the poor By plotting the homes of West Nile victims on a map the researchers found to their surprise that it was people in the welloff communities of Park Cities and North Dallas who were most likely to become infected Thats unlike many infectious disease outbreaks which affect the poor The welloff neighborhoods may be vulnerable because there are more houses and fewer woodlands untended swimming pools and heavy sprinkling of lawns may be a factor too Haley says Many states have had very few West Nile cases in recent years others face ongoing threats The virus will continue to pose a significant threat to health in the future according to a   by CDC researchers also published in   Heres a glimpse at how the states are faring
