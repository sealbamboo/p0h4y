It had been several months since I had last seen my patient and even longer since Id seen his mother He was  and unable to walk or talk and when I caught his eye his face broke open into a huge smile accompanied by the grunting and rhythmic thrusting of his torso and arms that he uses to express himself Shortly after he was born he was found to have a genetic variance about which unfortunately little is known  My patient has an unusually small head widely spaced eyes seizures feeding and digestive problems and a wide range of developmental delays He also has obstructive sleep apnea which is why I had first become involved in his care when he was only a couple months old About a year ago his mother told me that she was planning to go back to school to become a medical clinical assistant And since then his grandmother had accompanied him to his last few appointments so his mother would not have to miss class I asked the mother if she had finished her coursework My classes yes she replied But I still havent taken the certifying exam Why not I asked guessing what the answer was even before I had finished the question Are you nervous about passing Yes she said halfsmiling to herself before looking up at me We talked about how her year had gone She told me that she had found the classwork quite easy because of her experience in caring for her own child with special needs All of the pumps and suction machines and nebulizers I knew all that from him she said bouncing a finger lightly off the tip of her sons nose and eliciting a giggle I encouraged her to push ahead Im sure youll do fine on the exam and it will be great for you to start doing something youre good at and being in regular contact with other adults Yeah youre right she said I like the people in health care People in health care they dont stare at my son like hes some kind of freak you know They see him for who he is She took a deep breath and continued Its different when Im around other people Either they make faces because they think he is too big to be in a stroller or when he starts making his sounds and throwing his body around they just stand there and stare I feel like they dont want either of us around and just wish we would go away I started my pediatric residency  years ago this summer two months after my oldest was born Over the years I have cared for thousands of children with all sorts of conditions and I try to connect with each and every one of them in a special way With some I talk about what theyre reading the sports theyre doing the instruments theyre playing their dreams or their fears With others the communication is nonverbal whether  they are babies who havent yet learned to speak or their development is delayed I have yet to meet a child who fails to kindle my compassion or to bring out in me the most basic desire to try to help Perhaps this is why I was so shaken by what I had just heard about mother and son being shunned by others who were unable to see the son she loves as a child instead of as a condition or disease I couldnt help recognize the cruel irony of these strangers withdrawing from this child because of the very sounds and movements that he uses to try and interact with them undeniable expressions of his humanity Faced with such a child in the park or at a restaurant too many of us just stand there and stare Instead notice the twinkle in the childs eyes even if they are halfhidden behind smudged thicklensed glasses Return the smile even if it twists unusually or is wetter than what youre used to Wave back at him when he jerks his arms toward you and say hello even if its hard to understand exactly what shes saying  These children and their families will notice and feel welcomed
