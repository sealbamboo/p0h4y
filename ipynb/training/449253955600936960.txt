Not so long ago a middleaged patient came to my office for a checkup He cheerfully admitted that he hadnt been paying attention to his diabetes for the last few years Hed stopped taking his medicine stopped seeing his doctors stopped thinking about the disease altogether When I checked his blood sugar in the office it wasnt just a little elevated  it was four times the normal level For doctors it is always a shocker to hear a case like this How can a patient completely ignore a disease for so long How can a lifethreatening illness just   from someones consciousness The patient was not in denial he knew he had diabetes It just wasnt on his   priority list at this point in his life For me it was flashing neon at the top of my list with seven exclamation points Its not surprising that doctors and patients have contrasting agendas We come to illness from entirely different perspectives and backgrounds Moreover the angles of our respective lenses are mismatched For my patient his wideangle lens took in the whole of his life of which diabetes was one small part For me in the  minutes allotted my lens was narrowly focused on the disease that posed the gravest and most immediate risk to his health The challenge that lay ahead of us was to help each other adjust the angles of our respective lenses so that our visions could come into common focus Otherwise wed slip into futile haranguing The diabetes algorithm taped to the wall could tell me exactly how much insulin to administer for his staggering high sugar level But my patient didnt need me to tell him he was perfectly aware of the algorithm himself What the algorithm couldnt tell us was how to understand the disease from different perspectives how to tease apart the elements that had led up to the current situation and how come up with a workable plan to prevent an otherwise healthy man from ending up blind impotent on dialysis and in a wheelchair from foot amputations That required extended discussions over the next few months that touched upon matters both practical and philosophical We had to figure out how a taxi driver who relied on streetvendor food and whose only exercise was pressing the gas pedal could adhere to the diet and exercise requirements to control diabetes We had to talk about the diarrhea that his diabetes pills caused We had to discuss how his religious background influenced his approach to the future  And we had to talk bluntly about his life expectancy and the legacy he would  or would not   leave to his children It was fascinating to be in on the complicated messy and individual way that people make decisions in real time Both of us had to reconsider our assumptions about diabetes and how it should best be treated He flatly refused insulin my opening bid for the most efficacious way to control his sugar I had to fight back my clinical instincts to appreciate that bringing down his glucose level simply was not his top priority He was most concerned about keeping his life workable and needles were distinctly not part of that We had to compromise on a medical regimen that involved pills only and agreed on an initial goal of getting his sugar just low enough to prevent the symptoms of excessive thirst and urination Beyond that it was negotiations that rivaled the Mideast peace process Was this a success Well his glucose did not get anywhere close to the normal range as had been my initial goal Certainly the scientific consensus is that getting glucose close to normal decreases the risk of many of the bad outcomes of diabetes Letting go of this goal ran against all my training as a doctor But we did manage to get diabetes back onto his radar While we both would have preferred that he didnt have this disease at all the reality was that it was there like it or not By being aware he could now begin to think about how his food choices and activity level could sway the disease  for better or for worse His sugar is now lower than it was and this should result in some harm reduction even if the level never approaches normal He is taking his meds and has made a few modest changes to his diet On my end Ive learned that there are times that I need to modify my own priorities and figure out with the patient what goals are achievable at least at a given time Im also reminded how much more intriguing and challenging medicine is when we have the opportunity to delve in deep with a patient By the quality measures scorecard this patient will count as a failure on my watch since I have not succeeded in normalizing his glucose  or his cholesterol or his blood pressure for that matter The objective outcomedriven data would rate me as a betterquality doctor if diabetes fell off his radar again and he dropped out of my practice Luckily for both of us he continues to come to his appointments and we both call that a success
