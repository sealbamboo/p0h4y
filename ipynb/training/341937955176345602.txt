the time and twothirds wore hats in the sun But researchers wanted to find out what would happen to skin if people tried to use a broadspectrum sunscreen all the time over four and a half years Half of the study participants were told to continue their usual practices and the other half to slather on sunscreen daily The result   in The Annals of Internal Medicine is that those assigned to use sunscreen every day had noticeably more resilient and smoother skin than those assigned to continue their usual practices The study also included nearly  people who were randomly assigned to take beta carotene a nutritional supplement or a placebo to see if the supplement prevented skin aging It did not The sunscreen element of the study impressed other researchers Dr David R Bickers a dermatology professor at Columbia University who was not involved in the research said it makes it clear that extensive consistent use of sunscreen can alter a pattern of what would be an inevitable progression of photoaging Until now he said most studies of sundamaged skin were conducted with mice not people and it was not clear whether the results would be the same Dr Barbara A Gilchrest a dermatology professor at the Boston University School of Medicine and the editor of The Journal of Investigative Dermatology said she too found the study convincing Dr Gilchrest who was not associated with the study noted that its subjects were not inveterate tanners but rather people who tried to protect their skin They were not taking the worst sun offenders and taking them out of the sun Dr Gilchrest said Everyone had pretty darn good sunprotection habits to begin with No one had done such a study before because the very idea is daunting dermatologists said Hundreds of healthy people had to agree to follow their assigned regimens for years The sunscreen used by those assigned to daily applications had a sun protection factor or SPF of  which filters  percent of the suns rays Someone who would normally burn in  minutes would burn in  minutes with an SPF  Those assigned to use sunscreen even had their sunscreen bottles weighed to make sure they were using it Getting compliance over a sustained period of time is no mean feat Dr Bickers said To me it is remarkable that they were able to get the degree of compliance that they did The sunscreen study was paid for by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia No sunscreen makers contributed Researchers studied only white people in Nambour northeast of Sydney Participants agreed to let researchers make silicone casts of their skin at the start and the end of the study to assess how their skin had aged The studys principal investigator Adele C Green a senior scientist at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and her colleagues there and at the University of Queensland had previously shown that this method provides the same sort of information as a skin biopsy With a biopsy dermatologists look at elastin the elastic tissue which degrades with aging contributing to wrinkles and sagging skin It is easy to see the effects of aging in a biopsy said Dr David J Leffell a professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale Instead of nice pink fibers you see a purple amorphous material It is almost like looking at a photograph through a lens covered with Vaseline The silicone molds allowed experts to look at corresponding changes on the skins surface In making a mold a subject first stretched the skin on the top of a hand by grasping a cardboard tube and making a fist Then a researcher covered the top of the hand with silicone and peeled it off forming the mold Assessors who did not know whether the subjects were using sunscreen examined the lines in the silicone molds and graded them from  to  A score of  means no photoaging at all Its like a babys skin resilient Dr Green said There is a fine network of lines under a microscope A person with a score of  has severely aged skin with no elasticity and deep lines Every point on the scale represents coarser skin and increased wrinkling on the hand the face or wherever the skin is being assessed On the face each point is also associated with a greater number of visible small blood vessels At the start of the study the median score in both groups of subjects was  which means they had moderate photoaging At the end those assigned to daily sunscreen use still had a median score of  but those in the control group had a median of  The study does not answer the question of whether people older than  would also have more youthful skin if they used sunscreen Dr Green cautioned After  she said agings effects on skin start to predominate And the effects of ultraviolet light on skin are cumulative It is not known how much sunscreen can help if its use is started later in life But Dr Green would advise it anyway she said because it can protect against skin cancer The study also does not answer the question of whether darkerskinned people could protect their skin from wrinkling and sagging by using sunscreen People with fair skin have much more of a problem with photoaging and skin cancer than those with darker skin Dr Gilchrest said But if asked to speculate about whether darkerskinned people would retain more youthful skin if they used sunscreen she said she thought they would It is not clear that anyone will ever get an answer for darkerskinned people though said Dr Robert A Swerlick a dermatology professor at Emory University With less photoaging in darker skin it would take longer to see an effect if there was one he noted If the study could be extended long enough and people could be enticed to use screening agents diligently an effect likely could be shown in darkerskinned people Dr Swerlick said But he added whether it is worth the effort to religiously apply sunscreen over many years when your personal probability of benefit is uncertain and perhaps low is another
