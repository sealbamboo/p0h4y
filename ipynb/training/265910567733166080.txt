Walk into a fast food restaurant and its probably safe to assume that whatever deepfried deliciousness you eat youll consume more calories than you would if you ate a wellrounded home cooked meal Thats common sense But public health officials are sounding the alarm about the effect that eating out often  whether at fast food or full service restaurants  is having on our diets especially in children And now theres data to support the public health communitys fears   a professor of health policy and administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago and her colleague Binh T Nguyen also of the University of Illinois at Chicago linked eating at both fastfood and full service restaurants to higher calorie intake Their   were published Monday in the   The researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of  children ages  to  and  adolescents ages   over the course of several years They looked at each kids diet on two separate days and examined a slew of factors how much of the food they ate came from fast food joints how much came from fullservice restaurants whether they got takeout or ate at the restaurant energy and beverage intake and nutrient intake fat saturated fat sugar sodium etc The also accounted for food consumed at a friends house or at school Teens got  more calories on days when they ate at fastfood restaurants but overall children and adolescents consumed more calories on days where they ate at either fullservice or fastfood establishments Teens that ate at the fastfood restaurant also drank less milk and twice the soda on a daily basis The daily total energy intake for those who ate at fullservice restaurants were also higher and for lower income teens and children the adverse effects on diet only get worse On days when teens are consuming fastfood theyre not reducing their calorie consumption in other areas of their diet says Powell They take in more sugar more fat more saturated fat more sodium  thats putting them at risk for a whole host of other health risks Namely heart disease   and stroke just to name a few According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   of adults and more than   of children and adolescents in the United States are obese And we eat out a lot more than we used to years ago when restaurant meals were an expensive treat According to a   released this week by NPD we are eating out a tad less since the recession  adults ages  to  will eat out only  times this year compared to  times in   but thats still only about about a day less each week Powell blames marketing in part Children and youth are constantly being bombarded with the promotion of fastfood she says Powell notes that kids are exposed to more fast food ads on TV these days and more fastfood restaurants can be found near high schools That fastfood and fullservice restaurants   and increase soda intake is no surprise to folks whove been following these issues  an assistant professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins Universitys Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who is not affiliated with the research says the study does a better job than previous ones at tracking the multiple sources of food in kids diets but notes the study has some limitations For example its a survey that requires participants to recall what they were eating  always an X factor What is most notable about this paper is not its finding but rather its policy significance she says Bleich says it will help policymakers address obesity Powell says addressing the obesity issue isnt as simple as putting in place a   But she says its a step in the right direction We need to change the environment she says We need to work with restaurants so that the healthy items are priced well and promoted Some eating establishments have made efforts to scrub their greasy reputations   now prominently features calorie counts on its menus and some   are offering more healthy choices This summer   even started limiting junk food advertisements Whatever happens warns Powell We dont want fast food to become the norm
