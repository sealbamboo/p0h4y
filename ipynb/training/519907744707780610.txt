Robby Benson is sitting serenely in the cafe of the Beverly Hills Hilton sipping hot coffee as afternoon sunlight pours in through the windows The yearold actor voice of the Beast in Disneys animated Beauty and the Beast is the picture of rugged health and wellness he wears a loose blue buttondown his thick brown hair falls in waves and his easy smile welcomes passersby as he stands up to say hello Its not the appearance one would expect from a man whos endured four openheart surgeries in  years but Benson who runs and swims nearly every day doesnt give in easily to circumstance In his recently published book Im Not Dead Yet he writes about his congenital heart valve defect and how his health motivated him to find a new way of life and to work toward helping others I have had the gift of people coming to me and asking for advice and help with either loved ones or themselves Theyre either an advocate or a patient and one way or another they are very vulnerable I want to give as much of myself as I possibly can to help them navigate this very brutal experience When I woke up in the ICU after my fourth openheart surgery I started thinking if I could show the things that Ive been through and the mistakes that Ive made  and Ive made a lot of mistakes  people can bypass these mistakes and have a better and healthier experience What I learned is that moderation is really imperative I feel so lucky to celebrate my body and exercise To me it is a gift I do  minutes of cardio most days  its not killer cardio but its moderate and it keeps my entire body healthy Exercise is so good for me mentally too Other days I use the Stairmaster for  minutes then I take off my sweaty shirt put on those really cool barefoot running shoes put on my goggles and I run about two miles to a lake by our house  at a decent pace nothing fast just what feels right at that moment  then I swim across the lake and I run home You know each surgery is such an education such a learning experience The year before the first surgery I had run the New York Marathon I thought it would be noble to bounce back from the surgery as fast as I possibly could to the point where eight weeks to the day that they cut me open I ran a K At the time I thought that was the right thing to do But I was putting myself in jeopardy foolishly by being macho I thought that was taking care of my family when in truth I should have gone for long walks holding my wifes hand being with her and talking with her There are also days when Ill start my run then and then Ill stop and Ill say You know I think Ive done enough I would never have done that before because I thought of it as quitting I perceived quitting as something that can be an epidemic once you start it might creep into other things Ive learned thats just not the case Im not quitting If I feel good tomorrow Ill go for this run this swim but today I think Im going to go home and write some music It took me so long to get to the point where I started making the right choices and stopped being a macho control freak and I hope people can learn from that I also really believe having been a patient for so long that its harder to be the loved one than it is to be the patient The patient has tangible things that theyre dealing with they feel the pain they understand the pain but the loved one has to deal with the unknown and use their imagination and I think thats very frightening Thats where the book comes in Always In my life I have learned to harness that energy from almost everything thats happened to me into something creative even if its incredibly negative energy Otherwise its a waste of my time As far as Im concerned to just sit around and stew in negativity and anger is wrong Theres no doubt that I could get started in the negative and have as much anger as anyone youll ever meet but I was taught at a very very young age to turn that energy into something positive
