Nearly  patients have been discharged from Welsh hospitals late at night over the last two years Liberal Democrat research shows that  patients left hospital between pm and am since  with the party concerned people are discharged without any good reason The figures are for inpatients admitted for treatment not AE patients Welsh ministers said there were valid reasons for the vast majority of night discharges Local health boards in Wales do not record the reasons why patients have been discharged Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams called on the Welsh government to make it compulsory Were concerned that such a large number of people seemingly are being discharged from hospital overnight without any good reason for that happening at least no reasons being recorded she said   Were asking the Welsh government to ensure that in the future that any patient leaving hospital between the hours of pm and am theyre actually recorded and the reasons for that discharge are recorded as well Im concerned that these discharge figures maybe are a reflection of the pressures that we have in the entire hospital system because of a lack of beds but we simply dont know Ms Williams added      show there has been a  reduction in the number of hospital beds in Wales between  and   accounting for  beds  Concerns have also been raised by a body that represents the interest of patients but it says more information is needed Dr Paul Worthington Chief Officer of Cwm Taf Community Health Council said Patients should never be discharged from hospital unless its clinically safe clinically appropriate and also convenient for patients The numbers are high so I think that does flag a legitimate question to say are all these discharges appropriate Are they clinically safe But I think the devil really is in the detail we need to understand the dynamics of those figures  A Welsh government spokesman responded Out of the more than  people discharged from Welsh hospitals last year  only a very small percentage of these left at night  The vast majority of these will have valid reasons to do so with their transfer of care to the community planned by clinicians and family working together  Sometimes it is actually appropriate to discharge a patient at night if it is safe to do so and if this is the wish of the patient and their family
