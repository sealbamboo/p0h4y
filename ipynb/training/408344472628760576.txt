The population of people on dialysis is graying adults aged  and older are the fastest growing group beginning this treatment  But often doctors dont answer their key question How long can I expect to live  Researchers at Tufts University and the University of New Mexico underscored the disconnect in a recent review Ninetyfive percent of patients said they and their families   the authors noted But a  survey cited in the study found that  percent of patients had never discussed the issue with their nephrologists The researchers called for doctors to explain prognosis to patients and undertake shared decisionmaking assessing the benefits and burdens of treatment in light of a persons values That recommendation has also been   and the American Society of Nephrology But the advice is widely ignored in practice I interviewed several experts and reviewed almost two dozen scientific reports for some answers about the prognosis for older adults on dialysis  What is known about life expectancy among older dialysis patients  Older people on dialysis have a significantly shortened life expectancy compared with peers in their age group   This is especially true when they have multiple illnesses up to onethird of older adults with severe kidney disease have four or more other ailments such as diabetes hypertension heart disease or dementia Dr Jeffrey Berns who heads the nephrology fellowship program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania pointed me to some useful data from the    The data show that  to yearolds on dialysis can expect to live  years on average compared with  years for all Americans of that age For  to yearolds the figures dropped to  years versus  years  For  to yearolds they were  years versus  years  And for those  years and older average life expectancy was two years versus  years  The dialysis data is for  and the general population data is from  Some people will do better and others will do worse Dr Berns said Its hard to predict with any degree of precision but obviously the more conditions someone has the less likely it is their life expectancy will be enhanced by starting them on dialysis   This is especially true of patients with ischemic heart disease characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart  That condition alone is sufficient to negate any potential benefit from dialysis in the elderly Dr Berns said  Do other factors affect life expectancy     Research suggests that older adults who are frail and unable to dress toilet bathe eat on their own or get out of bed in the morning also tend not to  live long on dialysis   If someone cant perform multiple activities of daily living you need to be introspective about whether dialysis adds to their longevity said Dr Leslie Spry medical director of The Dialysis Center of Lincoln in Nebraska and a spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation If theyre otherwise relatively healthy and getting around all right thats another matter altogether One simple question that draws on the doctors clinical judgment  Would you be surprised if Mr Smith died within the next six months  turns out to be highly predictive of who will survive New research from the Mayo Clinic presented last month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology suggests other considerations    looked at  patients aged  and older at the Rochester Minn medical center between  and  Slightly more than threequarters of them began dialysis in the hospital after an acute exacerbation of chronic kidney disease a severe infection or an acute kidney injury following surgery  Those who started dialysis in the intensive care unit  percent of the hospital population did especially poorly  Only  percent survived the next six months   percent were alive at one year  Patients who started dialysis in the hospital but outside the ICU had better results initially but those worsened over time  percent died in the first six months but only  percent were alive after a year The Mayo Clinic draws especially ill patients from across the country and the results may not be generalizable  But they suggest that many sick older patients who begin dialysis while in the hospital may not survive for long according to lead researcher Dr Bjorg Thorsteindottir a health care delivery scholar at the Mayo Clinic  Still a healthy elderly patient should absolutely consider dialysis and can do very well she said  Will I live longer on dialysis than on supportive therapy  Most studies suggest that older adults on dialysis will live longer than those who decide against this treatment and choose instead to treat symptoms such as pain or nausea  socalled supportive therapy According to a review of studies of patients on supportive therapy   with a range of up to  months  On average that is shorter than the life expectancy for older adults on dialysis   But in general the evidence supporting a survival advantage in very old patients on dialysis is weak according to Dr Thorsteindottir And theres growing concern among experts that too many elderly patients with severe kidney disease may be starting dialysis without the potential for significant benefit   Concerns about overtreatment are focused on older adults especially those who are frail or have other severe or lifelimiting conditions according to the authors of   last year  The bottom line  older patients and their families deserve to understand what they can expect when a physician recommends dialysis This is a demanding treatment and one whose potential benefits and burdens deserve careful consideration
