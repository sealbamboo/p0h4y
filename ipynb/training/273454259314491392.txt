Some people are allergic to peanuts others to shellfish fruits or wheat But this rare allergy is a carnivores worst nightmare A tick bite that can cause a case of itchy red hives every time you eat meat Yup get bit by one of these buggers and you may be saying farewell to your filet Mignon For some people around the country this is no nightmare its a reality  and it may be coming to your neck of the woods The meat allergy known as alphagal for a sugar carbohydrate found in beef lamb and pork produces a hivelike rash  and in some people a dangerous anaphylactic reaction  roughly four hours after consuming the meat Its caused by antibodies to the alphagal sugar that are produced in humans after they are bitten by common Lone Star ticks Now the government has not yet issued health warnings about meat allergies associated with these ticks  such allergies are still quite rare and like many other food allergies the presence of the antibody doesnt necessarily guarantee an allergic response Scientists say the allergyinducing tick bites have affected about  people since it was first reported in  compared to the roughly  new cases of Lyme diseases reported every year In the majority of cases so far the tick bites have become a concern for meatloving hikers farmers and pretty much anyone spending regular time outdoors in Southeastern states like Virginia Kentucky and Tennessee where the Lone Star tick is commonly found But data presented at a recent allergy meeting suggests that even people living outside known Lone Star regions have reason to be wary Michelle Altrich the director of ViracorIBT Laboratories one of two main reference labs offering a   for the alphagal allergy presented an analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tick data that indicates the allergyinducing bites are being reported in large numbers well outside known Lone Star tick areas We were curious to know whether the prevalence of the allergy actually overlaid with the tick or if it was different says Altrich who discussed the findings at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunologys   in Anaheim Calif We saw a trend in positive results to the southeastern US with the tick but interestingly we also found positive rates varying from  percent to  percent of samples submitted for testing outside of the tick area Weve actually had positives as far west as Hawaii Why that is isnt clear says Altrich One possibility is that those diagnosed with the allergy in places like Hawaii were actually bitten while traveling in a hightick area like Tennessee she says Another possibility is that the ticks are growing in number and their territory is spreading to adjacent states The   range and abundance of Lone Star Tick has increased steadily in the past  to  years according to the CDC  likely concurrent with an explosion of populations of deer the ticks primary host Allergy researcher   of the University of Virginia has been studying alphagal since  and was among the first to describe it in in the scientific literature He also consults for ViracorIBT He says the increasing number of cases may also be explained in part by the sheer number of bites inflicted by this particular species This tick is very aggressive Its larval forms will bite humans whereas none of the other American tick larvae will do that he says PlattsMills and his colleagues now believe that there is something in the tick saliva that causes humans to develop the alphagal antibodies but he says so far no one is sure exactly what that substance is Tick saliva is brilliant stuff  it has loads of substances  but if you ask me which substances are critical I dont know Its something we are working on PlattsMills says In the meantime ACAAI President   wants to spread the word so that people can avoid triggering the allergy Fineman says too few people are aware of the allergy or dont make the connection between a case of hives and the meal they had much earlier in the day and so they never get tested It takes four to six hours to see a reaction so many people dont correlate that to their meat or hamburger or something  its easy to miss Fineman says The bottom line Preventing the tick bites is the only way to stop the allergy before it starts So regardless of where you live if youre going to be outdoors and you love meat  bring along a bottle of DEET If you want to know more about a guy who hunts ticks for a living check out   on University of Rhode Island professor Tom Mather
