As a hardpartying teenager Patrick Kennedy met President Reagan at a fundraiser for the JFK Library a meeting captured in a photograph that the former Rhode Island congressman now hangs in his home office He used to think of it as a funny episode a collision of Camelots cocaine kid and Americas foremost opponent of illegal drug use But Kennedy took his last hit of anything in  and hes since honed an antidrug message that sounds a bit like Reagan with a Boston brogue Kennedy believes there is an epidemic in this country of epic dimensions when it comes to alcohol and drugs Hed like to treat it all but hes convinced that the single biggest threat to Americas mental health is freemarket marijuana So even as Democrats favor the legalization of potby a point margin according to the latest WSJNBC News pollthe scion of Americas most famous Democratic family has broken ranks criticized the White House and aligned with the likes of Newt Gingrich to warn voters against trying to tax and regulate todays psychoactive chlorophyll I dont think the American public has any clue about this stuff says Kennedy after welcoming guests with a choice of Gatorade or bottled water The stuff in question is modern marijuana of course which gets pumped into snack foods and candies and carries more THC tetrahydrocannabinol the chemical that gets you high than the ditch weed used by the hippie generation Kennedy calls legalization a public health nightmare because he believes it will warm more people to a dangerous drug and lead inevitably to Big Marijuana a bloodsucking vice industry dependent on converting kids and selling to heavy userssame as the tobacco and alcohol industries The science tells the story he says breaking into an attack on the idea that marijuana is safer than alcohol He ticks through studies showing that smoked marijuana is associated with or linked to IQ loss psychosis and selfreported dissatisfaction with life It takes you to the same place as cocaine or heroin he often adds It just takes longer Last January Kennedy went public with his beliefs launching Smart Approaches to Marijuana or Project SAM a campaign to keep marijuana illegal and address the failings of the drug war through other means But what other means Kennedy has sometimes been vague promising a fresh approach that neither legalizes nor demonizes marijuana but never quite clarifying what makes him different from Reaganera prohibitionists Not anymore In a series of interviews Kennedy and his cofounder Kevin Sabeta former senior advisor to the Obama administration on drug policypreviewed SAMs aggressive new posture for  Its not a new War on Pot but it might be the most potent campaign since Nancy Reagan made marijuana the centerpiece of her Just say no tour three decades ago As Kennedy and Sabet cut a path between the poles of legalization and prohibition they seem to list toward the status quo They would make the simple possession of marijuana a civil infraction like jaywalking which could take  annual marijuana arrests down to zero and alleviate the disproportionate burden that prohibition puts on people who are nonwhite and poor But instead of handcuffs Kennedy and Sabet propose a mandatory screening for marijuana addiction according to the Legal Reform section of their website That could lead to marijuana education and ultimately a year in a probation program to prevent further drug use And if the pot smoker still insists on getting high Its handcuffs time Incarceration is a powerful motivator says Kennedy who after a prescription drugrelated car crash in  spent a year urinating in front of a probation officer three times a week He faced a jail term if he relapsed That does it for a lot of people he added Thats the turning point hearing that judge say treatment or jail Kennedy and Sabet can also sound oldschool on medical marijuana As a member of Congress Kennedy voted in favor of allowing patients access to pot but now says he was wrong Hed like to repeal every law that treats smoked marijuana as medicine Instead he hopes to see pharmaceuticalgrade cannabis satisfy an FDA approval process and sell as a patch or pill We dont smoke opium for morphine as Sabet explains we dont need to smoke pot for medicine SAMs opponents argue that legalizing weed would raise tax revenue allow law enforcement to chase more serious crime and undercut Mexicos violent drug cartels Kennedy and Sabet sharply dispute all thisand so much morebut theyre particularly unapologetic about championing the continued existence of a black market They say its mostly nonviolent on the American side and will create fewer public health problems than allowing advertisers to flog for Big Marijuana There is no way to minimize the greed and profit motive in promoting a dangerous substance says Kennedy When it comes to pushing a product adds Sabet I think Madison Avenue has proven that it can get around more rules and be more ruthless than any Mexican drug cartel He calls the black market better than having Joe Pot heir to Joe Camel on a busstop where Im going to be hanging out with my kids before school When Project SAM launched opponents mocked the effort as foolhardy and they had a point Voters had just legalized marijuana by a landslide in Colorado and Washington Polls showed that a majority of Americans supported doing the same nationwide and Kennedy could do little at first but appear on TV as the token voice of dissent Now however SAM is poised to launch a serious counteroffensive It began this month with a billboard outside the Super BowlMarijuana kills your drive read the carefullycalibrated text which picked up national coverage spreading on a tide of the oppositions howls and guffaws It was crafted by Sabet a yearold prodigy of drug politics who launched his first antidrug campaign Citizens for a DrugFree Berkeley while in college and is now in the opinion of Rolling Stone the number one national enemy of legalization Yep he emailed after the ad launched Game on The game continues this spring with SAM planning a response to We Are the Marijuana Majority a web compendium of legalizations best and most famous friends launched with a grant from the Drug Policy Alliance a leading advocate for reform The SAM answer will be a directory ofyou guessed itthe antimarijuana majority The precise URL and title is still under discussion but the webpage will feature opponents of legalization an infinite scroll of head shots and quotes from the likes of Tina Brown David Brooks and Barack Obama whose tangled statements on the subject appear to have landed him on both sites at once SAMs second website will take aim at Colorado and Washington the worlds first stateapproved markets for marijuana and to Kennedy and Sabet a slowly unfolding disaster that will prove them right in the end The Justice Department has said it will shut down the state experiments if the regulations fail or public health falters which is why SAM will use this site to track every known example of pot gone wrong The third website is tentatively titled The Other Side of Marijuana and it will collect stories from people who believe marijuana damaged their lives Its a counterpoint to the notion that marijuana is a safe nonaddictive substance Based on a sample of entries its also likely to draw more fire than anything SAM has done yet My name is John and marijuana ruined my life begins one note from a young man who says that marijuana took the gifts and potential I was born with Most of my daughters former friends are in jail or dead adds the mother of an yearold in residential treatment for marijuana addiction She is sickened by the idea that marijuana will be the next big business in America In another note a therapist quits her practice in despair after a rise in marijuanarelated patients I witnessed firsthand too many of the problems she writes ticking off anxiety depression irritability and psychosis Not every pot smoker goes crazy or brainless as Kennedy admits but SAM is about minimizing the risk to those wholike himstart drugs young and are predisposed to break bad for life After he got married in  in his early s he moved to his wifes hometown of Atlantic City NJ Now he is the father of three kids under  one is a stepchild and he worries they will inherit his addictions He can aslo see the casinos from his backyard The appetite for Americans to lose themselves is just Kennedy shakes his head and seems too pained to finish the thought His sixweekold daughter was fussy the night before and it was his turn to shush and pace In the hallway near a stairway to where his monthold son is napping theres a toy fire engine and Kennedys eyes return to it again and again Suddenly he seems to be on the brink of tears This is the stuff of life he says trying to explain his passion for drug policy so you bet Im emotional about it The rollout of the new SAM continued this month at a conference in Washington DC where Kennedy and Sabet held a standingroomonly rally for supporters They celebrated  media mentions and  states with SAM affiliates They aired footage of Kennedy telling CNNs Sanjay Gupta that his ballyhooed endorsement of marijuana was shameful a ratings ploy that history will not remember well So far however the legalization side seems to have an edge in the war of ridicule They charge Kennedy and Sabet with st century reefer madness which the duo bats away as a sign that the opposition is afraid to engage with the facts But while they can sometimes be unpopular at parties they keep going fueled by those letters from the public and enthusiastic notes from past drug advisors SAM is doing what no one else has done and doing a darn good job of it wrote Robert DuPont Richard Nixons head of drug control in a recent email to Sabet Absolutely brilliant presentation Clintonera drug czar Barry McCaffrey added in a different note In a sense nothing has changed since a teenage Kennedy gave President Reagan a sly smile To make the world a healthier place the antidrug crowd wants to protect people from their most dangerous appetites The reform side supports the same vision of health but wants to make drug use itself safer believing that insobriety is normal and indulgence inevitable Neither side appears to be winning because theres no such thing as an objective position on marijuana policy Would legalization really be so bad Or is it the panacea its proponents claim The honest answer is nobody knows for sure because no modern nation has ever tried legalization beforeuntil now Life isnt really in our control says Kennedy as another sober day fades to night Theres a mover in the universe a higher power so to speak and we cant imagine what were going to find in our universe if we let go and just let God lead us
