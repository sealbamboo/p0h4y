Nature provides plenty of reasons for parents to adore their newborns The giant eyes the adorable coos the flawless skin But in the days following the birth of my son in May it was his fresh slightly sweet and immensely satisfying scent that did me in At all hours of the morning I would take long greedy sniffs as I cradled him in the dark Ive already forgotten the sleep I lost but I dont think I will ever forget that smell But what exactly was I smelling Its a question that proved surprisingly hard to answer And there is a sizable group out there a Web search revealed who insist that new baby smell is merely a myth the lingering effect of scented wipes or an olfactory hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation I couldnt buy that Now a study published in the journal   confirms my beliefs suggesting that baby smell is not only real but acts as a kind of sensory compensation for mothers Researchers asked  women   who had recently given birth and  who had never given birth  to identify mystery scents while their brain activity was monitored When given the smell of newborns taken from pajamas the women all showed activity in the same dopamine pathways that light up after ingesting cocaine enjoying food or other rewardinducing behavior The reactions were observed in all the women though they were stronger in the new mothers Johan Lundstrm a biologist with the   in Philadelphia and a study author believes that womens brains are hardwired this way to provide an evolutionary incentive We think that this is part of a mechanism to focus the mothers attention toward the baby he said  When you interact with the baby you feel rewarded A similar process may apply to men as well Dr Lundstrm said though he lacks the data to prove it Much of the earlier research in the area of smell and babies has focused on how infants react to their mothers scent It had been shown for example that babies are   than a clean pad and that newborns undergoing painful procedures are    but not the milk of others Its not surprising then that hospital staff now often place an article of moms clothing in the incubator alongside preterm babies in the hopes that it will calm them But theres research on new baby smell to be found too A  study found that mothers who were given three hospital gowns to sniff guessed which one their child had worn  percent of the time a finding confirmed by   A   the smell of their childs feces to that of other children Do with that what you will Still nobody seems to know for sure what causes new baby smell But like any body odor it is probably a combination of factors Odors are chemicals Dr Lundstrm said but its really hard to establish which chemicals In natural body odor we have roughly   individual chemical compounds and they vary by individuals Complicating matters is the fact that baby smell is so fleeting By six weeks of age it is typically gone One likely component is the vernix caseosa the white cheeselike substance that covers babies at birth Dr Lundstrm said Hospital workers usually wash it off right after delivery but traces can remain in the babys hair or the folds of the arms and legs and contribute to new baby smell as it breaks down Amniotic fluid too has a distinct smell that both mothers and fathers can recognize that could also be a source of new baby smell In  researchers asked  mothers and  fathers to determine which of two bottles of amniotic fluid belonged to their child Twelve of the mothers and  of the fathers guessed correctly And maybe the fragrance industry knows something that scientists dont After all theyre the ones pumping out lotions and powders that smell baby fresh containing ingredients like white musk vanilla and orange Interestingly those ingredients vary by country If you look at baby products from Spain or France they tend to have orange blossom as an ingredient because thats in the countryside and thats fresh said Michelle Krell Kydd a fragrance industry consultant and prominent flavor and fragrance   Americans on the other hand have a love affair with vanilla and powdery scents With my son approaching  months of age his new baby smell has long since faded But I still love his scent as fresh and satisfying  and addictive  as ever Who knows Maybe its the lotion
