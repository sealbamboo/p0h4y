Many of you still full from Thanksgiving may be anticipating holiday parties to come and wondering how to balance things out with some of the meals in between With this in mind I decided to work on light fish and seafood dinners for this weeks Recipes for Health They should provide you with a respite from rich food during this shortened window between Thanksgiving and Christmas I bought several fillets of Alaskan cod knowing that the Alaskan state fisheries use sustainable practices Cod is a very mild tasting fish that has a fairly firm texture I oven steamed the fillets using the same technique I use for salmon and made three different sauces to serve with the fish Oven steaming worked beautifully I love using this cooking method because you dont need any extra oil except to oil the foil on your baking sheet and you wont be left with lingering odors of fried fish in your kitchen It is a very forgiving method for preparing fish and lends itself to doahead cooking In addition to the cod with sauces I made a refreshing and satisfying ceviche and I also bought some clams which I steamed and served with a spicy tomato sauce All of these dishes are light even with the robust sauces They are nice not only for family dinners but also if you are entertaining this holiday season and want to try to keep the menu on the light side  A sauce that can double as a vegetable side dish  A cool sauce over hot fish makes for a delicious meal  Tomatillo sauce works with a wide range of fish  A light satisfying meal that can be served over a bed of spinach
