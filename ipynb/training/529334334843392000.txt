Brittany Maynard was a beautiful anomaly Most yearolds dont get incurable brain cancer Most young cancer patients dont choose assisted suicide when given a terminal diagnosis or decide as Maynard and her husband did to pack up and move to another state so she could have that choice And Maynard also decided to let the world in on her excruciating choice opening herself and her family up to criticism at a time when thats the last thing they needed Since news of Maynards decision first surfaced Ive been thinking a lot about what I would do if I got a terminal diagnosis or if someone I love does I dont know But American health care often does a spectacularly bad job of caring for people as theyre dying And as Dr Atul Gawande   in his new book   young patients like Brittany are most likely to be given the live longer at any cost approach Maynards husband and family seemed in unison in trying for as good a life as possible in her final days But I can imagine struggling with it if my mom said she wanted to make an early exit Thats what happened to Emily Bem whose mother a psychology professor diagnosed with Alzheimers told the family she planned to commit suicide before she lost the ability to think My NPR colleague Alix Spiegel   Ultimately what made it possible for Emily to accept her mothers choice was a gettogether for family and friends with her mother The people who choose assisted suicide are typically much more like Emilys mother than like Brittany  theyre older than  They also tend to be white welleducated and to have put a great deal of thought into their choice And most who ask about the option dont follow through in the end Indeed a   published last year in the   found that just  percent of  terminal cancer patients who had asked about assisted suicide at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance eventually decided to kill themselves Only onethird filled the prescription Most never continued beyond their first inquiry Qualitatively patients and families were grateful to receive the lethal prescription whether it was used or not the study authors wrote The most common reason people gave considering assisted suicide was fear of a loss of autonomy If those numbers hold true assisted suicide will remain the choice of very few people even if it becomes legal in more states And even people who decided in the end to make that choice dont say its easy Ethan Remmel a psychology professor with cancer who died at age  wrote eloquently about the process about his frustration that his family and doctors seemed to value quantity of life over quality and about his grief at a life cut short Three days before he died he that he had come to terms with that loss
