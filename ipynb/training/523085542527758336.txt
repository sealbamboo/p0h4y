Graphs and formulas say Science to consumers so much so that simply seeing claims about a new drug that were accompanied by data visualizations made people more likely to believe the claims The effect is especially true if people have a strong belief in science to begin with Thats the conclusion of a   published online in the journal   It includes three experiments In the first  people read a paragraph saying that a nonexistent new drug enhances immune function and reduces the likelihood of catching a cold by  percent Half of the people also saw a graph that repeated the numbers but contained no new information Of those who saw the text and the graph  percent said they believed the drug worked compared with  percent for the people who saw only the text The researchers from the   wanted to be sure that difference wasnt just because one group had the information repeated for them in graph form So a separate group of  people saw the text and the graph or the text plus an extra sentence repeating some of the information Again the people who saw the graph rated the medication as more effective  especially those who said they believed in science Finally the researchers wanted to make sure that the effect didnt just hold for visual representations of information such as a graph So a different group of  people received information about another hypothetical drug For half that included the drugs chemical formula Those who saw the formula believed the drug would work two hours longer than those who didnt get the formula Even trivial elements that are associated with science  can enhance persuasion the authors said Thats important in an era of sometimesdubious health claims for foods and supplements as well as medications Indeed a Nielsen survey a few years back found that while most people say they   they were more likely to believe claims backed by numbers Cornell behavioral economist   an author of the study says theres nothing inherently illegitimate about product information marketing materials or advertisements that include graphs or formulas Its just that those elements make the marketing message more convincing So he warns that its important to consider the source of all that information no matter the form it takes Is it from the company itself or a source funded by the company Or is it from an independent source He says it cant hurt to approach sciencey information like graphs or formulas with a more critical attitude But he doesnt know if putting your guard up can make you immune to the bias
