Malaria has proved one of the hardest diseases on the planet to treat The World Health Organization estimates there are nearly  million cases each year and the parasitic infection is blamed for some  deaths annually One reason malaria may be so difficult to treat is that different types of malaria parasites can be streaming through the victims body at the same time Researchers at the   in San Antonio are now applying a form of DNA analysis called singlecell genome sequencing to better understand the various parasites in a single case For instance the researchers found that people whod come down with malaria along the ThaiMyanmar border had both   and  parasites in their blood This is problematic because the standard drugs to treat each of these types are completely different In addition the San Antonio academics found that some of the parasites multiplying in the blood cells are resistant to antimalarial drugs while others show no resistance Older DNA sequencing methods didnt allow researchers to analyze single parasites according to   who led the   There were so many different strains of parasites within a malaria infection that we couldnt tell which was responsible for drug resistance or disease severity Cheeseman tells Shots We really needed a method where we could work out the individual genome sequence of each parasite With singlecell genome sequencing Cheeseman and his colleagues found that some of the parasites were very closely related but others were completely different strains This raises the question of which strain is driving the illness inside the sick person whether that could help tailor treatment According to Cheesemans coauthor Shalini Nair up to  percent of malaria cases in subSaharan Africa are multiple genotype infections meaning theyre caused by multiple strains of the parasite And we currently dont know how many genotypes are present and whether parasites come from a single mosquito bite or multiple mosquito bites says Nair Singlecell genomics could help researchers figure this out But the sophisticaed equipment used to do this wont be coming any time soon to a malaria field clinic in say Malawi This isnt going to be used on a routine diagnostic basis for a long long time  possibly ever Cheeseman says But learning about the basic biology of parasites he believes will enable researchers to find better treatments or more effective ways to use treatments that already exist
