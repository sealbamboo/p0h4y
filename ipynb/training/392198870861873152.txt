The way Ronna Simmons of Philadelphia describes it every two weeks a timer goes off Simmons  will have been doing just fine working taking care of her daughter And then suddenly everything changes Normally cheerful Simmons says she begins to hate herself I tell everybody Im not myself right now  she says  Ill call you back when Im Ronna again Simmons has premenstrual dysphoric disorder or PMDD Its sometimes referred to as PMS on steroids PMDD is defined by psychiatrists as a fairly rare syndrome that prompts disabling emotional and sometimes physical reactions to the hormonal changes that come with a womans period Psychiatrists have been slow to formally recognize PMDD as a disorder but thats changed under the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSM which lists PMDD as a distinct mental disorder Doctors who treat   say women typically begin experiencing symptoms around the start of the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle a twoweek span between ovulation and the first day of a womans period Symptoms can include severe depression anxiety and tension And then just as quickly the symptoms disappear Once your period starts says Megan Olney  from Warren Ohio its like a release You feel OK but then you have to deal with what you just went through Olney was a teenager when she realized that there seemed to be a link between her period and the extremely dark moods she was experiencing But when she tried getting help she found doctors skeptical that her emotional problems could be connected to her period So Olney went online and diagnosed herself She learned that PMDD is different from   PMS different from depression or bipolar disorder As many as  percent of menstruating women have at least one   according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists PMDD is much less common affecting no more than  percent of menstruating women The PMDD diagnosis has three main criteria First the symptoms have to correspond with the menstrual cycle for a minimum of two successive months Second the symptoms must be truly disruptive to a womans ability to carry out her normal activities Thats different than in PMS where most symptoms are mild Finally to be diagnosed with PMDD women must report that they arent depressed all the time just in the days leading up to their periods In PMDD says   who directs the Penn Center for Womens Behavioral Wellness a woman clearly has symptoms under a certain hormonal state that are not there under another hormonal state Epperson says the medical literature was until recently vague about what PMDD is and how to treat it but that has changed Previous versions of the DSM lumped PMDD into a category called not otherwise specified Last year Epperson served on a   in charge of updating the manual The group decided to give PMDD its own entry as a full diagnosis in the latest version of the manual the DSM Epperson says it was a controversial decision I think any time a disorder occurs more frequently in women or only in women theres going to be a group of individuals who have concern that this will diminish womens role in society their sense of being capable Epperson says One person concerned about that is   who studies health disparities in the school of social work at Washington University in St Louis She has tried to find out how many women actually have PMDD to see as she puts it if there was any evidence for this disorder Gehlerts team randomly recruited  women from around St Louis and Chicago They asked the women to fill out a form every day for two months answering basic questions about their mood and how they were feeling The form said nothing about menstruation Instead the women submitted daily urine samples so Gehlerts team could see where each was in her monthly cycle I wanted to go into it as scientifically and objectively as possible she says This was especially important to Gehlert because PMDD struck her as a diagnosis that could be used against women Say a poor woman was in court trying to see whether she could keep custody of her child Gehlert says Her partners or spouses attorney might say Yes your honor but she has a mental disorder And she might not get custody of her children At the very least Gehlert worries that PMDD could be overdiagnosed pathologizing healthy women who were experiencing normal hormonal shifts After all she says theres a lot of money to be made from it One textbook example is the prescription drug Sarafem which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in  as a treatment for PMDD In reality Sarafem is identical to the widely prescribed SSRI antidepressant Prozac or fluoxetine The patent on Prozac was about to expire and manufacturer Eli Lilly faced losing market share to generic versions So Eli Lilly gave Prozac a new name   and painted it pink What had been a generic drug that cost  cents a pill was marketed as a PMDDspecific drug for  a pill The marketing of Sarafem raised eyebrows In November  after Lilly aired a TV commercial showing a frustrated woman wrestling with a shopping cart the FDA sent Lilly a  telling Lilly to immediately cease using this broadcast advertisement and all other promotional materials for Sarafem that contain the same or similar issues The shoppingcart commercial never defined PMDD the FDA said and failed to distinguish it from PMS Consequently the overall message broadens the indication and trivializes the seriousness of PMDD the letter continued For a diagnosis of PMDD symptoms must markedly interfere with work school usual social activities and relationships To Gehlert the women in the Sarafem ads looked like normal women who were just having a tough day That would attach any kind of normal frustration to the menstrual cycle she says And that could lead people to think that women  over men  were predisposed toward that sort of behavior In the women Gehlert studied just  percent fit the criteria for PMDD The   were published in  in the journal   Its a small number smaller than what other researchers have found for PMDD To Gehlert the jury is still out especially when there is still so little hard evidence about how hormonal changes interact with a womans emotions I would feel much much more comfortable if we understood the biology behind it she says Even though we found evidence the question remains Is what we described real Megan Olney says she understands their concerns She knows how neatly PMDD can fit into harmful stereotypes about women But getting formal recognition for PMDD has made a difference to her There comes a point where you need to realize there is a name for what youre going through she says It helps you to realize that youre not alone in your struggles Today theres a big online community centered around PMDD forums where Olney and other women talk about whats worked for them  whether its antidepressants birth control pills or exercise and diet They find each other on Twitter and other social media networks That community can be its own therapy says Amanda Van Slyke who is  and lives in Edmonton Alberta The online communities have been a refuge for Van Slyke a place where she came out as she puts it as a woman with PMDD and found others willing to share their experiences with the disease Resources include the   in the United Kingdom various Facebook sites and the PMDD hashtag on Twitter Van Slyke and other women say the forums are also a place to be reminded that unlike other mental disorders PMDD always goes away at least for a while
