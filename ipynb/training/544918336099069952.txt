Another December day  and still your donations are streaming in You have now raised  for    Thank you Inside the building weve been busy too Incredibly your donations are coming in at almost twice the rate of last years appeal It really feels like this is an issue you want to put your hearts minds and wallets behind  Chief Executive of Christmas appeal charity   Mark Winstanley thinks so too Just this morning he dropped in to talk to us about how the landscape around mental health is changing Inspired by your support for the appeal inside the building weve been trying to play our part too  We had plenty of fun taking your calls during Saturdays telethon but weve been having some fun to raise money for the appeal during the week too we do work sometimes  promise  Most of this has been down to a healthy dose of competition with the floors of Kings Place being pitted against each other to see who can raise the most cash The strategies used were almost entirely built around replacing any well loved traditional game with innocuous festive references Hence weve been enjoying a pin the nose on Rudolph game a guess the number of brussel sprouts in the jar competition and a wear your Christmas jumper to work day The first floor team refused to play ball with the Christmas theme however with their winning chicken nugget competition Were very happy as all of these efforts added a lovely  to the fundraising pot  Thank you for being so generous If you have done anything festive or fun to raise money for the appeal let us know in the comments below
