For many years immediate surgery has been considered the only proper treatment for appendicitis in children Now a small study suggests that in some cases antibiotics alone may be better The study   involved  uncomplicated cases of acute appendicitis that met specific criteria Patients were  to  years old they had had pain for  hours or less their white blood cell counts were only moderately elevated less than  CT or ultrasound scans confirmed their appendix had not ruptured and they had no impacted feces  Thirty of the patients opted not to have immediate surgery and were treated with a minimum of  hours of intravenous antibiotics followed by about a week of oral antibiotics Any child who did not get better within  hours of antibiotics underwent surgery Of the  two needed surgery within  hours and a third underwent surgery a day after discharge because of insufficient improvement but none suffered complications The other  nonsurgical patients missed fewer days of school and resumed normal activities sooner than those who had had appendectomies Its so dogmatic to operate for appendicitis that it requires a huge paradigm shift said the senior author Dr Katherine J Deans an assistant professor of surgery at Nationwide Childrens Hospital But there are choices It may be safe to wait
