A new observational study suggests that drugs commonly used to treat Alzheimers disease may have another benefit preventing heart attacks and premature death Swedish researchers reviewed records on  Alzheimers patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors Aricept Exelon Reminyl and other brands Over an average of about  months of followup  of the patients had a heart attack or died After adjusting for sex age previous cardiovascular disease additional prescribed drugs and other factors the researchers found that taking cholinesterase inhibitors reduced both the death rate and the heart attack rate by about  percent Moreover the risk decreased further with increasing doses of the medicines The   Critically ill patients are not usually prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors but even excluding patients who died within three months changed the association only slightly The authors emphasize that only a clinical trial could prove a causal relationship but they suggest several possible reasons for the effect including the antiinflammatory properties of cholinesterase inhibitors Its very interesting that these drugs have such potentially beneficial effects said the lead author Dr Peter Nordstrom a professor of geriatrics at Umea University But I would not tell people to take these drugs to prevent heart attack This is only an association and we cannot recommend them to prevent cardiovascular disease
