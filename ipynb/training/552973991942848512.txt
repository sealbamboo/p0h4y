The journal Food and Chemical Toxicology is retracting a highly controversial French study it published last year linking genetically modified maize to cancerous tumors in rats In a statement released from its Cambridge Mass offices on Thursday publisher Elsevier said that upon closer review of the paper editors determined that the experimental sample was too small to allow for clear conclusions Also the type of rat involved in the experiment is known for high incidence of tumors it said Unequivocally the editorinchief found no evidence or fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data the   read However there is legitimate cause for concern regarding both the number of animals in each study group and the particular strain selected The paper entitled Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Rounduptolerant genetically modified maize was publised on Sept   It was quickly embraced by opponents of genetically altered foods and stoked debate over Californias failed Proposition  which sought to require labeling for genetically modified foods The research was led by GillesEric Seralini a professor at the University of Caen and founder of the nonprofit Committee for Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering On Friday study authors said they were standing by their findings They called the publishers criticisms unacceptable and accused the journal of exercising double standards The full statement can be read   The researchers had studied  SpragueDawley rats which were divided into groups and given different diets A number were fed Monsanto Cos Roundupresistant corn At the time the study appeared geneticists were quick to criticize its sampling size and other methodologies On Thursday Elsevier said that because of the controversy surrounding the studys findings the journals top editor made the rare request to review the authors raw data and that the researchers willingly complied The low number of animals had been identified as a cause for concern during the initial review process but the peer review decision ultimately weighed that the work still had merit despite this limitation the Elsevier statement sad A more indepth look at the raw data revealed that no definitive conclusions can be reached with this small sample size regarding the role of either NK or glyphosate in regards to overall mortality or tumor incidence Given the known high incidence of tumors in the SpragueDawley rat normal variability cannot be excluded as the cause of the higher mortality and incidence observed in the treated groups the statement read
