Walking fast or slow is wonderful exercise But now a firstofitskind study shows that to get the most health benefits from walking many of us need to pick up the pace The findings stem from a new analysis of the National Walkers Health Study a large database of information maintained at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory about thousands of middleage men and women who walk regularly for exercise Recruited beginning in  at walking events and from lists of subscribers to walkingrelated publications these volunteers filled out a lengthy survey about their typical walking distance and pace as well as their health history and habits As most of us would likely guess walking is the most popular physical activity in America But people who walk for exercise do so at wildly varying speeds and intensities Some stroll at a leisurely  miles per hour which is lowintensity exercise Others zip along at twice that pace or better resulting in a sweatier workout  Exercise guidelines generally suggest that for health purposes people should engage in  minutes of moderateintensity activity most days of the week For walkers a moderately intense pace would probably be about  or  minutes per mile It has generally been assumed that if people walk more slowly but expend the same total energy as brisk walkers  meaning that they spend more time walking  they should gain the same health benefits But few largescale studies have directly compared the impact of moderate and lightintensity walking especially in terms of longevity    To do so Paul T Williams a statistician at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gathered data about  male and  female participants from the walkers health study who represented almost every speed of fitness walker from sluggish to swift His findings were  Dr Williams divided participants into four numerically equal categories based on their normal pace Those in Category  the fleetest averaged less than  minutes per mile putting them on the cusp of jogging while those in Category  the slowest strolled at a relatively dilatory  minutes or more per mile The majority of the walkers in this group in fact required at least  minutes to complete a mile and many had a pace of  minutes or more per mile Interestingly on average female walkers were faster than men in all of the categories  Next Dr Williams crossreferenced his data against that in the essential if somewhat ghoulish National Death Index to determine which of the almost  walkers had died in the decade or so since they had joined the survey and from what It turned out that nearly  of the walkers had died More telling these deaths disproportionately were clustered among the slowest walkers Those in Category  were about  percent more likely to have died from any cause than those in the other three categories and were particularly vulnerable to deaths from heart disease and dementia  Unexpectedly the death rate remained high among the slowest walkers even if they met or exceeded the standard exercise guidelines and expended as much energy per day as someone walking briskly for  minutes This effect was most pronounced among the slowest of the slow walkers whose pace was  minutes per mile or higher They were  percent more likely to have died than walkers who moved faster even if they met the exercise guidelines One important inference of these statistics is that intensity matters if you are walking for health Our results do suggest that there is a significant health benefit to pursuing a faster pace Dr Williams said Pushing your body he said appears to cause favorable physiological changes that milder exercise doesnt replicate But there are nuances and caveats to that conclusion The slowest walkers may have harbored underlying health conditions that predisposed them to both a tentative walking pace and early death But that possibility underscores a subtle takeaway of the new study Dr Williams said Measuring your walking speed he pointed out could provide a barometer of your health status  So check yours your spouses or perhaps your parents pace The process is easy Simply find a meter track and using a stopwatch have everyone walk at his or her normal speed If a circuit of the track takes someone  minutes or more that persons pace is  minutes per mile or slower and he or she might consider consulting a doctor about possible health issues Dr Williams said  Then with medical clearance the slow walkers probably should try ramping up their speed gradually  The most encouraging news embedded in the new study is that longevity rises with small improvements in pace The walkers in Category  for instance moved at a speed only a minute or so faster per mile than some of those in the slowest group but they enjoyed a significant reduction in their risk of dying prematurely
