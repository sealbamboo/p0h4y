What it means to be a doctor in America is changing The Affordable Care Act is one reason But the federal health overhaul is just the latest factor among many that have affected the practice of medicine Just ask Drs Robert and Michael Sawyer a father and son in a family that has worked at Denver Health since the s Anesthesiologist Michael Sawyer  is a thirdgeneration physician He and his father Robert a surgeon head up to Michaels cramped office on the third floor   has never been known as a fancy place but its been there for people in need since its logcabin origins in  Michaels office has a wellworn futon where he sometimes crashes on long shifts The walls are decorated with photos of his fathers father noted surgeon Ken Sawyer who died in  Theres grandpa Michael says pointing to a blackandwhite photo of a doctor in a gown and surgical mask at work Here he is operating at CU University of Colorado Hospital a long long time ago if Im not mistaken Thats his doctor bag actually and theres his microscope over there in that box over there He and his father joke about how he uses his grandfathers desk much to the chagrin of the facilities managers at Denver Health who disapprove of unauthorized furniture Mike says he knew pretty early that he wanted to be a doctor I remember going to work with Dad when hed round and hed operate and Id sleep in the old surgery lounge he recalls It was this cool big leather couch in this cool little room with a huge picture of your grandpa on the wall because it was named after him and you just kind of go This is what Im supposed to do  Michael is the youngest of seven children and is the only one who became a doctor He says his father never pushed it as a career They both say becoming a doctor is about equal parts you choosing medicine and medicine choosing you You dont go into medicine just because your dads a doctor says Robert You go into medicine because it just seems right to you Its a fit Had I thought about going into banking Id have gone crazy Robert Sawyer is  years old and he still practices one day a week He also knew early on that he wanted to be a doctor When he was still a kid he watched his father the guy on the wall practice This was during the Depression he explains People didnt have much and it was like they were like part of his family Theyd bring him chickens and eggs and steaks and stuff like that rather than pay him And some of those people when he died kept coming to me Robert says the joy he gets from seeing patients has been the best part of his career But over the decades he has watched health care grow much more complicated and expensive When I started out there was only one insurance company and that was Blue Cross Blue Shield he says Most of the people you dealt with on a cash basis and you worked that out Then pretty soon here come the insurance companies Here comes Medicare and Medicaid and all of a sudden the bureaucracy is just overwhelming You have to ask about what youre going to do You have to go get permission to do what you think is right But it was really nice when you could just be able to be a doctor Robert says the bureaucracy frustrates doctors because it separates them from their patients As his son Michael was making his way through his training as a doctor bureaucracy and complexity only grew further reducing the time physicians spend practicing medicine Being a doctor now is more stressful for other reasons too The cost of medical school has skyrocketed Michael started his career with a sixfigure student loan debt that shocks his father Michael says he doesnt try to sugarcoat what it takes to become a doctor when he talks with the next generation of Sawyers Hes got a granddaughter I have a niece right now whos showing some interest and is academically very very bright says Michael But I have a real very real conversation with these people about it Youre going to spend a lot of money youre going to spend six or seven years of the next  years of your life sleeping in a hospital He questions his career choice far more than his father did Michaels wife is a physician too While they were still in residency working crazy hours for low pay under a ton of stress friends their age had already launched successful careers Boy we couldve done something else he says Would we have been as happy We dont know Would we be happier Who knows But when youre in the thick of it I think I dont know a doctor my age who doesnt secondguess it But Michael loves being a doctor He talks about seeing a teenage girl he took care of up and walking around again after she nearly died in a car accident He says knowing he helped save her life is immeasurably gratifying Ive always looked at it as  a higherlevel calling I think theres a couple jobs like that and they would be teachers and they would be clergy and they would doctors Michael says You know that what youre doing is absolutely good for the world and its a good feeling no matter how exhausted you are But the lifeanddeath nature of the work takes a toll he says I dont know how many days Ive gone home after some pretty tragic nights at this hospital and collapsed crying into my wifes arms because it was really sad what happened the night before he says And all you can do is like you know at least you were there trying to help His father gently chimes in I dont know if anybody could say it better than that It is a calling Stepping out of an elevator and through the hospitals glass doors into the cold but cheerful winter sunshine Michael and Robert walk to a small courtyard near the entrance where patients and their families can take a break from the noise inside Its paved with inscribed bricks which the hospital sells to raise money Michaels kids had a garage sale and he told them they had to donate half their earnings to charity His yearold son bought a brick It says Sawyer Family  Michael reads  Three generations of Denver General Denver Health Physicians We were trying to go a little bigger but the kids budget couldnt get much more than that he jokes They pause Its great Well see if we cant get it to four here going forward says Michael Thatd be nice says his father They dont take it for granted that there will be a physician in the fourth generation of the family They know exactly how demanding it is But they also know no matter how complex medicine becomes how enormous its bureaucracy grows and how expensive medical school gets kids are still going to want to be doctors when they grow up
