From cinnamon buns in the morning to a burger after a long run food never smells as good as when youre superhungry Now scientists have uncovered a clue as to why that might be  and it lies in the munchies and marijuana Receptors in the brains of mice that light up when the animals are high are also activated when the critters are fasting French scientists   Sunday in the journal   In other words skipping a meal triggered the same hungerinducing brain receptors that marijuana does And it works at least in mice by boosting the sense of smell neuroscientist   and his team at the Universite de Bordeaux report Thats because the receptors that get activated are located in the smelling center of the brain And sense of smell is known to be a key factor driving appetite In case youre wondering the mice didnt toke up The researchers injected the rodents with   the active ingredient in marijuana Of course mice arent men  especially when it comes to smelling The little rodents spend much more of their lives sniffing out yummy food than we do And they devote much more of their brain power to the activity But there are some hints that a similar mechanism may also be at work in people When you skip a meal or fast your brain creates compounds called    appropriate right  that look and act similarly to THC And not surprisingly these chemicals drive you to eat But hunger also makes you more sensitive to food aromas Marsicano and his team thought perhaps the two processes  that burning desire to eat ie munchies and enhanced smelling  were linked So he and his team went hunting for receptors in mouse brains that controlled both They hit the jackpot when they looked in the mices olfactory bulbs That part of the brain was packed with receptors that bind THC and ramp up the rodents appetite  both when theyd been fasting and when they were high These receptors also made the mice more sensitive to odors when their tummies were empty or their brains were stoned The data suggest that the major way marijuana triggers the munchies at least in mice is through olfaction Marsicano and his team write in the study As for humans Were a more complicated lot and theres more than just the sense of smell at play when we get the munchies from hunger or high For starters our cannabinoid receptors are located throughout our brains and in other parts of the body That said if the same mechanism does occur in humans the findings could help scientists develop weightloss or antiobesity drugs that target the cannabinoid receptors There has already been one such drug   approved for use in Europe But it was withdrawn from the market in  because of serious side effects
