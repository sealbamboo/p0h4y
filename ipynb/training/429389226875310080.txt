The home of Sean Morey bears the impressive signposts of his year career in the NFL a Vince Lombardi trophy for his Super Bowl championship with the Pittsburgh Steelers in  A hefty Super Bowl ring A framed photograph showing Morey in midair launching himself like a missile to block a punt With that play in  his Arizona Cardinals became the only team in NFL history to win a game in   But look in Moreys medicine cabinet and youll find other vestiges of his NFL career the bottles of pills that he takes to mitigate the effects of brain injury he sustained playing football Propranolol to help with debilitating headaches Lexapro an antidepressant to  as Morey puts it  lengthen my fuse Ritalin to help him focus Trazodone to help him sleep Morey suffers from postconcussion syndrome Hundreds of other NFL players have been diagnosed with far more serious conditions dementia ALS Parkinsons and severe cognitive decline On autopsy the brains of more than  players show clear signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE a progressive degenerative disease Morey hopes that by retiring from the NFL when he did in  hes avoided that fate By the end of his career Morey was considered one of the best special teams players in the league Special teams players sprint down the field to block and tackle on kickoffs and punts Because of the speed and the explosive collisions that result the kickoff return has been considered one of the most dangerous plays in football Morey was small for the NFL  just  feet  inches and  pounds But he was fast and relentless He was whats called a wedge breaker I basically hit and blocked everything I could as hard as I could he tells me Anything that moved And over his career he suffered dozens of concussions Somewhere in the high s You know I was pretty reluctant to admit how many Id had he says But he does remember them in photographic detail for example one concussion that knocked him unconscious in  I was asleep he recalls You feel like youre waking up from a dream But you see the grass you hear the noise and you realize Oh Im in a football game So you get up and I start walking but Im walking sideways Another time he stumbled off the field to the opposing teams bench In his final season in  he had four concussions in just one game he says Every time I hit somebody it was like getting tasered he says That was when doctors told him it was time to hang up his helmet They said Theres a chance youll never get over these headaches  Morey says  Youve been symptomatic for too long and I just cant with a clear conscience let you play football anymore Youve gotta retire  When I sat down to talk with Morey and his wife Cara at the home they share with their three young daughters in Princeton NJ they told me about the symptoms that Sean has shown over the past four years Hell get crushing migraine headaches that knock him out of commission for days at a time Hell launch into bouts of explosive rage shouting at his family He has trouble focusing forgets things and loses his train of thought Sean says theres no question these symptoms are related to brain trauma sustained playing football You cannot have that kind of pain and have it not be related to brain damage he says The dysfunction the pain the misery the confusion the desperation the depression  There were instances in my life that would never have existed had I not damaged my brain Cara Morey has watched her husband turn into someone she doesnt recognize He gets a look in his eyes that youre pretty sure youve never met this person before  Its very scary Its a type of rage that I had never seen and I dont think anyone should ever see and I dont think my girls should ever have seen it Theres years of my life but more importantly theres years of my daughters life that I wish I could rescript says Sean Cara admits that she may be in denial about the extent of her husbands injuries and whether he might get progressively worse I dont want to ask myself that question because Im scared of what the answer would be she says Morey is among dozens of retired NFL players who have agreed to donate their brains for medical research when they die He hopes his brain might provide some answers For now he accepts that the damage he sustained is permanent He doesnt think its getting worse so he tries to adapt He writes a lot of reminder notes sets alerts on his phone stays on top of his meds And he has devoted himself obsessively to learning about concussions and helping other players who are suffering He was founder of the NFL Players Associations committee on traumatic brain injury Now hes an independent advocate for players health Morey is constantly on the phone with other retired NFL players trying to persuade them to join him in intervening in the  million concussion settlement thats now being reviewed by US District Judge Anita Brody The deal was reached between the NFL and thousands of retired players But Morey is concerned that a lot of players are left out players who may not have the most serious conditions such as Parkinsons or ALS but who are still suffering the consequences of brain injury in the NFL This Sunday Sean Morey will tune in to watch the Super Bowl from home Hes hoping for a tough physical exciting game But hell be watching with a very critical eye Every time someone gets concussed Ill rewind it he tells me Im looking at did they even evaluate him Did anybody look at him Did they shrug it off Whats the report back Well theyre saying Oh he got shaken up on the field They wont use the word concussion Im like an educated informed spectator Ill watch it more closely
