
 Every so often I like to do a small roundup of glutenfree pasta products to see if there is anything new and noteworthy on the market This week was a good time to do it as Im in New York staying with my sister Melodie who is glutenintolerant Melodie used to eat a lot of rice pasta until she became concerned with reports about arsenic in rice It is cold in New York and  we are mourning the death of our yearold mother and this calls for comfort food So I went shopping for glutenfree pasta that was not made primarily with rice flour and put my purchases to good use Those purchases by the way were not cheap The best price I could get at Whole Foods for one of the brands I liked the most Andean Dream Quinoa Spaghetti when you look closely at the ingredients youll see that it is made from a mix of quinoa and brown rice was  for an ounce package Another brand I liked truRoots Ancient Grain Spaghetti made from quinoa amaranth and brown rice was  for an ounce package  I saw the same products at other shops for as much as  I can get regular spaghetti for  to  a pound  So if you are on a budget the glutenfree pastas I worked with this week will be splurges I also tried cornmeal fettucine made by Le Veneziane  for  ounces  and thought it was quite good Brownrice penne rigate by Delallo was also good but I found the texture more brittle and stodgy than the other varieties I think the shape is an important element here Spaghetti had the best al dente texture of all the shapes followed by fettucine   Creamy ricotta and Brussels sprouts add color and texture to this dish  Cauliflower is often matched with pasta in Italy this version is all about texture  The walnuts add texture and flavor to this pasta dish  A simple dish that is sweet with tarragon and a breeze to make  A robust winter pasta with a spicy kick
