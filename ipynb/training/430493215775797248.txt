WASHINGTON  A kinder gentler approach to one of the most dreaded exams in medicine is on the way US regulators have cleared a bitesize camera to help screen patients who have trouble with colonoscopies The ingestible pill camera from Given Imaging is designed to help doctors spot polyps and other early signs of colon cancer The Food and Drug Administration cleared the device for patients who have had trouble with the cringeinducing colonoscopy procedure which involves probing the large intestine with a tiny camera embedded in a fourfoot long flexible tube  The Israeli companys technology developed from missile defense systems uses a batterypowered camera to take highspeed photos as it slowly winds its way through the intestinal tract over eight hours The images are transmitted to a recording device worn around the patients waist and later reviewed by a doctor  While Givens wireless imagebeaming system may sound like science fiction its actually more than a decade old In  the company received FDA approval for a similar device used to get a closeup view of the small intestine  At that time analysts expected Givens approach to grow into a direct competitor to traditional colonoscopy But company studies found that images taken by the minicamera were not quite as clear as those from the inoffice procedure As a result the company has pursued a more limited market for its device patients who have trouble undergoing standard colonoscopies  The FDA on Monday cleared the companys PillCam Colon for patients who have experienced an incomplete colonoscopy Given estimates  US patients are not able to complete the procedure each year due to anatomy issues previous surgery or various colon diseases  Even with this limited indication analysts estimate the new pillcam could grow to sales of over  million in North America by  with room for expansion as the technology improves MorningStar analyst Debbie Wang said the company has shrewdly positioned the device as another tool in the gastrointestinal specialists kit rather than a direct competitor  Givens management understands that the traditional colonoscopy is the gastroenterologists bread and butter right now Wang said So they didnt want to do anything that would position this as a substitute  Wang notes that Givens PillCam costs  significantly less than the roughly  rate for colonoscopy Eventually she thinks doctors may use the device to attract adults who avoid regular screenings due to fears of pain embarrassment and general discomfort The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions guidelines currently recommend regular colonoscopies beginning at age  and continuing through age  though most US adults dont follow the recommendations  In December Irish medical device firm Covidien said it would buy Given for about  million Given Imaging headquartered in Yoqneam Israel markets seven lines of medical devices and surgical supplies including pillcams to screen the esophagus and small intestine  Pillcam Colon was previously approved in  other countries including in Japan Europe and Latin AmericaÂ
