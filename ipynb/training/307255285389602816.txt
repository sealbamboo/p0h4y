Theres great enthusiasm among some global health leaders about a bold  some say radical  strategy to prevent pregnant women from transmitting HIV to their newborns But skeptics worry that the approach dubbed   will pit pregnant women with HIV against others infected with the virus diverting resources from the broader struggle against the pandemic The goal of Option B is to make serious inroads in reducing a stubborn and heartbreaking problem Every year about  babies in subSaharan Africa are born with HIV The new strategy aims to put every pregnant woman with HIV on tripledrug treatment and keep her on it for the rest of her life  even if the virus has not yet damaged her immune system to the point where she needs medications to preserve her own health Universal treatment of HIVpositive pregnant women avoids the need to do expensive and often hardtoaccess testing of a womans level of   to determine if shes sick enough to need longterm antiretroviral drugs The name Option B distinguishes the strategy from two earlier approaches called A and B which have failed so far to eliminate mothertochild transmission of HIV in mostaffected countries Those other options either reserve tripledrug treatment for pregnant women with severely compromised immune systems or provide it only temporarily around the time of childbirth to those whose immunity is still relatively robust A report   Thursday by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that when   a small country in southeast Africa made a big push to implement Option B the payoff was impressive a sevenfold increase in the number of pregnant and breastfeeding women starting antiHIV treatment in only a year I think this is actually a big deal CDC director   tells Shots He says the results not only demonstrate that its possible to implement Option B across an entire country but that it makes a huge difference The data are really remarkable In the space of about a year Malawi trained  health care workers to give Option B It doubled clinics offering tripledrug treatment and went from having less than  pregnant women on HIV treatment to nearly  Frieden estimates Option B prevented  infants from getting HIV from their mothers in its first year of operation I think Option B is absolutely crucial Frieden says because it gets to people who account for  percent of new HIV infections  women of childbearing age He predicts Option B will have ripple effects that benefit families and communities by sharply reducing transmission of HIV from women to their uninfected partners But not everyone is convinced Among them is   a leading South African HIV specialist who chaired the International AIDS Conference in  which helped focus the worlds attention on the pandemics staggering toll in Africa Coovadia tells Shots that he had a gut reaction against Option B last July because of the way it was presented at the International AIDS Conference in Washington DC It looked like everyone had been tutored to say this was a great thing he says Hillary Clinton mentioned it in her   Almost everyone spoke about B as though it was going to change the direction of the AIDS epidemic But it didnt look to me that there had been adequate consultation This was a pet program of the US government After the Washington conference Coovadia says he and his colleagues debated the strategy back in South Africa Recently he coauthored a sharply worded   in   calling Option B extreme The strong push for countries to switch to B is premature they write A switch now would be dangerous ignoring severe ethical safety feasibility and economic concerns The CDCs report on Option B in Malawi this week is not a convincing argument that B is worth all the potential problems Coovadia says South Africa he says has been able to lower the rate of mothertochild HIV transmission from  percent to less than  percent by treating pregnant women with simpler cheaper regimens and reserving tripledrug treatment for those who need it One big concern is that Option B will create tensions in households and communities when it becomes known that pregnant women with HIV are preferentially getting tripledrug therapy whatever their immune status while other infected people with deteriorating health may not South Africais already a fractious community Coovadia says If it got out that of two women with the same CD count one was treated and the other was not the scope for tensions would be great Friedens response to that Why should being pregnant get you to the front of the line The answer to that I think is first that its more likely to get the baby protected  It also saves the lives of the mother the child the family and it stops the spread of HIV And the critics Frankly I think theyre mistaken Frieden says Coovadia calls for more study of Option B before implementing it aggressively More data will be forthcoming Rwanda and Haiti have already adopted the strategy and seven other subSaharan countries are actively implementing it or preparing to
