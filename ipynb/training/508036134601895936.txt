When the heat is on you might lose your motivation to hit the gym But the typically warm days of Southern Californias late summer offer a perfect excuse to take your workout into the pool where its nice and cool Youll still work up a sweat said John Platero director of education for the National Council for Certified Personal Trainers but youll hardly notice Platero created this combo with desk jockeys in mind Sitting in front of the computer  is not a great position for your posture These four easy moves counteract all the sitting Ideally these moves are done in water thats chestdeep Please keep safety in mind Youre likely to get winded so you might want to be near the edge of the pool where you can easily rest and catch your breath These four circuit moves  the sun squat touchdown split jacks and the jackknife  work the entire body while helping you stretch out hips that are most likely overly tight and shortened from lots of sitting  Stand with feet shoulder distance apart hands reaching for the sky Squat  this will likely take you under water so be ready to hold your breath  and then thrust your hips out when you return to standing position The buoyancy will help you get a great stretch at the top of the move  Stand with feet shoulder distance apart hands reaching for the sky Hop into a lunging position and then return to standing Alternate legs The buoyancy will help you drop deeper into the squat than youd likely be able to do on land  Just like jumping jacks but youll get more of an inner thigh and ab workout due to the resistance provided by the water  Take a break to catch your breath if needed before performing this underwater move and then pause as needed during repetitions Were not after speed were after form and resistance The move begins by lying facedown in the water hands straight out ahead Use your core muscles to swing your hands and feet toward each other and then return to the starting position and gently hyperextending your back and hips for a great stretch This is a challenging move and dont expect your feet and hands to actually meet Expect to get winded fast Perform these four moves in a circuit with five to  repetitions for each move You may not be able to perform as many jackknifes and thats fine Repeat the circuit three to five times Add more repetitions as you become more comfortable with the moves
