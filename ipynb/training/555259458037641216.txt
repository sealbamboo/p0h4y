The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has opened its first Ebola treatment centre specialising in care for infected pregnant women  MSF says the death rate for expectant mothers is extremely high and health workers treating them particularly during childbirth or miscarriage are especially vulnerable to catching the virus  The BBCs Tulip Mazumdar has been given access to the facility in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown Building work is still continuing at the maternity section of the latest MSF Ebola clinic on the outskirts of the capital  Its been erected at the site of one of the citys most prestigious secondary schools Methodist Boys High School in Kissy  The classrooms are empty  schools have been closed for months The playing area is now home to MSFs sixth treatment centre in Sierra Leone When it is fully operational it will have  beds and a special focus on treating pregnant women suspected or confirmed to have Ebola  Across town at another former school turned MSF Ebola clinic yearold Lumatu Samura cradles her eightmonthold niece Mamusu Shes sitting behind an orange plastic partition which separates the sick from the strong Lumatu has very recently recovered from Ebola but she has chosen to stay at the centre to look after little Mamusu who is extremely sick  Lumatu may not realise it but she is a very special Ebola survivor Not only does she now have some immunity to the virus which is why she can safely look after Mamusu but she is also one of only a handful of people in the world known to have recovered from Ebola while being pregnant  Speaking from inside the Ebola zone about m ft in front of me Lumatu who lost her own baby early in her pregnancy explained what happened to her  I had a cold at home and my joints were aching  she said My father knew he couldnt keep me at home So he sent me here to the treatment centre  I was bleeding for two hours Noone would touch me After the bleeding I was put on a drip I started to feel much better Now I am recovered  But I need to stay and look after my sisters baby Six pregnant women have been admitted to the MSF Prince of Wales Treatment Centre since it opened on  December Only Lumatu has made a full recovery Dr Greg McAnulty one of the doctors whos been treating her said Unfortunately pregnant women are very at risk of dying from Ebola and complications related to Ebola  The reasons seem to be related to delivery or the foetus dying earlier in the pregnancy The prognosis for the foetus is terrible and there seems to be a concentration of the virus in them So even when babies have been born alive they tend not to survive Its an awful awful situation You have a woman who is at high risk of dying herself and a baby who invariably dies as well Back at the new Ebola treatment centre focusing on pregnant women so far only one expectant mother has been admitted A key reason for the need for a specialist unit is the risk the women can pose to the health workers treating them  Delivering babies is particularly dangerous Experts say the viral load of Ebola in both the placenta and the foetus as well as the surrounding fluids is extremely high  even if the woman herself has recovered  Dr Benjamin Black an obstetric doctor on sabbatical to MSF researching how best to treat Ebolaaffected pregnant women said very little was known about Ebola and pregnancy  The Ebola virus is attracted to certain types of cells within the body The placenta happens to have a lot of those cells and invades those cells so it can multiply because of that you get a high amount of Ebola virus in the placenta and therefore crossing to the baby The field coordinator overseeing the running of the clinic Luis Encinas said Our focus is to protect the health staff and then to save the mother and  if its possible  to save the child Even if the pregnant woman is cured the delivery moment is such a high contamination moment we need to take care  during the delivery  of the health staff as well He said health staff had extra protection in addition to the personal protective equipment used by employees treating other Ebola patients Not only do we have gloves and goggles we have the full equipment and sometimes we have extra equipment like an incubator where you put your hands in the gloves attached to the screen and you have like a window of protection so you can do the delivery without being exposed to some liquid by accident There is still very little known about exactly why the death rate for pregnant women is so high But its hoped this new treatment centre will help give at least some women their best chance of surviving  Dr Black said Before this epidemic we were working on an understanding that maternal mortality would be around  but that was based on very small studies from previous outbreaks From our experience so far with MSF we probably have more women surviving then that For the baby theres not a huge amount we can do He said that so far from all previous epidemics including this outbreak there had been no recorded cases of babies being born and surviving if their mother had had Ebola But thats not to say it cant happen it just means it hasnt happened yet  The World Health Organization said there was early hope that more pregnant women would survive in this outbreak
