New viruses are a dime a dozen Every few months we hear about a newly discovered   thats jumped from birds to people somewhere in the world And the number of viruses identified in bats is extraordinary and appears to increase almost daily scientists   last year in the journal   But a virus that has been quietly hiding inside millions of people on three continents  and never been noticed before That doesnt come along often Scientists at San Diego State University have discovered what may be the most common and abundant virus in the human gut And yet the tiny critter called crAssphage oh yes theres a story behind that name has eluded researchers radar for decades Heres the cool part The virus doesnt just hang out in our intestines naked and alone scientists   Thursday in the journal   Instead the virus takes up residence inside gut bacteria  specifically inside   a group of microbes that have been linked to obesity and diabetes So the system is almost like a Russian nesting doll The virus lives inside the bacterium which lives inside our gut The new virus doesnt make us sick but it may be involved in controlling weight through its effect on  We suspect this virus is very important in regulating the number of these bacteria the   in the intestine says computational biologist   who led the study Edwards and his colleagues found the virus in fecal samples from people across the US Europe Korea and Japan But we think the virus is likely found worldwide he tells Goats and Soda Weve basically found it in every population weve looked at If we tested Africans we think wed find it in them too Scientists are just starting to learn about all the organisms that live in and on the human body Collectively theyre called the human   And theres no question theyre important for our health So far most studies have focused on the guts bacteria  not other microbes there These bacteria are known to help regulate everything from our weight and immunity to heart health and   One study even found that changes in gut bacteria   malnutrition in young children in Malawi But during all this discussion of microbiomes there have been billions of tiny elephants in the room viruses Some scientists estimate that there are a hundred times more virus particles than human cells in the human body and  times more viruses than bacteria But no one ever talks about viruses Why Because they are extremely difficult to study The number of viruses known to infect people is remarkably small And the number known to hang out in our bodies for a long time is even smaller For instance there are herpes viruses which cause painful recurring blisters Adenoviruses can set up recurring respiratory infections in people and papillomavirus causes   And hepatitis viruses and HIV can silently hide in the body for years Beyond these common pathogens however the list quickly peters out although DNA surveys suggest that humans have thousands of viral species in and on us Most of them likely coexist within our gut in peace and harmony To start putting a name and function to some of these quieter organisms Edwards and his colleagues dug deep into sequencing data from the   They noticed that a few genes from the same virus kept popping up over and over again So they painstakingly stitched together the viruss genome inside the computer Then the team used that genetic code to search for the virus in fecal samples from people in Europe Korea and Japan To their surprise the virus was strikingly common It occurred in  percent of the  samples they analyzed And the virus was abundant About a quarter of the viral genes in the samples belong to crAssphage Given the viruss abundance and how widespread it is it is probably going to be very important for understanding the ecology of the human gut says microbiologist   of the University of California Davis And it likely infects a group of organisms the   thought to be really important for health Eisen who wasnt involved with the study calls the new virus really cool and worth learning more about But he says its too soon to say if its truly a global virus The samples searched so far have reasonable diversity  theyre not just from white men in New England Eisen says But we havent sampled all of human diversity We desperately need an organized systematic effort to gather information about viruses Eisen says He proposes something like the Human Microbiome Project but for viruses that directly infect humans and viruses that infect the bacteria of the human microbiome That point brings us back to the new viruss strange name crAssphage The phage part Edwards says comes from the name of viruses that infect bacteria  the socalled   And the first part crAss comes from the computational tool that the scientists used to find the virus   But we couldnt help but notice the name also brings to mind where the scientists found the virus Oh no we never thought of that Edwards says with a chuckle We would never be crass
