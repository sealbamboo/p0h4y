Heres a sobering thought Wild birds  including city pigeons and ubiquitous Canada geese  carry  different types of bird flu You know all those viruses with the Hs and Ns in their names like HN and HN Only a dozen of these viruses have infected humans so far but many of those have been deadly and three of them have caused global flu pandemics Does every bird flu that leaps into people have the potential to turn into the next big one that spreads rapidly around the world Thats the critical but currently answerable question writes   who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases He and his colleagues took a look at the genetic sequences of past flu pandemics to learn how a virus goes from infecting only chickens or pigeons to sickening millions of people globally They   their thoughts on the topic Wednesday in the  Take for instance the   Doctors in China identified the first human infections of HN this March Since then the virus has    people and killed  Although HN doesnt transmit easily between people some scientists have worried that it could gain that ability The virus has several mutations in its genes that help it invade and live in human cells Fauci and his colleagues write These mutations are also found in flus that have caused pandemics leading some scientists to predict that HN is evolving into a global threat But Fauci and his colleagues say thats not the way other flu pandemics came about Those viruses didnt just pick up single mutations here and there slowly increasing their abilities to hop between people Instead the three flu pandemics since  have all evolved from the socalled Mother of All Pandemics   which killed  million to  million people back in  And in each instance the virus underwent large sweeping genetic changes to create the contagion that swept across continents Given how little scientists known about what it takes for viruses to adapt and spread in new hosts Fauci and his colleagues say these historical precedents are only slightly reassuring for HN Every pandemic emergence seems to be a law unto itself the scientists write We cannot know whether or under what circumstances the highly unusual HN virus might be able to become pandemic  HNs journey has just begun
