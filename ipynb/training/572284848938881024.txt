In a grim assessment of the Ebola epidemic researchers say the deadly virus threatens to become endemic to West Africa instead of eventually disappearing from humans The current epidemiologic outlook is bleak wrote a panel of more than  World Health Organization experts in a study published Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine We must therefore face the possibility that Ebola virus disease will become endemic among the human population of West Africa a prospect that has never previously been contemplated In the absence of new control measures the authors estimated that the total case load would exceed  by Nov  The numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months the authors wrote As of Monday the United Nations health organization reported that out of a total of  confirmed and probable cases  deaths have resulted The true numbers of cases and deaths are certainly higher the authors wrote There are numerous reports of symptomatic persons evading diagnosis and treatment of laboratory diagnoses that have not been included in national databases and of persons with suspected Ebola virus disease who were buried without a diagnosis having been made When a virus is slow to mutate as Ebola appears to be the pathogen steadily wanes as the number of people who have developed immunity increases With proper controls experts say the virus would find it increasingly difficult to spread among the population until it eventually disappeared from humans and survived only in its socalled animal reservoir which is believed to be a fruit bat In this case however epidemiologists fear that the virus could continue to linger in small pockets extending its life in humans and potentially mutating in a way that makes fighting it more difficult In an accompanying editorial Dr Jeremy Farrar director of the Wellcome Trust and Dr Peter Piot director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the epidemic has helped to degrade an already meager system of healthcare This disintegration would have broad consequences and only worsen as the epidemic progresses they wrote West Africa will see much more suffering and many more deaths during childbirth and from malaria tuberculosis HIVAIDS enteric and respiratory illnesses diabetes cancer cardiovascular disease and mental health during and after the Ebola epidemic Farrar and Piot also warned that here was a very real danger of a complete breakdown in civic society In the WHO paper researchers presented their first full statistical snapshot of the epidemic which gained a foothold in December of last year and has fallen hardest on Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone The majority of patients stricken by Ebola are  to  years old with men and women suffering at a nearly equal rates according to researchers The case fatality rate  based on confirmed cases only  is  with a slightly lower chance of death    for those admitted to a hospital Although the epidemic has already killed more people than all previous outbreaks combined researchers said the virus now wreaking havoc on some of the worlds poorest nations is no more lethal or virulent than other strains Instead its rapid spread is due to insufficient control efforts and a large intermixing population that has transported the virus across borders and between rural and urban areas In order to stop the epidemic researchers say the rate of transmission would have to be cut in half This would be equivalent to vaccinating  of the population Several experimental vaccines are under development and  if they prove to be effective  wont be available in large quantities for months Study authors made the following observations on the effects of the outbreak The risk of continued epidemic expansion and the prospect of endemic EVD in West Africa call for the most forceful implementation of present control measures and the rapid development and deployment of new drugs and vaccines the authors concluded
