People with severe dementia are still not getting acceptable care from the NHS in Scotland according to a mental health watchdog  The Mental Welfare Commission says there are still huge variations in care levels across the country The report says that while progress has been made too many units still fail to meet acceptable standards  However the Scottish government said its policies had given Scotland a worldleading level of dementia care  About  people in Scotland have dementia a third of whom are in care homes     The Mental Welfare Commission first examined the care of people in dementia units in  when it found that some people were being kept in wards  hours a day for years on end It also found that no social or recreational activities were available in more than half of wards The watchdog has published a new report following visits to  units which provide specialist care for people with complex and severe dementia It examined the care provided to  people and talked to  carers and relatives The report said whilst some progress has been made the care and the environment in too many units still fail to meet acceptable standards   The organisations Dr Gary Morrison told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme Basically we found that there was too little pleasurable or purposeful activity going on There was too little personcentred care there was too little access to the outside world to fresh air and there was too much medication The number of units having access to outside space has risen from around half to  but the commission says only  of these were safe attractive and wellmaintained   In two units the only light into communal areas was via skylights or high windows meaning people spent the majority of their day with no way of seeing the world outside Seven units were described as institutional bare and stark Inspectors also expressed concerns about excessive use of medication A total of  of residents were taking antipsychotics the majority of which were unlicensed for use in dementia and which could have significant side effects    Meanwhile there was often little effort to avoid medication to sedate people One in ten residents had no care plan  which contains essential information on the triggers for stress or distress   One person had been prescribed seven psychotropic drugs but there was no behavioural care plan in place because staff thought it was not needed   A quarter of patients care plans appeared to be generic or to have been cut and pasted from one patient to the next One referred to communication with a spouse who had been dead for  years In one unit the same care plan was typed out in every file However relatives appeared to be content with the care on offer with  saying they were satisfied with the care provided and all of them said their relative was treated with care and respect The Mental Welfare Commission has recommended that the Scottish government set out how it is going to deliver on commitments contained in its National Dementia Strategy which was first published in    It also says the NHS needs to consistently apply a wealth of knowledge about the importance of a pleasant environment and provide a range of activities to create meaningful days The watchdog also says that mediation should be a last resort not the first Alzheimer Scotland said it was deeply disappointed by the extent of the problems highlighted in the report The charity said failing to follow the proper procedures for prescribing drugs was unlawful as well as a potential breach of human rights and must cease now The Scottish government responded to the reports findings by saying that it has raised levels of investment for dementia carers and that the country benefitted from a worldleading approach to dementia care  Figures from the government showed that it had invested another  in education and frontline caring staff along with an extra  pledged for Alzheimers Scotland nurses over the next three years  Scotland currently has a  higher level of dementia diagnosis than England and Wales figures from  found The government also stated that this extra spending was in addition to a m joint investment for Alzheimers Scotland nurses over the past three years  Health Secretary Alex Neil told Good Morning Scotland that the Scottish government would implement the recommendations in the report and monitor progress closely He added Weve got the highest rate of diagnosis in the whole of the UK so there are many aspects of the strategy where weve had real success But clearly theres a lot to be done in terms of hospitals and the private residential care homes where these visits took place I dont want a future health minister in five or six years time to have to read another report like this  This additional investment was welcome by Henry Simmons chief executive of Alzheimer Scotland He said We are delighted by this substantial and significant further investment in both the Dementia Champions and the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Nurses  Scotland is leading the way in developing innovative educational frameworks and improvement methodologies
