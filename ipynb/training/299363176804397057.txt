When we lived in Athens we had a dear family friend who had known me and my sister since we were little girls He lived in Thessaloniki the cosmopolitan capital of northern Greece where my mother was from He was a classically warm exuberant generous Greek man the kind we wish we could import more of into the US Whenever he came to Athens he would visit us and we all looked forward to his visits which usually included bringing our favorite Greek sweets  baklava melomakarona cookies and tsoureki the traditional sweet braided bread This man was a very successful contractor married to a very difficult demanding woman who always seemed to be complaining about something One time he came to visit us after we hadnt seen him in some time When he arrived at our apartment he seemed out of breath after climbing the stairs to our door It was clear that he was stressed and overworked he looked run down and he had put on weight But when we sat down to dinner he told us how well things were going in his life He was thrilled about a new contract he had just won to build a new museum in Thessaloniki My mother listened for a little while without comment Then she said to him I dont care how well your business is doing  youre not taking care of   Youre smoking youre eating fatty foods youre staying up late and getting up early  youre going to end up with a heart attack She went on Your business might have a great bottom line but   are your own most important capital Banking involves both withdrawing and depositing There are only so many withdrawals you can make from your bank account and you just keep on withdrawing You could go bankrupt if you dont make some deposits soon Im fine Elli he said laughing Ive just been under a lot of pressure But to my mother this was no laughing matter and she got right up from the table and made a call to her own doctor My mother made an appointment for our friend to see her cardiologist the following day right there in Athens To his surprise though not to hers they found that he had blocked arteries and needed to be admitted to the hospital right away for an   My mother had more than likely saved his life A few years later when the museum was finished my mother got a package in the mail It was the catalog of the museums first exhibition inscribed   Take care of your capital thats what my mother would say anytime she saw us being pulled in too many directions depleted by inner and outer demands It was her favorite phrase when she needed to remind us to take care of ourselves she meant that the smartest investment you could make was investing in your self That profound metaphor still echoes in me now How we conserve spend or invest our energy on a daily and even a momenttomoment basis defines our lives We have a responsibility to be good custodians of our gifts What does it really mean to take care of ourselves How do we find where our energy is leaking Where do we start  My mother was very big on sleep Sleep was sacred to her If somebody was sleeping there was nothing in the world that would make her interrupt that sleep To her it was a big investment in capital You would reap the profits when you were awake Whenever one of us came to her with a problem that needed solving small or big she wouldnt feel pressure to come up with an instant answer she would simply say Let it marinate overnight She regarded sleep as a way that our consciousness worked out stress and found solutions to problems in our waking life  Food was another important investment in my mothers portfolio When we were young girls in Athens there were long delicious meals after school when we sat at the kitchen table and talked over the day It was a time for us to unwind and reconnect over stuffed cabbage leaves feta cheese and tsoureki My mother abhorred the whole notion of fast food so prevalent in America to her there should be nothing fast about food When she saw people gobbling their food or eating on the run she would say Youre eating mechanically She always reminded us that eating is meant to be a ritual a way of communing with others and nurturing the body and soul If she were alive today she would regard as sacrilege the practice of keeping a BlackBerry on the table and checking emails or texting throughout a meal And then there was time out for your body and soul my mother brought yoga and meditation into our lives from the time we were teenagers to help us learn to breathe relax and understand the value of centering ourselves Of course when you are  the thought of cultivating stillness is not exactly your idea of a good time but my agile body took very easily to doing headstands  My mother knew that they can pay dividends or they can put you in the red She knew how to distinguish between the givers and the takers and those who were impoverished at heart She taught us how true friendships recharge us and renew us She knew that energy follows thoughts  some thoughts bring us down others lift us up Good friends know us well enough to catch us when our thoughts are spiraling downward and they help us reflect our better nature Its so easy to close ourselves off in the world in order to protect ourselves My friendships are a big part of keeping my heart open giving me a safe place where I can be vulnerable There at our own little kitchen table as we listened to each others stories of the day I learned the sacredness of a safe place For years my mother and my sister and I were like riverbanks for each other providing a protected channel to flow into the world Sometimes its easier to be generous with others than with ourselves  but being kind and compassionate with ourselves always gives a great return on our investment Life can be so much more purposeful when we make ourselves a priority This is not to be confused with selfindulgence so many of our difficulties arise because we dont think enough of ourselves to take care of ourselves first Theres a wonderful quote that I love  Treat yourself as if you were someone inexpressibly dear to you Why would we expect others to treat us better than we treat ourselves  Unbinding the Heart
