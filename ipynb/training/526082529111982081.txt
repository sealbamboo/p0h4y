My day starts when the alarm goes off around am  I stumble down for a quick breakfast  normally a smoothie laced with coffee Once awake I get dressed and head out the door I have two options for the commute either the car or train if the weather is ok I try and take the train  its a nice walk to the station and gives me time in the morning to wake up and catch up on a physio podcast I arrive at work and begin to open up shop including checking the answerphone for cancellations or urgent new appointments I generally arrive around am for my first patient at am the rest of the department gets in slightly later The typical morning starts with getting my list of patients up on the computer and checking their notes  especially if I have someone I havent seen in a while or a new referral I see each patient for  minutes and also have to try and fit in typing up notes writing letters to GPs or consultants and also reviewing all new referrals At pm I normally head for the staff room for a packed lunch Occasionally I will end up eating at my desk while catching up with paperwork I have wanted to be a physiotherapist ever since I suffered with several rugby injuries at school I would regularly speak with physiotherapists and they always seemed to enjoy their job I always liked the idea of helping people following school I went straight to university and after three years I got my BScHons It took a little while and plenty of bar work to get my first   job but since then I havent looked back I have moved on from rotations changing specialty every few months for a taster of the different careers to becoming a specialised musculoskeletal physiotherapist in outpatients I plan to continue working in this area I love the NHS but as rules become stricter and we have tighter budgets and less time with patients I may end up having to split my time between clinical work and another area such as teaching The biggest challenge facing my department but also the NHS as a whole is the lack of money I work in a small team and because of this the number of patients seen drops dramatically with sickness or leave  meaning the waiting time goes up We are looking into ways to reducing the wait this may mean more classes where I can see three times as many patients in an hour My afternoon generally continues on from where the morning left off more patients phonecalls and letters On average I tend to see four or five new patients a day on top of that I see up to  followup patients I eventually finish by pm and make my way home Before leaving I make sure any unread messages on the answerphone have been dealt with if urgent and close up shop I find that for me the best way to relax and unwind is to exercise I have taken up running and am currently training for my first k race I also enjoy walks in the local area catching up with friends and the escapism of reading good fiction I am very lucky that I can turn off the work button when I head for bed what really helps is a good book and some calm music Though if I know I will be particularly busy or have a difficult patient the following day it can be hard to relax
