The parents of the first British person to contract Ebola during the outbreak in West Africa say he is recovering well William Pooley  has spent the last week in a special isolation unit at Royal Free Hospital in London His parents Robin and Jackie say they knew he was improving when he ordered a bacon butty and praised the world class care at the hospital More than  people have died since the outbreak started in Guinea  Mr Pooley was volunteering as a nurse in Sierra Leone when he was infected  But he did not tell his parents until it was confirmed that he was going to be flown home  His mother Jackie said We were at our nieces wedding and he phoned we were out in the grounds and the photos were being taken We assumed hed phoned to wish his cousin every happiness  The phone was passed around family members but his father Robin thought William was sounding flat and that there was something wrong  He said So fairly soon I rang him back and he told me At which point the first thing in mind is We cant spoil the day He told his wife later and they made an early exit from the wedding  Mrs Pooley described it as a very stressful and anxious time when all the worst case scenarios were running through her mind  Initially the family were worried that Mr Pooley would not make it to the plane as he had to travel  miles through countless checkpoints to the airport in the capital of Sierra Leone Freetown She told the BBC It wasnt until the plane had taken off that we breathed a very very small sigh of relief we knew he was on his way home He was flown back to the UK on an RAF plane on Sunday  August and taken to the Royal Free Hospital He is still being kept in an isolation unit  His family can talk to him through a telephone link and see him indistinctly through the layers of glass and the polythene designed to stop the deadly disease spreading  Doctors have treated him with the experimental drug ZMapp Robin Pooley said Hes a lot better than we thought he might have been weve only got what the medics tell us but hes got a little step in there which the physio gave him so he can rebuild his strength that in itself is a good enough sign I think but he seems to be pretty well actually And his appetites back it came back with a bacon butty one morning for breakfast  The disease is largely contained to Guinea Liberia Nigeria and Sierra Leone where there have been  cases and  deaths The World Health Organization has warned as many as  people could be infected before the outbreak is over Hes very aware of what he left behind said Mrs Pooley Were very glad hes here because the care is second to none  The family said they were feeling much happier now than we did in a week ago and in the longterm hope he will make a full recovery But for now they just want him home We should be delighted when that day comes
