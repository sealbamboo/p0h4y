Most health policy meetings are a dull gray snooze of business suits talking data They seem a million miles removed from making sick people healthy But this week in Washington DC some of those meetings was enlivened by a sudden flash of color The back of one womans suit jacket bore a painting a Renoirlike portrait of a mother and child A mans blazer showed him reborn after years of despair Another womans jacket portrayed a young man holding his organ donor card A petite redheads jacket blazed with a scarlet letter A It was an insurrection of sorts the latest incarnation of something called the Walking Gallery The paintings on the back of jackets tell tale about the wearers odysseys through the labyrinth of the American health care system The paintings speak of struggle frustration and loss But theres also perseverance great love and triumph in the face of tragedy Gregg Masters has gained control after years of struggling with depression Lygeia Ricciardi has a healthy happy child though her attempt to have a natural childbirth in a hospital didnt work out as she planned And Alisa Hughley convinced her parents that they should allow her brothers organs to be donated after he was murdered at age  As a result she says four lives were saved The Walking Gallery is the vision of artist Regina Holliday In the past two years she has painted more than    with the owners promising to wear them to health care meetings two or three times a year Wearers include doctors health policy types and regular folks Their jackets tell the stories not just of their work life but of their personal experiences with health care Its your own story Holliday says And its your own jacket I wear my jacket proudly says   a cardiologist and professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla Calif It gets people talking about what we can do to get patients taking charge His jacket shows him standing inside a persons chest cavity while holding a smartphone He says it captures his passion for letting people use their own medical data Holliday first applied art to the iniquities of the health care system after her husband Fred died of kidney cancer at age  Infuriated by how Fred had been made wretched by inadequate and uncoordinated care in  she painted a huge mural about his death on the wall of a gas station near her home in Washington DC NPRs Joe Shapiro   of that mural  As a widow with two young boys Holliday could have stopped there Instead she has become a patient advocate speaking to medical groups and painting at medical meetings The idea of painting on the back of business suits came to her as a way to bring the subversiveness of art to the corporate suite Her own jacket the one with a scarlet A reflects both her identity as an artist and   when Fred was dying in the hospital A doctor was angry that Regina had asked a hospital social worker for help getting paperwork done for desperately needed disability insurance and that she had been asking questions about her husbands care The doctor said I understand Little Miss AType Personality has been asking questions Holliday is still asking questions and still painting including a   at the   this week that included references to Oklahoma her home state the deadly twisters there and one of the organizers loss of a child in a miscarriage A   is raising money for a documentary on the Walking Gallery I know so many patients who suffered in silence while the world turned its back on their suffering Holliday   of the Walking Gallery Now when you turn your back on a patient you are actually communicating at a far deeper level for on your back you portray the patient voice
