Engineers have taken an ordinary smartphone and made it a whole lot smarter.. Researchers from Columbia University developed the dongle to make it easier for healthcare workers in remote areas to identify people with life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases. The HIV and syphilis tests that are currently available cost as much as $8.50 combined and can take more than 2.5 hours to complete. By then, patients may be long gone.. To make a device that fit this bill, the engineering team had to solve several problems. One of the challenges was to make the dongle simple enough for anyone to use after half an hour of training.. How did it do? Very well, according to the report:. * The device correctly diagnosed all the patients who were HIV-positive and 87% of those who were HIV-negative. Twelve people got false-positive test results.. * In interviews, 57% of the patients praised the test for offering quick results, 44% appreciated that it tested for multiple diseases at once, and 95% were happy to offer just a pinprick of blood instead of having to endure a typical blood draw from a vein.. All of this performance came at an extremely reasonable price, according to the study. The engineers estimated that their dongle would cost $34 to manufacture. The traditional lab equipment used to diagnose HIV and syphilis costs $18,450, they wrote.
