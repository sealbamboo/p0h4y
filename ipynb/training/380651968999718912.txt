Did you take it out yet my supervising physician asked me referring to the urinary catheter I placed in a patient several days before You know theyre keeping tabs on that now I did know We had recently discussed performance metrics during morning rounds and were taught that prolonged urinary catheterization caused many hospitalacquired infections Hospitals were now being penalized for that sort of thing 
Several months before I had attended a conference where there was a heated discussion about whether to tie reimbursements to how well physicians managed hemoglobin Ac levels  a marker of blood sugar control in diabetic patients Some argued doctors would pay closer attention to diabetes control Others thought they would simply select healthier more compliant patients to make their jobs easier Suddenly a stately gentleman stood up and the room fell silent I recognized him as one of the most distinguished faculty members at my medical school a legend that physicians across the state consulted on their most difficult cases What on   are we teaching these young doctors he asked exasperated He stressed that a physicians responsibilities  to avidly manage diabetes or blood pressure to promptly remove a urinary catheter to ensure patient compliance with medications  come not from incentives but from a sacred duty we assume upon entering the profession Overemphasizing the former while underemphasizing the latter he argued does a disservice to the medical profession and to our patients His words struck me because they were so at odds with the language of recent discussions Id had on quality improvement Ive been taught that behavioral economics tells us much about how individuals consciously or subconsciously respond to incentives If we are able to align incentives to promote safer higher quality care then thats what well get But so far evidence on payforperformance incentives has been mixed at best While incentives can help change simple behaviors and improve productivity of rote tasks they may actually reduce creativity and dull motivation for the complex tasks and broad thinking required in medicine Furthermore incentivizing certain behaviors can sap time and attention away from those not measured And many aspects of medical care that are evaluated by quality and efficiency metrics  like reducing waits in emergency rooms or shortening hospital stays  are outside an individual doctors control A   by the   recognizes these limitations and argues that instead we need to capitalize on the inherent motivation of physicians and support underlying drivers of excellent care like professional purpose mastery and autonomy It advocates removing large perverse incentives that can inhibit good decisionmaking and valuebased care  like feeforservice payment models  but not devising elegant schemes to manufacture desired behaviors Todays physicians are trained in an environment in which discussions of costs and incentives are as much a part of our education as conversations about duty and humanism Its an environment in which words like provider and consumer are used as frequently as healer and patient In the midst of this evolution we must frequently examine the effect of these changes on the medical profession as well as the kind of education and narrative needed to reinforce physicians internal sense of purpose and pride in their work A mentor of mine recently took issue with the shifting vocabulary created by discussions of money in medicine I dont drag my butt out of bed at  am for a customer he said But Id do that any night of the week for my patients He told me the story of the midnight neurologist from his first month of residency more than  years ago He had been in the hospital for almost two straight days and was just settling into a nap shortly after midnight when the neurology fellow paged him to check on a comatose patient he had admitted several days before Cursing his pager he opened his bloodshot eyes and trudged down to the patients room exhausted When he arrived he noticed the neurologist slowly lift the patients hospital gown just above his left knee exposing as little of the leg as possible He tapped gently with the reflex hammer and carefully noted any changes from the day before He then replaced the gown over the left knee and repeated the procedure on the right My mentor told me he often still thinks of that moment It was the middle of the night and this neurologist  like him  had been on call for more than  hours They both knew the patient would likely never regain consciousness and no one was keeping tabs on anything Yet the neurologist respectfully tenderly meticulously completed his familiar routine as he would on a cherished loved one As a student of health policy I believe that incentives will be a powerful tool for changing physician hospital and patient behavior  especially given the many perverse incentives that currently exist in our system But as a student of medicine I believe this focus on incentives must be coupled with an equally robust discussion of the historic and modern duties of a healer We must promote a culture among students residents and policymakers that recognizes that incentives  aligned misaligned askance or otherwise  are secondary to a physicians duty to fervently protect the health of patients These two dialogues have largely operated in parallel but its time we integrate them and acknowledge their mutually reinforcing potential for delivering better care Because alone no arsenal of carrots and sticks will ever produce the kind of compassion and attention to detail every patient wants and deserves
