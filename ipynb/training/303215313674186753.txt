 You may want to think twice before inhaling your next big breath of fresh air According to new research out of Rice University in Houston  ranked eighth in the country for highest annual number of ozone days    may lead to cardiac arrest The research results of which were announced today in Boston at the America Association for the Advancement of Science conference was funded by the Houston Endowment and the city of Houston it will be published in the   Statisticians examined information collected over eight years from Houstons air quality monitors and also looked at  reports of outofhospital cardiac arrests tallied by Houston Emergency Medical Services They found that a daily increase in air pollutant matter elevated risk for outofhospital cardiac arrests especially among those with preexisting medical conditions Likewise increases in ozone levels had similar risk ramifications Those most at risk for cardiac arrest associated with air pollution or ozone included men African Americans and seniors The researchers determined that outofhospital cardiac arrests    perhaps due to the heat  and more than  percent of these cardiac arrests resulted in death Recent studies have also linked   Researchers hope that this newly discovered correlation between outofhospital cardiac arrests and air pollution will lead to more   to lower death rates from cardiac arrests and to improvements in air quality especially a reduction in ozone levels In addition better air quality monitoring would help public health officials warn vulnerable people when conditions are bad The bottomline goal is to save lives said study author Katherine Ensor PhD professor and chair of Rices Department of Statistics in a press release Wed like to contribute to a refined warning system for atrisk individuals Blanket warnings about air quality may not be good enough At the same time we want to enhance our understanding of the health cost of pollution  and celebrate its continuing reduction added Dr Ensor
