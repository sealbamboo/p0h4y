Theyve got a few weeks But if federal officials cant get the new online insurance marketplace running smoothly by midNovember the problems plaguing the threeweekold website could become a far bigger threat to the success of the health law hampering enrollment and fueling opponents calls to delay implementation analysts say The system needs to be operating reasonably efficiently  Im not saying flawlessly  before the middle of November says   the insurance commissioner of Kansas one of the  states relying on the federal marketplace because legislators there opted not to create their own statebased market On Monday President Obama addressed the problems directly for the first time No one is more frustrated than me he said promising that technology experts from around the country were working with the administration to get this working better faster sooner Still he did not offer details about the scope of the problems a timeline for the repairs or   who have successfully enrolled out of the more than  million visitors to the federal site The stakes are huge  and not just because of public opinion but to ensure   which are key to the laws longterm success The marketplaces were supposed to be onestop shops where individual consumers could compare policies find out if they were eligible for subsidies and enroll in coverage But without robust participation  and the government is counting on  million enrollees the first year  the program could fall short of attracting the necessary balance between healthy and unhealthy consumers If were not seeing a substantial improvement in the next two or three weeks well be in a bad place said   director of exchange technology at Leavitt Partners a consulting firm Were already behind the curve in getting to that  million mark The risk in frustrating consumers is that those who are healthy or on the fence about enrolling may give up leaving only the unhealthy motivated enough to persevere That could drive up premiums in future years potentially leading to what experts call a death spiral where only the sickest people sign on The people who will go back will be precisely the ones who need health insurance because theyve got ongoing problems said   an economist at the American Enterprise Institute Experts outside the government are trying to assess the scope of the problem with little information coming from the Obama administration What is known is that technical issues have made it difficult if not impossible for consumers to create accounts They also have resulted in insurers getting misinformation about those who do manage to enroll The troubles have been most severe with the federal website although a few of the  states operating state exchanges are also experiencing serious problems If the administration solves the problems before the end of October this would just be a blip on the radar said   CEO of the Washington DC consulting firm Avalere Health If problems cannot be resolved that quickly Mendelson says there are other options for getting people enrolled Medicare beneficiaries signed up for coverage for decades without using computers he notes The president also mentioned those options Monday saying consumers could sign up by telephone in person with trained assistants or by downloading an application and mailing it in But those options are not ideal mainly because they would require that millions of applications be manually checked across several federal agencies That would take significantly longer than if it was automated said Schuyler While its a fallback its not going to resolve the issue that if HealthCaregov doesnt improve in two or three weeks were going to have this backlog of people who are trying to enroll Consumers have until Dec  to enroll for coverage that starts Jan   although the open enrollment period goes through March  Some analysts suggest that if problems persist into late November or December the Obama administration will need to consider   period At least one expert though said November is not the most critical period for the website to be functioning smoothly Brian Haile senior vice president of health care policy at Jackson Hewitt tax service notes that the health law is primarily aimed at people with lowtomoderate income And their household cash flow is often drained by holiday gift spending he says and replenished by February tax refunds If youre trying to sell something you need to do it at a period during which you dont have competing consumption said Haile After Nov   foremost on their minds is not Am I going to buy insurance but What am I going to put under the tree
