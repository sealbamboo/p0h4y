Marie Theriault started having trouble with her hands more than three years ago She was the director of a day care center but suddenly she couldnt change diapers or tie shoelaces She started dropping things People would say to me Look you dropped your folder  Mrs Theriault  said I wasnt aware I had dropped it Though she did not have any problems with memory Mrs Theriault eventually found out that she has a rare form of   The diagnosis enabled her family to plan ahead Her husband took early retirement and found a clinical trial for her to enroll in and the two went on a safari that had been a dream for years Were frontloading a bit enjoying life as much as we can now that the disease is manageable said Paul Theriault  It can get pretty ugly For the Theriaults getting an accurate diagnosis of Alzheimers disease brought a measure of relief even though the future might be grim Indeed there is a growing interest in the early detection of   not only in patients like Mrs Theriault but also in people with normal agerelated memory changes or even no symptoms at all The idea is that treatments for Alzheimers disease and other dementias have been largely ineffective because the conditions arent caught early enough Now researchers are starting clinical trials that focus on people in the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimers disease   is paying for wellness visits that include cognitive assessments and screening But the push for everearlier dementia screening raises troubling questions for patients and their families When the diagnosis is early Alzheimers disease the medical profession has little treatment to offer This month researchers at an   urged policy makers to think hard before recommending wider dementia screening saying studies have found no evidence that early detection improves outcomes And the experts said that little if anything is known about the potential risks of early detection The diagnosis may cause stress anxiety depression and even suicide in patients and can have implications for employment purchasing life and longterm care insurance and ones overall quality of life sense of autonomy and selfimage It colors how people see you and how you see yourself said   a geriatrician and ethicist at the University of Chicago Everyone forgets things but if you have the diagnosis whenever you forget something youll think Its because Im sick It pathologizes everything The amyloid plaque that is characteristic of Alzheimers disease starts to accumulate years even decades before symptoms become apparent and some researchers are convinced that in order to prevent or postpone cognitive impairment these plaques must be attacked earlier  director of the Alzheimers Disease Clinical Trials Office at the   said new trials of a monoclonal antibody that binds to amyloid will specifically recruit subjects who do not show any symptoms of Alzheimers disease but already have evidence of amyloid plaque buildup Healthy subjects will have to volunteer to undergo PET scans that detect amyloid plaque in the brain They may be recruited from among the many worried well who are seeking reassurance and clear answers about the future This trial will require participants to have an amyloid burden that is consistent with risk for Alzheimers disease so you essentially will know your status which is uncharted territory Dr Ryan said This type of trial has not been done before There are already  medical centers that have PET scanners that use an imaging agent called amyvid approved by the Food and Drug Administration to detect amyloid plaque in the brain Yet this month the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a draft proposal indicated that the agency would not pay for these brains scans as diagnostic tools because they just dont help much Even when a brain scan helps confirm the diagnosis of early Alzheimers disease available treatments only delay symptoms for a relatively short period of time And there is the potential for misdiagnosis since plenty of people have amyloid plaque in their brains without developing symptoms of Alzheimers disease or other dementias The rush to find early Alzheimers disease worries some physicians and ethicists You are telling someone they have a disease that theyre not experiencing in any way that they can see and youre telling them its an incurable disease Thats kind of tough said   the lead author of   We dont know yet what its like to live with the experience of asymptomatic Alzheimers she added Its hard to even conceive of Still many scientists use heart disease as an example in describing how Alzheimers disease may develop It takes decades for the underlying biological changes including plaque accumulation to damage the brain just as high cholesterol and hypertension left uncontrolled may ultimately lead to a heart attack The plaque is kind of like cholesterol Dr Ryan said Not everyone who has high cholesterol goes on to have a heart attack but it puts you at higher risk It makes sense she said to treat this risk factor as early as possible even if not everyone with plaques will develop Alzheimers Still that is just a hypothesis said Dr Malaz Boustani an associate director of the   and the medical director of the   at Wishard Health Services Its a beautiful hypothesis and its what I do my research on but its still a hypothesis and we need data Dr Boustani said Both he and Dr Brauner urge patients who notice cognition or memory problems  or whose family members notice changes  to get a complete evaluation The physician should take a history do a thorough exam and rule out a number of potential causes of mental impairment depression thyroid kidney and liver function vitamin B levels infections and   and electrolyte disturbances Sometimes an   or CT brain scan may also be done to assist in diagnosis These are different from the PET scans that detect amyloid plaque and proponents argue that they can help clarify a diagnosis under certain circumstances The physician should also do a careful review of medications since many drugs can have adverse effects on cognition You cannot believe the number of people who come to our clinic with memory symptoms and we find it was driven by their exposure to medications like taking Benadryl to sleep or bladder medications Dr Boustani said Reassuringly many people who experience mild cognitive impairment do not progress to dementia and many even return to normal some studies suggest A study of primary care patients seen at Wishard Health Services identified  patients with mild cognitive impairment A year later most were stable and nearly onethird had reverted to normal
