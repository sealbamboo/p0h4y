Everyone on the ward fell hard for the patient in the room at the end of the hall Her roommate was loud demanding and a complete nuisance  nobody spent more time in that part of the room than was absolutely necessary But the gently smiling impeccably mannered little yearold admitted to the window bed with a touch of pneumonia was a big favorite The doctors joked with her the nurses stroked her head and brought   and nebulizers right on time and her privateduty attendant organized her pillows and fed her little snacks She looked like a million dollars when they sent her home Two days later she was back in the emergency room   and choking all over again her readmission an embarrassment to the professional staff  and for the hospital a big fat fine from   in a new effort to discourage these repeat performances Cases like hers torture health policy makers partly because nobody can quite figure out who is to blame The systems culpable habits are legion discharging patients who are still sick providing them with incomprehensible instructions forgetting theyre too weak to get to the pharmacy overlooking the booby traps at home providing no coherent followup Sometimes the outpatient doctor doesnt even know the patient has been admitted But patients are not always innocent either They routinely ignore some or all of their discharge instructions or merrily resume the bad habits that got them into trouble in the first place And divine providence of course supplies us with an array of remitting and relapsing disorders whose behavior no one without a crystal ball could predict  thus disagree on how many readmissions within  days of discharge are actually preventable Some say almost none some say almost all In  Medicare and   tried to shame hospitals into doing better by posting readmission rates that didnt do much and now fines are imposed Hospitals efforts to eliminate some of their worst habits have indeed led to modest improvements For comic relief it should be noted that a few of these strategies backfired and   possibly because they helped outpatient providers see clearly just how sick their discharged patients were But all the various patterns of overt malfeasance were irrelevant to the yearold patient for whom everyone from head nurse to housekeeping wished only the best her discharge went by the book We must blame instead a global failure to understand that in medicine as in theater staging can be all Imagine a theater director leading a tiny whitehaired amateur actress onto the proscenium for her first big starring role For Act I he tucks her into a wonderful electric bed with her head elevated to just the right degree He hires a dozen veteran actors to bustle about her feeding her or adjusting the oxygen tubes in her nose She cracks a few weak jokes and the pros all laugh Someone helps her with her lipstick She is warm safe admired mentally stimulated coughing discreetly into a fist Offstage  this is an important detail  the voice of her roommate moans in an endless loop of complaint Then we come to Act II Blackclad stagehands make quick work of the set change Gone is the bed the oxygen the bedside tray full of food and ice water Gone are the professionals except for a visiting nurse in the wings and she wont show up until the Monday after the Friday afternoon discharge Gone is the voice of the roommate in the silence that cough is suddenly much much louder Our star slumps off a teetering stack of old pillows and from the cutest little thing on a ward full of disasters she becomes a sick old lady lying the wrong way on a bed too far from a bathroom lipstick smeared terrifying relatives who dont know how to lift her properly Small wonder that on Sunday morning she is rushed right back to a safer place for that embarrassing  and expensive  Act III Policy analysts might read this script and highlight the Friday discharge in accusatory yellow although   on whether the hour health care cycle errs when it spits patients out into a world that still has weekends The rest of us should try to remember that what we see in the hospital can sometimes be a masterful illusion staged by experts Only by squinting directly at the star of the show until her surroundings blur is there a chance of accurately predicting whether that fabulous performance can be sustained on an empty stage
