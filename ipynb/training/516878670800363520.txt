As US troops begin arriving in Liberia to help contain the regional spread of Ebola a physician in the capital is grappling with the virus upfront Dr Martha Zarways life turned upside down when one of her clinic staff members  a friend  died on Sept  amid rumors that the cause of death was Ebola  It was not so long ago that Zarway   survived Liberias civil war dodging bullets as rebel groups fought for control of Monrovia and other parts of the country Just as Liberia was struggling back to its feet the Ebola outbreak came and dealt the people there a body blow Health workers like Zarway a private general practitioner who operates her own clinic are bearing the brunt of the virus So far at least  health workers in Liberia have died of Ebola The truth is the entire thing is scary she says But at the same time I usually tell my staff its scary  but think about a war and all the soldiers run away What will happen to the civilians Pouncing on her military theme I ask whether she feels like an army general who has to rally her foot soldiers Like I say its scary its double scary she says But you cant run from the field I mean I cant change my profession Im a doctor Im a doctor so we cant run away I ask her if there are similarities between living through this Ebola outbreak and living through Liberias year civil war which ended about a decade ago There are similarities and yet theres a big difference because this one  I think its more scary It seems that you cant hide  We used to say Let we go down the basement to hide from the gunshots  she says But this one you cant hide  especially being a medical practitioner Theres no way to hide Liberians call Ebola the silent enemy the silent weapon Zarway set up her clinic five years ago in Paynesville a Monrovia suburb She and her staff treat all kinds of patients from pregnant women to diabetics They also deliver babies Zarway says they all take precautions wearing protective equipment and diplomatically asking patients if theyve come in contact with or looked after people who are sick with Ebola In Monrovia these days campaigners all over the city are trying to raise awareness about Ebola They sing and play drums and use bullhorns to spread the word about how to avoid the virus But at Zarways clinic Ebola quietly crept into their midst when their colleague died with fear and stigma attached Rumors circulated that he died of the virus In fearful times there was fingerpointing at the staff and the clinic They had to relocate temporarily The original clinic had to be disinfected Despite the upheaval Zarway says most of her staff have chosen to stay on So far only one person is scared to come back to work she says One nurse decided to stay home  This is our first time having to see and deal with Ebola so we are adapting Now that Zarway has become a potential contact person herself  being monitored for possible infection because of the questions about the late colleague she looked after  she says the toughest part is the notouching rule refraining from physical contact with others I tell my little son No you cant touch Mummy until after the  days  she says Thats the threeweek virus incubation period for those who might have come into contact with Ebola and could test positive So no touching no hugging no kissing Thats the hardest she says During the war we could hug each other and give some comfort she says But now with Ebola you have to be careful You have to stay distance apart Zarway had to try to explain all this to her young son But how does the rest of her family feel To tell you the truth she says I havent told my husband yet Hes in the States I have to tell him today you know but its scary Later I asked her how the call went Zarway told me shed been praying that her husband wouldnt tell her to slow down She still loves her job despite the hazards of Ebola He didnt ask her to quit And her clinic is still up and running
