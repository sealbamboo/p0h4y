
 Can stress affect a womans ability to become  pregnant A new study says it may Over  four years  women who were stopping  contraception and trying to have a baby  underwent saliva testing for two stressrelated substances the enzyme alphaamylase and the hormone cortisol The women  provided a saliva sample upon enrollment in the study and then another at their first observed menstrual period so that comparisons between the women could be made from the same starting point Researchers analyzed the samples and then followed the women to see how long it took them to become pregnant Women who became pregnant during the first month of the study before they could give a second saliva sample were also included in the analysis The scientists defined infertility as a failure to become pregnant after  months of unprotected intercourse During the study published Monday in Human Reproduction  women became pregnant and  did not There was no association of cortisol with fertility But those whose alphaamylase   levels were in the highest third a sign of longstanding stress had more than double the risk of infertility The scientists controlled for age race income and other health and socioeconomic factors The lead author Courtney D Lynch director of reproductive epidemiology at Ohio State University said that if a woman was having difficulty becoming pregnant it would be harmless and might be helpful to consider stressreduction techniques Yoga meditation mindfulness have been successful in other health outcomes she said and might be helpful for fertility as well
