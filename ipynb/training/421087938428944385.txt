OTTAWA—A Canadian died from the H5N1 strain of avian flu, officials said, in the first fatality in North America from a virus that has been infecting people off and on for more than a decade.. The Alberta resident fell ill on a return flight from China to Canada and died on Jan. 3. Federal officials said the case was isolated and the risk of others getting H5N1 low. But the death comes amid a rise in concern over avian flu following an uptick in deaths from another variety of the deadly virus in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
