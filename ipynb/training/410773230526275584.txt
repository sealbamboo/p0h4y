The deaths of patients following liver surgery at a Cardiff hospital have been referred to South Wales Police Prof David Paul Berry was suspended from the University Hospital of Wales in January Eight patient deaths in his care were avoidable said a review for the health board South Wales Police said it had liaised with the coroner and was now in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service to examine the facts Earlier on Wednesday Health Minister Mark Drakeford dismissed calls for a review of all Welsh hospitals to address public concerns about standards of NHS care following the case He told AMs in the Senedd the matter had come to light without any external review Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams had tabled an urgent question asking for a statement from the minister He responded Any avoidable death in the NHS care is a matter for profound regret and a cause for deep distress to families All organisations must have robust clinical governance systems in place to routinely audit patient outcomes and take immediate action if concerns emerge The suspension of a surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales was the result of such a process He rejected a request by the Conservatives to act on a call from the Royal College of Surgeons to hold a review into Welsh hospitals Mr Drakeford had said earlier he was satisfied systems in place provided early warning systems if something went wrong He added Where things arise where I do feel there is a need for an independent outside look at what is going on in order to provide public assurance then I will do that Earlier Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards medical director Dr Graham Shortland said an internal audit had highlighted concern and they had taken steps to ensure the public are safe BBC Wales discovered on Tuesday that Prof Berry had been suspended at the start of the year It has since emerged he was suspended at the same time from Spire Cardiff Hospital where he had a private practice Prof Berry who moved to work in south Wales from the Leicester area was originally stopped from carrying out complex surgery in October  following concerns about the outcomes of some liver patients in his care An initial internal investigation confirmed the health boards concerns and he was fully suspended from duties in January this year Two further independent reviews by the Royal College of Surgeons RCS followed The second RCS review of the individual care of  patients who underwent complex liver surgery by the surgeon found that  later died and eight of those  deaths were avoidable The health boards medical director told BBC Wales Good Morning Wales programme This is about complex liver surgery and not about other surgery that was performed  Dr Shortland added that an initial independent review showed this was not a service problem this was a problem with an individual surgeon When asked why had the matter only just come to the wider publics attention Dr Shortland said We felt it was very important to have a discussion with those families affected and we would have made sure this was taken into the public domain at an appropriate time Our duty was to inform those families first The health board has issued unreserved apologies to every family affected Stephen Allen chief officer of patient watchdog Cardiff and Vale Community Health Council said Its a distressing time for the families concerned and we cant imagine what they are going through Maria Daviess partner Martyn Rogers from Newport died after undergoing treatment last year and she has instructed lawyers to investigate further Solicitor Emma Rush said Ms Davies had inklings something was amiss and this was confirmed by the RCS review As far as Maria is concerned losing a loved one is horrific in any situation But when you then subsequently find out that youve lost that loved one and the death was avoidable I cant even begin to imagine how that makes Maria feel Clearly she is devastated Ms Rush added A helpline for anyone who is concerned about the surgical care they received at the hospital in relation to liver surgery between February  and October  has been set up The helpline number is    and will be open from noon to  GMT every day from Wednesday December  to Friday December  On Wednesday evening Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust said the helpline had received  calls Dr Shortland added We are also pleased that the two remaining families who we have been trying to contact for some time have been in touch and we can offer them appropriate support  University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said Prof Berrys results in the year before he left for Wales were in line with those of his peers but over a longer period there were times when they were not as good as those of his colleagues The trust has sought advice from the Royal College of Surgeons about the need for a similar look back exercise carried out in Wales It is to open a freephone patient helpline      on Thursday  December to run from am and pm daily until further notice
