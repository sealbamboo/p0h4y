Many of Americas cities have become much safer in the years since for reasons that range from better policing to the   of the s to the removal of lead from the environment Even in Philadelphia where the economy is still struggling and population has never recovered from the urban flight of the s and s there were  murders in  down significantly from the worst years a couple of decades ago  Other cities have experienced even more astounding turnarounds in New York where I live now there were just   in a city of  million the lowest number in more than half a century  But those statistics arent convincing the country that cities are getting safer   found that most Americans continue to believe that the nations crime rate is getting worse even though theres been a sharp and sustained drop in murders and other violent assaults since the mids Perception  no doubt fueled in part by the media  beats reality But even with crime down surely its still safer to live in the quiet countryside than it is in the city It turns out thats not true According to   PDF published today in the Annals of Emergency Medicine large cities in the United States are significantly safer than rural areas The risk of injury death  which counts both violent crime and accidents  is more than  higher in the countryside than it is in large urban areas  Perceptions have long existed that cities were innately more dangerous than areas outside of cities but our study shows this is not the case said the lead author Dr Sage R Myers of the University of Pennsylvania and the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia in a statement Far from being violent death traps a large city might just about be the safest place to live in the United States Now its true that the risk of homicide is greater in big cities than it is in the countryside But the study which analyzed  deaths from injury between  and  found the rate of dying from an unintentional injury is over  times higher than that of homicide for the population as a whole  Whether you live in rural areas or the city youre much less likely to die from a gunshot wound  either from someone else or selfinflicted  than you are in a simple accident Especially car crashes which make up the bulk of unintentional injury deaths  motorvehicleinjuryrelated deaths occurred at a rate that is more than  times higher than the next leading cause of death The study doesnt attempt to explain why injury death is more common in rural areas than large urban ones but some of the statistics are telling  The risk of firearmrelated death showed no difference across the ruralurban spectrum for the population as a whole but varied when divided up by age  firearm deaths were significantly higher for children and people ages  and older while for people ages  to  the risk of firearm deaths were much higher in urban areas Id wager some of that comes down to differences in gun ownership more households have firearms in rural areas than in urban ones and sadly too many gun owners keep their firearms where their children can reach them The result can be tragic At the same time the bulk of victims killed by homicide are young men according to FBI statistics And they are more likely to be shot and killed in the cities But guns  whether used accidentally or with intent  are much less likely to be the cause of death than another tool cars And people drive more drive longer drive faster and drive drunker in rural areas than in urban ones where they can walk or take public transit  Motorvehicle crashes led to  deaths per  people in most rural areas and just  deaths per  people Those are stark statistics and they dont even take into account the cardiovascular benefits that may accrue to urbanites who spend more time walking than riding in cars Its not for nothing that New Yorkers who live in the densest urban area in the US live about  years longer than the national average Of course not all cities are equally safe  Chicago has seen a terrifying rise in gun deaths in recent years and theres nothing safe about a bankrupt and broken city like Detroit where it can take  minutes on average for police to answer a  call Even there most urban areas have an advantage though  youre likely to be much closer to the nearest hospital in a dense city than the spreadout countryside and minutes matter when it comes to trauma  But the numbers dont lie  as scary as we may think urban crime is the threats that are prevalent in rural areas are statistically more dangerous We already know that the best way to shrink your carbon footprint is to move to a dense city Now it turns out that it might be the best way to stay alive too
