ews about the unsustainable pressures facing AE departments has been hard to avoid Visits to AE in    And   show that up to m emergency admissions are avoidable and up to  of  calls could be managed at the scene The depth of this crisis is clear but its time to find alternative solutions To reduce   pressures we need to prevent people getting so ill Part of this is about preventing hospital admissions and readmissions by making homes safer to prevent falls and warmer to avoid coldrelated illnesses worsening Its also about enabling quicker safer hospital discharge for patients who are well enough to go home but cant Recently Sir Stephen Bubb chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations presented to a cabinet subcommittee on how charities could help reduce AE pressures But it isnt just the big national charities that can help tackle the crisis in our health system Another resource are home improvement agencies HIAs There are nearly  of these organisations in England many notforprofit some run by councils or housing associations others independent The HIA national body is Foundations and its charitable arm which gives out grants is the   HIAs organise repairs and adaptations to make homes safer for vulnerable people many of whom live on their own with carers visiting occasionally Health commissioners are waking up to the contribution that low cost modest home modifications  installing a grab rail replacing front steps with a ramp or mending a thermostat  can make to NHS budgets  The organisation I work for Swan Housing Association has been commissioned by North East Essex   CCG to run a rapid response service to do just that We realised that many older patients in AE fell between two support pathways They needed more than the oneoff intervention provided by hometohospital projects But they didnt need an intensive  week care package offered by reablement schemes As a result patients often had to be unnecessarily admitted and some had their discharge delayed because the right type of support wasnt immediately available To plug this gap Swan Care  Repair in partnership with our own care provider   created a new service Handypersons were available seven days a week ampm Within four hours of a GP community matron or paramedic phoning us a patient was visited by a handyperson and senior care worker and provided with up to six days of support at home A social return on investment exercise showed that for the  invested in the pilot by the CCG and Swan Care  Repair a net value of  in savings was generated to the whole economy The financial and practical success of the model meant that North East Essex CCG have commissioned services until September  Were also trialling the placement of care staff in hospital discharge teams and our care staff are helping to identify outpatients who would benefit from services at home rather than being admitted This is a prime example of how better integration between housing social care and health can have a big impact on AE departments There are many community organisations out there that could help to address the hospital crisis I hope they get the chance and the commissioner backing to make this a reality for more communities
