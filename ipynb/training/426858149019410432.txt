The very title of this blog suggests the continual shifting of ground underneath all of us of a certain age Whatever we thought old age meant yesterday it means something different today  Sixty when the blog began Im now  Thats not a complaint but an indisputable fact and with the years come my own idiosyncratic observations Hardwired for pessimism one would think they would be gloomy Mostly they arent I love Medicare Social Security a fixedbenefit pension senior movie tickets and even the occasional person who offers me a seat on the bus I love caring less about what other people think of me and more about what I think of myself Im hoping all that eventually balances the hard reality that goals and dreams from my s and s that havent happened yet arent going to Pulitzer Prizes children and grandchildren running a marathon I particularly love pleasure and pain not being mutually exclusive how the rooms where I live even my nightly dreams and the conversations in my head are more and more populated by ghosts  loved ones now dead but blessedly not gone They are always welcome here and why would I want it otherwise Gone is too final To me it means six feet under a memorial yahrzeit candle on the anniversary of a death the prayer for the dead chanted in Hebrew during the period of mourning and on certain religious holidays Gone doesnt mean that life goes on in a better place To chase my ghosts away to silence their voices  and Im not sure I could  would be in effect a second death I dont   them gone  I would rather talk to my mother dead more than  years but still saying the same things she said to me as long as I can remember Pay the  she reminded me just the other day even if only I could hear  a family joke about the cost of undeserved parking tickets long ago I was about to waste time energy and heartache fighting for money that I would likely not get in the end She was telling me to cut my losses  I would rather talk to my father himself a journalist who died in  but still reminds me that writers block is nothing more than procrastination If you cant write type he says Or a variant Lay bricks He means that work is work so sit down and do it Another oftenheardfrom ghost  years dead of a brain tumor at the age of  was my Times colleague in California he the seasoned bureau chief in Los Angeles and me the rookie in San Francisco His moral compass was so true he only had to stare at me to keep me from taking company legal pads home for personal use When I was on the verge the other day of walking off with a pen by accident I swear after signing for a credit card purchase gone though he might be he shot me a look and I shamefacedly returned the pen These conversations are not onesided Recently overwhelmed by a run of problems I didnt know how to solve I silently raged at him Your job was to take care of me  that was the deal I took care of you when you were sick and was fine with that But now I need you badly and where the hell are you  Ashamed to be so angry at a dead person I almost missed his reply It isnt fair he told me And Im so so sorry  Would I rather he were really here Of course But that isnt one of the choices is it   Then there is my oldest childhood friend from the time she was  and I  Her advice was often caustic even unwelcome But her taste was impeccable  mine admittedly less so  and her job was to ensure I didnt have a pixie cut when everyone else had a ponytail or big hornedrim glasses when the ittybitty wire ones were in style and to buy me earrings I was too cheap to buy for myself  Cancer almost killed her in her s instead she had  more years Now shes the ghost who shops with me Invisible to the optometrist she chose not one but two pairs of eyeglass frames both too expensive Never once have I regretted spending the money And she is with me wherever I wear them There are others many more The ghosts sometimes seem to outnumber the real people and that will only be more true as time passes I know But early January was a doozy two deaths over one weekend and both memorialized in this newspaper on the very same day   was my colleague at The Times She regularly brought food when I was recovering from surgery many years ago she took halting walks with me when that was the only activity I was allowed Very few people left at The Times even remember her The loss of who we used to be  and how quickly we are forgotten  is a death of a different kind   was my first newspaper editor the man who made my career a reality As he saw me through its beginning he also saw me through its end At  I pounced on a voluntary buyout yet was stunned by the loss of my job Get used to it he said Youll feel this way forever Thats what happens when you lose what youre best at and love most His obituary ends with an anecdote about him waking each morning postretirement and designing the front page of a newspaper he no longer ran He had told me that story many times neither flippant nor gruff just plain old sad   How strange for all of us as we age to move into a time of life when so many of the voices we hear are of people no longer living Yet what might be a mournful chorus is rather consoling company We are alive and they are dead but we are not who we used to be There is no talking to   ghosts no keeping them alive Instead with the help of loved ones who got there before us there is a slow recognition that doors once open are now closed and that others open if you let them
