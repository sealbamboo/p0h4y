There are a lot of ways to describe excessive gas burping belching flatulence and bloating While what you call it might not seem to matter being able to identify where the gas starts  and where it ends  can help you treat the painful or embarrassing symptoms For example burping and belching usually refer to gas that escapes from the mouth while flatulence or farting is intestinal gas that escapes from the rectum Bloating is used to describe the sensation of excess stomach gas that has not yet been released Its common to experience some gas after eating  and to release it through belching or flatulence According to the   passing gas about  to  times a day is normal But if youre experiencing painful gas and the embarrassment of chronic and foul smelling flatulence you can start to play detective and try to eliminate the cause with the following steps One way to manage flatulence and belching is to eat fewer of the wellknown gassy foods Common culprits include certain fruits like apples and pears specific vegetables such as broccoli Brussels sprouts and onions whole grains like bran and dairy products including milk cheese and ice cream These items contain fiber sugars and starches that dont digest or absorb easily eventually causing intestinal gas Foods containing sorbitol a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit are on some peoples gassy foods list Other people are bothered by carbonated soft drinks and fruit drinks If you discover that these foods are causing you excess gas eliminate them from your diet or eat them in small portions When it comes to foods to avoid moderation is key says   professor of internal medicine and director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at the Center for Digestive Health at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond Keep in mind that almost any food or combination of foods can cause gas Certain foods dont get along well in certain people says Donald Novey MD an integrative medicine physician in Poulsbo Washington Some people find they are gassy if they eat fruits with proteins or if they eat starches and proteins together Its personal and requires a little experimentation to find out what the culprits are Dr Novey suggests keeping a food diary and noting when you feel gassy If you find youre gassy after eating a certain food eliminate it from your diet and see if it helps he says Cooking may help break down some of the offending ingredients Dr Bickston says But the style of cooking can also decrease healthy chemicals found in vegetables Boiling seems to break down chlorophyll and other desirable ingredients Look for recipes that call for steaming as that seems to be a better cooking method for gassy foods If you drink liquids with your meals you lose stomach acids and cant break down food as well Novey says Try drinking about  minutes before a meal to help your stomach digest better When you eat or drink fast you can swallow a lot of air which can cause gas says Bickston The simple solution Slow down when you eat If you have dentures check with your dentist to be sure they fit properly so youre not gasping air while eating  are available as overthecounter supplements I recommend going to the health food store and getting a digestive enzyme says Novey You can take one or two You will know very rapidly  within a few weeks  if it makes a difference But antacids wont do much for   says Bickston Another overthecounter digestive aid Beano contains an enzyme that breaks down the complex carbohydrates in beans and many vegetables into more easily digestible sugars Take two to three Beano tablets or one Beano Meltaway a dissolving tablet before each meal Note that Beano wont help if excessive gas is caused by fiber or lactose Activated charcoal may help reduce and treat excess gas and bloating Unlike the charcoal you find in your grill or fireplace activated charcoal undergoes a special treatment that makes it safe for human consumption Once you take activated charcoal via liquid or pill it attaches to fluid in your gut potentially reducing gas and bloating and creating firmer stools Habits like smoking chewing gum and drinking through a straw may cause your stomach to fill with air leading to gas Sorbitol and related sugar alcohols used in many sugarfree versions of foods can also aggravate gas Sorbitol is often the first ingredient in any brand of sugarfree gum Ive found at local grocery stores says Bickston One to two sticks is akin to eating a prune But the sugar substitutes that are found at a typical coffee stand or in popular soft drinks are not the kind that cause gas The various packet sweeteners  yellow sucralose pink saccharine and blue aspartame  are not associated with gas or laxative effects If excessive gas is persistent or severe consult your doctor  it could be a sign of a more serious digestive condition such as Also warns Bickston if youve had abdominal surgery a hernia or significant weight loss or
