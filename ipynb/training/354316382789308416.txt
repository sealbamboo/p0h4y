 is a highly controversial catchall term for a host of longlasting symptoms that may or may not stem from prior infection with the bacterium that causes acute   Often misdiagnosed and mistreated chronic Lyme disease leaves thousands of people physically and mentally debilitated and without a medically established recourse Mary Rasenberger  a New York lawyer experienced a series of ailments going back  years She was finally given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease last summer after having been told that she had   Her longterm symptoms were aching joints headaches and indescribable fatigue that made her miserable and unable to exercise In the last few years two additional symptoms developed neuropathy in her limbs and face and   In an interview she said she woke up every day feeling sick if she became overheated she felt as if she had   Yet a test for Lyme disease came back negative Desperate she finally consulted a Lyme specialist one of a number of doctors who treat patients with symptoms like Ms Rasenbergers with longterm   despite the fact that such a regimen has shown no significant or lasting benefit in controlled clinical trials These trials involved randomly assigning patients to the antibiotic Rocephin often administered intravenously or a placebo with neither patients nor those evaluating their symptoms aware of who got what Still after several months on antibiotics Ms Rasenberger like many similar patients said she felt completely healthy for the first time in years Each time she tries to stop the medication her debilitating symptoms return Reports like Ms Rasenbergers are hardly unusual and experts now realize that some people who get Lyme disease go on to develop a chronic illness even if their initial infection was promptly diagnosed and correctly treated Approximately  percent to  percent of people who are treated for medically documented Lyme disease develop persistent or recurrent symptoms of fatigue musculoskeletal pain and cognitive complaints The condition is known as   or PTLDS It is a real disorder although nobody really knows whats happening Dr John N Aucott an infectious disease specialist in Lutherville Md said in an interview A lot of patients have been told theyre not really sick just tired or depressed he added But this is not normal fatigue and its not caused by    although depression certainly can result from the patients seriously diminished quality of life Antibiotic therapy for PTLDS is based on disputed reports that these patients may harbor hidden reservoirs of the spirochete causing Lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi long after their initial treatment But researchers who have studied the therapy have   and many say the regimen is fraught with hazards that could be even worse than the illness Risks include the development of an antibioticresistant infection intractable   kidney or liver damage and as happened to a yearold woman treated with an antibiotic through a catheter   People with PTLDS are not hypochondriacs seeking attention or sluggards wanting to avoid work or chores Dr Aucott said though they may benefit from psychotherapy that helps them cope better with their symptoms These are highfunctioning people  couch potatoes dont get Lyme disease he said They are not crazy and the doctors who treat them are not evil These are desperate people trying to get better and wellintentioned doctors who are trying to help them But until the causes of PTLDS are discerned it will be difficult for researchers to find effective therapies Among the possible causes of the syndrome are prolonged postinfection fatigue and an autoimmune reaction to the infecting organism according to a recent book by Dr Adriana Marques of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases As for why some people with PTLDS seem to benefit from intensive antibiotic therapy at least temporarily Dr Aucott suggested a few theories The antibiotics may have an antiinflammatory effect that relieves pain and swelling Alternatively patients may have a lowlevel persistent infection that is temporarily suppressed by antibiotics  but not killed by them Or it may be that some PTLDS patients experience a placebo effect improving because they believe the treatment will help and because someone is finally taking their symptoms seriously Complicating the picture is the fact that some people with PTLDS symptoms apparently never had Lyme disease in the first place Dr Marques said in an interview There are other infectious organisms  EpsteinBarr virus for example  that can produce similar symptoms and may be the real culprits But experts cannot rule out Lyme spirochete as a cause either Many if not most people who are infected with it never know they have been bitten by the tiny deer tick that spreads the bacterium from animals to people They may never develop or notice the red rash that can result Even when a rash occurs only one in five is the characteristic bullseye associated with Lyme disease Most are solid red and round or oval Such people may never receive treatment for the infection in its early stages and end up weeks months even years later with the kinds of symptoms that have plagued Ms Rasenberger Symptoms may develop gradually as they did in my dog which had minimal effects from a Lymecarrying tick until nine months later when he collapsed unable to eat or drink on his own Both Dr Aucott and Dr Marques said more research is desperately needed if people are to get the help they need This is a huge disease thats only going to get bigger yet it receives only a tiny fraction of the NIH budget Dr Aucott said referring to the National Institutes of Health Given the uncertainties about chronic Lyme disease prevention is more important than ever Avoid walking through brush and high grass When hiking in the woods camping gardening or mowing the lawn wear long lightcolored clothing and tuck pant legs into tightfitting socks Spray exposed skin with a percent DEET insect repellent and clothing with permethrin Remove clothes before coming back indoors and wash and dry them separately Shower as soon as possible after being outdoors using a washcloth or loofah and check your body carefully especially in skin folds for attached   They should be carefully removed with a tweezer without crushing them by pulling gently and steadily near the mouth Then apply an antiseptic to the site
