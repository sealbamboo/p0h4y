Under the Affordable Care Act nearly everyone will be required to have health insurance If they dont theyll have to pay the federal government a tax penalty But it turns out this is a case where there are deadlines and then there are   deadlines And with the federally run health insurance exchange at   so mired in technology problems figuring out the what counts as a real deadline has become a very hot topic On Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney   when people are allowed to enroll in an insurance plan and when the penalties for not doing so kick in And those are going to be addressed he said In a media briefing Thursday Health and Human Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said of the March  deadline confusion We are working on it and will have something soon Heres a cheat sheet for sorting through the deadlines  and what the White House may need to do to clarify things That is the date when the socalled individual mandate to have health insurance becomes law If you dont already get insurance through your job including COBRA or a retirement plan or public programs such as Medicare Medicaid or the VA youre supposed to buy insurance on the health insurance exchanges To be insured by Jan  youd have to do that by Dec  The confusion comes from   that spell out some of the nittygritty details about how the Affordable Care Act is to be implemented One of those IRS rules says that people dont have to pay the tax penalty if they have a short gap in their coverage The IRS defined a short gap as lasting less than three months So heres the rub What if you start your short gap on Jan  Reading the IRS rules you might conclude that you could drag it out for less than three months and wait until March  to get insured Well no Remember how you needed to sign up by Dec  to be covered by Jan  Theres always this lag If you signed up for insurance on March  it wouldnt take effect until May  Youd have to pay the tax penalty for the month of April its prorated Nope This is where it gets really technical If your coverage doesnt start until April  then the IRS would consider your coverage gap to be more than three months Youd still have to pay the tax penalty for the month of April Yes See why this is confusing The way the rules are currently written the final deadline  if you dont want to pay any tax penalty at all  is Feb  That would have you insured as of March  That represents a sixweek grace period from the Jan  deadline weve been hearing about So if you dread the idea of buying insurance on the exchange  but dread the idea of paying a tax penalty even more  youve got a little time to drag your heels But six weeks also represents a much shorter grace period than the roughly day time frame that seems to have been the spirit of what the IRS intended in its rules On Wednesday the White House released a statement that said If you sign up for insurance by the end of March you will not face a penalty So its possible that the ultimate deadline will move again But the IRS will have to revise its rules to make that happen The US Department of Health and Human Services has released   The deadline for enrollment remains Mar  If you enroll between Feb  and Apr  you will not pay a penalty However if you do this you will need to claim a hardship exemption on your  tax return filed in  HHS says additional details will be provided on how to claim this exemption will be provided in
