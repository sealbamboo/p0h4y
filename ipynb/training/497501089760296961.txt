Over the past few months reporters and editors of The Times have debated a subject that has come up regularly ever since the world learned of the CIAs brutal questioning of terrorism suspects whether to call the practices torture When the first revelations emerged a decade ago the situation was murky The details about what the Central Intelligence Agency did in its interrogation rooms were vague The word torture had a specialized legal meaning as well as a plainEnglish one While the methods set off a national debate the Justice Department insisted that the techniques did not rise to the legal definition of  torture The Times described what we knew of the program but avoided a label that was still in dispute instead using terms like harsh or brutal interrogation methods 
  
But as we have covered the recent fight over the Senate report on the CIAs interrogation program  which is expected to be the most definitive accounting of the program to date  reporters and editors have revisited the issue Over time the landscape has shifted Far more is now understood such as that the CIA inflicted the suffocation technique called waterboarding  times on a single detainee and that other techniques such as locking a prisoner in a claustrophobic box prolonged sleep deprivation and shackling peoples bodies into painful positions were routinely employed in an effort to break their wills to resist interrogation Meanwhile the Justice Department under both the Bush and Obama administrations has made clear that it will not prosecute in connection with the interrogation program The result is that today the debate is focused less on whether the methods violated a statute or treaty provision and more on whether they worked  that is whether they generated useful information that the government could not otherwise have obtained from prisoners In that context the disputed legal meaning of the word torture is secondary to the common meaning the intentional infliction of pain to make someone talk Given those changes reporters urged that The Times recalibrate its language I agreed So from now on The Times will use the word torture to describe incidents in which we know for sure that interrogators inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information
