 Ultrasound equipment used for physical therapy may have potential as a   according to a new animal study Based on their findings with lab rats the researchers said its possible that the commercially available equipment could make men   by lowering their sperm counts In conducting the study researchers from the department of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine rotated highfrequency ultrasound around male rat testes warming them to  degrees centigrade about  degrees F They found two minute ultrasound sessions two days apart were most effective resulting in a sperm count index of zero The study is published Jan  in the journal   Unlike humans rats remain fertile even with extremely   said James Tsuruta of the UNC School of Medicine in a journal news release However our noninvasive ultrasound treatment reduced sperm reserves in rats far below levels normally seen in fertile men  percent of fertile men have more than  million sperm in their ejaculate Tsuruta said more research is needed to determine how long sperm counts would remain low and whether or not the ultrasound procedure is safe for more than one use While studies involving animals can be useful they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans
