A   finds the US birth rate has dropped to its lowest level on record led by a dramatic decline in births among immigrant women The trend has been visible at La Clinica del Pueblo a nonprofit in Washington DC that holds a weekly neonatal clinic We went from about  pregnancies to  to  another year with  and then  says Dr Madeline Wilks Her patients are largely foreignborn Hispanics Some are in the US legally some are not and many are uninsured Wilks isnt exactly sure why so many have decided not to have babies in recent years Weve been puzzling over that she says The drop is all the more striking because immigrants have long propped up the US birth rate keeping it higher than that of many other developed nations But Thursdays report by the   finds that while the US birth rate is down generally since the recession its fallen twice as much among the foreignborn Many of La Clinica del Pueblos immigrant patrons hold lowwage jobs with no benefits like paid leave says Wilks making money a worry for many of her clients We do have people who just cant feed their families if theyre not working And they cant work when theyre with new babies Wilks says she even had a patient last year who put her baby up for adoption And thats just not done in this community she says Ive never seen that But she just really clearly said I need to give my baby a chance And it was heartbreaking Dr Joshua Kolko another physician at La Clinica del Pueblo says he sees more women carefully planning their pregnancies Longterm contraceptives are particularly popular he says A lot of women are coming to us and asking for some means of contraception he says or of timing their pregnancies for when they are in a more stable situation The Pew report also breaks down birth rates by national origin  with particularly significant findings for some populations We found that for Mexicans in particular the declines were really dramatic says Pew senior researcher Gretchen Livingston Researchers found the birth rate for Mexican immigrants has fallen a stunning  percent since  She says   has found a strong link between fertility and those who fared worst in the recent recession Hispanics were the hardest hit in terms of employment she says Their wealth declined by something like  percent during the recession Also important she notes is that Hispanics   themselves as being extremely hard hit by the recession There may be other factors at work beyond the economy Theres also been an ongoing if less publicized crackdown on workplaces that employ those in the US illegally The number of deportations rose to nearly  in   a record level That uncertainty has immigrants secondguessing their choices says Xiomara Corpeno of the   There is a lot more uncertainty  Like well Were together we have this family wed love to expand it but we dont know if were going to be here tomorrow  she says Even if immigrants continue grappling with those wrenching decisions the Pew report projects that the foreign born will continue to drive US population growth in coming decades The vast majority of births the researchers predict will be to immigrants whove arrived just since  and their descendants
