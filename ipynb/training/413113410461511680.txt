If everyone over the age of  ate an apple a day  deaths from heart attacks and strokes could be avoided every year in the UK say researchers Apples would give a similar boost to cardiovascular health as medicines such as statins yet carry none of the sideeffects the University of Oxford researchers say in the BMJ  They base their assumptions on modelling not direct scientific study  Any fruit should work but getting people to comply could be challenging  More than twothirds of adults do not eat the recommended five portions of fruit and veg a day population surveys suggest  And although nine in  of us do manage to eat at least one portion a day Dr Adam Briggs and colleagues from the British Heart Foundation Health Promotion Research Group at Oxford University say we would all benefit from eating more By their calculations if adults of all ages could manage to eat an extra portion of fruit or veg a day as many as  vascular deaths could be averted each year  The Victorian mantra of an apple a day to keep the doctor away is particularly important for the overs who are at increased risk of vascular diseases say the researchers They analysed the effect on the most common causes of vascular mortality  heart attacks and strokes  of prescribing either a statin a day which lowers cholesterol or an apple a day to people over  Assuming at least seven in every  complied with the advice statin drugs could save  lives and an apple a day  lives a year they calculate  The data their work rests on comprises a large body of medical trials and observations involving hundreds of thousands of patients Dr Briggs said The Victorians had it about right when they came up with their brilliantly clear and simple public health advice An apple a day keeps the doctor away  It just shows how effective small changes in diet can be and that both drugs and healthier living can make a real difference in preventing heart disease and stroke While noone currently prescribed statins should replace them for apples we could all benefit from simply eating more fruit  Dr Peter Coleman of the Stroke Association said everyone stood to benefit from eating a balanced diet Apples have long been known as a natural source of antioxidants and chemical compounds called flavanoids all of which are good for our health and wellbeing  This study shows that as part of a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruit and veg a daily apple could help to reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease
