Consumers shopping for coverage on the new health insurance exchanges have been focused on the lowestcost options But some shoppers are trying to determine which plans offer the widest array of doctors and hospitals  and are finding that can be trickier than it sounds John Batteiger applied for insurance coverage on the New York state exchange But after hed selected a plan he had second thoughts Hed forgotten to check if the plan he picked included a hospital near him Batteiger is  and healthy But all things being equal he figures why not make sure his neighborhood hospitals are considered innetwork with his insurance plans Turned out that wasnt so easy to figure out on his own So he and   a   are in a Manhattan office doing some digging After a little hunting and pecking Batteiger learns that a nearby hospital Lenox Hill was not in the first plan he chose Eventually he did find a plan that includes Lenox  and also brings his monthly premium down from about  to  per month To save  a month  thats a really good thing Batteiger says Its safe to say however that not everyone will be so lucky New York City has a lot of hospitals to choose from but many of them are considered innetwork for only a few insurance plans   vice president of public policy and communications at the National Committee for Quality Assurance says health plans get better deals by limiting the number of innetwork hospitals If a health plan can say Instead of five hospitals in this city were going to have three then those three hospitals that are included in the network might be able to give some discounts to the health plan she explains Insurers and hospitals are often locked in a tugofwar over prices Smaller clinics and doctors offices have a lot less leverage than hospitals  but they also need to make decisions about which insurance networks to join And many are sitting on the sidelines  president of Family Health Institute serves lowincome residents in the Bronx many of whom have complex health needs He says some of the plans are offering extremely low medical reimbursement rates They claim that they are putting their premiums out on the street at a very low rate to make them affordable he says But we cant afford to see a patient for the same amount of money that a private doctor in their office with one assistant can Calman accepts five plans A handful of others wanted to pay him less than what he receives from Medicaid A trade association of New York doctors   and found that threefourths of them are either not participating in exchange plans or are unsure if they are Benjamin the health exchange navigator is also a senior policy adviser at the Community Service Society which aids lowerincome families She says New York has done a good job generally making sure the all policies have enough innetwork providers  but things are still in flux It is a game of musical chairs The providers and the health insurance companies are still  the musics still playing she says But eventually the music will stop and then well really have a strong sense of who the actual provider list is And that will continue happening over the next few years Benjamin printed out a comparison chart for her client Batteiger of the plans hes considering purchasing Batteiger whos been uninsured since June says hes not worried about finding a personal physician who accepts this or that plan since hell be starting from scratch anyway But for other consumers who care about going to particular hospitals or doctors Benjamin advises calling those offices before signing on to a plan
