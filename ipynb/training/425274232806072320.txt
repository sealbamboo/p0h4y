He was born and he looked as healthy as any of my other children said Sarah Moore whose son Jaxon was the first to die I held him And then three weeks later I was burying him Shortly after the fifth death in  Kentucky Childrens   and placed its only pediatric heart surgeon on leave At the time the babies parents said they didnt receive any explanation And today theyre still waiting for answers Something happened Lewis said Cant nobody give me no answers But now pediatric heart surgeries are resuming at Kentucky Childrens Hospital  without any reported investigation by the state health department and without oversight by anyone  There seems to be no medical governing body that needs to sign off on the decision to reopen the heart surgery unit The only person I need permission from is me said Dr Michael Karpf executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentuckys health care system which includes Kentucky Childrens Hospital  Last year Karpf said he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates werent what he wanted them to be They were OK and OK isnt good enough for me he said at the time Its got to be better Its got to be good Karpf commissioned   PDF on the heart surgery program Parents of the dead babies hoped that might provide them with some information But the page report doesnt explain why the babies died In fact it doesnt acknowledge any deaths at all  How do you know when the problems have been fixed when theyre not identified asked Kevin Allen whose daughter Kalyn died in January  I mean they could say they fixed them But is an internal review really objective Asked in May whether parents should trust that Kentucky Childrens would fix any issues before reopening the program Karpf threw his hands in the air This is America he said You know they have a choice They can trust us or not trust us All I can tell them is Im not going to reopen until I feel good about it Its as simple as that A hospital spokesman declined a request for another interview with Karpf referring questions to a   about the internal report CNN reached Karpf this month as he arrived to speak at a community center and asked whether he could give parents some answers about why their children died Unfortunately babies die at childrens hospitals after having heart surgery at other places also he said We explained to you that our mortality rate fit the national standards Kentucky Childrens however has been reticent to release statistics on the program unlike other hospitals that are more transparent After a legal battle  which saw the Kentucky attorney general requesting data and the university appealing to a state circuit court  the hospital released the following number Patients at Kentucky Childrens Hospital were dying after all heart surgeries at the alarming rate of  Thats more than double the national average of  Karpf wont say how well it performed specific heart surgeries on children information that some hospitals put on their websites We as parents deserve this information said Jennifer Allen Kalyns mother I expect nothing more from a health care facility than honest answers And whether its good or bad we should know I mean thats not too much to ask Shannon Hall whose son Mason died says its scary that the hospital is going to be taking pediatric heart patients again It really hurts that theyre going to open this program back up Lewis said Im very scared for the kids I dont want nobody else to go through this again Moore said shes worried about the same thing that happened to my baby  I never brought my child home He never left the hospital However Kentucky Childrens says its doing things differently The surgeon placed on leave has since left so a new heart surgeon will be hired The hospital also will dedicate an intensive care unit specifically for heart surgery patients and is considering forming a partnership with another hospital for pediatric heart surgeries In addition the hospital says it will no longer perform the most difficult types of heart surgeries But that doesnt satisfy the parents still mourning their children Sometimes you feel like youre alone through it Hall said I dont think that it gets any easier ever Moore said Ive been told my entire life that time heals everything I dont believe that I still miss my baby Every day
