So why is every day still a struggle for the   and mother of five    I have had to deal with teachers who hand out Skittles candy bars lollipops and giant frosted sugar cookies to the children in class  before  am McDonald says I think this is setting kids up for failure and unteaching the healthy habits I have instilled The fact that doughnuts and cupcakes are given out as a reward after soccer practice or dance class is a paradoxical hurdle in the fight against childhood obesity As doctors and parents struggle to encourage healthy behaviors our sugarfilled sedentary surroundings resist every step  Think about it says Dr Stephen Daniels chief pediatrician at   Every day kids are exposed to advertising about fast food instead of homecooked meals Theyre surrounded by vending and soda machines at school They have hundreds of channels on TV own three video game systems and live in neighborhoods that were built without sidewalks  Our environment is constantly pushing kids in the wrong direction Childhood obesity isnt just a cosmetic issue although   overweight children are often isolated and bullied by their peers  Obese youth are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease diabetes sleep apnea liver disease and bone and joint problems   Excess fat has also been linked to many types of cancer  About twothirds of obese children  adults  Gary Evans is an environmental and developmental psychologist at   His latest study published this year in the   analyzed the effects of stress on weight gain in children and adolescents  Researchers know that both adults and children seek higher fat foods in response to stress Evans and his team found that stress also damages a childs ability for selfcontrol which leads to a higher body mass index as a teen  Evans examined children who were dealing with stressful situations such as poverty single parenthood housing problems and domestic violence In the study stress hormones hurt the brains prefrontal cortex  the one responsible for our ability to plan and avoid temptations  at the cellular level    See also  Its kind of a quadruple whammy Evans notes Lower income children have less healthy food stores nearby more junk food available because its cheap fewer places to play outdoors and as his team found out a harder time curbing bad impulses  If you are born poor your life expectancy is less Evans wrote in an email Perhaps even more striking  upward mobility does not remove the ill effects of early childhood poverty on subsequent health and wellbeing  For parents trying to raise healthy kids this is all kind of depressing  What we need to do as a society is work to make the healthier choice the easier choice says Daniels There has been movement in that direction Policymakers are  for healthier food in schools and local programs are   But realistically an environmental overhaul could take years  Theres a danger in being too pessimistic about the influence we have on the ways our kids live Daniels says Research shows that children who lose weight are less likely to gain it back than teenagers or adults As hard as it is to make a change at age  its that much easier than at  or   Twins Molly and Chris McGann  are perfect examples of this In third grade Molly was bullied for being overweight The McGanns started attending the   at Childrens Hospital Colorado    Shape Downs instructors taught the whole family how to measure their food cook with different colors  broccoli red peppers carrots  and include exercise in their daily lives Molly dropped the extra pounds and is still at a healthy weight Her twin Chris hit a tough spot in middle school when undiagnosed sleep apnea caused his weight to creep up  As a teenager he is finding it more difficult to stay on track because of peer pressure His school cafeteria for instance has a pizza buffet and a long line of desserts available every day  My friends eat the pizza and the Little Debbie cakes and theyre all as thin as rails he says Its really hard to walk by that stuff because it looks so good I just think I want to be healthy I want to lose weight and I know if I eat those things its not going to happen  Daniels doesnt talk about dieting or weight loss with his patients He talks about getting the entire family on board to eat healthier and be more active  You have to understand what kinds of behaviors are leading to the problem and the changes to take he says Its helpful to go slow Its about simple goals You dont have to get to a perfect weight in order to have the health benefits For more help conquering your environment the Mayo Clinic has suggestions on
