Facebook has rolled out a tool to address online harassment that some digital safety advocates are calling a beneficial but belated first step The social networking site with  billion users worldwide released a   this week Its essentially an online resource center with suggestions for teens parents and educators on how to address bullying  both online and off  and take action on Facebook The site is also beginning to roll out more options for teens to report when posts are making them uncomfortable The idea is to build on Facebooks existing tools says company spokesman Matt Steinfeld For example the site unveiled social reporting in  which encouraged users to send a message to a friend asking for help or ask another user to take down a photo The latter was particularly successful Steinfeld says  percent of the time if you reach out to a user who has a photo you dont want to be in that user will take it off We were pretty impressed when we rolled out social reporting a couple of years ago that people were willing to engage with each other as long as we suggested some text to use he says And Facebook hopes this will be true of bullying as well The hub gives suggested conversation starters for victims Hey NAME  that comment wasnt funny I dont like it please take it down as well as for people who are accused of bullying and people who witness it Theres a lot of literature on how people interact face to face  What were trying to do is apply those studies to an online setting And its tough Steinfeld says People are really hungry for help Jim Steyer is CEO of Common Sense Media an organization that promotes safe technology and media for kids and he says hes glad to see Facebook taking positive steps toward combating online harassment He also says this should have been done earlier We think cyberbullying is an enormous challenge facing every young person Steyer says Facebook has been a big part of the problem in this area He also says that Facebooks everchanging privacy policy confuses users instead of keeping them safe But Facebooks Steinfeld says the company is serious about the cause Bullying prevention has been something weve worked on for a long time he says Were the first Internet company thats putting bullying prevention resources in the heart of the product itself Other Internet companies are more and more taking the blame for recent bullyingrelated teen suicides Rebecca Ann Sedwick a yearold girl who died in September had been harassed on Facebook   But after her mother closed Rebeccas account the bullying returned viciously on other social messaging applications like Askfm Kik and Voxer Londons  also links Askfm  a site where people can ask each other questions often anonymously  to   in Britain and Ireland Its part of a larger teen migration away from Facebook Steyer says Last week the companys chief financial officer David Ebersman told analysts that although usage among US teens overall has been stable we did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens Earlier this fall financial services firm Piper Jaffray reported that   was the most important social network down from  percent last fall And  percent of teens say social networks other than Facebook Twitter Instagram Google Tumblr or Pinterest were the most important up from only  percent a year ago According to Common Sense Media middleschoolers are most affected by online harassment So will an antibullying campaign on Facebook affect the age group that needs it the most There are enough teens still on Facebook that it could says Jennifer Hartstein a psychologist who works with adolescents and digital behavior And maybe its a good model for other sites that teens are now going to Steyer says the effort will be most effective when it spreads to Instagram which Facebook owns and beyond These sites have to take way more responsibility for this
