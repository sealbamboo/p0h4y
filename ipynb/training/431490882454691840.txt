What could be more likely to draw international headlines and jokes on latenight talk shows than a government report that includes both an alleged waste of Medicare money and erectile dysfunction Even without dopey jokes about swelling costs and rising whatevers this story was bound to get attention The federal Department of Health and Human Services dispatched its Office of Inspector General to review Medicare payments for vacuum erection systems less formally known as penis pumps Its recent report revealed that   which draw blood into the penis creating an erection that allows a man to have intercourse From  through  the investigators found Medicare paid on average  per pump Medicare beneficiaries were responsible for a  copay Medicare put up the remaining  That was more than twice what the Department of Veterans Affairs paid per pump  Searching online the investigators found that consumers could buy similar pumps for even less And Medicare paid for a whole lot of these items  more than  pumps over six years Had it paid what others paid the Inspector Generals report concluded taxpayers could have saved more than  million and beneficiaries almost  million each year Those are paltry sums in the general scheme of Medicare which spends hundreds of billions of dollars annually But anyone who wants Medicare to continue to provide health care for older and disabled Americans and avoid death by a thousand budget cuts had to shudder at the waste The   pointed out that it had made significant progress in reducing overpayments for durable medical equipment which is what a vacuum erection system is with its competitive bidding program But the agency needs Congressional authorization to add pumps to that program as the Inspector General suggested Officials said they would consider seeking it Aside from the price tag issue though there is rumbling about whether Medicare should cover penis pumps at all According to Reuters a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute which advocates free market solutions pointedly noted that retiring boomers will strain the Medicare budget and asked if politicians shouldnt be focusing this entitlement program on real lifesaving treatment and equipment to service the health needs of seniors For men who wanted a pump he added just buy it yourself  you dont need to send the bill to your fellow Americans The comments on mainstream news sites were predictably nastier with contemptuous references to geezers and old goats  We are a laughable bunch as we spend that sort of money to allow sexually dysfunctional men to have erections they have no business having read one of the milder comments on the NBC site There is an ageist current here a result of our deep discomfort with the idea of older peoples sexuality Cant we insist that Medicare not get ripped off by device manufacturers without sneering at the idea that an older man  perhaps feeling the effects of diabetes or the side effects of prostate cancer treatment  and his partner might want to have intercourse Most private health insurers cover vacuum pumps and many also cover drugs like Viagra Levitra and Cialis to treat erectile dysfunction Why should that approach change on someones th birthday The general concept is that older people are asexual that they dont have or shouldnt have any thoughts about sex said Ann Christine Frankowski associate director of the Center for Aging Studies at the University of Maryland Baltimore County whose research has included sexual behavior and policies in assisted living Theres a bias against it In    under the Part D drug plan The bills chief sponsor scoffed at Grandpas recreational sex  his language suggesting that if he couldnt avoid paying for seniors health care he at least wanted to be sure they didnt have any fun In fact beneficiaries increased use of vacuum pumps for impotence may well be a response to the fact that Medicare wont cover the pharmaceutical treatments which are considered firstline therapies Theyre the most patientfriendly said Dr Ira Sharlip a urologist at the University of California San Francisco The pumps by contrast are a little awkward a little inconvenient and not very romantic Dr Sharlip said But they do work pretty well and a lot of patients rely on them Medicare covers many things that dont save lives but do enhance health as it should And of all the things it doesnt cover we might rank dental care well ahead of penis pumps or erectile dysfunction drugs in importance But it is hardly ridiculous to think people over age  are doing it In fact as a recent New York Times opinion piece by Dr Ezekiel Emanuel pointed out   and sadly not using condoms regularly enough to prevent sexually transmitted diseases My two cents and Im eager to read yours Sexual health is part of health And you can spare us the ageist claptrap about Grandpa and his recreation sonny
