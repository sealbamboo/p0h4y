Millions of people have been trained in   in recent decades yet when people who arent in hospitals collapse from a sudden cardiac arrest relatively few bystanders attempt resuscitation Only onefourth to onethird of those who might be helped by CPR receive it before paramedics arrive With so many people trained why isnt bystander CPR done more often For one thing people forget what to do the panic that may ensue is not conducive to accurate recall Even those with medical training often cant remember the steps just a few months after learning them Rather than make a mistake some bystanders simply do nothing beyond calling  even though emergency dispatchers often tell callers how to perform CPR Then there is the yuck factor performing mouthtomouth resuscitation on a stranger So pervasive is the feeling of reluctance that researchers decided to study whether rescue breathing is really necessary Two major studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in July  clearly demonstrated that chest compressions alone were as good or even better than combining them with rescue breathing In both studies one conducted   and the other   a slightly higher percentage of people who received only bystander chest compressions survived to be discharged from the hospital with good brain function When a person collapses suddenly because the hearts electrical function goes awry it turned out there is often enough air in the lungs to sustain heart and brain function for a few minutes as long as blood is pumped continuously to those vital organs In addition some people gasp while in cardiac arrest which can bring more oxygen into the lungs Indeed the studies strongly suggested that interrupting chest compressions to administer rescue breaths actually diminishes the effectiveness of CPR in these patients Based in part on these findings the American Heart Association has removed rescue breathing from bystander CPR guidelines for teenagers and adults in sudden cardiac arrest About  Americans die every day because of sudden cardiac arrest Nearly  of such episodes occur outside hospitals each year  percent of them at home Thus the life you save with CPR may well be a relatives Sudden cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack A victim of sudden cardiac arrest collapses suddenly becomes unresponsive to gentle shaking and stops breathing normally The arrest occurs when the hearts electrical system malfunctions resulting in highly irregular signals that leave the heart unable to pump blood After just four minutes of this the brains ability to recover from a lack of oxygen begins to seriously decline About  percent of people in sudden cardiac arrest die before reaching the hospital Many of them were otherwise healthy A victims chances of survival fall by  percent to  percent every minute the heart fails to pump Since  the heart association has advocated a simplified version of bystander CPR When encountering a person who has collapsed and is unresponsive the most important emergency action  after yelling for someone to call   is to administer rapid forceful chest compressions until medical help arrives or an automated external defibrillator or AED can be used to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm Put one hand over the other with fingers entwined place them in the center of the chest between the victims nipples and press hard and fast Each compression should depress the chest by about two inches and should be repeated about  times a minute If done to the beat of Stayin Alive the old Bee Gees song the proper rhythm will be achieved The chest should be allowed to rise up momentarily between compressions to allow the heart and lungs to refill You dont have to take a course to learn compressiononly CPR You can prepare by watching a video by the American Heart Association Search online for handsonly CPR instructional video or check out   There are also   available for iPhone and Android phones Chest compressions alone should be done only for teenagers and adults in sudden cardiac arrest Conventional CPR with rescue breathing is still recommended for infants and younger children The combination should also be used for teenagers and adults in cardiac arrest who collapsed unobserved and may not have any air left in their lungs as well as for victims of drowning drug overdose or collapse because of a breathing problem The heart association has changed the recommended protocol for conventional CPR in hopes of improving its effectiveness The current recommendation is to start with  chest compressions at a rate of  a minute followed by two onesecond breaths repeating this sequence until help arrives When providing breaths the victims head should be tilted back to open the airway For an infant the rescuers mouth should completely cover the babys nose and mouth For children older than  and for adults the victims nose should be pinched and the mouth completely covered by the mouth of the rescuer who should observe the chest rising with each rescue breath
