At a basic level kissing is a biohazard What is love then if not the willingness to expose yourself to a host of nasty diseases lurking in your partners mouth But could kissing also be a tool with a purpose Psychology graduate student   from the University of Oxford wanted to find out Results from his experiments supported two of the existing hypotheses about why we kiss First we kiss to assess potential mates Second we kiss the mate weve found to maintain attachment And while kissing may result in arousal he says its probably not a driving reason why people in romantic relationships kiss each other Killjoy The findings   in the   So how did Wlodarski figure this out He posted a questionnaire on an online repository for psychology studies For the chance to win an online shopping voucher  people in about  countries responded to questions about how they value kissing in various romantic situations Most of them were in the US and the UK Wlodarksi concluded from the response that men and women value kissing for different reasons Men are more likely to initiate kissing before sex when it might be used for arousal purposes whereas women are more likely to initiate kissing after sex where it might better serve a relationship maintenance function he writes A lot of good kissing was associated with a better relationship and satisfaction with the amount of sex Lots of sex however wasnt related to the quality of the relationship There seems to be something special about kissing Wlodarksi tells Shots Wlodarksi also found that overall women rated kissing as more important than men did Women were also more likely than men to feel a change in attraction after a first kiss Longterm partners said kissing was more important than did those in shortterm relationships In a companion paper     Wlodarski speculates that the hormone progesterone which fluctuates with menstrual cycle may guide a womans attitude toward kissing Past research showed that when a womans progesterone levels are high she may prefer healthylooking men with   men who   and men with   But birth control pills end up flattening out the natural monthly ebb and flow of female hormones Female study participants gave the date of their last periods and indicated if they were on birth control or not If they took the pill or had irregular periods they were excluded from the analysis Within naturally cycling women theres actually a very regular pattern of hormonal release especially of estrogen and progesterone says Wlodarski who was able to analyze results for about  women It correlated very highly with their attitudes toward kissing When a woman kisses a man she might be subconsciously detecting and scrutinizing his chemical signals generating some sort of instinctual health profile of the guy Especially if shes in the stage of her menstrual cycle when she can get pregnant most easily Kissing could all boil down to smell acting mostly as a way of getting people close enough to take a deep whiff of each other Past research  like a famed experiment that involved sniffing    has shown that by smelling someones odors animals and maybe people can get a sense of a mates health and genetic compatibility Mouthtomouth contact might give the tests an extra boost with taste tests of skin oils and saliva compounds More often than not kissing involves some sort of facetoface contact often that allows people to get close enough to smell each other says Sheril Kirshenbaum author of   a book about the history of kissing Kissing hasnt always been popular and it hasnt always looked the same When the Black Death struck in the Middle Ages she says kissing lost popularity She   early explorers and tradesmen noticed alternative behaviors to kissing during their travels  like nipping eyebrows licking or sniffing One of the earliest written mentions of kissing appears in the   dating back to at least  BC Kissing was initially described as inhaling the other persons spirit says Wlodarski And whats known as an Inuit kiss involved placing your nose on a loved ones cheek or forehead and inhaling deeply In the end kissing may be a good tool but a good face sniff could work just as well
