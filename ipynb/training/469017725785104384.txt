Robin Reath was getting a routine checkup recently when her doctor brought up something new about cervical cancer screening We might be doing something a little bit different than what weve been doing in the past when weve screened you said   an internist at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington For years doctors have been using the Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer The Pap involves swabbing some cells from a womans cervix to examine them for any signs of abnormalities Its credited with a steep decline in the number of cases of cervical cancer in the United States  and a drop in deaths from the disease Now  the sort of new thinking is  actually looking at just doing HPV testing  so just looking for the virus Singer explained to Reath referring to the human papilloma virus the primary cause of cervical cancer Reath who also works at Georgetowns hospital told Singer shed heard something about the new test but didnt really understand what it meant for her own health What it means for Reath  and for all women these days  is the subject of an intense debate The Food and Drug Administration   an HPV test for use as a primary screening tool for cervical cancer The tests manufacturer   argues that the HPV test can catch more women at risk for cervical cancer early If we can detect either the risk or early disease much earlier on then we should have many fewer women ultimately getting cervical cancer says Paul Brown who heads the company And thats of course the holy grail But not everyones so sure One concern is that while many women have HPV only some of them will get cervical cancer Like a cold virus everyone gets it says  a womens health policy analyst at George Washington University It comes and it goes Its only if the virus happens to stay around for a period of years that it is associated with the precancerous conditions which  if not treated  could go on to become cancer So screening everyone for the virus will end up scaring a lot of women for no reason Wood says In addition it could lead to many women going on to get unnecessary followup tests including a procedure known as a   That procedure which uses a magnifying device and a mildly acidic wash to take a close look at highlighted cells of the cervix is somewhat expensive somewhat painful and can result in finding abnormalities that may result in biopsies that can actually cause real harm to the woman says   of the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund a Washingtonbased advocacy group Biopsies for example can increase a womans risk for preterm deliveries In addition a small minority of cervical cancers are not caused by HPV Zuckerman says raising the possibility that HPV screening would miss women at risk for those Our greatest fear is that replacing the Pap smear with the HPV test will result in more getting cervical cancer  and dying from cervical cancer  rather than fewer she says But Roche and some other experts disagree They point to a study the company sponsored that involved more than  women The results clearly showed the advantages of HPV testing Brown says What we were able to show was that  in  women who were clear by a normal Pap test had already got precancer Brown says So it just drives home the point that you know as good as a normal Pap is it does miss disease that you can pick up and detect with an HPV test Amid the debate many doctors are trying to decide whether to use the test and how Although there have been a lot of people very aggressive at the extremes of the issue like with most controversies the truth is in between says   of Virginia Commonwealth University I dont think there is any huge problem with this I dont as yet see huge advantages compared to what were currently doing For her part Reath is looking forward to trying the new test You always kind of wonder  Do they see everything  says Reath A test thats more specific she says makes her feel more like theyre going to be looking exactly for what could cause cervical cancer To help doctors and patients sort all this out the   and the are leading the effort to develop interim guidelines for how to use the HPV test for cervical cancer screening Those guidelines the groups say could come as early as this summer
