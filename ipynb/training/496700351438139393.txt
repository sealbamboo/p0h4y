Writebol was wheeled into   early Tuesday afternoon on a gurney wearing a white fullbody protective suit and escorted by two people wearing similar gear There she joins her fellow missionary   who became the first Ebola patient ever in the United States on Saturday for treatment in a special isolation unit It is one of four of its kind in the United States designed to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases  Nancy is still very weak but has shown signs of improvement said Bruce Johnson president of Christian mission group SIM USA with which Writebol is affiliated Writebols arrival contrasted with that of Brantly who wore a similar suit but walked into the hospital Saturday with someones assistance  Writebol of North Carolina and Brantly of Texas and Indiana were on a joint Samaritans PurseSIM team caring for Ebola patients last month when they became sick in Liberia That is one of four West African nations hit by an outbreak that the   believes has sickened  people and killed  of them Writebols two sons expect to communicate with her soon Johnson said The family was considering funeral arrangements for her just last week days after she became sick David Writebol said through Johnson Yet we kept our faith and now we have real reason to be hopeful David Writebol said in a statement read by Johnson Though there is no proven treatment or vaccine for Ebola   and Writebol were recently given an   in Liberia while they were awaiting evacuation to the United States Both have since shown significant improvement sources said on condition of anonymity The gruesome disease that can torment victims with profuse vomiting uncontrollable bleeding and organ failure is ravaging West Africa The outbreak started this year in Guinea but also has affected Liberia Sierra Leone and Nigeria Though Writebol was weak she had yogurt before her flight early Saturday from Liberia to the United States Johnson said She was taken to the plane by stretcher but she stood up and entered the plane with assistance he said The experimental drug ZMapp which Brantly and Writebol received despite the medication never being subjected to clinical trials is getting a lot of attention Just last Thursday Brantlys condition in Liberia had deteriorated so badly that he called his wife to say goodbye  But three vials of ZMapp stored at subzero temperatures were flown into Liberia Brantly and Writebol took the drug and their conditions improved before they evacuated to the United States The medicine is thought to work by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells Its a threemouse monoclonal antibody  meaning mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and the antibodies generated within the mices blood were harvested to create the medicine While Brantly and Writebols conditions improved after taking the drug the serum shouldnt be viewed as a miracle cure internist and gastroenterologist Dr Jorge Rodriguez said  Lets be cautious We dont even know really if this serum is working Rodriguez said Im glad now that these patients were brought to a hospital where so many tests can be done where they can see the response of their body to this serum We dont know if these patients are naturally getting better or whether the serum is really doing something Many have asked why the two Americans received the experimental drug when so many in West Africa also have the virus The World Health Organization says it was not involved in the decision to treat Brantly and Writebol Both patients had to give consent to receive the drug knowing it had never been tested in humans before The process by which the medication was made available to the American patients may have fallen under the US Food and Drug Administrations compassionate use regulation which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials Ebola doesnt spread through the air or water The disease spreads through contact with infected organs and bodily fluids such as blood saliva and urine Historically the odds have not been good Previous Ebola outbreaks have had a fatality rate of  but the current outbreak in West Africa has a rate of about  perhaps because of early treatment  There is no FDAapproved treatment for Ebola Emory will use supportive care for its two Ebola patients unit supervisor Dr Bruce Ribner said  That means carefully tracking a patients symptoms vital signs and organ function and using blood transfusions and dialysis to keep patients stable The National Institutes of Health plans to begin testing an experimental Ebola vaccine in people as early as September Tests on primates have been successful In the s an Ebola strain tied to monkeys  EbolaReston  was found in the United States but no humans got sick from it according to the CDC A man hospitalized in New York City was in strict isolation Monday and Tuesday waiting to learn whether he has the disease  The patient became ill after recently traveling to West Africa New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital said Doctors were trying to confirm the cause of the mans high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms A specimen from the patient was delivered to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta testing typically is completed within  hours the hospital said Tuesday But odds are this is not Ebola said Dr Jeremy Boal chief medical officer of the Mount Sinai Health System Its much more likely that its a much more common condition  The patient was stable Monday night into Tuesday and was in good spirits the hospital said in a news release Tuesday CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta agrees About half a dozen people have recently returned from West Africa and gotten tested because of symptoms but none of those cases has been confirmed as Ebola Gupta said Doctors in Saudi Arabia are   as they treat a yearold man who recently returned from Sierra Leone  The man was in critical condition Tuesday with symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever the Saudi Health Ministry said  The source of his infection remains unknown but Ebola cannot be ruled out the ministry said
