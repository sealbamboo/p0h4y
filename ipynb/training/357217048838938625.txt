Sometimes a drug hits cancer hard Sometimes the cancer cells are unfazed But its often hard to know which outcome to expect A group of scientists at the   has spent the last three years turning some mathematical algorithms loose on giant sets of data to better understand the relationship between cancerous cells and cancer drugs Theyve decided to make the data public and published their   this week in   Shots called molecular pharmacologist   who led the research team to find out more Cancer is more difficult to treat in certain tissues including the colon breasts ovaries kidneys lungs and also leukemia and melanoma he says So he and his crew harvested  types of human tumor cells for each of these cancer types They put the cells in petri dishes and let them split over and over again After a while the had created something they called the NCI Think of it as simplified cancer simulator that could stand in for tumors in the lab Pommier explains the genetic side of the story For each of the cells in the NCI weve sequenced the coding part of the genome he says This coding part of the genome is called the exome and it contains the information needed to make proteins Just like genome sequencing exome sequencing creates a gigantic set of data that Pommier says gives the genetic landscape of each cell This is held up to the healthy   to identify the genetic variations that are specific to cancer For an explanation of the drug side of things Shots called on   the Director of the Divison of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the NCI and also a member of the research group Thousands of chemical compounds have been screened through the NCI he says To be screened a drug is added into the petri dish with each of the cancer cells We look for growth inhibition growth stabilization or no growth response he says More drugs have been screened across this panel of cell lines than any other panel in the world and for the past several years this has been a free service Send us a group of molecules and we will screen it for you and give the results back Doroshow says And the fruits of these efforts Millions of data points explaining the genetic mutations in cancer cells plus millions more data points quantifying how cancer cells react to chemical compounds The next step was to find connections between the two huge data sets so they brought in the mathematicians They came up with a powerful algorithm to predict the effectiveness of an anticancer drug This socalled   algorithm takes in the chemical formula for a drug and then spits out some number quantifying how effective it is in the presence of genetic variations Low numbers are good high numbers are bad So they arrive at a satisfying and quantified answer And better yet they have some clues as to why genetically these numbers are what they are Although the notion of mining medical data to determine treatment options is admittedly a bit scary it can be invaluable as a tool for building hypotheses From a discovery perspective people can mine these mutation analyses and find potentially novel mechanics of drugs both old and new Doroshow says Yves Pommier pointed out one success of the NCI panel an anticancer drug called Nutlin which has been in clinical trials for several years Using the NCI database we predict that Nutlin will only work for cells with a normal   he says He hopes that this better understanding of the drug will bring it closer to FDA approval Since most cancer treatments involve a complex drug cocktail the group has also developed algorithms to explore combinations of drugs Theyve just finished analyzing every possible combination of commercial anticancer drugs  thats  unique combinations We got some unpredictable combination synergies and we hope this will drive new therapeutic combinations in patients says James Doroshow The group has decided to make all of their data publicly available on the NIH sponsored website   so that it can be widely used for hypothesisdriven pharmaceutical research and hopefully speed up our understanding and improvement of cancer treatments
