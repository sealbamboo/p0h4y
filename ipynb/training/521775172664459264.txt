
 Will history someday show that the electronic medical record almost did the great state of Texas in We do not really know whether dysfunctional software contributed to   in a Dallas emergency room when some medical mind failed to connect the dots between an African man and a viral syndrome and sent a patient with deadly Ebola back into the community Even scarier than that mistake though is the certainty that similar ones lie in wait for all of us who cope with medical information stored in digital piles grown so gigantic unwieldy and unreadable that sometimes we wind up working with no information at all We are in the middle of a simmering crisis in medical data management Like computer servers everywhere hospital servers store great masses of trivia mixed with valuable information and gross misinformation all cut and pasted and endlessly reiterated Even the best software is no match for the accumulation When we need facts we swoop over the surface like sea gulls over landfill peck out what we can and flap on There is no time to dig and even worse no time to do what we were trained to do  slow down go to the source and start from the beginning 
 This man had by then recounted the long story of his bad leg to three separate teams of doctors and nurses I was the th interrogator by my count and despite my standard opening gambit I know youve been over this before I was the one to flip his switch The patient ordered me and my team out of his room and pulled the covers over his head Who can blame him for assuming that in this day and age once told his story needed only to be retweeted But medical care requires dialogue Although we plucked some information from the glut of words in his chart and cobbled together a plan we didnt do him justice not by a long shot The fact is that even if all the redundant clinical information sitting on hospital servers everywhere were errorfree and even if excellent software made it all reasonably accessible doctors and nurses still shouldnt be spending their time reading The first thing medical students learn is the value of a full history taken directly from the patient The process takes them hours Experience whittles that time down by a bit but it always remains a substantial chunk that some feel is best devoted to more lucrative activities Enter various efficiencypromoting endeavors One of the most durable has been the multipage health questionnaire for patients to complete on a clipboard before most outpatient visits Why should the doctor expensively scribble down information when the patient can do a little free secretarial work instead Alas beware the doctor who does not review that questionnaire with you very carefully taking an active interest in every little check mark It turns out that the pathway into the medical brain like most brains is far more reliable when it runs from the hand than from the eye Force the doctor to take notes and the doctor will usually remember Ask the doctor to read and the doctor will scan skip elide omit and often forget The same problem dogs other efforts to reduce the doctors mundane historytaking responsibilities For instance Why not leave it to the nursing staff to ask all those dull questions about smoking drinking social activities and recent travel They will write it all down The doctors will review And then the next thing you know that unimportant background information explodes all over the nightly news because the doctors failed to review or failed to remember what they reviewed and key travel details simmered unnoticed in the bowels of some userunfriendly electronic medical record Over and over again we are forced to admire the old traditions As we tell the students its not that complicated You say hello you sit down and you have a conversation A few months after our expletivespewing patient got better and went home our team went to see a more cooperative young man admitted to the hospital with a fever This one had gotten sick after a camping trip in California and the words camping and California were repeated over and over again in his chart escalating into the general conviction that he had come down with a serious fungal infection that can be acquired from the soil in some parts of Southern California If this patient had refused to talk to us we might have been tempted to treat him for that infection which would have been a big mistake Fortunately he politely led us through his entire hike which proved to have skirted the habitat of this fungus by hundreds of miles We could tell his other doctors to stop focusing on his travels and pay attention to his heart murmur instead the real clue to his problems Like good police work good medicine depends on deliberate inefficient plodding expensive repetition No system of data management will ever replace it
