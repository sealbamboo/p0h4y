Technology can interfere with a good nights sleep in several ways The biggest problem is these devices are often left on at night and emit light and noise that can   and alter sleeprelated hormone levels The light from electronic screens can trick your body into thinking its daytime and stop it from producing melatonin the hormone that helps regulate sleep  News articles and games can also keep your mind very active making it difficult to relax and fall asleep  A    published in the Behavioral Sleep Medicine journal found that computer and mobile phone use before bed was positively correlated with insomnia As long as your phone is on and not in airplane mode its communicating intermittently with nearby cell towers emitting low levels of radiation While the effects of cell phone radiation arent well understood a  found people exposed to mobile radiation for three hours before going to sleep had more trouble falling into and staying in a deep sleep The result is later bedtimes and a higher incidence of waking during the night  Its not surprising then that research shows children with electronic devices in their bedrooms sleep less and experience lowerquality sleep than children without gadgets Sleep quality suffers most dramatically when devices are regularly left on during the night And the higher the number of gadgets the lower the quality of sleep   So what to do One solution is an electronic curfew One hour before bed remove all electronic devices from the bedroom  Some sleep specialists suggest no TV right before bed but some people feel they need the distraction of TV to fall asleep Those people can try using a TVtimer  featured on most modern TVs  which will automatically turn off the television after a chosen period  If you use your phone as an alarm clock consider switching to an old school alarm clock with no digital lights It will not be as disruptive to sleep  And while it might be tempting to track your sleep using an app on your tablet or phone its probably best to leave these devices in the living room Youll get a better nights sleep even if you dont have the data to prove it
