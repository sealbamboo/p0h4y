People with chronic conditions will be better protected from crippling medical bills starting in January as the health laws coverage requirements and spending limits take effect But a   by Avalere Health found that many people may still find themselves underinsured spending more than  percent of their income on medical care not including premiums even if they qualify for costsharing subsidies on the health insurance marketplaces You have some great protections in place but these outofpocket costs and how plans are structured are going to create some serious problems says Marc Boutin executive vice president at the   an advocacy group for people with chronic health conditions Potential trouble spots include prescription drugs specialist care and services such as physical therapy that typically require a course of treatment over weeks or months The   from turning down sick people for coverage and generally eliminates lifetime and annual dollar limits on benefits including hospitalization and prescription drugs The law also caps the amount people spend outofpocket in  at  for individuals and  for families that buy a plan on the individual and small group markets including the health insurance exchanges People with incomes below  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual or  for a family of four in  may qualify for costsharing subsidies on the marketplaces that reduce those caps as well as their deductibles and copayments The Avalere analysis found that many chronically ill people especially those in bronze or silver plans that offer less generous coverage will likely reach their outofpocket maximum every year John Earley worries he may be one of them Earley  has severe   a condition that causes painful itchy red patches on his skin After he was diagnosed more than  years ago topical creams and ultraviolet light treatments that slow the growth of skin cells worked for a while But eventually their effectiveness waned He finally found relief with a prescription drug called   The twice monthly injections cost more than  but the Texas highrisk pool through which Earley and his wife are insured covers the drug with a  copayment The drugs manufacturer AbbVie covers all but  of that amount through its   Their insurance premium is  per month With the Texas highrisk pool   early next year Earley who works on contract as an architect in Arlington is checking into plans on the health insurance marketplace The plan with the best Humira coverage  a  copay per refill  is a gold plan with a  monthly premium for the two of them says Earley Plans with lower premiums would require  to  percent coinsurance for the drug which is in a highcost specialty tier What Im finding with the insurance policies that are available its going to cost you either way says Earley The gold plan with the best Humira coverage would cost roughly a quarter of their income says Earley who is not eligible for tax credits to subsidize his premium cothsts But that may be their best option even with financial assistance from the drugs manufacturer given the high drug coinsurance charges on the other plans Drug costs are perhaps the most often cited coverage concern for people with chronic conditions but there are others say experts Access to specialists and to academic medical centers with the necessary expertise can be problematic on the marketplaces where many insurers have opted for a narrow network of doctors and hospitals in order to keep a lid on premiums A recent McKinsey  Co   found that  percent of the  plans it examined offered narrow hospital networks that excluded at least  percent of an areas biggest hospitals Academic medical centers were generally part of broader plans whose premiums were  percent higher than average For people who need specialist care narrow networks can be problematic since the laws limits on what a patient spends outofpocket only apply to innetwork care Dermatologists trained in handling severe psoriasis may not be in network nor the academic medical centers that some people need for treatment says Leah Howard director of government relations and advocacy at the National Psoriasis Foundation On the other end of the spectrum sometimes the outofpocket costs for effective treatments such as phototherapy can deter patients who would have to make a copayment for perhaps dozens of sessions Weve seen people who would prefer to be on phototherapy but cant afford  in copays over eight weeks so they end up stepping up to a systemic treatment says Howard In addition although dollar limits on benefits arent allowed plans typically limit the number of sessions for certain treatments such as physical therapy Because of the rocky rollout of the exchange websites in many states many consumers have found it difficult to get basic information about premiums and plan deductibles say experts Many dont know which providers are in the plan networks or what benefits the plans cover As more and more people become covered and as people start to use their plans well see if the cost protections in the plans are sufficient and directed toward getting people the care they need says Sara Collins a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund
