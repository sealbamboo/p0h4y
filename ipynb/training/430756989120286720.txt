People who need expensive drugs to treat serious medical conditions often rely on   for help But its uncertain whether the help will be allowed for people who buy health insurance on the marketplaces established by the federal health law With open enrollment ending in less than two months federal rules remain unclear leaving patients advocates and drug programs in limbo Recent guidance from the government saying that third parties should refrain from making payments to help patients with cost sharing or premiums may affect these programs In addition theyd like a clearer assurance that the programs are not in violation of the federal law against kickbacks In  the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general   that financial assistance like this violated the statute when offered to Medicare patients The law prohibits businesses that receive federal health program reimbursements from offering something of value in this case a subsidy to induce beneficiaries to use their products Drug manufacturers are commercial entities and the FAQ states that we  issuers from accepting premium payments and costsharing obligations on behalf of a qualified health plan enrollee said an official from HHS Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services in an email Drugmakers   for costsharing assistance programs that encourage patients to use a brandname drug when a cheaper generic alternative is available Even though consumers may get the drugs at a discounted price insurers are left paying the expensive tab for their share of the cost But for many patients there are no generic alternatives for medicines to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis cancer and multiple sclerosis In the case of multiple sclerosis for example at least  diseasemodifying therapies cost between  and  annually says Nancy Law executive vice president of programs and services at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Such drugs are typically considered   by health plans and may require patients to pay coinsurance of as much as  percent rather than the flat copayments that are charged for less costly drugs Even with good insurance many patients cant afford the medicine without financial help What we find is that people cant afford their high deductibles or copays says Law Advocates for patients with serious illnesses who are anxiously awaiting word from HHS were reassured when in   to Rep Jim McDermott DWash HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that exchange plans werent considered federal health care programs Many took that to mean that the plans arent subject to antikickback rules But a few weeks later the   posted on the CMS website raised concerns again with its discussion about discouraging cost sharing assistance In December the   an advocacy group for people with chronic diseases sent a   seeking clarification The group says its still waiting for answers In the absence of clear guidance some drug companies have decided to provide costsharing assistance to people in marketplace plans while others are holding off Most companies are relying on the advice of their general counsel and my sense is that that has been mixed says   vice president at Avalere Health a research and consulting company In the case of Medicare independent charitable organizations have stepped in to offer a workaround that enables many older patients to get the drugs they need Such organizations are permitted to act as gobetweens They solicit money from drug companies for specific diseases and provide financial assistance to needy patients to cover drug and other medical costs If drug companies arent permitted to provide direct assistance to people in marketplace plans presumably the nonprofits could step into the breach as they do with Medicare patients
