Parents and pediatricians will often reach for antibiotics to treat middle ear infections strep throat fevers and other common ailments of childhood But new research suggests that doing so and prescribing broadspectrum antibiotics in particular increases those childrens risk of obesity at least in early childhood A new study finds that babies who got broadspectrum antibiotics in their first two years of life or who were prescribed four or more courses of antibiotics in that period were more likely to be obese at some point between their their second and fifth birthdays than were those who had taken no antibiotics or who were treated with medications designed to target a narrow spectrum of diseasecausing bacteria Broadspectrum antibiotics  including amoxicillin tetracycline streptomycin moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin  are intended for treatment of major systemic infections in cases where the bacteria causing the illness has not been identified or where a patient is under attack by a strain of bacteria resistant to standard antibiotics While they can be highly effective their antibiotic action is indiscriminate and beneficial bacteria in the body are often killed off as collateral damage The latest study tapped the medical records of  babies and children in and around Philadelphia It was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics The heightened risk of obesity linked to antibiotic use was not huge Babies who got widespectrum antibiotics in their first two years were about  more likely to be obese between  and  than were those who got no such drugs Babies who had four or more courses of any antibiotics in the first two years were also  more likely to be obese in early childhood than those whod had fewer exposures to antibiotics But among children who had four or more antibiotics prescriptions including at least one widespectrum antibiotic the risk of obesity rose to  And the earlier a babys exposure to widespectrum antibiotic medications the more likely he or she was on average to be obese between age  and  The studys findings add to mounting evidence that the mix of bacteriaÂ  in the gut plays a potent role in obesity A welter of research has shown that the diversity of the guts population of bacteria appears to confer protection from obesity while an impoverished microbiotic environment in the gut has been linked to higher risk The new research suggests that very early childhood may be a pivotal period in creating a rich and complex mix of microbiota in the gut  a condition that animal studies as well as epidemiological research have linked to reduced risk of obesity The gut microbiome is often the unintended victim of chronic exposure to antibiotics and especially to widespectrum antibiotics which act on a wide range of bacterial families Because the first  months of life comprise major shifts in diet growth and the establishment of intestinal microbiome this interval may comprise a window of particular susceptibility to antibiotic effects the authors wrote They went on to speculate that by knocking offcourse the normal development of bacterial populations inside a childs gut the repeated use of antibiotics may alter his or her longterm ability to control weight gain The researchers pediatricians from the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine adjusted their findings to reflect known variations in obesity risk that run along ethnic and socioeconomic lines And they ruled out the possibility that other medications which might be prescribed more often to children who get antibiotics might be responsible for the heightened obesity risk Around the time of their second birthdays the weight of babies in the study did not vary in ways that reflected their antibiotics exposure the researchers noted Those patterns emerged over time in their third fourth and fifth years of life The new research underscores that for some obesity may have origins in decisions made long before food preferences eating habits and lifestyle decisions are developed or established This really gives strong evidence that often obesity really is not a personal choice said Dr Stephen Cook associate professor of Pediatrics and Community Health at the University of Rochester Medical Center Cook who serves on the executive committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Obesity said the study makes clear that fighting child obesity is a much more complicated issue than move more and eat less For busy pediatricians the new research is yet another reason to use antibiotics wisely said Dr Sandra Arnold associate professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of infectious diseases at University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center But added Arnold who has authored research on physicians antibiotic prescribing practices thats easier said than done Its really hard to get physicians to stop prescribing antibiotics in circumstances where theyre unlikely to help said Arnold Despite intensive campaigns aimed at reducing physicians reliance on antibiotic medications  and despite the added protections that widespread childhood vaccinations provide  really nothing causes doctors to dramatically change their behavior she added Faced with the uncertain prognosis of a feverish child who appears quite ill said Arnold even physicians who know better will pull out their pad and write an antibiotic prescription Arnolds own research does suggest that physicians may be more amenable to a key message of the latest research that whenever possible narrowspectrum antibiotics are a better treatment choice for babies than are widespectrum ones While pediatricians are unlikely to resist the urge to prescribe antibiotics in all but the clearest cases of severe bacterial illness it seemed you could get better results getting doctors to use narrowerspectrum antibiotics than getting them to stop altogether
