Many of the twins delivered via cesarean section could have been safely delivered the oldfashioned way according to a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine Twin births have been on the rise for three decades fueled mainly by use of fertility treatments The increase in pregnancies among women over the age of  is also a factor since the odds of twins increase with maternal age In the United States alone the rate of twin births is up  since  according to   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Several studies have found that birth by cesarean section reduces the risk of complications for one or both twins compared with a vaginal delivery The results seemed to fuel a shift toward Csections for twins in the US and elsewhere One   of US births found that  of twins were delivered by Csection in  up from  in  But none of these studies was a randomized clinical trial the type thats considered the gold standard of medical research So an international group of researchers launched the   which ultimately included  medical centers in  countries As noted by an editorial that accompanies the New England Journal of Medicine report it took the researchers  years to recruit nearly  mothers to participate in the study Overall  women were randomly assigned to have a planned cesarean section and  were randomly assigned to plan for a vaginal delivery though they could switch to a Csection for one or both babies if that became medically necessary As expected women in the cesarean group were moreÂ  likely to be able to stick with their original plan  of them did deliver both of their twins via Csection The others delivered one or both twins vaginally Meanwhile  of the women who had been planning for a vaginal delivery were able to stick with their plan another  of these women wound up delivering both babies by Csection and  delivered one each way The main focus of   was to see whether mothers and babies in one group or the other were more likely to have medical problems during childbirth or in the first four weeks afterward For the infants such adverse events could include a birth trauma like a skull fracture or spinal cord injury the need for oxygen or a breathing tube or a low Apgar score For mothers problems included death hemorrhage blood clot or a serious infection The risk of these problems turned out to be the same for mothers and babies in both groups The rate of adverse events was  for infants in the planned Csection group and  for infants in the planned vaginal delivery group according to the study That difference wasnt statistically significant Secondborn twins were  more likely than firstborn twins to have a medical issue but that was true whether they were in the Csection or the vaginal delivery group Among the mothers  of those who were planning to have a Csection had some sort of medical problem along with  who were planning to have a vaginal delivery That difference wasnt statistically significant either One difference the researchers did find was that babies in the planned Csection group were born at an earlier gestational age than babies in the planned vaginal delivery group though the difference amounted to less than one day on average So women expecting twins who would like to try for a vaginal delivery can do so safely  but only under the conditions in the trial the researchers wrote Women were attended by an experienced obstetrician and they delivered in facilities that could perform an emergency Csection within  minutes if that became necessary Although the findings make clear that vaginal delivery of twins is safe when performed by skilled hands it probably wont persuade many women to plan for it   chief of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston wrote in   Csections are too much in vogue and babies who are in a breech position are rarely delivered vaginally among other reasons It seems unlikely that we will see a major change in use of cesarean delivery for twins nationwide he concluded    and like   on Facebook
