When it comes to public health there are bad ideas that seemingly cant be stopped and smart ones that dont get their due Often the real trick to improving health is getting both patients and doctors to hear the right message and then do something about it So whats the best way to get the word out about a decadesold generic drug that could save the lives of critically injured patients Make a comic book Thats what   a British epidemiologist did anyway Roberts believes a cheap readily available drug called   or TXA could prevent tens of thousands of trauma patients from bleeding to death each year if doctors only knew how well it worked and used it correctly TXA improves blood clotting The drug first synthesized in Japan in the s by a husbandandwife team is widely used in Asia and Europe by women with heavy periods as well as by dentists performing tooth extractions Its cost ranges from about  per course of treatment in the developing world to  or so in places like the UK Roberts wondered if TXA could save lives in the emergency room More than a million people around the world die in car accidents each year he says Ninety percent of trauma deaths occur in less developed countries In a third of cases hemorrhage is to blame An inexpensive clotting drug like TXA could have a big effect in poor places with dangerous roads and primitive hospitals he figured In  Roberts launched a big study called   to test the idea More than  trauma patients in  countries rich and poor took part Half were given TXA within three hours of their injury The other half were given a placebo The   were published in   in  with another   published the following year The findings showed that people who got the drug were significantly less likely to bleed to death especially if they received TXA early But medical practice wasnt immediately transformed You can find something thats true publish it in   wash your hands of it and say Well thats that  Roberts tells   But that doesnt seem very responsible Getting research into practice takes a long time He points to the introduction of   which are now given routinely to heart attack patients After the confirmatory clinical trials he says it took about ten years for those to get into practice In the meantime thats a small massacre Thats a lot of people dying unnecessarily Roberts turned to an unconventional medium to communicate his message commissioning   a British comic book artist to write and draw a   that showed ER doctors treating trauma patients with TXA Science is very good at finding the answer to whether a treatment works Roberts says But its very bad at helping you to remember that that treatment is effective What people remember are stories  emotional stories Roberts comic book begins with a bomb blast and follows three rather wellchiseled emergency doctors as they make their rounds triaging casualties and treating wounds In between asides that convey TXAs correct dosing and contraindications there is time for both a stabbing and a budding departmental romance We also tried to make doctors giving tranexamic acid look sexier than doctors not Roberts adds laughing I dont know if you noticed that one One of TXAs earliest adopters even before the comic was the military The British army started using it straightaway Roberts says particularly on the battlefield in Afghanistan The US Army was skeptical at first so it conducted   comparing the outcomes of wounded soldiers in Afghanistan treated by British surgeons  and hence with TXA  with those treated by American doctors no TXA The data showed that soldiers treated with the drug were less likely to die despite often grievous injuries and the American army soon started using it as well Roberts hopes that TXA can now make the jump from the battlefield to the home front He points out that there are far more shooting deaths in American cities each night than in Afghan ones But then its not just ER doctors that need winning over One of the advantages of tranexamic acid is also a disadvantage Robert says Its a generic drug and its really cheap Its one of the cheapest ways to save a life that currently exists The disadvantage is no pharmaceutical company is going to make a lot of money out of it So they dont have a huge marketing team working on it Roberts has a message and his medium All he needs now are some comic book fans in the right places
