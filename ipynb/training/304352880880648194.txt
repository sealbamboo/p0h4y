 Theres promising news for people with gastroesophageal reflux disease commonly known as   According to a study published today in the   researchers at Mayo Clinic in Florida have created a magnetic bracelet that can actually help control the digestive disorder In the United States alone one in three people have GERDÂ reports the American Gastroenterological Association  a condition in which stomach acid enters the esophagus as a result of muscular weakness Heartburn chest pain and throat irritation are among the   which are usually treated with overthecounter medications or prescription drugs The new device  a small magnetic bead bracelet inserted surgically  keeps the area where the esophagus meets the stomach closed restricting the entrance of acid specifically while a person is not eating or drinking anything It was developed to treat people with chronic GERD symptoms that cant be controlled with drug treatment and which in some severe cases can lead to development of   Patients undergo a modestly invasive onetotwo hour procedure to put in the device which requires overnight hospitalization The US Food and Drug Administration approved the device technically referred to as the LINX Reflux Management System and developed with the support of Torax Medical in March  Since then the Mayo researchers have been following a group of patients who have had it implanted This is really more intended for patients with daily reflux who are dependent on medication to control reflux and need to take increasing doses to keep symptoms under control says study coauthor and GERD specialist C Daniel Smith MD surgery department chair at Mayo Clinic Bettina B Kilburn MD of Atlanta had the device implanted in April  and reports that her recovery time was brief and manageable My GERD was pretty symptomatic explains Dr Kilburn of her decision to get the device It was reasonably controlled with medication and a pretty strict diet but it had gotten worse and I was leaning towards a mechanical solution The magnets in the bracelet provide controlled flexibility for the opening and closing of the esophagus The magnetic beads temporarily break when food needs to pass through to the stomach Afterwards the magnetic attraction closes off the channel halting further exposure to stomach acid Of  patients tested over a threeyear period at Mayo  experienced decreased GERD symptoms and  percent stopped taking medication for acid suppression Only six patients experienced severe side effects resulting in the removal of the device among four of them without any major longterm effects Additionally  percent of test subjects encountered   but that eventually subsided This is the first new safe and effective treatment we have to treat reflux disease in  years Dr Smith said in a press release The device is simple elegant and functional and it provides an opportunity to help a very large number of patients The only treatment options in the past have been acidsuppressing agents or surgery Acidsuppressing agents dont directly address the underlying ineffective valve between the esophagus and the stomach leaving patients with persistent symptoms surgery can lead to distressing side effects of bloating and inability to vomit in  percent of patients These side effects occurred rarely with this new device Smith expects the device once implanted will last a lifetime Costs will vary depending on the institution and the patients insurance coverage Compared to a lifetime of daily medications where that prescription can cost  a month this is a onetime cost that will give people a lifetime of relief says Smith I would have the implant again in a heartbeat Kilburn says I certainly recommend that anyone with GERD consider the full range of available options For the right patient it really transforms your life  GERD was running my life I prefer to run my own life
