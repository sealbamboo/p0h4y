Katharine Hepburn had it So did playwright Eugene ONeill and Sen Robert Byrd   is a condition that causes involuntary shaking While it usually develops in middle age it can start much earlier   was aware of her hands shaking as a child When I was about  years old I noticed in art class that I was never able to draw a straight line she says I really didnt know why I just thought it was odd I just thought it was me By age  the shaking in her hands was getting worse but she kept it a secret She did everything she could to hide it from her family her teachers and her friends By the time she was  Finsilver could no longer mask it She remembers sitting at a large family holiday dinner with her mother across the table She lifted a spoon to her mouth and her hand was shaking badly Suddenly the spoon went flying across the table she says I can still remember the look on my mothers face It was complete horror Terrified that her teenage daughter had   she contacted a neurologist who diagnosed Shari Finsilver with essential tremor It is the most common of all movement disorders affecting about  million people in this country Essential tremor is a condition in which head voice hands or even all parts of the body are engaged in a tremor that can be as frequent as four to eight times per second  says   a movement disorder specialist at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit The shaking can interfere with just about everything  getting dressed eating and drinking using the telephone In fact a small percentage of patients have such bad tremors that theyre completely housebound unable to manage the details of daily living Essential tremor is a condition that has been known about for hundreds of years Lewitt says The word essential refers to the fact that we essentially dont know what causes the tremor Researchers do know theres a genetic component President John Adams had it so did his son John Quincy Adams About half the people with essential tremor have a family member affected but not always the same way One sibling could have a hand tremor and the other sibling might have a voice and head tremor says Lewitt Its often confused or even misdiagnosed as Parkinsons disease But with essential tremor the shaking usually occurs when the person is doing an activity like writing or lifting a spoon People with Parkinsons shake when their hands are at rest The other major difference is essential tremor does not typically worsen or progress to complete disability like Parkinsons disease There is no cure but there are some things you can do to reduce the symptoms Medications like   or   work for some Alcohol too Just a glass of wine may ease the tremor for some but the relief is usually shortlived lasting just a halfhour or so and tolerance builds up Finsilver found no relief for her tremors with medicine or alcohol So  years ago in her late s she decided to try something extreme that has been shown to help    She had electrodes planted in her thalamus the spot in the brain involved in the tremors A small electric jolt disrupts the tremor All through her surgery Finsilver was wide awake And when they hit the spot in the thalamus with the electrode the tremor completely subsided she says It was a moment not to be believed I mean I cried Its just so unbelievable Initially the implanted electrodes controlled Finsilvers tremors almost completely but over the years her tremors have started to return Still she says they are much less severe She no longer tries to hide them and they no longer control her life
