The latest numbers on the Ebola outbreak are grim  people infected and  deaths Thats the World Health Organizations official   of confirmed probable and suspect cases across Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone and Nigeria But the WHO has previously   that its official figures may vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak So how bad is it really Thats the question NPR put to several people who have been carefully watching the outbreak Theres no scientific way of knowing exactly how wrong the official numbers are says Joseph Fair an infectious disease doctor who has been acting as a special adviser to the health minister of Sierra Leone At a bare minimum I would guess theyre probably off by  percent he says Once public health workers identify someone with this disease Fair says they have to find everyone else who might have gotten exposed through contact with that person And that hasnt been easy Even if someone tests positive for   he says public health workers may return and find that the person has simply disappeared Theyre traveling usually by public transport and coming into contact with a lot more people Fair says The health agencies of these povertystricken countries dont have the staff they need to track down all these people who may have been exposed Unlike previous Ebola outbreaks that hit isolated rural areas this one is affecting many more people in a more urban environment Adding to the difficulty is a climate of distrust created by years of war and conflict Because people are so afraid in some instances if a relative dies in a home all the others run away instead of going toward the clinic to report themselves says   a Liberian pediatrician who is president of the Liberia College of Physicians and Surgeons Shes currently in the US trying to raise funds and support to help fight Ebola Obviously the statistics were getting is just scratching the surface Marshall says When we say we have so many suspected cases so many probable cases so many confirmed cases thats just the ones who are coming in for testing  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases agrees that people running away from hospitals and quarantines are a real problem making him fear that this outbreak will get worse before it gets better A considerable number of people are going to die before we get it under control Fauci says Obviously as a physician and as a health person that bothers me But he says some government workers who have been to West Africa actually think the official numbers arent that far off They think its likely a bit underreported but not substantially Fauci says The number of people affected is not likely to be many many manyfold greater than what the WHO has estimated he added One simple reason the numbers are wrong is that theres currently a backlog in getting cases entered into the official counting system says   an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who has been working on the outbreak We probably will have much more accurate numbers in the coming weeks she says Having good numbers she says is key to understanding where Ebola is really spreading and where public health workers need to focus their efforts
