Investors may want to pay close attention to the anti-trust lawsuit filed by the New York State Attorney General, who alleges that Actavis is not playing fair by planning to prematurely end sales of its Alzheimer’s drug in order to force patients to switch to a newer version. The tactic is known in the pharmaceutical industry as forced switching or product hopping.. So far, Actavis has not commented on the charges, but analysts say this is a decided negative and the drug maker ought to consider postponing the switch in order to defuse criticism. Meanwhile, though, there is the risk that the litigation may prevent Actavis from making the switch. For now, though, the drug maker intends to proceed with moving patients to its newer Namenda XR this fall as planned.
