Fatu stayed healthy which is noteworthy considering that more than  health care workers have become infected with Ebola and she didnt even have personal protection equipment  those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units   Instead Fatu whos in her final year of nursing school invented her own equipment International aid workers heard about Fatus trash bag method and are now teaching it to other West Africans who cant get into hospitals and dont have protective gear of their own   Every day several times a day for about two weeks Fatu put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves Then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots   She wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag Next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand followed by a mask    It was an arduous and timeconsuming process but Fatu was religious about it never cutting corners  UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing   Essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves  Crowe said Our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have   She emphasized of course that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear  its just that those things arent available to many West Africans   No one knows that better than Fatu   Her Ebola nightmare started Juy  when her father Moses had a spike in blood pressure She took him to a hospital in their home city of Kakata   A bed was free because a patient had just passed away What no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of Ebola   Moses  developed a fever vomiting and diarrhea Then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of Ebola  Fatu took her father to Monrovia the capital city about a minute drive via difficult roads Three hospitals turned him away because they were full   She took him back to another hospital in Kakata They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him so Fatu took him home where he infected three other family members Fatus mother Victoria  Fatus sister Vivian  and their yearold cousin who was living with them Alfred Winnie   While operating her onewoman Ebola hospital for two weeks Fatu consulted with their family doctor who would talk to her on the phone but wouldnt come to the house She gave them medicines she obtained from the local clinic and fluids through intravenous lines that she started   At times her patients blood pressure plummeted so low she feared they would die   I cried many times she said I said God you want to tell me Im going to lose my entire family    But her father mother and sister rallied and were well on their way to recovery when space became available at JFK Medical Center on August   Alfred never recovered though and passed away at the hospital the next day   Im very very proud her father said  She saved my life through the almighty God   Now hes working to find a scholarship for Fatu so she can finish her final year of nursing school He has no doubt his daughter will go on to save many more people during her life  Im sure shell be a great giant of Liberia he said
