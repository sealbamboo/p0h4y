Anybody who has ever seen a drug advertisement or talked over the pros and cons of a medicine with a doctor can be forgiven for being confused Sorting out the risks and benefits of taking a medicine can be complicated even for professionals This spring the Institute of Medicine   with the Food and Drug Administration The topic How best to communicate to doctors and patients the uncertainty in the assessment of benefits and risks of pharmaceuticals The FDA not only approves drugs it also approves the prescribing instructions that come along with them For some drugs the wad of paper filled with fine print about the risks and benefits of using the drug is accompanied by a medication guide that is supposed to summarize the main points During one questionandanswer session   of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research acknowledged that those guides are full of information But its remarkably nonquantitative for the most part he said And I think we should try to think about whether there are quantitative ways of presenting that stuff He then referred to   and   two of his fellow panelists who have said its possible to pull that off The husbandandwife team from Dartmouth are on a decadelong mission They have been pushing the FDA to get useful and readable quantitative data about drugs to doctors and their patients Schwartz and Woloshin have designed a format they call a drug facts box It shows the gist of what they say is buried in all the fine print How does the drug compare to a placebo Thats in contrast to what usually happens Schwartz says The prescribing info is written by industry and then negotiated with FDA and then FDA ultimately approves it And we have documented examples where important info  like how well the drug works  is not in the label This drives Schwartz and Woloshin crazy So heres their experiment They showed people ads for two competing heartburn drugs one plainly more effective than the other They also showed people two of their drug facts boxes one for each of those two heartburn drugs showing how each drug fared against a placebo a sugar pill in testing When the people are presented with the standard information they see  like a drug ad  about  percent of people chose the better drug Woloshin says But when we showed them information in the drug facts box form  percent of people were able to choose the objectively better drug So thats a really dramatic improvement It just shows you that if you show people information in a way thats understandable they can use it and it can improve their decision Using FDA data Woloshin and Schwartz developed a drug facts box for the sleep aid Lunesta Two columns compare people with insomnia who took Lunesta and people with insomnia who unknowingly took a sugar pill The results Those who used Lunesta took  minutes to fall asleep Those who got a sugar pill took  minutes  a difference of  minutes Those who took Lunesta stayed asleep  minutes longer than those who took a sugar pill Woloshin and Schwartz say some people might consider those benefits worth taking the drug and some might not Thats the whole point of the drugs facts box Woloshin says to let people look at the evidence and come to their own judgments But you cant make those judgments without the facts He and Schwartz believe passionately in the numeracy of patients They say we can handle numbers like percents Its just that too often were given   or misleading information For example a claim that some drug reduces the likelihood of a particular disease by  percent can be misleading Woloshin explains why If you heard about a sale and it said  percent off would you travel a great distance to go to the sale Well you might if it was on things that are really expensive like a flatscreen TV or something he says But what if the thing that was on sale was gum and you save only a couple of cents So when you hear  percent reduction you have to ask  percent of what The doctors dream is to get those drug facts boxes into health systems and electronic medical records so that doctors and patients can study the information and decide whats best before the drug is prescribed What we hope is that the box will encourage people to take drugs that are effective and that work and discourage people from taking drugs that dont work or are just harmful Woloshin says And also that just having this information in front of people will stimulate better drug research because drug companies realize people are paying attention and looking at these numbers  and then wed have a better quality of drug trials Woloshin and Schwartz say medical information should be as quantitative as other information And we digest quantitative data all the time If you were reporting on an election you wouldnt say Obama won by a little he says Youd give the numbers If you were reporting sports scores you wouldnt say the Celtics won hopefully won by a bit Youd give the score Why should health care be different He and Schwartz are convinced that we can understand risk described by numbers provided the numbers are clearly and honestly presented They have been lobbying the FDA to develop drug facts boxes but say that seems unlikely So they started their own company to do it    Its funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation which also supports NPR All Things Considered
