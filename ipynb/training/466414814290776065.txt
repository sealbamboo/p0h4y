LONDONâ€”Pfizer Inc. put more pressure on AstraZeneca PLC to engage in talks Tuesday, as Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read appeared before a U.K. parliamentary committee to defend his proposed $106 billion takeover of the U.K. drug maker.. During combative questioning, lawmakers grilled Mr. Read on Pfizer's commitments to U.K. jobs, as well as concerns he is pursuing a deal chiefly to reduce the company's tax bill. Mr. Read defended Pfizer's takeover record but said any deal to buy AstraZeneca would involve job cuts in research.
