A test that identifies seven classes of breast cancer could be available within two years say UK scientists Writing in the   the Nottingham researchers say it could help doctors tailor treatment better and boost survival rates Currently two biomarkers are routinely screened for in breast tumours Last year researchers revealed that breast cancer can be divided into  different forms of the disease based on a patients genetic makeup  However these can only be identified using detailed genetic profiling which is costly and impractical for most patients Each cancer type has a different impact on survival rates scientists report  Now a team led by Andy Green of the University of Nottingham has developed a method that screens for  key proteins that identify seven different biological types of breast cancer  Dr Green said that as treatment options available for breast cancer patients increase decisionmaking regarding the choice of the most appropriate treatment method is becoming increasingly complex  Improvements in care and outcome for patients with breast cancer will involve improved targeting of effective therapies to appropriate patients he said Equally important should be improvement in parallel strategies to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate treatment and side effects The technology needed to measure the proteins in tumour samples already exists in most pathology laboratories across the UK he added In the study the scientists looked for the signature of each class of cancer in  tumour samples from a tissue bank  They found that  fitted well into one of seven classes while the remaining  were harder to categorise Further verification revealed that the seven classes are defined by different combinations and levels of  proteins found in breast cancer cells  They include two proteins routinely identified in breast cancer cells  the oestrogen receptor ER and HER  as well as others not currently tested such as p cytokeratins HER and HERa Baroness Delyth Morgan chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign which funded the study said We need to ensure the lifesaving and lifeextending treatments we already have in the clinic are used more effectively  directing the right treatments to those who will benefit and sparing others from unnecessary side effects so that by  we can achieve our ambition to overcome breast cancer This new test could be a realistic step towards making the holy grail of personalised medicine a reality offering hope to the  women diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK every year However Dr Emma Smith senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK said further research was needed into the approach  Research and new cuttingedge technologies are beginning to give us a glimpse of what is on the horizon in this area she said  But its not clear whether this set of biomarkers will give doctors any more useful information than the tests already in place  We would need results from further studies or clinical trials to say for certain whether this approach could be a good way of identifying different treatments and improving survival for women with the disease
