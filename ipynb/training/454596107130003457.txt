After a move to the US mainland from American Samoa almost two years ago I picked up walking and swimming and started eating more fruits and vegetables I avoided anything that came in a can or a box   As the weight came off slowly I started believing in myself  and in my ability to turn my life around After our first Fit Nation meeting in Atlanta I committed to walking in the mornings and training in the evenings My walking partner would pick me up at  am daily and we would go to Tampas MacDill Park where we walked two miles Every morning we saw a girl running nearby and we would marvel at her speed and form She ran with such grace  One day my friend told me youre going to be running just like her mi amiga   There was passion in her voice when she said it  a passion that meant she believed in me But I found it hard to believe it myself After all the runner was smaller Much smaller And there wasnt an ounce of fat on her body  Up until that point I was walking for five minutes and then jogging for a minute That minute felt like an eternity Before I even got to the second mark I would be gasping for air  But each morning I saw the runner I felt inspired I knew I needed to put more effort into my workouts Each week I added another  seconds to that minute until finally three weeks later I decided to give it a shot and run two consecutive minutes  To my surprise I kept running long after the two minutes were over  until I realized I had run my first mile nonstop Two weeks later I ran four miles nonstop in a time of  I remember being so excited and needing to tell someone But my sons didnt quite get it when I rushed through the door breathless and told them I had just run nonstop for an hour All they said was Cool Mom whats for breakfast In the past this lack of encouragement would have stopped me But Ive since realized I dont need to be reassured by anyone Theres something that happens once you chose to believe in yourself out of nowhere youll sprout wings you never knew you had  Each Saturday since Ive been running for four miles Last Saturday I ran my best time of  with one of my laps at  My goal is to run a minute mile  Beating my own time is my newest joy  It is a rush that keeps me going daily Theres nothing like hearing my sons complain when were walking to school in the mornings Youre always running Mom Why cant we just walk I may not be the most graceful runner on Saturday mornings but Ill keep going till I get to my goal  Ive learned that you dont have to be thin to run You just have to believe that you can  Im running Only this time Ive forgotten to be afraid
