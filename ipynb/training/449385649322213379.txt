Laws banning smoking in public places have had a positive impact on child health an international study in the Lancet suggests Researchers found a  reduction in premature births and severe childhood asthma attacks within a year of smokefree laws being introduced A research team analysed  previous studies from North America and Europe The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said smoking bans benefitted adults and children This is one of the first large studies to look at how antismoking laws in different countries and states are affecting the health of children living in those regions  Laws that prohibit smoking in public places such as bars restaurants and workplaces have already been shown to protect adults from the dangers of passive smoking In this study researchers from the University of Edinburgh Maastricht University Hasselt University in Belgium Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital looked at more than  million births and almost  hospital attendances for asthma attacks in children Dr Jasper Been lead study author from the Maastricht University Medical Centre in The Netherlands said the research on children under  was revealing Our study provides clear evidence that smoking bans have considerable public health benefits for perinatal and child health and provides strong support for WHO recommendations to create smokefree public environments on a national level  also found a  decline in children being born very small for their age after the introduction of smokefree laws Coauthor Professor Aziz Sheikh of Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Massachusetts and the University of Edinburgh said there was potential to improve the health of more children  The many countries that are yet to enforce smokefree legislation should in the light of these findings reconsider their positions on this important health policy question Previous research suggests that  of children worldwide are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke which has been shown to be a cause of respiratory disease and a trigger for asthma attacks in children  Recent European research also showed that passive smoking causes thickening of childrens arteries which can   Experts say children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of secondhand smoke because their lungs and immune systems are still developing At present  of the worlds population is covered by smokefree laws Scotland introduced a ban on smoking in enclosed public places in  and England in  Commenting on the study Professor Ronnie Lamont from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the study provided further evidence that smoking bans had substantial health benefits for adults and children Smoking during pregnancy has been shown to have adverse effects on foetal development and pregnant women need to be informed of the risks and should be offered advice and support to help them give up  It is important that healthcare professionals encourage women to lead a healthy lifestyle The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it supported recommendations for further implementation of smokefree environments A Department of Health spokesman said it wanted to build on the smoking ban by making it illegal for adults to buy cigarettes for children and to smoke in cars carrying children We are also stopping tobacco being sold from vending machines and increasing the tax on tobacco and banning displays it said But Simon Clark director of the smokers group Forest said children tended to be exposed to secondhand smoke in the home so workplace smoking bans would have little or no impact on children If the report is suggesting that environmental tobacco smoke is the only or principal cause of childhood asthma thats ridiculous he said In the UK the number of people suffering from asthma has tripled in the last  years During that same period the number of people who smoke has halved and today relatively few children are exposed to tobacco smoke in confined spaces such as homes and cars Mr Clark added that calling for more countries to introduce comprehensive smokefree legislation was a gross overreaction
