People willingly drive across town to save  cents on a carton of milk But when it comes to health care they dont want to think about how much it costs and they dont want their doctors to think about it either according to a recent   in the journal   Thats not good news for those   to nudge people into being more costconscious health care consumers Our findings present some challenges to doctors and to policymakers insurers employers  just about everybody whos concerned about the rising cost of health care says the studys coauthor   at the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan Researchers probed the attitudes of  focus group participants in Washington DC and Santa Monica Calif Participants were asked to weigh their own outofpocket costs as well as the costs borne by their insurer under scenarios in which the diagnostic and treatment options for various medical problems were nearly identical in effectiveness but varied substantially in price For example they were asked to consider getting an MRI versus a much less expensive CT scan if theyd had a headache for three months The results   According to the researchers the people in the focus groups generally did not understand how insurance works In addition they felt little personal responsibility for keeping health costs lower They were also unlikely to accept a less expensive treatment option even if it was nearly as effective as a more expensive choice Moreover they were antagonistic toward insurers and seemed to be motivated to choose expensive care out of spite There was an almost vengeful attitude toward insurance companies says Goold Still Goold says shes somewhat optimistic about the possibility that people can be encouraged to change their attitudes about weighing medical costs She pointed to changes in endoflife care over the past  years as an example As   and palliative care have become widely accepted the focus of patients their families and providers has shifted toward improving quality of life through pain and symptom management rather than necessarily extending life Insurance plan design can also encourage people to think differently she says   for example links patient outofpocket costs to the clinical value of a particular service In the case of a patient who wants an MRI instead of a CT scan under VBID the insurer could encourage the more costeffective choice by charging a higher copay for the MRI Although we know from other research that patients certainly consider their outofpocket costs theyre not very good atâ€¨ deciding whats worth spending extra money on says Goold Doctors have to be part of the discussion about the value of different options
