People who see something going wrong in the NHS should be able to report their concerns even if they havent been directly affected according to Anna Bradley the chair of patients group Healthwatch England In this weeks Scrubbing Up she says the NHS often doesnt let witnesses file complaints  an omission akin to preventing people reporting an abandoned bag at an airport because they dont have the owners permission We know that patients are reluctant to make a fuss when standards slip on hospital wards  Many simply dont know how to make a complaint others are actually scared of the consequences  Yet we often hear complaints referred to as gold dust by hospital bosses in terms of improving services You would think then that health and care organisations would be eager to hear from anyone who wanted to report a concern or complaint  However our research suggests that tens of thousands of incidents are slipping under the radar because those who witness poor care and try to report it are being told in one particular case to mind their own business Responding to a Freedom of Information request a third of hospitals across England told us that they dont record complaints from third parties ie those that witness rather than personally experiencing poor care   Many of the hospital trusts that replied incorrectly stated that such complaints cannot be investigated without the permission of the patient  Others said they record such incidents as informal feedback only with no followup provided to the courageous and civic minded individuals complaining on behalf of vulnerable patients   In the worst cases some hospitals just flat out said they dont record these complaints   Even where these reports are recorded they are often not included in formal stats allowing hospitals so their complaints data doesnt tell the true story For me this is symptomatic of a much bigger problem around complaints handling in the NHS and social care services  The fact that doctors and nurses would rather tell one of these citizen whistleblowers they cant complain because they dont tick the right box or have the permission to make a complaint is just wrong  If a passerby reports an abandoned bag in an airport the staff dont say Im sorry sir but do you have the permission of the bag owner Rather they are thanked for their vigilance  If the policy makers and politicians are serious about driving culture change in the NHS then more needs to be done to wipe out this compute says no attitude and encourage staff to welcome feedback  positive and negative  With the secretary of state for healths update on progress against the recommendations of the Francis inquiry expected in the next few weeks I implore him to take a long hard look at the complaints question    we set out a vision for streamlining and refocusing the complaints system around what people want  Firstly the system needs to make it easier for people to complain including institutions understanding that everyone including third parties has the right to raise concerns Secondly every case should be dealt with compassionately with a speedy personalised response that actually addresses the poor experience and includes an outline of what happens next Lastly those who fail to up their game must be held to account by being put into special measures by the regulators issued with financial penalties and ultimately being shut down and replaced In short its time for the health and social care sector to get serious about complaints and stop finding loopholes to avoid having to face up to their mistakes
