It was almost  years ago that I set my personal record since equaled but never exceeded of  patients seen in the course of a single afternoon What I remember are not the details of that particular day  all days are hectic for one reason or another  but a conversation I had at a party a short time later With nothing much else to discuss with another guest also a doctor I modestly mentioned my record He smiled indulgently and replied that he averaged more like  primarycare visits a day For some time afterward I compulsively redid the math he spent around eight minutes per patient hour after hour and idly fantasized about his office which clearly included a small army of medical assistants other capable souls to handle phone fax and paperwork and extraordinary dataretrieval abilities for labs and tests And a lot of agreeably healthy patients Or maybe they were too sick to talk much Did the man eat I wondered Did he type Perhaps a court reporter stood by Of course when I heard a few years later that the state had closed his office and stripped him of his medical license a whole new set of images came to mind I am hardly alone in these fantasies Every medical administrator in the country has the same obsession with physician productivity from the happy daydreams of smooth highthrottle operation to the   of wipeout if the machine spins out of control For some medical metrics the skys the limit  we aim for zero complication rates  percent adherence to various required annual screens But performance statistics always come with a natural cap The cheetah maxes out at  miles per hour or so and no American cow has yet provided more than   a year How fast then can a domestic physician move How much health can one produce Everybody approaches the math a little differently wielding different units of measurement Some think only in dollars with yearly income goals that are selfimposed or set by an employer The less said about them the better A more legitimate unit of productivity is the number of patients in a doctors practice  the patient panel to use the technical term American primary care providers have long been estimated to work smoothly if they care for about  patients each at an average rate of  visits a year which works out to  visits a day including Saturdays Some authorities now worry this number may be much too high Even without factoring in the exploding paperwork the list of tasks each patient brings to the office is growing with body mass The average American general practitioner is now   to worry about a total of  cases of uncontrolled    cases of uncontrolled    cases of uncontrolled   a few hundred of these same problems under good control and then a variety of other chronic illness in various states of disarray These chronic conditions are likely to take up about  hours of a doctors workday experts calculate and acute problems like injuries and infections will occupy another four hours Then there is also a growing list of potential problems to investigate hidden addiction domestic violence failure to wear bicycle helmets and many more Running that complete checklist for each patient   seven hours a day Clearly these tasks add up to a workday no selfrespecting dairy cow would tolerate   overpaneled providers long waits for appointments annoyed patients and the delivery of dangerously slipshod care Thus yet another metric provides for physician extenders like   A doctor who can delegate most of the preventive counseling and about half the chronic care to a capable nurse may see productivity more than double But even these involved calculations are trivial compared with those that seek to define and quantify productivity across medical specialties These are the calculations that inform most insurance reimbursement rates Who works the hardest Who deserves the biggest reward Is it more intellectually and physically taxing more generally valuable to spend a day replacing three knees talking to four mentally ill criminals or caring for five dying children These days the knees reimbursed at the highest rates are winning hands down Meanwhile those of us with the worms eye view of the landscape still mostly just count heads In the clinic a patient day is a breeze a patient day is a marathon and the doctor heading for  is a limp rag all listened out Sure politicians can shake hundreds of hands an evening and speeddaters can peck dozens of cheeks  and doctors who are part politician part speeddater will easily average  patient visits a day maybe more Those who are neither will have lower yields but the quality of their product is probably better
