Doctors at a Dorset hospital signed a do not resuscitate order on a patient without informing her or her family June Brook  had been admitted to Royal Bournemouth Hospital with sickness and diarrhoea but during her stay the order was issued to allow her to die if she needed resuscitating The order which states the family were not available was found in Mrs Brooks bag after she was discharged The hospital has apologised and promised an investigation The order which stays on a patients records was signed by two doctors and dated  October  It states CPR would be inappropriate because Mrs Brook has dementia Mrs Brooks son Kevin said It would basically have meant that they would have not resuscitated her and she would now no longer be with us To me it looks like a death warrant Its like legalised euthanasia Im gobsmacked  I dont know why they have written it A hospital spokesman said When a clinical decision needs to be made that CPR should not be attempted and the patient is not able to do this relatives must be consulted They may be able to help by indicating what the patient would decide if able to do so On this occasion this discussion did not happen for which we sincerely apologise  The reasons why this did not happen and why proper processes for communicating with next of kin were not followed are being investigated We have not received any communication from the patients family and we will therefore be contacting them to clearly understand their concerns and help us carry out a thorough investigation and learn from this  Further education for staff on this part of the patient pathway would form part of this improvement
