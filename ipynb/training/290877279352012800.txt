 Do I look fat to you Its a question that no parent or friend wants to answer in the affirmative but it turns out that with normalweight teens this reluctance may make sense A new Norwegian study shows that those who think theyre too heavy are the ones most likely to be overweight by early adulthood In what is described as the first study to capture the relationship between perceived and actual   over a period of several years researchers said they found that a negative selfimage may play a key role in driving teens toward obesity Among both girls and boys who were normal weight as teens but    percent of the girls became overweight as women and  percent of the boys became overweight as men When you experience yourself as overweight it raises your chances of actually becoming overweight said study author Koenraad Cuypers a researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim We think it has to do with the idealization of their bodies seeing all the models in the world of clothes and in the movies Cuypers explained You have to be thin to be successful That is the ideal That attitude makes teenagers  girls and boys  continually tell themselves that theyre not thin enough he said So how does that actually translate into gaining pounds rather than staying trim Its stressful Once you   youll feel fat in adulthood Cuypers said Feeling fat may create a kind of psychosocial stress because they cant reach the look they think they have to have The researchers also speculate that those who went into adulthood feeling fat may have repeatedly tried to lose weight which some studies suggest can increase the tendency to become overweight Others may have tried skipping meals which this studys data suggest can widen the gap between real and imagined weight According to the World Health Organization more than  billion adults were overweight as of  Of these more than  million men and nearly  million women were obese Excess pounds can contribute to a wide range of diseases and conditions including heart disease and stroke diabetes musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis and some cancers The health survey included  normalweight teenagers of both sexes Data were collected from  to  and again in  to  when the participants were between  and  years of age The researchers excluded those with physical or mental disorders and those who were pregnant They also adjusted for pubertal timing and the participants level of physical activity The study could help guide health education approaches about food and selfimage in teens said S Bryn Austin an associate professor in the department of society human development and health at the Harvard School of Public Health Its an excellent study that highlights that when kids feel bad about their bodies they take less good care of them she said Austin said parents should avoid telling teenagers they look fat or need to lose weight and focus on creating a healthy physically active environment at home Serve good food offer a fun physically active lifestyle take the TVs out of the bedrooms she advised Dont focus on restrictions or fear of weight gain She also blames the media for focusing too much on the obesity epidemic Body dissatisfaction is part of our obesigenic environment she said Theres a lot of hyperfocusing on the dangers which increases dissatisfaction adds stress and contributes to unhealthy attitudes and behaviors she said Its a perfect storm
