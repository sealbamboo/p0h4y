Some people lose their appetites when theyre under stress More often than not though the opposite is true Stressful situations trigger emotional eating for a lot of people whether its because food provides a source of comfort or because they feel extra hungry when theyre under stress So its hardly surprising that stress is the numberone predictor of gaining or regaining weight says John Foreyt PhD director of behavioral medicine research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston When people are under stress to get rid of the negative feelings they tend to revert to eating highfat or highcalorie foods they liked in childhood Indeed recent research from the University of California San Francisco suggests that were actually biologically wired for this behavior Scientists have found that consuming food thats laden with sugar fat and calories appears to literally calm down the bodys response to stress causing a slowdown in the release of stress hormones While this can be a good thing in the shortterm some experts are concerned that our increasingly stressful way of life may be contributing to the   by continuously triggering hormonal surges that in turn stimulate appetite But this doesnt mean you have to be at the mercy of your physiology You can learn to handle stressful situations without overindulging The key is to follow the right strategies for your situation There are times in your life when your stressmeter registers overload but theres no immediate solution for getting rid of the source Maybe youre miserable in your job or you have serious financial troubles When stress is sustained as it is in these situations the urge to nosh can be practically irrepressible But overindulging will probably only make you feel worse especially if you eat lots of sweet or starchy foods which is what women often crave when theyre under stress Dr Foreyt says Remind yourself that food is not the answer What is Practicing smart coping strategies Before ongoing stress has the chance to wreck   plan your meals so that you eat regularly and have some lean protein fat and carbohydrates in every meal advises Catherine Christie PhD RD an assistant professor of nutrition at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville and coauthor of Id Kill for a Cookie The carbohydrates will calm you and the protein will give you sustained energy Ideally try to eat three meals a day plus two small snacks such as lowfat yogurt cheese and fruit or peanut butter and crackers This will keep your blood sugar stable and your hunger satiated and prevent you from reaching for food to relieve stress says Kathleen Zelman MPH RD a nutrition consultant in Atlanta and director of nutrition for WebMD Aerobic exercise such as brisk walking or jogging triggers the release of   and other feelgood chemicals which improve your sense of wellbeing Dr Foreyt explains Feelings of wellbeing are incompatible with stress Antioxidants help protect your body from the harmful effects of stress Dr Christie says To get enough vitamin A C and E aim to eat seven to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day Antioxidant powerhouses include blueberries melons nectarines peaches strawberries papaya carrots broccoli spinach and sweet potatoes When under stress some people drink coffee all day long to keep themselves going Its a strategy that can backfire Dr Christie explains because caffeine actually mimics the stress response In fact a study at Duke University in Durham North Carolina found that people who swallow  mg of caffeine a day equal to two large servings of coffee experience an increase in blood pressure produce more stress hormones and feel  percent more stressed out until bedtime than on the days when they opt for decaf While one or two servings of coffee or another caffeinated food or beverage yes   and   count is probably fine dont pile it on Dr Christie says If you practice meditation deepbreathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation in which you systematically tense then relax various muscle groups from head to toe on a regular basis you can lower your reactivity to stress in general and be armed with a stressbusting strategy when you really need it A recent study at the Medical University of South Carolina found that relaxation training helped  adults with nighteating syndrome a condition often triggered by stress in which people consume  percent or more of their daily food intake after  pm Many different relaxation techniques work the key is to find the right one for you You should try them all to see what best fits your psychological makeup says Sandra Haber PhD a health psychologist in New York City and coauthor of Finding Your Voice A Womans Guide to Using SelfTalk for Fulfilling Relationships Work and Life If you find it engrossing and distracting then its a good choice for you When youre caught offguard by stressful situations whether its a traffic jam before an important meeting an argument with your boss or a call from your childs school about his misbehavior your best bet is to give yourself a timeout before reaching for that candy bar or bag of chips Look at what happened and see if you can gain a better perspective on the situation or find a way to learn from it Dr Foreyt suggests If a silver lining doesnt appear put the scenario out of your mind for the moment and give yourself a breather Heres how Take a very deep breath almost like an inward sigh and then exhale slowly Repeat this for a few minutes and as you do go to a favorite place in your mind Dr Haber suggests one that is serene and peaceful the beach the mountains or a place of your own invention Notice the sights and sounds in that setting the smells and physical sensations youd experience there Stay there for a few moments and really appreciate the beauty and safety that is there she says It will help you destress because you will have removed your senses from the current situation and given yourself a vacation from the problem at hand Theres something nurturing or soothing about the warmth that eases tension and makes you feel calmer Zelman says If   doesnt appeal to you try a mug of chicken soup Itll remind you of what your mother fed you when you were sick as a child when you felt cared for and comforted Dr Christie says Most cravings last about ten minutes so if you can impose another activity for that long the feeling is likely to pass Dr Foreyt says Ask yourself if youre truly hungry If you are have a wholegrain snack such as wholewheat toast with peanut butter or a filling drink like tomato juice if youre not divert your attention by calling a friend playing a favorite CD or taking a walk After even a five to tenminute walk you can come back feeling better able to regulate your mood Zelman says If the craving doesnt pass your best bet may be to eat a small amount of what you want eg a couple of Hersheys Kisses to put a chocolate craving to rest once and for all For acute stress carbohydrates may have a temporary calming effect Dr Christie says and theres nothing wrong with having a small portion of chocolate occasionally Its portioncontrol thats the main issue Use affirmations or pep talks to help weather the emotional storm without eating Usually people catastrophize in an acutely stressful situation Dr Haber explains If you decatastrophize by telling yourself This isnt the end of the world or depersonalize the situation by telling yourself that your boss got upset because hes in a bad mood you can get your balance back To restore your sense of equilibrium slowly repeat to yourself a soothing phrase such as This isnt the end of the world or I can handle this We all react to stress as if everything were a fire Dr Haber explains If you have perspective it helps you cope more calmly and not go off the deep end with food or anger Whether it strikes during family gettogethers or when you fight with your spouse it may seem as though youre a victim of circumstances when dealing with recurrent stress And at times like these you may think its impossible to exercise willpower Not so Anything you can predict you can control Dr Foreyt says Go through the situation in your mind and devise a plan to counteract whats happened in the past If you know youre likely to overeat when your motherinlaw comes to visit make sure you design survival strategies ahead of time to cope with her foodpushing ways or the tension you feel in her presence Try these tactics If you know   try to exercise early in the day to promote feelings of wellbeing all day long A series of studies at California State University Long Beach concluded that exercise appears to be the most effective moodregulating behavior Jot down what foods you tend to eat when youre under stress and when youre likely to eat them Dr Christie suggests Once you know plan ahead and have healthier alternatives or portioncontrolled servings Instead of chowing down on potato chips you might have a small bowl of microwave popcorn if what you crave is something creamy you could have vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream Having one drink might help you relax but more than that adds up to lots of extra calories sleep loss and a headache in the morning Zelman says It can also make you feel worse about the situation at hand since alcohol often has a depressant effect When you feel like youre at wits end sneak away and call a friend Social support can distract you from the stress and from eating Dr Christie says If you have a buddy who is a stress eater and understands what youre going through maybe she can coach you through a tough moment and offer a perspective you havent seen After fighting with your spouse you caved in and ate that pint of Rocky Road ice cream Big deal Remind yourself that an occasional lapse wont wreck your weightmanagement goals but selfflagellation just might Instead of beating yourself up let it slide and vow to get back on track with your next meal If you lose control and eat too much use that experience as a guide for how to handle it the next time says Dr Foreyt The best thing you can do is learn from it
