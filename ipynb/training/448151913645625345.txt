Pediatricians often recommend some mental health counseling for children who have behavior problems like defiance and tantrums But counseling can be hard to find Children are much more likely to get help if the counselor is right there in the doctors office a study finds The children in the study had behavior problems and many also had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or anxiety They were  years old on average and twothirds were boys Half of the  children were referred to outside counselors who took the familys insurance The other half had six to  individual or family counseling sessions with social workers placed in pediatricians offices as part of the study which was conducted by the University of Pittsburgh School of the Health Sciences The inhouse counseling was much better at getting the children to start and continue treatment Slightly more than half of the children referred to outside counselors started treatment compared with  percent of those offered inhouse counseling And  percent of those children completed the recommended treatment compared with  percent given referrals Its not only convenience but easy access to a familiar setting says   a professor of psychiatry psychology and pediatrics who led the study And parent and children dont feel the stigma of going for counseling since its in a pediatrics setting Children in both groups showed improvements in behavior but the families who had counseling at the doctors office had more improvements in behavior and hyperactivity less parental stress and more satisfaction overall But most pediatricians offices dont offer mental health services So whats the typical family to do Now Im trying to promote this on a larger scale in a way thats practical efficient and lowcost Kolko told Shots Hes talked to insurers and health care systems to figure out how to make that happen Some of the clinics who participated in the study have hired the social workers on their own and are billing insurance to pay for them Kolko says Last October NPR reported on efforts to provide   through primary care offices in Oregon This doesnt come easily Kolko adds But before you can ask for reimbursement you have to have evidence to show that it has some level of benefit He says this   which was published Monday in   helps makes the case
