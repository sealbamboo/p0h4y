Perdue Farms   it has ditched the common practice of injecting antibiotics into eggs that are just about to hatch And public health advocates are cheering Theyve been campaigning against the widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture arguing that its adding to the plague of antibioticresistant bacteria This particular use of antibiotics is ubiquitous but littleknown It happens at hatcheries which lie at the heart of largescale chicken production Hatcheries dont get a lot of attention From the outside Perdues hatchery in Salisbury Md is just a simple onestory cinder block building What goes on   though is amazing More than  million eggs arrive here every week from breeding farms a few hours away in West Virginia Unlike the eggs you buy in the store these eggs are fertilized there are embryos inside They go into massive heated incubators for  days Then when theyre almost ready to hatch theyre wheeled out into a hallway Tray by tray they go through a vaccination robot A bank of needles descends Each needle punctures an egg and squirts in a bit of fluid a vaccine against a common chicken virus  a veterinarian and senior vice president for Perdue tells me that the fluid contains a vaccine against   a highly contagious common chicken virus He points out a tiny hole in each egg where the needle went in But that hole is a risk because the last thing you want is bacteria getting in and infecting the embryo Thats why in many hatcheries across the country these machines also inject an antibiotic called gentamicin along with the vaccine Its even   in production of organic chicken It used to happen here but all of Perdues  hatcheries now are off antibiotics  the companys CEO says that weaning wasnt easy You cant do this overnight he says You really got to work hard at it And thats why its an exciting thing because its the culmination of a lot a lot of effort Getting to this point took  years Perdue says When they first tried it a lot of chicks got infections and died StewartBrown says the company learned over the following years how to make sure the hens laying these eggs were healthy and that their eggs were clean as they arrived at the hatchery You cant have dirty eggs coming into the hatchery and be successful at a noantibiotic hatchery he says According to StewartBrown Perdues hatcheries are working better now antibioticfree than they ever did before Public health advocates such as   a veterinarian and senior officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts gave Perdue a round of applause Wednesday From the public health point of view to not use gentamicin in the eggs is a big step she says Hansen and others have been campaigning against the use of antibiotics in farm animals because it can increase the risk that bacteria will evolve to become   This in turn can make human infections harder to treat Other poultry companies have also stopped using antibiotics at some hatcheries but Perdue appears to be the first to make all of its hatcheries antibioticfree The government   meat producers to reduce their antibiotic use in all stages of their animals lives  not just at the hatchery For instance a few days after eggs go through that vaccination robot little yellow chicks emerge Within a few hours theyll be on their way to farms On those farms some of Perdues chickens will get antibiotics in their feed  but only ionophores a class of antibiotics that humans dont take A few flocks  fewer than  percent Perdue says  are likely to get sick they may get antibiotics in their water But an increasing number will get no antibiotics at all StewartBrown says the company is still learning how best to grow chickens without antibiotics It costs more he says But consumers  a little more for chickens that Perdue says were raised using no antibiotics ever
