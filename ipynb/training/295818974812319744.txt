Many big food companies are caught in a dilemma these days They want to rebrand themselves as merchants of health  CocaColas new   are just the latest example  but many of their profits still come from products that make nutritionists scowl If theres one person who symbolizes this tension its   A decade ago Yach a softspoken doctor from South Africa was building a reputation as a thorn in the side of the global food industry He was working at the   in Switzerland leading the WHOs new effort to take on health problems that come from   or from   Among the academic experts who got to know Yach during those years was   a nutrition professor from New York University He was putting enormous pressure on food companies to stop marketing junk foods to kids she recalls I saw him as someone who saw the food industry as an enormously destructive force in public health But Nestle may have misunderstood Yach Yach himself says that food companies were never the enemy The strategy for dealing with the food industry he says was very different from his tactics for fighting tobacco The   was simple Demonize the industry Tax it through the roof Ban all forms of marketing But you cant get the same results with sugary soft drinks he says If you tax them heavily enough you can drive consumers away from those products but that doesnt mean you solve the obesity problem It all depends on what they choose as that alternative With food theres always an alternative  another sugary product on the shelf Food companies create this universe of options which is why Yach felt that he needed to talk to those companies draw them in persuade them to offer consumers better alternatives But he says he never ever thought hed actually go work for one of those companies until one day in  Hed left the WHO and was working at the   in New York He got a call from   who had just been named CEO of PepsiCo She had the most powerful vision of how she wanted to transform the company he recalls PepsiCo sells Pepsi of course And Mountain Dew FritoLay chips Doritos Cheetos and Capn Crunch But PepsiCo had also picked up Tropicana orange juice and Quaker Oats In fact Nooyi wanted to transform the companys entire product line Her vision was very clear There was an opportunity to turn this into the healthiest food and beverage company in the world She wanted Yach inside the company pushing everybody toward that goal He took the job He felt like he had to Nestle  and a lot of other former allies in the public health community  were stunned I couldnt believe it she says I was really astounded I mean its not like he went to work for a company thats selling carrots He went to work for a company thats selling sugar water With that choice Yach became the symbol of a very controversial idea that companies like Pepsi can be part of the effort to get people to eat better Yach stayed at Pepsi for almost six years He left a few months ago While he was there he says he pushed for changes in some of the companys products to make them more healthful like potato chips with less salt and fat and beverages with little or no sugar in them He got very different reactions to this idea in different parts of the company Some took it almost as a personal attack People very much loved and believed in their brands They couldnt believe that there could be anything wrong with them or that they should be reducing the way that they market or sell these delightful tasty brands he says But Yach stuck to his guns I said Weve got to change our marketing strategies Weve got to lower salt sugar fat repeatedly over and over The food technologists on the other hand became Yachs allies They took on the challenge of making a lowsodium snack that   or a soda thats   This is true throughout the food industry Yach says There are pockets of people who are spending their entire lives trying to reformulate as fast as possible PepsiCo has in fact adopted some ambitious longterm goals for cutting salt sugar and fat from its products But when it came to making changes right now  launching new products putting marketing muscle behind them changing recipes  Yachs goals ran into the limits of what the company was prepared to do Executives often got cold feet because all of those things cost money And pulling fullcalorie Pepsi off the shelves certainly wasnt an option You cant just withdraw from markets That would simply be giving up market share to a competitor That wouldnt be permitted by a shareholder Yach says Despite all that and even though hes no longer a PepsiCo employee Yach remains convinced that companies like PepsiCo can in fact help people change their diets for the better He points out that PepsiCo is cutting salt from its products Its selling a lot more reducedcalorie beverages And its now in the hummus and yogurt business The change isnt happening as fast as Yach would like but it is happening because its good business in the long run he says Peoples expectations are changing The arc of history as he puts it is pointing food companies toward more concern for health Nestle though thinks Yach is wellmeaning but naive PepsiCo hasnt changed that much she says The companys sugary soft drinks are still adding to obesity worldwide In fact she says Yach actually has hurt the cause of public health by giving the company more credibility He was a much greater asset to PepsiCola than Pepsi was to him or to public health Yach has moved on now to a company called the   Its part of a health insurer in South Africa The Vitality Group finds ways to pay people to do healthful things like eat more fruit and vegetables or exercise It makes money doing this because it then has to pay fewer medical bills This is an industry apparently that really can capture profits by promoting better health
