Can choral singing really help people age well Maintain their health and their crucial social connections Perhaps find their way through grief and loss Thats a tall order but the new film Unfinished Song quietly makes those claims Opening in New York and Los Angeles on Friday and then around the country it struck me as predictably plotted but with several elements to recommend it a Terence Stamp

d An energetic choir of other older singers mostly recruited from actual community choruses in England You may recall   the  documentary about a Northampton Mass senior chorus of the same name Going strong since  the group rehearses twice a week has released three CDs and has given concerts around the world most recently in Belgium and Holland You might expect performers over age   the minimum age  to stick with memoryfanning songs of their youth But YoungHeart is currently working on tunes by Yo La Tengo and the Flaming Lips  It exercises the brain You have to learn stuff the choir director Bob Cilman said People work hard to stay in and continue Its probably good for their health Theres some evidence that hes right Choral singing has been shown to strengthen neural connections fortify the immune system and reduce stress and depression It seems to tinker with the chemicals in the brain in just the right way to make people feel better said Stacy Horn author of the new book Imperfect Harmony Finding Happiness Singing With Others As for the impact on older choristers a  study comparing singers in Washington DC choruses for those over age  with nonsinging groups found that the   Julene Johnson a neuroscientist at the University of California San Francisco has done   where choruses for all ages genders and interests are ubiquitous When she asked senior singers about their experiences they said they got emotional benefits relaxation and social support from participating Dr Johnson said It seemed to have a relationship with how highly they rated their quality of life Wouldnt you think there would be scores of similar organizations around the United States for older singers Possibly there are but without a national umbrella group they are hard to track Of course many thousands of older adults probably continue singing with allage community and church choirs but I can also see good reasons to form choruses specifically for older adults The   which grew out of that  study now offers  choruses for the plus crowd at senior centers and residences and community colleges in Maryland Virginia and Washington These seem to favor more traditional vocal music heres a YouTube   performing Aaron Copland in a concert last month In San Francisco Dr Johnson is starting the   recruiting about  singers over age   no previous choral experience required  at a dozen senior centers to study its impact on their mobility cognition and psychosocial wellbeing over the course of a year A bit north in Mill Valley a chorus called Rock the Ages follows the YoungHeart template and recently covered the Whos My Generation Of course But where else Lets see if we can come up with a broader list If you or a family member sings in a chorus for older adults please tell us about it Where is your group and what does it sing What do you value about the experience And a bonus question suggested by the fact that the chorus in Unfinished Song performs not only Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder tunes but also SaltNPepas Lets Talk About Sex My moviegoing buddy took offense seeing ageism afoot Wasnt singing hiphop and heavy metal a toocute attempt at pretending to be young A sacrifice of hardwon dignity Was the film audience laughing with them or at them Im ambivalent on the issue But I can agree with Mr Cilman of YoungHeart who says that his chorus members live interesting lives They perform for big audiences they get great responses he said Its unexpected for them God I hope something like this happens for me when Im older
