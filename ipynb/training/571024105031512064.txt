Consumption of emulsifiers additives widely used in the production of processed foods promotes inflammatory bowel disease and a cluster of obesityrelated diseases known as metabolic syndrome and may have contributed to the sharp rise in these conditions over the last three decades says a new study conducted on rats The emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose often referred to as cellulose gum and polysorbate  also known as Tween  add bulk to foods and keep sauces smooth and frozen confections from separating They plump up fastfood shakes keep bottled salad dressings creamy and prevent ice cream from dissolving into an unsightly soup when left out Theyre also used extensively in pharmaceuticals to improve the consistency of gel capsules to make pills come apart in the stomach and to keep medication suspended in fluids But when fed to rats in volumes that mimic their widespread consumption in humans both emulsifiers induced lowgrade inflammation increased weight gain and fat deposition caused worrisome changes in metabolic function and changed the mix of bacteria that colonized their digestive tracts the authors reported The   published Wednesday as a Research Letter in the journal Nature suggests that the ubiquitous use of emulsifiers in processed foods consumed by Americans might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesitymetabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases In rats the consumption of the two emulsifiers appeared to administer a onetwo punch to the gut The detergentlike molecules were found to erode the mucous membrane that lines the gut and provides a buffer between the delicate epithelial cells of the intestinal surface and the garden of microorganisms that flourish there The food additives also appeared to alter the composition of gut microbes not only boosting strains that promote inflammation but driving down strains that check the process The FDA has labeled carboxymethylcellulose generally recognized as safe or GRAS a category of food additives that has been in long use without evidence of toxicity Cellulose gum is widely used in foods at concentrations of  The agency has approved the use of polysorbate  in certain foods at concentrations of up to  Led by microbiologists at Georgia State Universitys Institute for Biomedical Sciences a team of researchers fed several types of rats concentrations of the two additives dissolved in their water and separately in their chow The three groups of rats  one group of normal healthy lab rats a second engineered to have a predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease and a third engineered to have sterile digestive tracts  allowed the researcher to discern the conditions under which the emulsifiers caused trouble The rats at higher risk of developing colitis responded to the emulsifierenhanced diet by developing robust colitis suggesting that the additives had a pronounced inflammatory effect on them The response of wildtype rats was more muted but certainly problematic Those rats developed evidence of chronic intestinal inflammation with damage to the delicate epithelial cells linings their intestines Researchers noted modest but statistically significant weight gain in these rats and a marked increase in fat deposition They ate more chow and their glycemic control and glucose tolerance both showed signs of impairment In both sets of mice a clear difference emerged After the introduction of emulsifiers into their diets the protective mucus barrier separating the microbiome and the walls of the intestines was thinner Only the rats with bowels free of microbiota appeared to be immune to the additives effects  evidence said the researchers that the inflammation linked to additives is the result of a disturbance in the relationship among the gut microbiome the layer of protective mucus and the epithelial wall In addition to calling into question the wisdom of ingesting either emulsifier a nearimpossibility for anyone who eats food prepared by others the researchers said their findings should prompt the FDA to reconsider the criteria they use in declaring food additives safe FDA safety testing of food additives has generally sought to rule out the possibility that their ingestion would cause immediate poisoning or that its ongoing consumption would cause cancer the authors said The FDAs process they added is not designed to detect the effects of daily consumption of an additive on such subtle measures as inflammation and microbiotic diversity  which research suggest are probably linked That they suggested should change Its not clear whether the emulsifierinduced inflammation seen in rats reflects what goes on in the human gut in response to carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate  Studies in animals suggested that polysorbate  could cause anaphylactic shock and that its injection could disturb development of reproductive organs But human testing did not bear out such concerns The study
