One of the great divides in malefemale relationships is the chick flick  movies like Terms of Endearment and The Notebook that often leave women in tears and men bored But now a fascinating new study shows that sappy relationship movies made in Hollywood can actually help strengthen relationships in the real world A University of Rochester study found that couples who watched and talked about issues raised in movies like Steel Magnolias and Love Story were less likely to divorce or separate than couples in a control group Surprisingly the Love Story intervention was as effective at keeping couples together as two intensive therapistled methods The findings while preliminary have important implications for marriage counseling efforts The movie intervention could become a selfhelp option for couples who are reluctant to join formal therapy sessions or could be used by couples who live in areas with less access to therapists A movie is a nonthreatening way to get the conversation started said   an associate professor of psychology at the University of Rochester and the lead author of the study Its really exciting because it makes it so much easier to reach out to couples and help them strengthen their relationships on a wide scale The initial goal of the study was to evaluate two types of therapistled interventions called CARE and PREP The CARE method focuses on acceptance and empathy in couples counseling while PREP is centered on a specific communication style that couples use to resolve issues The researchers wanted a third option that allowed couples to interact but did not involve intensive counseling They came up with the movie intervention assigning couples to watch five movies and to take part in guided discussions afterward A fourth group of couples received no counseling or selfhelp assignments and served as a control group Going into the study the researchers expected that the CARE and PREP methods would have a pronounced effect on relationships and that the movie intervention might result in some mild improvements to relationship quality To their surprise the movie intervention worked just as well as both of the established therapy methods in reducing divorce and separation Among  couples studied those who received marriage counseling or took part in the movie intervention were half as likely to divorce or separate after three years compared with couples in the control group who received no intervention The divorce or separation rate was  percent in the intervention groups compared with  percent in the control group Dr Rogge and senior author   a director of the   at the University of California Los Angeles   In determining the list of relationship movies that might be useful to couples the researchers eliminated popular romantic comedies or falling in love movies like Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry Met Sally Instead they put together a list of movies that show couples at various highs and lows in their relationships Hollywood can place very unrealistic expectations on romantic relationships Dr Rogge said The idea that you are supposed to fall in love instantly and effortlessly is not reality and not relevant to most couples who are two three or four years into a relationship Some of the movies on the list like Couples Retreat are funny and not necessarily realistic But they are enough to get a dialogue going Dr Rogge said Since completing the initial study Dr Rogge and his colleagues have been recruiting couples from around the country to study the effect of the movie intervention on different relationships including longmarried and samesex couples Megan Clifton a yearold student in Knoxville Tenn has lived with her boyfriend for nearly two years Although she says the two have great communication she opted to try the movie intervention While watching the movie Date Night with Tina Fey and Steve Carell the couple laughed at a scene in which the husband fails to close drawers and cabinet doors He leaves cabinet doors open all the time and I become the nagging girlfriend and he shuts down a little Ms Clifton said When we were watching the movie I said Thats you and it was humorous We ended up laughing about it and it has helped us look at our relationship and our problems in a humorous way Matt and Kellie Butler of Ashtabula Ohio have been married for  years and also feel the movie intervention has helped their relationship So far they have watched Love and Other Drugs and Shes Having a Baby Its kind of powerful Mr Butler said Its like watching a role play in a grouptherapy session but its a movie so its less threatening and more entertaining Mr Butler said that even though he and his wife have a strong bond longmarried couples sometimes forget to talk about their relationship Weve been married  years but its not something you sit down and have a conversation about he said When you watch the movie it focuses your conversation on your relationship Couples interested in the method can find more information at   Dr Rogge noted that more research is needed to determine the effect on a variety of couples One flaw of the study is that the control group was not truly randomized While the couples in the control group seemed similar to other couples in the study in terms of demographics and relationship quality further research is needed to validate the movie method I believe its the depth of the discussions that follow each movie and how much effort and time and introspection couples put into those discussions that will predict how well they do going forward said Dr Rogge
