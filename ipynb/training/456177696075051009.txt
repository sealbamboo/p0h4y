But it doesnt have to be  Activists like Bo Laurent Jim Ambrose and Pidgeon Pagonis have made it their mission to guide people with intersex traits and differences of sex development known as DSD toward understanding their own worth in the world Theyre demanding visibility and justice in a culture that has long mythologized marginalized and misunderstood their bodies And some of them are hoping to find love with someone who truly sees them  Its hard for people to wrap their head around what exactly is going on It gets everywhere  its nothing but sprawl Its not limited to the bedroom says Ambrose   and the cofounder of   a site that collects and shares personal stories of people living with an intersex condition or DSD So lets start in the classroom with a quick lesson on what intersex is not  though the two are often erroneously lumped together or the hermaphrodite of lore and porn possessed of fully functioning and physically impossible male and female genitalia  Its also not especially uncommon A visible difference of sexual anatomy occurs in  out of every  to  births according to statistics from the World Health Organization  Medically speaking intersex is defined as a congenital anomaly of the reproductive and sexual system   a senior research scholar at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Stanford University says that in most cases people have a genetic mutation that affects development of sex organs This might be evident at birth later in life or not at all For example in the case of people with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome these women have XY chromosomes and testes Their bodies produce testosterone but because their bodies dont respond to it the genitalia dont masculinize and they dont develop masculine secondary sex characteristics such as increased muscle mass a deeper voice and facial hair  They have XY chromosomes and testes and you wouldnt know that at birth because they are born with female genitalia Karkazis says From the s until recently parents of babies born with atypical or ambiguous genitalia were generally presented one option genital surgery This is most often done to present the child as female because of doctors beliefs that its an easier outcome to achieve with available medical techniques This often entails surgeries to remove testes reduce organs that might present as a small phallus or an outsized clitoris or add a vaginal cavity To parents  shocked and confused by anatomy they dont understand and envisioning a life of otherness and romantic rejection for their newborn  surgery to normalize can seem like the most loving course of action In  intersex rights pioneer Bo Laurent was born into a world of confusion Medical professionals were in a state of shock for three days unable to determine what sex she was and her mother was kept sedated Laurent was eventually labeled a boy and her parents were dismissed from the hospital unable to seek additional child care lest their secret get out When she was  years old another doctor decided to change her sex assignment so she could be raised as a girl They performed a clitorectomy and they told my parents to move to another town and not tell anyone where they went and never tell me what happened Laurent says All those things were so traumatizing frightening and painproducing for my parents that it made it hard for them to relate normally to me Alienated from her parents withdrawn from her peers and deeply disconnected from her medically numbed and scarred body Laurent avoided romantic and intimate connection with partners well into her s Then she started to seek answers  The discovery of her intersex status finally offered a path into the world Over the course of the past two decades with her work as an activist speaker and founder of the nowdefunct Intersex Society of North America Laurent has led others on a journey to connect body and soul  their own and others One of the things Im proud of is that I think that Ive helped to provide frameworks to talk about it narratives that are now available to other people Laurent says Jim Ambrose is one of the people Laurent helped Though hed been surgically assigned as female as a baby furthered by hormones and by additional surgeries his late teens Ambrose now  vividly recalls how different he felt from the other girls even at an early age I remember the first girl in my class wearing a bra and I reacted exactly as every other boy in the class did he says I was enamored and fascinated  Unconsciously he knew that the interest didnt spring from girltogirl solidarity or a glimpse at his future Watching a schoolmandated sexed film about menstruation he thought I dont think this is ever going to happen to me It didnt of course Ambroses mother disclosed the reason when he was  and estrogen treatments soon followed  Neither did he experience the sexual connections his peers were making  At  Ambrose  still perceived as female by his peers  had a girlfriend by default he jokes rather than a drive to romantically bond He studiously kept her away from his intimate parts In retrospect it was out of selfprotection While the girlfriend never argued she did confess to mutual friends that the distance weirded her out  Word got back to Ambrose and he was suddenly painfully aware that while he felt a deep detachment from his femaleassigned body it was no longer just of interest to his parents and doctors It was now of interest to his peers   and his future sexual partners After all thats what it had been surgically constructed for  The guiding principle was pairbonding with a man and to be even more specific to make sure that I possessed a proper vessel for an erect penis Ambrose says The end goal wasnt that I would be a sexually satisfied woman or a person who was curious about other forms of sexuality  My personal sexual pleasure wasnt taken into account Stanfords Karkazis sees this all too frequently in her work and friendships with members of the intersex community Imagine for a moment that you want to connect with someone sexually and you feel nothing sexual in your genitalia Or you feel pain I know people who have tried everything under the sun and have even contemplated more surgery Imagine this kind of searching Karkazis says The door is closed before its even opened You can think youre so damaged that no one will be satisfied with you But after Ambrose struck up a friendship with Laurent he used her framework of disclosure to amplify attempts at connection A sympathetic and proactive doctor agreed with him that the removal of breasts and vaginoplasty were medically necessary  and the way to correct a wrong that had been done to him by the medical community She started him on a regimen of compounded testosterone cream to correct bone density deficits that occurred when he stopped taking estrogen  While he hadnt consciously considered transitioning to a more malepresenting body before then his physical response to the hormones was undeniable  Almost immediately I felt a difference Ambrose recalls Its like when a hunter is walking slowly through the woods and he steps on a branch and it cracks and the deer pops its head up to see whats going on What What was that My body was telling me Hey this shit is good Lets do this Were into this  A year later when he was in his late s he began taking testosterone injections and presenting as male in public His psyche and body were more aligned than they had ever been before and he had been dating women all along but the transition ushered in a whole new set of insecurities  Ambrose says I was a man who didnt have the penis that everyone was going to expect And by everybody I mean that I was really focused on dating straight women I wanted to date women who were going to desire me as a man  I wanted a woman to see me from across the room and say Yeah I want to f that guy before they knew anything about me He adopted Laurents technique of presenting his story honestly and early telling prospective partners I work at this bookstore but mostly I do advocacy work and it sends me around the country and I organize and do workshops and I sit on committees and I do fundraising for this little organization and  why do I do that Well because it happened to me  And it worked A lot Date after date after date was a rousing success according to Ambrose  It puts me in a position of somebody who is being proactive about their life One who is acting in defense of myself and others he says  To couch it that way informs the listener  often a potential sexual partner  that I care what you think but I know enough about myself to know that if you want to perceive me as a victim cry for me be disgusted by me or get up and leave you can do all of those things My happiness selfawareness and ability to get up in the morning doesnt hinge on whether you want me to go home with you tonight While Ambroses most recent longterm relationship ended a few months ago he grows increasingly comfortable in the body he now has and steadfast in his attempts at romantic connection with the right woman I think there is a resilience gene There are so many times when I could have packed it in or subsisted on scraps Or I could have chosen girlfriends who were bad for me or cruel or abusive but I didnt Ambrose says  I need for them to see me as plainly and clearly as they possibly can I need unequivocal visibility from my sexual partner Pidgeon Pagonis sought intimacy and found pain in its place Pagonis identifies as neither male nor female and uses the genderneutral pronouns they them and their to describe themselves  Im really persuaded by things like the idea of what high school should be I really wanted a high school experience and part of that was dating a boy and having sex with that boy says Pagonis now   At age  Pagonis was told that the genital surgery they had received as a child was to treat cancer and the one they were about to receive was to fix a urine drip issue In fact the latter was to insert a vaginoplasty At  Pagonis was dismayed by difficulty and pain during attempts at intercourse with a boyfriend Id never had any dilation which would have kept the passage open so it was just a shock to my body I left that moment being like That really hurt  Pagonis says But Cosmo magazine said it would get better It didnt get better in terms of pleasure but it got better in terms of not hurting as much every single time Still Pagonis soon came to associate almost any intimacy including kissing with the impending pain of penetration and found any desire evaporate the moment they were touched Alcohol and marijuana offered some distance from the ache but ushered in a host of other issues including a cycle of abusive partners and vulnerability to sexual assaults while blackout drunk I wanted to be so drunk that sex felt OK I thought Id feel less reserved and that sex would feel good You strive to be normal when you know youre not normal Instead of talking it through I would just drink Pagonis says  After a college professor lectured on the topic of intersex traits and DSD to a psychology of women class something clicked Pagonis walked across the street from their classroom at DePaul University down into the hospital basement where coincidentally their own medical records were kept  There Pagonis ripped open the shroud of shame and secrecy that had swaddled their body since the first surgery The terms were unfamiliar  male pseudohermaphrodite and  XY  but suddenly so much made sense Their mother confirmed and after throwing their phone at the wall Pagonis vowed to tell no one But souls are loud and determined things They seek and reach for connection despite all our best attempts at muffling them Six months after the revelation Pagonis started dating a woman to whom they disclosed the diagnosis While the alignment of anatomy threw their physical differences into sharp relief  I still dont think my high school boyfriend knows I didnt have a clitoris Pagonis likes to joke  alternatives to penetrative sex opened up a whole new realm of connection  These elements of intimacy are what I needed at the time Pagonis says Tickling is my hurrah For now the muting of sexual pleasure from the result of surgery and sexual trauma has proved a barrier to romantic pairing Pagonis is flying solo and attempting to find peace and pleasure in their own body with the help of a therapist  Sex is  fiction and  friction  Pagonis quotes the therapist That stuck with me because when I was with people I was always having fiction in my head and I thought this is because Im messed up and I cant just get off from the person  Pagonis relies on wise words from Laurent too She told me Who cares Think about whatever you need to Its in your head and youre not hurting anybody If you can get off then good for you   I let the shame of having a different body and not looking normal debilitate me Pagonis says I needed that permission and Bo gave it to me Pagonis now works as Advocates for Informed Choices  and a teen dating violence prevention coordinator and firmly believes that doctors and parents lack of disclosure to intersexed children is as harmful as cosmetic surgery to conceal the physical differences  If people would just be honest and talk to you about your body you might still make the same decisions but I might not have  and I would have had someone to talk to and make healthier safer choices Pagonis says  Ambrose agrees I have yet to meet a parent who was intentionally trying to hurt their child I have as much sympathy for my parents and my friends parents as I do us You perform these surgeries aimed to normalize a child and then you expect the child to be quiet and not talk to anyone about it Youre going to color every aspect of the childs life and your life And at  Laurent herself is still learning the boundaries of her own worth and wonder After the end of her marriage and a period of being single she decided to try again and was shocked to find herself loved and loving once more  Laurent found herself opening her heart to a younger woman who she met online and who had never heard of intersex conditions  She wasnt familiar with those words or the story but I did tell her about the clitorectomy I was surprised and comforted at how well she took that Laurent says For all the people who Laurent has rowed to safety in her years of advocacy it was a personal risk for her and this woman could see that She reached across the distance between them As they were becoming more serious she sent Laurent a quote she still remembers It read Love is like jumping off a cliff  Laurent says Your head says youre going to die but your heart says thats OK you can fly  PDF   documentary by Porter Gale and Laleh Soomekh   essay by Tamara Beck   documentary
