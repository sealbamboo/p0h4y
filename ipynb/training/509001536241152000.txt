Heres what you need to know as a parent  The virus usually starts like the common cold symptoms include sneezing a runny nose and a cough This is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus  But some patients will get a severe cough have difficulty breathing andor develop a rash EVD is sometimes also accompanied by a fever or wheezing Unfortunately in the beginning its difficult  if not impossible  to tell the difference between a regular cold and this type of virus But there are symptoms you should be on the lookout for if your child becomes sick Go to the doctor if he or she develops a fever or a rash or if your child has difficulty breathing Children with asthma or a history of breathing problems are particularly susceptible for severe symptoms  There is no specific treatment for enteroviruses according to the CDC Plenty of rest fluids and overthecounter medications will help ease symptoms in standard cases  Patients who are hospitalized will likely receive assistance breathing and whats called supportive therapy to help their immune systems fight off the infection  Twelve states are investigating clusters of enterovirus illnesses Alabama Colorado Michigan Georgia Ohio Iowa Illinois Missouri Kansas Oklahoma Kentucky and Utah But EVD is often hard to distinguish from its relatives so the virus could be in other states as well  Anyone can get infected with enteroviruses   but infants children and teens are more likely to become sick because they have not yet built up immunity from previous exposures to the viruses The respiratory illness spreads through close contact just like the common cold You can also be infected by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them then touching your face Theres not a great deal you can do health officials say beyond taking commonsense steps to reduce the risk Wash your hands with soap and water for  seconds  particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people such as toys and doorknobs Avoid shaking hands kissing hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick And stay home if you feel unwell
