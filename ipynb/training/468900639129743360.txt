A new study based on realworld data from England lends support to the idea that electronic cigarettes can help smokers quit using regular cigarettes Among a sample of  adults who tried to kick the habit without prescription medications or counseling those who turned to ecigarettes were about  more likely to succeed than those who used nicotine replacement therapy or went cold turkey Researchers from University College London published their results online Tuesday in the journal   Scientists and public health officials are eager to sort out the pros and cons of ecigarettes which are lightly regulated and increasingly popular Surveys and clinical trials designed to measure the effectiveness of ecigarettes as a smoking cessation tool have produced mixed results For the new study researchers turned to data from the   an ongoing survey of English smokers They examined survey responses gathered between July  when ecigarettes were relatively new and February  from smokers who said they tried to quit at least once in the previous year For the sake of simplicity they focused on three groups of wouldbe quitters Those who used only ecigarettes  of the sample those who used only nonprescription nicotine replacement items like gum or patches  of the sample and those who didnt use any kind of smoking cessation treatment  of the sample The raw data were strongly in favor of ecigarettes with  of those who used them saying that they had quit smoking That compared with  of those who used nonprescription nicotine replacement therapy and  of those who went cold turkey But the people who opted for electronic cigarettes were not the same as other smokers so the researchers controlled for factors like age gender socioeconomic status and the degree of their nicotine dependence With these factors taken into account the researchers found that people who used electronic cigarettes were  times more likely to to quit smoking than those who opted for nicotine replacement therapy In addition they were  times more likely to succeed than people who didnt use any smoking cessation aids The study participants did not have to verify their nonsmoking status by taking a urine test or anything else the researchers noted But they said that given the surveys design people would have had little incentive to lie The findings provide reliable information on the value of ecigarettes in the real world the study authors concluded Ecigarettes may prove to be both an efficacious and effective aid to smoking cessation they wrote Insofar that this is true ecigarettes may substantially improve public health because of their widespread appeal and the huge health gains associated with stopping smoking The study was funded in part by Pfizer which makes the smoking cessation drug varenicline sold under the trade names Chantix and Champix In addition four of the five researchers disclosed that they had received grants and other fees from companies that develop and manufacture smoking cessation medications None of the five has a financial relationship with a company that makes electronic cigarettes Senior author   a professor of health psychology and director of tobacco studies at University College London is the editor in chief of Addiction
