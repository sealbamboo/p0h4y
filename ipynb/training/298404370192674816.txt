 A type of bacteria from the mouth can cause blood clots and lead to serious   if it enters the bloodstream a new study indicates The bacteria called   contributes to plaque that forms on the surface of teeth If the bacteria enters the bloodstream through bleeding gums it can cause problems by masquerading as human proteins the researchers found The study authors from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom discovered that   can produce a molecule on its surface that enables it to mimic the human protein fibrinogen which is a bloodclotting factor This activates platelets cells that are found in blood and involved in clotting and causes them to clump inside blood vessels The resulting blood clots encase the bacteria protecting the invader from the immune system and from antibiotics used to treat infection Platelet clumping can result in growths on the heart valves endocarditis or blood vessel inflammation that can block blood supply to the heart or brain The findings to be presented at a Society for General Microbiology meeting in Dublin this week could help lead to new treatments for infective endocarditis said study author Dr Helen Petersen In the development of infective endocarditis a crucial step is the bacteria sticking to the heart valve and then activating platelets to form a clot Petersen said in a society news release We are now looking at the mechanism behind this sequence of events in the hope that we can develop new drugs which are needed to prevent blood clots and also infective   The researchers stressed that its important to keep the gums healthy and get regular dental care We are also trying to determine how widespread this phenomenon is by studying other bacteria related to   Petersen said What our work clearly shows is how important it is to keep your mouth healthy through regular brushing and flossing to keep these bacteria in check Because this study was presented at a medical meeting the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal
