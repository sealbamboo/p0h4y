Ebolahit countries in West Africa are ripe for a measles outbreak that could infect hundreds of thousands of people US researchers warn  More than  people have died in the largest ever outbreak of the virus But a study in the journal Science suggests there could be even more deaths from other diseases because of the devastating impact on the countries vaccination programmes Experts said an increase in such infections was likely There have been  cases of Ebola in Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone  Many healthcare facilities closed and the fear of Ebola meant people did not show up at those that remained It has had a knockon effect on immunisation campaigns for measles polio TB and other diseases  An international team of scientists tried to estimate the impact on measles protection  They ran detailed models assuming  of vaccination programmes had been disrupted  The scientists estimated that  more people were becoming susceptible to measles every month At the start of the outbreak they said there were  unvaccinated children and the total would increase to  after  months of the outbreak  Their sophisticated predictions suggested this would translate to an additional  measles cases on top of the  that would be anticipated in a preEbola measles outbreak It could lead to  extra deaths more than have died from Ebola the team suggested Dr Justin Lessler of Johns Hopkins University in the US said Measles in particular is known to show up during or after humanitarian crises because it is so infectious  The addition of so many unvaccinated children to the already considerable atrisk population significantly increases the likelihood of a major measles outbreak Measles is not the only health threat that has been made worse by the Ebola crisis and may not even be the most dire but it is one we can do something about Prof Jonathan Ball of the University of Nottingham told the BBC News website The Ebola virus outbreak has put immense strain on healthcare systems that were already stretched  It was always likely that we would see an upturn in other diseases and infections as these creaking systems diverted attention to fight the emerging Ebola virus epidemic These are predictions and not hard fact but we shouldnt be surprised if we see an upturn in measles as we know that immunisation is key to controlling what can be a very serious infection The real lesson from all of this is the need to build better healthcare systems and to overturn what are significant global health inequalities
