Laura Hillenbrand the bestselling author of   is known for her exuberant storytelling and dynamic characters Her newest book   is a riveting tale of the life of an athlete and war hero Louis Zamperini Ms Hillenbrands ability to transport her readers to another time and place is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that she is largely homebound debilitated by chronic fatigue syndrome or CFS The illness a devastating and little understood disorder is characterized by overwhelming fatigue and various nonspecific symptoms like muscle pain memory problems sore throat swollen lymph nodes achy joints and unrefreshing sleep I recently spoke with Ms Hillenbrand about her latest book and why she is speaking out about the challenges of life with CFS Heres our conversation I had never been public about my illness at all before Seabiscuit I didnt want to talk about it very much because I had the experience of being dismissed and ridiculed People dont understand this illness and the name is so misleading I realized I had this opportunity because I was going to be getting press attention for the book Im going to talk about it because I can Maybe that will save the next person from going through what I did This is why I talk about it You cant look at me and say Im lazy or that this is someone who wants to avoid working The average person who has this disease before they got it we were not lazy people its very typical that people were Type A and hard hard workers I was that kind of person I was working my tail off in college and loving it Its exasperating because of the name which is condescending and so grossly misleading Fatigue is what we experience but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb This disease leaves people bedridden Ive gone through phases where I couldnt roll over in bed I couldnt speak To have it called fatigue is a gross misnomer Most people when they hear the disease name its all they know about it It sounds so mild When I first was sick for the first  years or so I was dismissed I was ridiculed and told I was lazy It was a joke I got it when I was  and I was diagnosed at  by the head of infectious disease at Johns Hopkins It was the most hellish year of my life I went from doctor to doctor I got very thin and lost  pounds in a month One doctor thought I was anorexic and lectured me about it After my appointment he followed me to the bathroom and put his ear to the door When my doctor at Johns Hopkins finally said You have a real disease that was an important moment for me As it does in most people it had a very sudden onset I was an athlete and had always been healthy I was riding in a car on my way back from spring break my sophomore year of college and felt very nauseated I guessed it was food poisoning I woke up a few days later and I literally could not sit up I was so weak It hit me that fast I had to drop out of school because I couldnt make the walk to the classes I was bedridden the first two years I was having fever all the time and huge lymph nodes the reddest rawest terrible sore throat typical sweats and chills like the flu but it didnt go away month after month I had the most extreme exhaustion and balance problems strange cognitive things trouble concentrating I couldnt read analog clocks anymore Id try to say one word and a different word would come up I had brain fog that was terrible in  and  and then it started to slowly get better I did better until  when I tried to take a road trip to Saratoga I had a catastrophic CFS crash went into shock and went back down to the bottom to worse than ever Then vertigo started and ever since the room appears to be moving around me I feel like Im moving all the time Im housebound now I had a relapse while I was working on the book in  I got weaker than Ive ever been Ive been too weak to leave the house for two years I only leave the house about once a month Im just not very strong A lot of days I dont get down the stairs Its a slow process to recovery The book publicity is quite difficult for me Im not able to do that much of it Its taking a whole lot out of me Its a tradeoff for me While its really hard to do at the same time Im escaping my body which I really want to do Im living someone elses life I get very intensely into the story into the interviews and the research Im experiencing things along with my subjects I have a freedom I dont have in my physical life Writing is a godsend to me that way Without it I wouldnt have anything I am completely still almost all the time A lot of time I dont leave the upstairs What I have is the story Im working on Its a wonderful thing for me to get out of my body for a while Because my life is so silent and so still I think Im able to get deeper into what Im working on My mind is willing to get out of here and go into there It becomes such an intense experience At the time I got sick I wanted to be a history professor I was  years old when I went across the street from my house to a fair and they always had a used book sale For a quarter I bought a book  called Come On Seabiscuit I loved that book It stayed with me all those years I was sick and housebound and looking for something I could write about I wrote an article I was partway through it and realized there was a huge untold story Lots and lots of interviews at least a hundred and going through newspaper archives The family of Seabiscuits owner sent me  enormous leather scrapbooks I bought so many things on eBay  vintage things magazines I did many interviews with very very old men Im married I have a wonderful husband The house is all set up for me There is a refrigerator upstairs My desk has everything I need Toaster utensil and bowls teapot  everything I need I got married in  Weve been together since before I got sick Hes my college sweetheart We waited to get married until I got reasonably well I was too sick to go to the reception I was just at the wedding for a few minutes He has been through this with me Some couples it would drive apart it has drawn us together We have a deep understanding He doesnt see me as a sick person He sees me as everything else I am Its a really wonderful relationship We had to learn how to do it Its not easy at all to be a couple with a disease Seabiscuit led me to him My subject was one of the greatest runners in the world in the s likely to break the fourminute mile Seabiscuit was famous at the same time All the newspapers that covered Seabiscuit also covered Louis I kept reading about him When I got done with Seabiscuit I wrote him a letter and called him and he told me his life story I had to write this book Its the most amazing survival story Louis was an Olympic runner who hung up his shoes and became a bombardier He crashed in the Pacific and floated on a raft for  days Sharks jumped on board to pull him off He was attacked by a Japanese bomber He nearly starved to death He went through a typhoon and was captured His captors experimented on him enslaved him and he was a prisoner for two years The things that happened to him and his defiance  its an amazing story I think because of what Im dealing with Im really interested in people who become trapped in extremity and have to rely on their character to pull them out of it Im fascinated by the struggle and the attributes that enable people to survive these things I want to look to them for inspiration I think thats why Im drawn to it Louis has told me he felt I was someone who was easy to open up to because he knows Ive suffered With someone else I think he might have been a little more taciturn But he felt She gets it Shes been to this place herself Having to go all the way to the bottom of yourself to find the resources to survive this is something I understand well I understand desperation Its an emotion I have dealt with a thousand times in the last  years You feel like you dont know where youre going to get the strength to go on Weve been to the same place in different circumstances Im not comparing myself to a prisoner of war but there are common emotions that enable me to identify with him I dont remember what its like to feel well Im  I was  when I got sick Its a lifetime ago Its hard for me to imagine what I would have been as a writer without the history I have now Were all sitting in our particular circumstances and writing from that place My husband wants me to I just dont know that I want to do that I have to spend so much time being vigilant on my body and worrying about my body and suffering So much of my own autobiography would be about my health and I dont know if I want to spend my professional life thinking about that I write to escape my circumstances Body willing and if I can find a subject that compels me Ill keep writing Its a great way to touch the world because Im not in this world I went out recently to the CVS drugstore for the first time and they had these new checkout things with no person at the checkout counter I was baffled by this Writing is my way of communicating with the world and I dont have any other way to do it so I want to keep doing it
