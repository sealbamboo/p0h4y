When Ariel Sharon died in January this year eight years after a stroke hed survived for longer than would probably be expected had he lived elsewhere in the world  Since  its been illegal in Israel to turn off ventilators when a person is dying or has no hope of recovery The result is that large numbers of patients spend years on life support many of them unconscious After surviving Auschwitz as a small child only to find herself without a family home after the war Hava whos now  made a promise to herself   When she grew up she would have her children young provide them with a warm home and then after theyd left she and her husband Schmail would have a second childhood and this time it would be a happier one   For a while it was but then her husband developed heart disease and one day at the age of  he collapsed  For the past  years he has lain in a bed in a converted psychiatric hospital up in the hills on the outskirts of Jerusalem   Like all the other patients here he lies silently with a large tube connected to a hole in his throat that breathes air into his lungs  Hava spends six hours a day at his bedside I try to talk to him she tells me I let him know hes not alone  Hes unconscious but she thinks the one voice he recognises is hers I try to keep him alive she says So long as he has a warm hand thats something  A few patients are propped up on pillows The odd one stares into the distance but for the most part each bay contains people who look as though theyre sleeping somehow suspended in limbo between life and death   At the nurses station theres a CCTV monitor where all  patients can be viewed on one screen and you see very little movement  just sleeping people   In most countries a ward like this would not exist and doctors and families in discussion together might have made the decision to turn off Schmails ventilator to allow him to die   But since  this has been illegal in Israel and is considered to be killing the patient even if they are already dying The law in Israel was informed by Jewish tradition but talking to families of other faiths in the hospital here it seems to have become a cultural viewpoint too  When I visit the childrens ward there are the colourful mobiles wall friezes and the tinny sounds of piped nursery rhymes There are  children here and it feels like any other childrens ward  barring the absence of much noise Some of these children survived drowning others had nearfatal accidents Its as though theyve been put down for an afternoon nap except that they dont wake up And over the years they grow of course  I meet Eli Cohen whose daughter was only three years old when she choked on her own vomit during the night starving her brain of oxygen  He tells me she was a very very sweet girl but theres there very little chance of recovery  Israels position on keeping ventilated patients alive is particularly unusual when patients are not stable on a ventilator but dying on one When a patient is dying decisions have to be made both by the medical team and the family about what treatment they receive  The Jewish faith draws a clear distinction between withholding and withdrawing   Any act that hastens death is prohibited so it follows that it is illegal to turn a ventilator off when a patient is dying even if this would ease his suffering Shes now  and looks like a teenager Her sisters visit her every day to keep her up to date with the family events which she will never attend  She lies in bed on a ventilator with limited movement She cant even blink said Eli But she does move a bit Exactly what shes thinking we dont know her father says to me As an ultraorthodox Jew he says that he believes that what has happened to her must have occurred for a good reason But even now I sit next to her and cry he says   During this time Eli and his family have visited the ward regularly updating her about their lives and bringing news from the outside world   Despite any change in her condition his daughter has progressed growing from a young child into a teenager In four years time shell be a young woman and moved to the adult ward The doctors seem to encourage a sense of hope One tells me Hope for a miracle is a fundamental human trait  Im looking around the ward and another doctor comes up to tell me that a mother has heard that were here and has requested that I come and speak to her adult son  She thinks that having the BBC here might be enough to wake him up  She looked expectant I knew I was going to disappoint her  She was from Georgia and spoke no Hebrew but through a threeway translation she tells me Ive been here all day and all night for eleven years  Her son looks as though he was asleep and there seems to be flickering behind his eyelids but he too is unconscious after a cardiac arrest  Beside the bed an old folded mattress leans against the wall alongside several giant checked shopping bags a small fridge and a coffee machine  Although she doesnt speak the same language as any of her the staff his mother had made the ward her home  She now lives at his bedside and her daughter who works in a shop nearby often visits too His mother is determined not to leave his bedside in case he wakes up My visit didnt have that effect  Like Hava she continues to sit at her loved ones bedside Hava says the whole experience has changed her  She has learnt to live day by day and has some advice for me You cant live your life in the future Do what you have to do now and not later
