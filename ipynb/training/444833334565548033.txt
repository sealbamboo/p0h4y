As a Pittsburgh family prepares to bury a yearold Drexel University student who died suddenly of a fastmoving infection a drugmaker says it will seek US approval for a meningitis vaccine that may have saved her Officials with Novartis confirmed Friday that they plan to submit a license application to the Food and Drug Administration as early as the second quarter of this year for Bexsero a vaccine that protects against the B strain of meningitis that killed Stephanie Lynn Ross Its the same vaccine recently given to   and those at   after outbreaks there Julie Masow a Novartis spokeswoman said its exact timing will depend on guidance from the FDA Ross a Drexel sophomore who played softball loved the color purple and planned a career in mechanical engineering will be remembered at a service set for Monday at a Pittsburgh church She died March  of a bloodstream infection caused by the B strain which is not covered by existing meningitis vaccines recommended for US college students Her father Stephen Ross speaking briefly to NBC News said that the family may be interested in helping champion ways to get the vaccine to other college students Health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with those in Philadelphia and New Jersey said they are cooperating with a Pennsylvania state investigation into how Ross may have contracted the infection CDC officials said theyre waiting for tests to see whether the genetic type of the meningitis B bacteria is the same as that responsible for a Princeton University outbreak last year that sickened eight people  or the type that caused an outbreak at the UCSB where at least four people fell ill Drexel University and Princeton University are about  miles apart College students are at high risk for bacterial meningitis because the infection is spread through respiratory droplets and oral secretions from close personal contact such as kissing Meanwhile some health experts are calling for Bexsero to be offered more widely much sooner With mengingococcal disease in general thats the scary thing about it it can cause very significant disease very quickly said Dr Kristen A Feemster a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia The question is If we have a tool that could effectively prevent it does it change our conversation about making this tool available Dr Paul Offit a vaccine expert also with CHOP told NBC News the same compassionate use criteria that made vaccines available to healthy students after outbreaks at Princeton and UCSB could perhaps be used for others at risk elsewhere in the US If my child were on that campus Id want to be able to get it said Offit who coauthored a paper with Feemster in December calling for wider use of the vaccine Our ability to mobilize resources in response to this situation should compel us to take measures to ensure access to this prevention tool with proven safety and efficacy to all who are at risk they wrote Sally Pipes president of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy a conservative thinktank group has been critical of what she says is the FDAs excessive caution and regulatory hurdles in approving Bexsero I think it should be available she said Theres one case at Drexel now but whos to say there wont be more cases Bacterial meningitis is a dangerous infection of protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord There are about  cases of bacterial meningitis in the US each year with more than a third caused by meningitis B About  in  people who contract it die and another  percent are left with permanent disabilities
