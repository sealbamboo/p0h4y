Eight of nine children enrolled in a gene-therapy trial for the rare disease known as “bubble boy syndrome” are still alive after treatment and none developed leukemia, an issue that was a setback for earlier efforts and tempered enthusiasm for the novel technology.. Researchers on the trial reported that the eight children are alive 16 to 43 months after treatment. One patient died from an infection that already was present when he began the gene therapy, said the report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
