Medical literature is rife with research linking birth months to the risk of various chronic conditions 
While intriguing many of these studies have been flawed methodologically not taking proper account of such factors as socioeconomic background But a   in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences may be the largest to demonstrate a persuasive connection between the season of conception and at least one important outcome preterm birth The researchers at Princeton University studied more than  million births in New York City New Jersey and Pennsylvania To control for the influence of socioeconomic status among other things they included a large number of siblings in their analysis The researchers found that babies conceived in May were  percent more likely to be premature But they suspected that the reason for this was that their mothers were nearing full term in January and February when seasonal flu cases spike Pregnant women who contract the flu in their second or third trimesters have a slightly elevated risk of miscarriage and premature labor The researchers also found that babies conceived during the summer weighed on average up to nine grams more than other infants which they chalked up to seasonal patterns in pregnancy weight gain The findings they argued may have policy implications They suggest that seasonal variations in nutrition matter for birth outcomes even in rich countries they wrote and that flu shots might be effective in fighting the seasonal deterioration in length of gestation   Babies conceived in the spring may have a greater risk of being premature
