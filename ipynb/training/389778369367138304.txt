The effect of vivid D vision can be experienced with just one eye a study has suggested Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for D technology The study published in Psychological Science also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with doubleeye vision The method was said to create D similar to effects used in filmmaking Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images  one from each eye  to be combined in the visual cortex creating a sense of depth But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath a psychologist at the university believes both eyes are not necessary for this D experience Dr Vishwanath said We have demonstrated experimentally for the first time that the same special way in which depth is experienced in D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture circular hole While this effect has been known for a long time it is usually dismissed Now we have shown that it is in fact real and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic D the kind seen in D movies   Based on this finding we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the D experience might be The university said the  invention of the stereoscope  the technology behind D filmmaking  brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for D vision Dr Vishwanath said This work has significant implications for people who dont have normal binocular vision First it could help them experience what it means to see in D Second it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain twoeye D vision which produces the strongest D effect in everyday life once they can see firsthand what seeing in D is really like Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics people with misaligned eyes   He said that nearly  of the population including Hollywood actor Johnny Depp may have some form of misalignment The psychologist also believes his theory suggests a D experience could be induced simply by increasing resolution using ultrahigh definition K televisions Seeing in D with just one eye Stereopsis without binocular vision is published by Psychological Science Further research is due to be published later this year
