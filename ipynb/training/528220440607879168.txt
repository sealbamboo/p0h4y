When Paula Radcliffe won the New York City Marathon in  the fact that she pulled it off less than a year after giving birth was considered something of an anomaly But a recent article in The Times   underscores how for some athletes juggling pregnancy with a training routine is becoming the norm To better understand how and why some elite runners train through their pregnancies we spoke with Clara Horowitz Peterson a top runner and a mother of three Ms Peterson  has trained through four pregnancies including her current one She is  weeks pregnant and runs about  miles per week  a number that might sound like a lot she says but is substantially less than her usual mileage Ms Peterson who lives in California and is sponsored by Nike Trail was an allAmerican in crosscountry and track at Duke University and a runner for New Balance from  to  In  she completed her first marathon at the United States Olympic Trials with a time of  hours  minutes  seconds less than a year after giving birth to her second child While some women are encouraged to restrict physical activity because of complications doctors generally recommend that pregnant women get at least  minutes of exercise on most days The levels that are considered safe will vary from one woman to the next and experts recommend that women consult with their doctors  as Ms Peterson did  before beginning an exercise program of any kind Here are edited excerpts from our conversation with Ms Peterson How did you get into running I grew up in Berkeley Calif and started running in the fourth grade Once a week Id run with my dad a mile around the block He had this group of guys he used to go running with and I would tag along By my sophomore year of high school I won my first state championship I won a total of four three in crosscountry and a track state championship in the twomile Did you or your doctor have any concerns when you trained through your first pregnancy My doctor was onboard and I felt comfortable continuing to run But I always put my baby first I never overdid it If your doctor is monitoring you and you dont have any weird pains then its fine Ive heard of hundreds of women doing it Did you scale back your training Throughout pregnancy I always slowly decrease the mileage and intensity I think adding intensity when youre pregnant is never OK If were talking about someone who normally runs  miles a week with intense workouts then by the end it should be dwindled down to  miles a week with no workouts For the average person thats a lot But for an elite runner its nothing So its all about perspective Did you ever encounter any problems or complications I never experienced any weird pain or anything like that When you have a sixpound baby in your stomach its a little uncomfortable But I listened to my body There were days where I felt less up for it And then there were days where I felt better It was all about listening to my body and I think thats why I was able to handle more through the second and third pregnancies because I think my body became conditioned to running in a pregnant state Runners like Paula Radcliffe and Alysia Montano have been praised but also criticized for training through their pregnancies What do you say to critics Runners really know their bodies more than anybody I figured out with my most recent three pregnancies at three weeks that I was pregnant To be that in tune with your body you have to really know whats OK and what isnt Were human beings who have tested our limits over and over again since we were teenagers For an elite runner the key to having a healthy baby is to do what your body is used to doing but at a much slower pace Alysia Montano   and ran  minutes  seconds in the  meters which is fantastic But when she was in shape she was over half a lap ahead of herself Shes broken two minutes For a normal person that pace is insane But for someone who is as highly conditioned as Alysia Montano it wasnt a big deal In  you qualified for the Olympic marathon trials four months after giving birth What went into your decision to train through that pregnancy Going into the pregnancy I was in very good shape and I felt very motivated to run In pregnancy your body becomes deconditioned over time So I just wanted to minimize my deconditioning as much as possible in a healthy way I ran a lot but by six months the longest run I did was probably  miles and by the end I was probably running four to seven miles a day Throughout the pregnancy I would do a lot of pickups when I ran I would pick up my pace for a minute and then take a break and I would do that  to  times just to practice minor intensity It was more to maintain routine The quality of the workout compared to an elite runner was very minimal For the average person it probably wouldve been hard but there was no elite runner I would have been able to keep up with Is it physically a lot harder to run while pregnant Your gait changes a little bit And as you get bigger naturally theres a lot more discomfort Theres definitely discomfort on the bladder because the uterus is right above it Dealing with that is probably the hardest part about running while pregnant In the last trimester I planned out runs where I knew there were portapotties or restaurants along the way just to make sure I was able to relieve my bladder and not be forced to hold it Experts recommend that normalweight women   How much weight do you typically gain If youre running a lot youre not going to have excessive weight gain I gained about  pounds with each kid I havent had to worry about the feeling of acclimating to excessive weight gain which I would imagine would be very hard to run with You get a little more cushion here and there but the majority of the weight gain was in my uterus What is your training regimen like Was it the same for each pregnancy I went into each pregnancy with a different level of fitness But I came into this one in pretty good shape Right now Im  weeks pregnant Im down to running about  to  miles a week whereas I was running up to  before I got pregnant Im cutting out long runs Do you do any specific exercises to make it easier As a runner its really important to do core and strength training to prevent injuries So I do mostly bodyweight exercises like lunges planks and squatting If you spend nine months not doing any core or strength training and then come back to it its just so overwhelming Which exercises have you found most helpful while pregnant I would say any kind of footstrengthening exercises Theres so much pressure on your feet all day Your feet are taking a beating so I do a lot of heeltotoe walks I do a lot of hip and glute strengthening too Any type of forward flexion is bad for the abdominals so I tell pregnant women not to do crunches situps and things like that Doctors usually recommend four to six weeks of rest after giving birth Did you follow that or did you take a different approach I started jogging very minimally after around two weeks with all of them  a very slow onemile run I start walking pretty early with all my kids just to get out and move my body around But I have to say it wasnt until about six weeks after giving birth that I could run up to an hour and have it feel OK I think I always start too soon because the runner inside of me just cant hold back But with every kid at six weeks on the dot Im like I feel good now Lets go Do you follow a special diet I eat healthy and plentiful I like keeping things healthy and organic but I dont have many restrictions I have to not only sustain energy to go run but I also have to mother three children So I eat a lot of large healthy balanced meals What tips do you have for other women who continue running while pregnant  barring any medical restrictions Always listen to your body And never take too much time off because once you do and you try to come back to it it feels impossible Three or four days you can get away with But if you take a week off its over Even if its just going out for a one mile run it helps
