Very fit men in their late s are less likely to get lung cancer and colorectal cancer than unfit men a study in JAMA Oncology suggests Their high fitness levels also appear to increase their chances of surviving cancer if they are diagnosed later on University of Vermont researchers said even small improvements in fitness could help to reduce cancer risk Cancer Research UK said investigating links between mens fitness levels and cancer risk was a new approach  Being physically active and eating a healthy balanced diet are already known to be important factors in reducing peoples risk of developing cancer and other diseases But study author Dr Susan Lakoski said it would be more beneficial to tell people how much they needed to improve their fitness in order to reduce their risk of cancer to acceptable levels This could come in the form of a personalised plan which should start with measuring their cardiorespiratory fitness  of  men aged between  and  in Texas tested their cardiorespiratory fitness levels at the outset by making them run on a treadmill to the point of exhaustion After that their fitness levels were regularly tested over an average of six and a half years between  and  Between  and   of the men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer  with lung cancer and  with colorectal cancer The study found that the men with high levels of fitness in middleage reduced their risk of lung cancer by  and their risk of colorectal cancer by  compared with the men with low levels of fitness  those who took more than  minutes to run or walk a mile However the study found that the fit men in middle age did not appear to reduce their risk of prostate cancer The authors said the exact reasons for this were unknown but men with high cardiorespiratory fitness may be better at looking after their health and therefore more likely to undergo screening for prostate cancer making them more likely to be diagnosed Dr Lakoski said fitness prior to a cancer diagnosis was important This preventative message starts earlier than you think way before you develop cancer Your health behaviours and your fitness earlier in life has an impact  or  years later  and thats what people dont realise In the study she said as long as people were above the lowfitness category they already had a lot of advantages Tom Stansfeld health information officer at Cancer Research UK said Investigating links between mens fitness levels and cancer risk rather than just the amount of physical activity they do is a new approach  The results reconfirm the benefit of physical activity in decreasing mens risk of bowel cancer Interestingly the study also found a positive effect of fitness on reducing lung cancer risk but more research is needed to understand this potential link better  He said other research in women had shown that increased levels of exercise could reduce the risk of breast and womb cancers He added Being regularly physically active is great for your overall health and as this study demonstrates has benefits far beyond the health of your heart
