Abortions in the US resumed their downward trend between  and  according to a new study But its authors say the recent surge of state laws intended to restrict the procedure is likely not the reason Both the abortion rate and the number of abortions just under  million fell  percent   the reproductive health think tank thats been doing the   of abortion providers since the s The  abortion rate of  per  women ages  is the lowest since  the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide The survey also found a continuing increase in the use of medication abortions as opposed to surgical ones An estimated  percent of all abortions performed outside of hospitals were nonsurgical the study found  up from  percent in  But the authors said they found no evidence that the passage of   had any impact on the latest decline While most of the new laws were enacted in states in the Midwest and the South abortion incidence declined in all regions the study noted And some states that are generally supportive of abortion rights including those allowing Medicaid payment for abortions for poor women experienced declines in their abortion rates comparable to and sometimes greater than the national decline the study said It cited California New Jersey and New York as examples The authors suggest two more likely possibilities One was the economy which was in recession or slow recovery during the survey period Evidence for that comes from the fact that the birthrate also fell  by  percent  between  and  meaning fewer women got pregnant overall Presumably then more women and couples were making conscious decisions to avoid pregnancy and so resumed or continued using contraceptives the authors noted This strategy would be expected to have a bigger impact on the rate of intended pregnancies than on the abortion rate but could also have averted the  percent of abortions that followed intended pregnancies The other likely reason for the abortion decline is the increase in the use of longacting contraceptives like the IUD which are much more effective in preventing pregnancy than condoms or other nonprescription methods Longactingmethod use in publicly funded clinics increased from  percent to  percent during the study period One wild card in the study is a possible increase in the use of the ulcer drug misoprostol to terminate pregnancy While not approved for use alone it is normally used in combination with the approved medication abortion drug   an unknown number of women are using it by itself and it   an early pregnancy The study suggests that if more women are turning to offlabel misoprostol use to terminate their pregnancies outside clinical settings then our estimate of the number of abortions is artificially low Meanwhile antiabortion groups are taking exception to the studys conclusions Charmaine Yoest president and CEO of   called the report an abortion industry propaganda piece short on data and long on strained conclusions noting that all of the reporting of data is voluntary
