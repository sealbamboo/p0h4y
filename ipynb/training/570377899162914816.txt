German researchers have some advice to the organizers of the  FIFA World Cup in Doha Qatar Hold the soccer tournament during the winter Or if the matches really must be played during the summer hold them at night The reason they say is not that it would be dangerous for soccer players to run around the pitch for plus minutes in Dohas degree heat though one presumes it would be Their primary concern is the health of the spectators who would be watching In particular theyre concerned about fans from Europe and places with similar climates who are not at all used to Qatars extreme meteorological conditions they   in the International Journal of Biometeorology   is a scientific field that examines the weathers effect on living things The researchers dont say in their study whether they are soccer fans who would like to attend the World Cup eight years from now However they do work at the Meteorological Institute at the University of Freiburg in Germany the country that   this years FIFA World Cup in Brazil The study authors Andreas Matzarakis and Dominik Frohlich are part of a   that looks at how global warming will affect tourism As scientists they use a measure called   or PET to assess the changes in human thermal comfort Or in this case discomfort The PET is the temperature measured in degrees Celsius you would have to set in a room to mimic the conditions you would feel in an outdoor setting including your core temperature and skin temperature In the s Matzarakis and another colleague developed a PET scale that ranged from  and below causing extreme cold stress up to  causing extreme heat stress For this study Matzarakis and Frohlich had to add two additional categories for PETs one in the  range  to  degrees Fahrenheit and one for above  greater than  degrees F The two researchers examined meteorological data taken at the Doha International Airport from March  to January  During the months of June and July  when the World Cup is usually played  the air temperature was typically in the range of  degrees F During the first week of June temperatures dipped below  degrees less than  of the time by July that figure dropped to  The most comfortable PET range is  the equivalent of  to  F when humans feel neither cold nor heat stress the researchers wrote In Doha this range dominates during winter time If such temperatures are ever felt during summer its only at nighttime according to the study Temperatures in Doha are likely to top  degrees F about  of the time during the first week in June and more than  of the time come July Favorable thermal comfort conditions for Europeans are likely to occur at less than  of all cases in June and almost none in July Matzarakis and Frohlich wrote Even at nighttime conditions in Doha may cause heat stress for Europeans Since Qatars climate is more extreme than in most places plenty of spectators would face the same problem as the Europeans the pair wrote Concerns about heat and humidity which isnt a problem in Qatar arose during this years World Cup in Brazil as four matches were played in Manaus a city in the Amazon rain forest A match on June  between the US and Portugal made history for having the tournaments first   But organizers of the   say theyll tame the heat by equipping soccer stadiums with new outdoor airconditioning technology Though that could make the matches more comfortable for spectators in a stadium it will make things even worse as soon as they leave it according to the study Matzarakis and Frohlich are hardly the first people to criticize FIFAs decision to award the  World Cup to a hot arid city on the Arabian Peninsula Critics have been agitating for a revote and the tournaments executive committee has begun   to determine the best dates for the matches A big consideration is likely to be the fact that most European professional soccer leagues in Europe are on break during June and July It is not the aim of this study to show that Doha City is inappropriate for the FIFA  but to find a time period with the most suitable thermal conditions for visitors and tourists the German researchers wrote According to the results this is the time from November to February
