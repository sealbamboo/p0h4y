At our very first visit I was overwhelmed by all of the issues my new patient faced She was nearly  pounds and her diabetes was raging out of control She had asthma but smoked to ease her anxiety Her obesity severely limited her mobility but the constant stress in her life led her to overeat She had been raised in a family faced with psychiatric medical and social challenges and now the cycle seemed to be replicating itself Her three children all had emotional and educational needs that required intensive services She couldnt figure out how to get a handle on her life and as her new physician I wasnt sure how to get a handle on it either Should I work on her diabetes first Her smoking Her weight Her asthma Her anxiety and stress Her life seemed frighteningly out of control On what could we connect I wondered In the middle of our visit her cellphone rang She glanced at the caller ID then looked apologetically toward me Its my sons teacher she said I told her to please take the call As a parent of three schoolage children I well understood how hard it could be to reach a teacher and how critical such calls were I know my son missed two assignments she said into the phone as I scrolled through her labs Sometimes hes anxious after therapy session so I have to give him time on the playground She paused and listened to the teacher We keep a chart she said and he gets a check for each homework he finishes As she carried on the conversation I found myself feeling more connected to her I knew about the driving necessity of playground time I knew about the charts and the checks required to keep children focused on their tasks I knew the frenetic juggling required to keep up with three children and their schedules I also knew the awkward sensation of explaining details of a life to a teacher unsure if they will pass muster When she hung up the phone she apologized for the interruption Dont worry I reassured Teacher calls are important I was about to continue to offer her some of our commonalities thinking that could offer us a good start on a working relationship But then I stopped myself I remembered an   in an attempt to empathize My father also had lung cancer I know how difficult it can be or I also had knee surgery I know how hard the recovery is But contrary to what might be expected such selfdisclosures often turned out not to be helpful in addressing patients concerns or building rapport Patients sometimes interpreted them as disruptive The authors concluded that physicians ought to limit reflexive selfdisclosure Personal details if appropriate should only be used to assist the patient and the focus quickly moved back to the patient A week earlier I had a visit with one of my longterm patients  a woman in her s who has been alone and lonely for as long as Id known her At the end of our visit she asked why there werent any new pictures of my children the photo on my desk was about three years old by now I never get around to printing any photos I said sheepishly They just sit on my phone She leaned toward the cellphone sitting on my desk somewhat expectantly I figured it would be OK to show her a quick photo since wed known each other for so many years at this point My patient gave a wistful smile when she saw the photo What a happy family you have she said Your husband looks like such a nice person Your kids look so smart The plaintiveness in her voice was so palpable and I suddenly realized what a mistake Id made Id thought it would strengthen our bond to share a bit of my life But it turned out it may have had the opposite effect as she projected onto my life some of the things that were missing in hers I quickly closed the photo embarrassed at the awkward dynamics There were likely some patients for whom the addition of the human element of the doctors life might be helpful but this patient probably wasnt one of them I felt terrible that I might have done something detrimental And now as I sat with my new patient a woman who in most ways was so vastly different from me I wondered if sharing some of the communalities we did have would enhance our alliance and give us a better chance at tackling her medical issues After all that was my ultimate goal In the end I decided to keep quiet I couldnt be sure if such disclosure would offer solidarity or inadvertently toss in a monkey wrench Instead I simply acknowledged how challenging the situation with her children must be I offered my admiration for her efforts and pointed out her successes She reddened slightly but smiled Raising kids is harder than Id ever imagined I know I said I wanted to say that I really did know but I decided to leave it at that  newest book isÂ  She is an associate professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and works at Bellevue Hospital She is editor in chief of
