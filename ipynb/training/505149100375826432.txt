Exciting a specific part of the brain with electromagnetic pulses could boost our ability to remember certain facts a study in   suggests The US trials involving  volunteers found they made  fewer mistakes in memory tests after the procedure Scientists are now investigating whether the technique could help people with memory disorders and reduce memory loss in later life  Independent researchers describe the method as ingenious Researchers at Northwestern University in the US targeted a particular nerve hub known as the hippocampus  This area of the brain has a central role in basic memory processes that tie unrelated facts together  such as remembering someones name or the contents of last nights dinner Scientists pinpointed this region in each of their  volunteers using detailed scans and then assessed their baseline memory Participants were presented with pictures of faces while hearing unrelated words and asked to learn and remember the faceword pair A device was then used to apply short bursts of electromagnetic stimulation to the area of the head directly above the hippocampus hub The sessions lasted  minutes a day for five consecutive days  Volunteers scored significantly better on similar memory tests after this procedure  even  hours after sessions were completed The study revealed they made  fewer mistakes at this point compared with scores before they had the procedure  And they showed no signs of improvement when exposed to a dummy placebo version of the device Prof Joel Voss who led the study said We show for the first time that you can specifically change memory functions of the brain in adults without surgery or drugs which have not proven effective He added This noninvasive stimulation improves the ability to learn new things  It has tremendous potential for treating memory disorders Researchers are now investigating how memory changes in older age and hope to start trials on people with early signs of dementia Dr Nick Davis who was not involved in the study said The method used to stimulate the hippocampus is quite ingenious It is very smart work  The work is exciting as most of our knowledge about memory circuits comes from animal studies or people with memory impairments Scientists say the device works by emitting a strong electromagnetic field in rapid pulses  This then generates an electrical current in nerve fibres  mimicking the usual electrical activity in the brain
