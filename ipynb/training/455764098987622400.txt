For  years Anna was a solitary figure sitting at the far end of our waiting room for her annual checkups having shaved a halfhour off her workday so she could hustle over before we locked our doors Then she became very ill and suddenly she was engulfed in a crowd It turns out that she had one of the great families of all time a big cheerfully intertwined conglomeration of blood step foster and commonlaw attachments From the moment she was hospitalized they never left her side Or more precisely they never left her by herself  it turns out there is actually bit of a difference between the two 
 One of them would sleep in Annas hospital room at night and another would come by in the morning At lunchtime more would wander in and by the middle of the afternoon it was standing room only in Annas half of the semiprivate accommodations on A When she was moved to the ICU the whole mass of them decamped into the waiting room down the hall a tide of Annafocused humanity surging in and out with the day Somebody usually one of her daughters was deputized to sit by the bed waiting outside the cubicle when the nurses had work to do then coming right back in Presumably this family instinctively knew or had learned the hard way that in health care as in the lions den there is some small margin of safety in numbers So ill does the solitary traveler fare in fact that a basic tenet of patient safety is the mandate to bring someone along to even the most routine encounter to function as secretary memory chip and reality check Hospitalization makes those functions even more essential Studies show that having what are termed partners in care improves health saves money and leaves everyone a little happier Some hospitals have modified standard   accordingly relaxing the usual restrictions on quantity and duration unless the crowds get out of hand Others try to enforce the traditional limits two at a time starting after noon ending after dinner Intensivecare units may pare the sessions still further some to mere minutes on the hour a horribly stingy fraction if those hours prove to be the patients final ones These   have been damned as an exercise of pure power the medical system beating its chest in mighty cruel display No argument there But even so every patient needs a moment or two alone Anna was no fool I knew I should have   she said on her first day in the hospital even before it became clear that what was engulfing her lungs hips and spine was terminal lung   Guess thats it she said A big supportive chorus of protest immediately arose from the crowd around the bed Come on Mommy a daughter said Theres plenty they can do Anna just shook her head but she didnt say anything else The weight of that big fond family muffled her like a fluffy blanket And sure enough in the months that followed we did plenty to Anna all with the best of intentions No one was trying to cure her the radiation and efforts to drain the malignant fluid were all intended just to make her feel better for a while Still one thing did lead to another as they tend to do She shook her head as she signed for every procedure a daughter helping her weakening hand along at the end I caught her alone just once toward the end of it all in her ICU cubicle She couldnt speak at that point but she looked right at me and rolled her eyes Then a daughter came back into the room and Anna shut her eyes tight It could have been worse I suppose but it could have been much better In the best of hindsightenabled worlds we would have had the sense or possibly the correct phrase would be the power to ease that mass of loving family away from the bed and have a long frank talk with Anna then a long sad discussion with a single selected spokesman that selection alone has been known to   families into irreparable shards We would have curtailed all the extra treatments we piled on She would have died weeks sooner and far more peacefully than she did In the face of family discord we do this all the time But not this time  we all loved that wonderful supportive family so cheerful and upbeat so proactive and protective I suppose we loved them as much as Anna did forgetting understandably but indefensibly that for all our power the option of falling in love with them wasnt legitimately ours
