Doctors have long suspected that head trauma boosts the risk of getting Alzheimers disease later on but the evidence on that has been mixed But it looks like people who have memory problems and a history of concussion are more likely to have a buildup of plaques in the brain that are a risk factor for Alzheimers according to researchers at the Mayo Clinic But there were also people in the study who had had concussions and who didnt have  in their brains They were also less likely to have memory problems All told the people with memory loss were  percent more likely to have plaques Its not known why the people with memory issues seem to be more at risk for longterm effects of concussion or if the concussion was even a factor in the brain changes But the finding jibes with other   that suggests that some people are more at risk We need to figure out whats making some people more vulnerable than others says   an Alzheimers researcher at the Mayo Clinic who led the study It was  online Thursday in the journal   Just because you have a head trauma doesnt mean youre going to develop memory problems or significant amyloid levels Mielke told Shots And it doesnt mean youre going to get Alzheimers But it does suggest to us that theres a mechanism with head trauma that does increase your risk Mielke and her colleagues did PET scans on  people who are participating in a longterm study of aging and memory Thats a lot of people for a brain imaging study which makes it more likely that the findings are accurate The people were in their s and s About one quarter of the people had   thinking and memory problems that may or may not lead to Alzheimers Roughly  percent of the entire group reported having had a concussion one bad enough for them to lose consciousness or lose memory In most cases those concussions happened at least  years ago Head injuries are most common in the young Now that she had found an association between head trauma and amyloid in peoples brains Mielke also wants to look for another marker for Alzheimers   Earlier this year other researchers figured out a way to see tau in the brain of a living human with PET scans Before the only way it could be measured was through a spinal tap To have almost  people with amyloid imaging measures its a lot of people but its still not large enough Mielke says Are all these people going on to develop Alzheimers Hopefully down the road we can answer that question
