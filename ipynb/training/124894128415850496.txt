Heartburnlike pain is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD But several other conditions can cause a burning feeling in your chest 
                   
                  Most of the time your doctor will be able to identify whether you have heartburn or GERD by doing tests 
                   
                  Here are nine other conditions that can cause heartburnlike pain Angina or chest pain caused by lack of blood flow to the heart can feel a lot like heartburn 
                   
                  The major key is if youre getting heartburn when youre doing strenuous or moderate activity says Ryan Madanick MD a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill 
                   
                  If youre  or older and getting heartburnespecially if you havent had this kind of pain beforeit can raise suspicion of angina Suspicions can also be raised if youre younger but have heart risk factors such as hypertension diabetes or a family history of heart disease For more information check out   Although gallstones dont always cause symptoms a stone blocking your bile duct can hurt usually in the middle or upperright side of the abdomen 
                   
                  Pain may be cramping dull or sharp and often strikes minutes after you eat 
                   
                  If youre experiencing stomach pain after meals that doesnt improve after you take an overthecounter acidsuppressing medication gallstones should be suspected says Joel Richter MD a gastroenterologist and chairman of the department of medicine at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia Ulcers can cause a gnawing burning sensation usually felt in the upper abdomen The pain can find its way up to the chest Dr Madanick says 
                   
                  Acidsuppressing medications may relieve ulcer pain But ulcers are usually caused by   a type of bacteria that inflames the stomach lining so you will need to take antibiotics to clear the infection 
                   
                  Certain antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen and osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates can also cause stomach ulcers A hiatal hernia occurs when a portion of the upper stomach pokes through the diaphragm into the chest cavity rather than staying in the abdominal cavity where it belongs 
                   
                  This can push food and stomach acid up into the esophagus causing heartburn Other signs of hiatal hernia include chest pain belching and nausea If you have heartburn due to hiatal hernia your doctor will typically prescribe acidsuppressing drugs and recommend lifestyle changes like eating smaller meals avoiding alcohol and not eating right before bed In rare cases surgical repair may be warranted Esophageal cancer is rare but its incidence is rising rapidly in the United States Dr Madanick says 
                   
                  If you have heartburn it might be a sign of esophageal cancer but its highly unlikely he says Your doctor may decide to order an upper endoscopy to examine your esophagus if youve got longstanding heartburn especially if you smoke or drink heavily both of which are risk factors for esophageal cancer 
                   
                  This test involves passing a tube with a light and a camera at one end down your throat into your esophagus During the test your doctor can look for abnormal areas as well as collect tissue samples to test for cancer Poor control of diabetes can lead to nerve damage which can affect the workings of your digestive tract This is called gastroparesis and it dramatically slows the movement of food through the stomach and can cause heartburn 
                   
                  Treatment can include dietary changes such as eating smaller meals avoiding fat and fiber medications and for people with very severe symptoms inserting a feeding tube or an implanted device that emits electrical pulses mimicking stomach contractions Esophagitis or inflammation of the esophagus can result from frequent acid reflux This condition can in turn lead to more heartburn as well as difficulty swallowing 
                   
                  The esophagus can also become inflamed from taking certain painkillers and   particularly if the pills are taken without water allowing them to remain in the esophagus 
                   
                  A third type of esophagitis called eosinophilic esophagitis occurs when white blood cells known as eosinophils invade the esophagus The condition is often allergyrelated so treatment requires identifying and avoiding the offending foods Doctors may also prescribe steroid medications to ease inflammation Inflammation of the lining of the lungs and chest cavity known as pleuritis or pleurisy can cause heartburnlike chest pain Pleuritis should be suspected if the pain or burning gets worse when you take deep breaths or move around Dr Madanick says 
                   
                  Pleuritis is most commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection and resolves when the infection does 
                   
                  Costochondritisan inflammation of the cartilage anchoring ribs to the breastbonecan cause sharp pain along the breastbone or sternum It can be related to injury or infection and typically is treated with antiinflammatory medicines pain relievers and rest Although anxiety wont cause GERD it can cause heartburn and make GERD symptoms worse Dr Madanick says A person can have both anxietyrelated heartburn and GERDrelated heartburn One of the signs that its not just reflux is that treating the reflux problem doesnt make it any better he says 
                   
                  Reducing anxiety and stress through for example exercise relaxation and therapy can also ease heartburn 
                   
                  Dr Madanick says that as with other conditions that masquerade as GERD many times the only times we will see a patientis when the overthecounter medications havent worked because the medications tend to be very effective for treating simple heartburn
