If youve been following the news out of China about the latest bird flu and its threats to humans may we direct your attention toward the Middle East for a minute A virus that many people had been calling a SARSlike virus because of the severe respiratory condition it has triggered in quite a few people has an   Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus or MERSCoV The World Health Organization has now   despite the groups preference not to put a place in the name of a virus Whys that Well the place name could lead to unnecessary geographical discrimination that could be based on coincidental detection rather than on the true area of emergence of a virus WHO says That said we know that WHO wasnt fond of the provisional SARSlike designation for virus either All the cases reported so far have a link to the Middle East  the people either lived there had traveled there or were in close contact with an infected person whod been there Now theres   in   that two people in France fell ill with the virus too A yearold man who had visited Dubai in April was hospitalized in northern France later that month A second man who hadnt traveled abroad recently shared a hospital room with the first patient for a few days in late April At the time the doctors didnt suspect the first man was infected with MERSCoV The second man a yearold with a blood clot deep in his arm was discharged at the end of April But eight days later he showed symptoms of MERSCoV infection By then the first man had been diagnosed with the virus so the second man was quickly referred to specialists His condition deteriorated rapidly Within days he experienced respiratory and kidney failure The doctors report that he remains in intensive care The first man died May  The doctors write in   that these cases suggest the incubation period for the virus may be  to  days longer than previously thought All told the fatality rate for confirmed infections with the virus has been   according to WHO based on   so far But the true fatality rate wont be clear until the fuller extent of cases some probably much milder becomes known But WHO is worried about MERSCoV even more than the HN bird flu Looking at the overall global situation my greatest concern right now is the novel coronavirus said   directorgeneral at WHO in   We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat Any new disease that is emerging faster than our understanding is never under control These are alarm bells and we must respond The novel coronavirus is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself The novel coronavirus is a threat to the entire world
