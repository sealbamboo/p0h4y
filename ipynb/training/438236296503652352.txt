A few years ago     at the White House At the time it was a major news story but there was another story going on behind the scenes Madhulika Sikka now the executive editor of NPR News had accompanied the team to the White House and while NPRs Steve Inskeep was talking to the president Sikka was waiting on a phone call from her doctor She had been warned a few days before that the news might not be good Just minutes after the interview the call came in She had breast cancer Sikka writes about what happened next in   Its less a memoir than it is a guide  one that works through the disease from A to Z For example W is for Warrior Sikka tells Inskeep Im not a warrior Im a woman who had breast cancer That language she says wasnt right for me Its not right for a lot of women and that is one thing I did learn by expressing this Im not saying that there arent days when you   feeling like that but it doesnt have to be the whole of it Theres no history of breast cancer in my family so I think about what could have caused this you know eating badly or waiting to have your kids or being on the pill  I went through the list because you kind of start thinking Well what did I do How come this happened to me I must have done something wrong And theres a really good chance that you didnt Its a cellular malfunction and it sucks but its a cellular malfunction So thats one facet of guilt The other facet of guilt is people like to point out how lucky you are when you tell them your story Oh you found it Oh you have great doctors  And theyre trying to make you feel better you know like Oh I knew someone who had this and it was terrible and youre really lucky Yes I guess subjectively I was lucky but I didnt need to get into sort of a competition with somebody elses cancer I understand that its helpful for a lot of people to look at their experience through that lens  that you have to sort of fight and kick its ass and all these sort of martial comparisons  I think thats the common approach I think that thats what we expect of people Oh you know you can kick it And the reverse of that is if somehow you are unfortunate enough not to survive that you didnt fight it that you werent a warrior And that is not the reality either Its a disease and I dont see that kind of language being used in the same way with so many other diseases including frankly lots of other cancers I pause because my first reaction is no and its a very visceral reaction because that ascribes something mystical to the experience of going through breast cancer and I just dont ascribe to that Your life goes on Youve got to manage your disease and your life and your family and everything else There was somebody who I knew who I thought on the outside Wow shes been amazing through this And she revealed to me that you know youre gonna get up in the middle of the night and youre gonna feel awful and youre gonna look at yourself in the mirror and its gonna scare you when you look at yourself because you are bald and you have no eyebrows and your skin is you know sallow and gray and its horrible Thank you for telling me that And I want to tell other people that Its just Thats what it is Im doing fine Im on drugs which you know thousands of women are and the point of the drugs is to reduce the risk of recurrence Its why Im not a fan of the word survivor because I feel survivor suggest an end I feel good I have great doctors Im on drugs they have side effects but right now I dont have cancer No  My opening essay is A for Anxiety Theres always a little bit of anxiety that will remain You dont live in a permanent crouch of fear but its just somewhere in the back of your head and it recedes over time but you have to be vigilant
