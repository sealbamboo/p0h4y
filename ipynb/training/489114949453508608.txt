Last week a young man from a remote village in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand was accused of sexually assaulting a married woman To punish him the village leader reportedly ordered the rape of his yearold sister The husband of the woman who was allegedly assaulted was told to carry out the rape As the womans husband dragged the girl to a nearby forest villagers only looked on her family     Its the latest case of sexual violence against women out of India and it comes only months after a West Bengal village reportedly ordered the gang rape of a yearold woman for falling in love with a man from another community It also comes almost exactly a year after a yearold woman was gangraped as   for her brothers act of adultery In all three cases unelected village leaders and councils that rule rural parts of India ordered the sentences despite national laws that prohibit such eyeforaneye punishment against women But these leaders often operate outside the law The use of rape as a punishment has a long history Sexual violence against women has been a part of warfare and military occupation says Kavita Krishnan secretary of the All India Progressive Womens Association Rape is in fact illegal in India except for   But history and tradition make the law hard to enforce In remote and rural parts patriarchal views on gender still hold sway and sexual assault is an unofficially accepted form of punishment Sexual violence against women and revenge rape are deeply entrenched in rural villages says Krishnan Women represent the honor of their community and are viewed as family or community property That means rape isnt considered an assault on the woman herself but a blow to the men she belongs to The father suffers because the daughter is no longer pure so according to tradition no family would accept her as a bride If the woman is already married her rape would strip the husband of his honor If you want to hurt the husband or hurt the father or hurt the community then you rape the woman to say All right Im soiling your goods  Krishnan says Indias legal system also makes it very hard for women to secure convictions As the     British colonial rule allows men to easily establish a victims consent by offering evidence of her loose character The countrys tradition of revering women as gold and goddesses is just as problematic Krishnan says Its so easy to say we respect woman as being precious like gold but you know gold is actually a piece of property she says Such thinking allows society to justify locking a woman in her home as the only way to keep gold safe And while some may think its flattering treating women as goddesses means theyre expected to behave differently If a woman doesnt behave as a very pure goddess  if shes challenging the modern norms of society  the violence and sexual violence that happens to her is not seen as a crime she says Despite the challenges India has made some progress Various womens rights movements and protests in the past three decades have started to create a shift in the thinking on rape  less as a crime against mens honor and more as one against the bodily integrity of women But Krishnan says shed like to see more effort from the government Following the highprofile rape of a New Delhi woman in December courts changed the rape laws to allow for capital punishment in cases that cause death or leave the victim in a vegetative state Repeat offenders can face death sentences But that isnt enough she told NPR last year saying that underlying issues  of gender inequality are still being ignored And you cant think of rape as just Indias problem she stresses One of the biggest signs of progress Krishnan says is a willingness to talk about rape cases not as isolated incidents but as part of a larger problem for patriarchal societies around the world
