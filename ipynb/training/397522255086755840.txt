A prostate cancer test which predicts how aggressive a tumour is could spare men unnecessary operations researchers suggest  Early data   suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slowgrowing tumours A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed Cancer charities said a successful test would be a gamechanger  Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK There are more than  new cases diagnosed and  deaths each year The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope  However the procedure has significant sideeffects such as infertility difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating One of the researchers Prof Dan Berney from Queen Mary University of London told the BBC We need a better test as we are overtreating many men most will die with not of prostate cancer We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring The commercial test developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour If  genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active it indicates the cancer is aggressive Prof Berney said such information could substantially change decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were huge and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years  We need to validate it and were not there yet but it is the strongest test weve had so far he added Dr Iain Frame director of research at Prostate Cancer UK said Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from nonaggressive prostate cancer could be a gamechanger for those affected by the condition  We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the  men who lose their lives to this disease every year whilst sparing the many others who neednt have concerns The results of this study are certainly intriguing and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve We will watch with great interest developments in this area Dr Harpal Kumar the chief executive of Cancer Research UK said Being able to tell apart aggressive and slowgrowing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment  Understanding more about the nature of a patients tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting sideeffects whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly
