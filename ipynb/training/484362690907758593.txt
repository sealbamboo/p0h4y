A prestigious scientific journal Wednesday took the unusual step of retracting some highprofile research that had generated international excitement about stem cell research The British scientific journal   retracted two papers published in January by scientists at the  research institute in Japan and at   that claimed that they could create stem cells simply by dipping skin and blood cells into acid The claim raised the possibility of being able to use the cells to easily make any kind of cell in the body to treat many diseases and generated international media coverage including some on   But other scientists almost immediately raised questions about the papers and investigators eventually found that the research papers contained many errors In April Riken even   that Haruko Obokata the main Japanese scientist was guilty of scientific misconduct The scientists involved in the work including   at the Harvardaffiliated Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston issued statements regretting the problems with the papers and agreeing that they should be retracted I am deeply saddened by all that has transpired and after thoughtful consideration of the errors presented in the Riken report and other concerns that have been raised I have agreed to retract the papers Vacanti wrote in a statement But Vacanti and Obokata said they still believed their techniques could work In fact   to allow Obokata to participate in an experiment aimed at attempting to reproduce the original results For its part the journal     it was reviewing its policies to try to prevent future flawed papers from being published and published retractions of the   original   as well as the   that accompanied them The episode has further highlighted flaws in  s procedures and in the procedures of the institutions that publish with us the journal said Brigham and Womens and Harvard both issued statements expressing regret about the case We are fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of our research Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations Harvards statement said
