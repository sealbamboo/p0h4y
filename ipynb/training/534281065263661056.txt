More than twothirds of patients do not realise that they have the right to see their records online research shows As many as  of people are unaware that technology allows them to access their GP record online or via a smartphone according to the results of a YouGov survey of  adults Respondents added that they would use the technology or thought it would help manage their health better From next April all patients registered with a GP in England should be able to have online access to their medical records under a commitment given by health secretary   as part of the Patient Online initiative designed to allow patients to book appointments order repeat prescriptions and monitor their records online Although the target forms part of GPs contracts for  it is estimated that around  of GPs currently offer the service to their patients Judith Wright a GP in Oxfordshire says online record access for patients has reduced the workload for her practice Around  of our patients currently use Patient Access an online service run by EMIS to view their records We thought it might result in more patient queries but  it can help to cut consultation times For example a patient using the service was able to check her test results so we were able to focus entirely on discussing treatment with her GPs with this system can now control the amount of information given to patients online by using settings tailored to particular groups of patients for example those with longterm conditions But the British Medical Association which represents GPs and privacy campaigners have raised concerns that allowing patients access to their records may open a Pandoras box of problems such as a debate over the real purpose of medical records And a survey by the Medical Protection Society which provides legal cover for doctors found that  of patients wanted records in simple language which they could understand without assistance or explanation but only  of GPs thought they should be written this way As many as  of doctors feared that making medical records available to patients would increase their workload by requiring them to spend more time explaining notes and clinical terms to patients Nick Clements MPS head of medical services said The research shows it is not enough just to equip patients with access to their medical records online they also need support to understand and use information safely appropriately and effectively Its important that a patient understands their record so they can share in the decisionmaking process but there are risks in asking doctors to write medical records using plain language A GP will need to consider whether a clinical term will be understood or whether an entry could cause distress or anxiety for the patient If doctors have to avoid using clinical terms and medical jargon to make it more readable for the patient this could limit the usefulness of the record for other healthcare professionals In the MPS survey nearly  of doctors saw medical records as a reference tool for their own use and for other health professionals rather than the patient There are also concerns in terms of patient confidentiality and data security Phil Booth a spokesman for MedConfidential a campaign group on data confidentiality says We have some real concerns about the risks for vulnerable patients If records are allowed to be accessed at home by the patient we need to ensure that other members of a household wont be able to put certain patients such as a teenage girl who sees a GP about contraception under duress to reveal their record Another example could be where a woman is in an abusive relationship sees her GP has details added to her record and is then put under pressure to reveal it to her partner We need to ensure there are safeguards in place and there should be some form of personal audit trail for patients so they can see who else has seen their record A joint working group set up by   England has been trying to address these concerns A spokesman said We continue to work with the Royal College of GPs and the BMA on the development and publication of guidelines and practical advice which address concerns GPs have raised with us for example in how to fulfil their safeguarding role and how to assure identity of patients online We are also providing additional support to practices to help them implement any technical or operational changes necessary to offer online services by March  Patient representatives have been involved in helping us to strike the right balance between providing meaningful services for patients without providing undue burden on GPs Details of the  contract are currently being finalised and will be announced soon
