Liberian soldiers have set up a blockade stopping people from western regions affected by the Ebola outbreak from entering the capital Monrovia It follows the presidents declaration of a state of emergency to tackle the outbreak that has killed more than  people in West Africa this year In Sierra Leone the security forces have now imposed a complete blockade of eastern areas hit by Ebola Health experts in Switzerland are discussing a response to the outbreak It is the worlds deadliest outbreak and the twoday World Health Organization WHO meeting will decide whether to declare a global health emergency Ebola a viral haemorrhagic fever is one of the deadliest diseases known to humans with a fatality rate in this outbreak of between  and  It is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of Ebola patients showing symptoms The military blockade is stopping people from western regions of Grand Cape Mount and Bomi where Ebola is prevalent from entering the capital These counties largely rely on Monrovia for their goods  and the blockade means that the cities of Robertsport and Tubmanburg are now cut off One Tubmanburg resident phoned into a radio show to complain that rice the national staple was already in short supply in the market The head of the National Health Workers Association said while the state of emergency was necessary people should have been given time to prepare Fear has prompted hospital workers to abandon clinics  meaning many are now shut  President Sirleaf said this meant many diseases prevalent during the rainy season such as malaria and typhoid were going untreated and there could be unnecessary and preventable deaths as a result Announcing a state of emergency for  days President Sirleaf said the government and people of Liberia required extraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people Speaking from a crossroads km  miles west of Monrovia the BBCs Jonathan PayeLayleh said  soldiers had been deployed to stop the movement of people  many of whom are traders In neighbouring Sierra Leone the head of the police in the east of the country said police and soldiers had imposed a complete blockade of the Kenema and Kailahun districts No vehicles or persons will be allowed in or out of the districts except those with essential food and medicines he said There has been carelessness on the presidents part she declared a state of emergency very late It is very scary some of my colleagues have died  We have not had a confirmed case at my facility but about km away a patient tested positive Twelve nurses have been coming down with symptoms and have been quarantined  When there is a suspected case protocol demands that the Ebola surveillance team should be contacted so blood samples can be collected That is not happening  Because of the high number of cases and very limited resources the hospitals own laboratory technicians are asked to draw samples which is very risky  As a result some of them have been infected When the specimen finally reaches the testing centre it takes two to three days before the results come back  That is too long especially when the patient is still in the community The longer the results take to come back the faster the patient spreads the virus  In other developments If a public health emergency is declared by the WHO it could involve detailed plans to identify isolate and treat cases as well as impose travel restrictions on affected areas There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola  but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment Ebola has initial flulike symptoms that can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure
