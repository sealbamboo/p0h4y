Two drugs given to people who suffer migraines reduced the frequency of their headaches in early trials scientists said The test results may potentially represent a new era in preventive therapy for migraine Dr Peter Goadsby an author on studies of both drugs said in a statement One of the researchers called migraine headaches the third most common medical disorder in the world Both drugs must undergo larger trials to confirm the results Both drugs are intended to prevent rather than treat migraine headaches and the studies of them are the first to test monoclonal antibodies for migraine prevention the scientists said The drugs are directed against whats called the calcitonin generelated peptide which had been thought important in migraines but had not previously been targeted with a drug The researchers are to present their findings at the American Academy of Neurologys th annual meeting which begins Saturday in Philadelphia The big deal is that theres never been anything introduced to prevent migraine attacks that was based on a mechanism and a sole indication of migraine Goadsby said Wednesday by telephone In the past sufferers could try beta blockers antidepressants or anticonvulsantsÂ  hoping theyd work for their headaches This the first bespoke migraine treatment said Goadsby a neurology professor at Kings College London and UC San Francisco He said patients should be pleased and for some it could be lifechanging He gave the example of a pilot who could be unable to keep flying if her headaches were treated with certain drugs now in use In one study  people who had migraines from five  days a month were given a placebo or an intravenous dose of a drug called ALD They were followed for  weeks Those who got the drug had an average of  fewer migraine days a month those who took the placebo had  fewer days In the second study  people who had a migraine four to  days a month received biweekly injections of a drug called LY or a placebo for  weeks Those who got the drug had an average of  fewer migraine days a month at the week mark Those who got the placebo had an average of three fewer days Dr David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic in Arizona an author of both studies said by telephone that rates for placebos are often high in studies of pain and in this case those rates could be due in part to the high level of anticipation people had for the success of migraine treatment They also could be affected as they sometimes are by the invasiveness of the treatments  injections rather than pills he said Clearly in the future well have to get a grip on this and carefully carefully design the next phase of trials for the drugs he said The scientists dont have a sense yet of which drug might be better or might work better for certain people Dodick said Both appear safe at this point he said The studies were supported by drug companies ALD by Alder Biopharmaceuticals and LY by Arteaus Twitter
