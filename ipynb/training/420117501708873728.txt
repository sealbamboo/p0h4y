New Years Day marked the halfway point to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act for coverage this year And after a dismal start things seem to be going a lot better on the   website Federal officials say more than  million people enrolled in coverage by the   for coverage that began January  People have until March  to purchase a plan or enroll in Medicaid if youre eligible If youre uninsured after that you may be subject to a tax penalty in  But even with things going better people still have a lot of questions so many that weve created a   so its easy to find the information you need Well be adding to it in the coming days and weeks Here are more questions from this months mailbag People can be forgiven for being confused about deadlines because they keep changing But at least for now theyre supposed to work like this As long as you sign up by the   your coverage starts on the first of the month after that So if you sign up by the th of January your coverage starts February  If you sign up on the th of January though youll have to wait until March  Same with February sign up by the th and your start date is March  but enroll February th and youll have to wait until the first of April Open enrollment ends March  Those peoples coverage wont start until May  When it comes to dental coverage the people who designed the benefits decided to split things up based on age There have been a lot of complaints about there being too many benefits in the   making coverage more expensive For that reason only dental coverage for children is among the required benefits But if you dont buy it you   Thats different than other required benefits So the answer to Ms Rowlands question is if her son is a child she can get dental coverage just for him But not all states are including dental coverage in health plans And it can be hard to find out if its included though some states are trying to make that easier In Colorado for instance health plans that include childrens dental coverage are designated by a colored tooth icon If dental isnt included in a plan you can buy standalone dental coverage That coverage is also available for adults in most areas Now that its  most people will have to have health insurance or be subject to that   weve been hearing so much about This first year the penalty is fairly small  if youre without insurance for the entire year its the larger of  or  percent of   taxable income in excess of the IRS filing threshold for an individual It goes up in future years If you dont have insurance you have until the end of March to buy coverage and still avoid the penalty Thats because you can be without insurance for up to three consecutive months before penalties are applied If you dont earn enough to file income taxes youre not subject to the penalty The penalty is prorated on a monthly basis For every month you lack insurance beyond three months each family member pays a monthly penalty No the call center operator was correct As long as you have   youre OK and exempt from any fines Once the requirement for employers to provide coverage takes effect the employer might not be but thats been   If Mr Rickels wants to drop his employer coverage and go to the exchange and buy a more comprehensive plan assuming his employerbased coverage doesnt cover  percent of typical health expenses he would probably be eligible for a subsidy Thats also assuming that he doesnt earn more than four times the poverty level    But if hes just worried about avoiding any penalties then hes fine This is an excellent question because it turns out theres quite a bit of paperwork involved And thats even though health plans cant ask you about your medical history any more To figure out of youre eligible for a subsidy to help pay premiums they want to know a lot about   Youll need to provide proof of identity either your Social Security number or legal immigrant status Youll need employer and income information which can include pay stubs or W forms or if youre selfemployed last years tax return The application also asks for information about any employer health insurance thats available to you or members of your immediate family because that affects your eligibility for government help paying for individual insurance So gather all that stuff up before you go to the web site or meet with someone whos helping you apply for coverage That sounds like a pretty straightforward question but it turns out that Mr Elgee is a CPA and what he really wants to know is whether employers particularly small employers can reimburse workers who buy their own insurance and then the employers could take a tax deduction for doing that It seems the answer is probably not There are lots of provisions in the law to encourage small employers to purchase coverage directly for their workers Theres a   for very small employers who have mostly lowerwage workers This year thats set to cover  percent of the cost of coverage And theres something called the   where businesses are supposed to be able to go to get a better selection of plans for their employees The problem is that with the rocky rollout for the web sites serving individuals the federal government and most of the states have put the small business part of the program on the   The small business site hasnt   and the few businesses that have tried to use it say   So for now that part of the program isnt living up to its promise That may be why some small employers want to give their workers extra money and let the workers buy their own coverage But tax experts say that may not be the best way to help people Thats because the higher a persons income the less help they will get paying their premium And that extra money from employers would count as income So if an employer really wants to help they might want to put more money into a workers retirement plan if they have one or buy them vision or dental
