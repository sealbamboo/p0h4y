At the age of  artist Raj Singh Tattal was unemployed and depressed Then he received a diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome and everything changed  Singh Tattal  also known as the PenTacularArtist now finally understands his obsessive tendency to draw pictures for hours on end  It is a common symptom of the autism spectrum disorder  He has learned to let the condition drive his creativity and this year he has four exhibitions lined up in his hometown London  In an interview with Ouch Singh Tattal talks about his obsessions support networks and being part of the Sikh community  Im very obsessive Where other people might take a month each of my drawings takes four days Im very reclusive as well  I probably spend  of the time by myself  I dont really like change I havent been out of London for  years I have multiple pairs of the same trainers and Ive eaten baked beans every day for  years Some of this stuff sounds quite trivial but over time it starts annoying people around you When Im at home I dont sit with my family in the living room and have only started eating downstairs to try and make an effort People used to think I was depressed because I was in my room but actually I was depressed when I had to leave it  I started drinking over the years to try and fit in with people and have had friends in the past but at the moment I have zero friends I dont drink I just draw  and I am the happiest Ive ever been Once I got diagnosed I decided to change my lifestyle  Rather than use my obsessive nature on silly things like games or films I decided to focus on drawing I have such an obsessive nature that when I draw I dont just do it now and then I put in ridiculous hours  Thats not very good for looking for work or trying to work so I had to stop When I started again I decided to go full force Ive been practising drawing for  months in my room  I knew the standard I wanted to get to and now that Im there Im happy to show my work to people They are all black and white graphite and charcoal drawings I dont do one particular subject Ive done a lot of comicbased drawings and Im doing some artwork on emotions people in distress Its not because Im a morbid person but because Ive gone through a really dark space I relate to the sad ones Ive been going to my support group for a year and Ive only ever met one other Asian person Thats not because Asian people dont have Aspergers Syndrome Its because Asian people tend to cover it up Its not something they really talk about  If I was from a white English family people would have picked up my symptoms very young because I was a typical Aspergers kid Im now slowly telling my relatives  who I dont even know because Im so reclusive Ive started talking to them over Facebook because I want to make an effort now Ive always hated myself because Im a pretty intelligent guy  I managed to get myself a degree  but after so many problems I started to think that I was a failure People make you feel like youre a bad person because you cant do certain things Going to the support group you see people who are similar to you and you realise that theyre really good people It makes you look at yourself in a different way I would recommend anybody whos on the spectrum  or even thinks they are  just to turn up Even if you are depressed it is nice and comforting to speak to other people who can give you advice and help you out When you start a new career you normally give a gift The present is a drawing of the Sikhs th Guru Guru Gobind Singh Ji He has the heart of a saint and the body of a warrior and Ive always aspired to be like that
