A precious package arrived at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last Thursday afternoon Inside packed in dry ice to keep it frozen was a vial containing millions of viruses derived from a yearold Chinese housewife who   of respiratory and kidney failure The package was addressed to the CDCs top flu virologist   Once we got the virus we took it immediately to the appropriate level of biocontainment Cox tells Shots That would be a socalled   lab where researchers can keep this demonstrably dangerous virus under tight control We unpacked it from the various levels of protection  that is containers in which it is placed in order to ensure that it doesnt spill Cox says And then the work actually began Theres     of urgent work to do according to scientists in farflung labs who also got samples of the virus at the end of last week In fact the urgency increased this weekend with the discovery that a yearold girl in Beijing fell ill with this new bird flu last Thursday She was the daughter of poultry sellers and contact with poultry may be the way many people have become infected Shes reportedly in stable condition but the fact that the virus has begun to sicken people nearly  miles from the epidemics epicenter in Shanghai is a strong signal that the virus will not be contained to one region of China  and perhaps not to China As of Sunday morning the   has climbed past  with new cases being reported daily Eleven people have died and most of the survivors have gotten severely ill In London virologist   wants to develop a reliable test to see whos infected with   as this virus is called Current tests for human flu viruses dont identify this one The top priority is diagnosis  the capability to be able to pick up this virus should it emerge outside of China McCauley says He directs one of the World Health Organizations collaborating centers on influenza At St Judes Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis flu researcher   is getting started on a vaccine against HN Well start preparing some vaccine seed strains against it  you know just in case says Webby director of another WHO collaborating center Having a seed strain is the first step in making a vaccine Webby and others have already started work on an HN vaccine using socalled    starting from the viruss gene sequences posted by the Chinese on the Internet two weeks ago But there are many unknowns about a vaccine against this type of virus So researchers are taking a beltandsuspenders approach Theyre planning to make vaccine candidates the conventional way by growing quantities of virus in eggs first as well as newer eggfree technologies Think back to the  pandemic when many of us assumed we were going to need two doses of that HN vaccine to get a good immune response and it turned out only one was needed Webby says Is this HN vaccine going to require two big doses Since no humans had ever been known to be infected with an HN virus before now   that a vaccine might not induce as strong an immune response as say a vaccine against an H strain where people are already primed to respond At the CDC scientists have a long todo list of HN research projects Cox the flu virologist plans to infect   weasellike mammals considered close to humans in the way they respond to flu viruses She especially wants to see if ferrets can pass this virus to other ferrets She also wants to make an antibody test which will enable scientists to tell if people close to the known cases in China have been infected without getting seriously ill There are many mysteries to solve One of the most puzzling is how HN has infected people in such a   of southeast China Poultry and wild birds are currently the only known source of infection But last week the Chinese  only  infected birds tested in five different markets A separate   indicated HN in  out of  ducks in Zhejiang province one of the affected areas Clearly testing of domestic poultry as well as wild birds is just getting underway It does look as if infected poultry have dispersed throughout this large area of roughly  by  miles says   who is in charge of tracking the infections at the CDC And its likely I think that there will be more cases in adjacent provinces in the weeks to come Widdowson tells Shots its hard to know how HN is jumping from chickens to humans exactly which part of the processing  slaughtering buying preparing eating  is particularly highrisk He notes that most of the cases have been in urban areas That differs from   bird flu patterns where many of the  or so human cases identified since  have been in people with close prolonged exposure to infected poultry The discrepancy makes him suspicious that kitchen exposures to HN might be important So far pigs have not been found to harbor HN which is a good thing since   with bird swine and human viruses Harboring all those different viruses allows the swapping of genes and generation of entirely new viral strains It would be rather bad news if the HN virus were to be found in pigs Cox says Cases of HN have been increasing at a faster pace than cases of HN which researchers have been watching closely for more than  years But Widdowson says cases of this new virus may soon go up even more rapidly because the Chinese have begun testing people for it nationally So far hes reassured that monitoring of around  close contacts of HN cases hasnt turned up firm evidence that this virus can be spread easily But that doesnt mean it wont happen Webby thinks HN poses a greater threat of becoming transmissible among humans than the HN virus that has caused such prolonged anxiety among researchers My gut feeling at this point in time is that this guy HN is probably closer to doing it he says Cox notes the virus already has   that enable it to infect human cells and reproduce at humans body temperature which is lower than birds That means she says these viruses may already be partially adapted  not totally adapted but partially adapted  towards the type of virus that might efficiently transmit from human to human She says the coming weeks may tell whether HN is only a bird disease that occasionally spills over into humans the potential seed of a dangerous global flu   or something in between
