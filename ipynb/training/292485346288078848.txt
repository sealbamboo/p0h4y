The US Food and Drug Administration announced in  that diets including daily soy resulted in a significantly reduced risk of heart disease the No  cause of death in the United States then and now With the announcement soy officially became a darling of the healthfood world and a cornerstone of American diets Fastforward  years and soy products are still widely seen as healthy alternatives to their animal counterparts Soy protein saturates supermarket shelves  sneaking into everything from cereal to protein bars to crackers to frozen meals and even surprising places like some brands of canned tuna  not to mention the more recognizable forms of soy including edamame tofu soy milk soy cheeses and soy meats But as soys popularity wages on some notable nutritionists and doctors now warn against consuming soy in any form including the processed and packaged foods that contain types of soy protein The reason is soys isoflavones a naturally occurring plant compound that is present is all forms of soy including organic soy which is a type of   Phytoestrogen is produced by plants and is slightly different from the estrogen hormone produced by the human body But in excess it can create some of the devastating effects of estrogen overload in both men and women Although soy isnt the only source of isoflavones in the modern diet all legumes have them soy is the most concentrated says Amy Gross MPH RD CDN of the NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City To make things more confusing while isoflavones harm some people they have been found to be beneficial in others There are different theories as to why these things may affect us differently or exacerbate one thing and improve another in our bodies Gross says It could potentially bind to estrogen receptors in different cells in our body It could act similarly to estrogen or take over where estrogen would usually take over when looking at that receptor itself that would be on that individual cell There is a lot of research that tells different stories Soy is very heavily marketed as a healthy food says Kaayla Daniel PhD a nutritionist and author of the book   but the fact is weve got hundreds of studies that link soy consumption to malnutrition   immune system reproductive health problems digestive disorders certain types of cancers and more It is also important to note that nongenetically modified soy and organic soy has been linked to these health conditions as well Daniel says Israel and Germany have issued warnings against the consumption of soy foods for young children and infants New Zealand also warns that soy formula for infants should only be used as a last resort To date these three countries are the only ones to come out forcefully against soy consumption Still some studies indicates that soy in moderation particularly tempeh miso and other soy sources with relatively low levels of isoflavones can be beneficial  though many of these prosoy studies have been funded by soy lobbying groups such as the Soybean Board Heres a look at some of the conditions soy can affect Soy like all foods has pros and cons so like all foods the takehome message is to consume it in moderation Gross recommends eating one to two servings a day max as part of a balanced diet which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables whole grains low or nonfat dairy and other sources of lean protein  Because soy often hides in processed foods under aliases such as textured vegetable protein its important to read nutrition labels on anything you buy to make sure it doesnt have hidden soy along with other ingredients Soy is in so many things you might not expect Daniel warns Just about everything that comes in a package If youre eating a lot of processed and packaged foods youre also eating additives and flavorings highfructose corn syrup and who knows what else so its not just the soy thats the problem in those products Instead Daniel and Gross both recommend preparing whole foods at home that you can make from scratch and avoiding processed foods whenever possible for overall health I think that its entirely appropriate to include soy in your diet Gross says But I wouldnt have it be everything that youre eating We need a variety of foods and if youre focusing on one food you might be missing out
