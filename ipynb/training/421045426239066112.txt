People who run races of more than  miles get hurt  stresses and strains and bruised toes But generally they are healthier and take less sick time than the rest of us None of thats too surprising if you imagine what it takes to run even five miles Running races longer than a marathon   miles  has grown in popularity with  people finishing such races in  and  doing so in  according to UltraRunning magazine So researchers decided to look at the health effects of extreme exercise They assessed  ultramarathoners to establish a baseline for the Ultramarathoner Longitudinal Tracking Study and reported their findings Wednesday in the journal PLOS One Such information is valuable in understanding potential benefits and risks from levels of exercise beyond the moderate amounts known to have health benefits the researchers  Dr Martin Hoffman an ultrarunner and UC Davis professor and Dr Eswar Krishnan an assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine  wrote The participants in the study were  to  years old with an average of  mostly men and mostly white Their average running distance for the previous year was  miles more than  miles a week Some of their findings  The most prevalent conditions  significantly higher than in the overall population  were allergies and hay fever about a quarter of them and exerciseinduced asthma  The researchers speculated that the asthma could result from the drying of the airways during exercise and the allergies from the increased exposure to airborne allergens  Fewer than the overall populationreported diseases such as cancers  heart disease  and diabetes   Seventyseven percent reported exerciserelated injuries and  of the runners reported that an injury cost them training days but those injuries rarely cost them time from work or school They lost an average of  days a year of work or school because of injury or illness employed Americans lost  days Younger and less experienced longdistance runners were more apt to be injured  Most of the injuries were to the legs and feet but just  of them were stress fractures Assessing these runners over time will help reveal how much exercise is optimal how much recreational activity is appropriate and beneficial and if there is a reason not to push your body beyond a certain point Krishnan an epidemiologist said in a statement The next step a questionnaire to be sent early this year will look at whether the runners have particular knowledge or adaptations to prevent injuries They also hope to study the psychological factors that motivate the runners MaryMacVeanlatimescom r
