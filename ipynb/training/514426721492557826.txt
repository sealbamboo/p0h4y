In a press conference Tuesday  cautioned that this model is based on older data from August The numbers are not projections but scenarios  The model does not take into account President Obamas announcement that the US is sending troops and extra medical equipment to the area Nor does it take into account the additional help from other countries promised  What the model does suggests he said is that the current surge of help can break the back of the epidemic and is exactly whats needed to end it  He said he is now confident the most dire predictions will not come to pass  The cautionary tale this data does tell he said is that there would be an enormous cost if help is delayed    a special assistant to the President and senior director of the National Security Council said the model tells responders how to bend the curve and that the epidemic can end with a large international response  The momentum must at least be maintained to ensure we are way out ahead of this Smith said And added that the international help will need to stay on this as long as it takes A separate   on Tuesday says the fatality rate of this outbreak in West Africa is  and that the current epidemiologic outlook is bleak It also warns that without drastic improvements in measures to control its spread the number of cases and deaths from Ebola is expected to continue climbing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months The cumulative number of cases could exceed  by November  the assessment said It blamed the spread not on a particularly virulent strain of the virus rather it said this outbreak was so deadly because of a combination of dysfunctional health systems international indifference high population mobility local customs densely populated capitals and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict Perhaps most important Ebola has reached the point where it could establish itself as an endemic infection because of a highly inadequate and late global response It warns that the global response must improve to meet the threat posed by this and future epidemics Another sixmonth report from WHO  which assesses the situation in three countries at the outbreaks center Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone  is dedicated to those health workers who as an expression of our innately shared human compassion risked their lives and lost them In the six months since this outbreak was first formally reported in March  health care workers have been infected of whom more than  have died the WHO said  where the outbreak began in a remote area details how the virus first gained a grip on a vulnerable frightened population illequipped to deal with the deadly disease Once Ebola was identified as the killer a national and international response swung into gear But each time it looked like the country might be at the point of controlling the virus new flareups occurred The WHO report concludes Ebola kept getting reintroduced into Guinea  with its notoriously porous borders  from the large outbreaks in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone Controlling the virus then will not be feasible in Guinea until its stopped in neighboring countries  Meanwhile health workers there have come under attack as they seek to educate the local population Today one of the biggest barriers to control is violence from an impoverished terrified and shattered population that does not understand what hit it and fights back the only way it can the report said WHOs   summarizes their situation as one of misery and despair tempered by some good reasons for hope The number of Liberian cases is increasing exponentially with  new ones reported over a single hour period on one day last week WHO said  a record number in any outbreak At the same time treatment centers are overflowing Many patients are turned away  The capacity to deliver other basic health services such as care for women in childbirth has been compromised The report warns malariarelated deaths may soon surpass those from Ebola Hope can be found in the opening of a new WHOfunded bed Ebola treatment center it said The US government is also setting up a new laboratory to speed up diagnosis  Currently there are four major Ebola treatment units in Liberia In remarks made on Tuesday Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that her countrys health care system is hurting Of the over  who have died  were health care workers   The President characterized the CDCs model for possible infections as scary to all of us She added though that she is happy with the US response to the disaster She believes it will make a major difference She predicts with that increased international effort Liberia will see better results in a couple of weeks  The   explains how traditional burial practices helped the virus spread quickly there following the funeral of a respected local healer  The virus has taken a devastating toll on health workers and researchers Sierra Leones most urgent needs include more treatment beds in much safer facilities better contact training and followup more personal protective equipment and body bags and more properly protected teams to collect bodies and bury them safely WHO said The deployment of international medical teams in West Africa including from China and Cuba may help   where the situation is judged stable  for the moment are seen as success stories Those countries have shown conventional methods such as early detection contact tracing isolation and an adequate supply of personal protective equipment can contain the virus WHO said If Nigeria can control an outbreak caused by such a deadly and highly contagious virus right from the start any country in the world can do the same its report said
