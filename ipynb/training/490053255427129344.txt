The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is on the hot seat It all started in midJune when the CDC   that dozens of its scientists might have accidentally been exposed to anthrax Since then a number of other security risks in and via national laboratories have come to light Ordinary flu virus was unknowingly contaminated with the deadly   virus sent from a CDC lab vials of smallpox virus   forgotten in a National Institutes of Health storage room and just this week the FDA   that forgotten vials of other potential bioterrorism agents were discovered in the same storage room where the smallpox samples turned up These lapses occurring in some of the nations top governmentrun facilities left many to wonder whether the CDC which is charged with protecting the public from natural and manmade health threats is capable of shielding Americans from the risks posed by its own research Under questioning by lawmakers on Wednesday the CDCs director Dr   testified that these errors represent a   of unsafe practices in government laboratories that must change This week Frieden sat down with NPRs   host David Greene to discuss these breaches and what new steps are being taken to ensure the safety of lab workers and the public Following are highlights of the conversation Ive imposed a moratorium on transfer of all infectious or potentially infectious material out of all of our high containment labs until we trust but verify that theyre changing their protocols  Ive closed the individual labs associated with the two incidents and they wont reopen until we are certain that they can reopen safely Ive appointed a senior scientist to be the single point of accountability and were going to work at every level of CDC to increase the culture of safety here One of the things that we want to ensure in the strengthening of the culture of safety is that people understand that anytime there might be a problem  or there is a problem  report it rather than try to figure it out first and then report it CDC scientists are rightly famous around the world for being the top in the world in their field and that same rigor that weve been applying to finding and stopping outbreaks  thats the rigor we are now applying to improving safety at CDC Scientists dont regulate themselves We currently have a   program run by both a separate division of CDC and the Agriculture Departments Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service These two agencies  oversee all entities that work with select agents We make unannounced site visits we have detailed reviews Well look at whether these incidents suggest that we should do other things in addition at those Were certainly open to anything that will improve lab safety One of the things that I will be doing this week is inviting an external advisory group that has no prior employment with CDC to  look at what we are doing on lab safety and biosecurity and suggest any ways that we can improve that process One thing that all three of these incidents suggest is that we need to take a hard look at the risks and the benefits of the different types of research that are being done and make sure in every case that the benefits justify  potential risks
