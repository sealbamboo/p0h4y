Teenagers may be suffering the most Researchers at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health called the problem The Great Sleep Recession in a new study published in the journal   They surveyed more than  teens in eighth th and th grades between  and  and found that teens are getting less and less sleep The average amount is seven hours a day which is two hours less than the nine hours they should be snoozing AfricanAmerican and Hispanic boys are the least likely to sleep enough But why  Katherine W Keyes lead researcher and assistant professor of epidemiology at Mailman says researchers dont know She and her team speculate that increased Internet and social media use is a factor as well as pressure and competition over the college admissions process Not everyone gets all their sleep at night though Babies and toddlers for example take naps to get it all in  But a new study published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood says toddlers sleep better at night without the naps Australian researchers reviewed  previously published studies and found that napping beyond age  is linked to poor quality sleep at night And as many parents of toddlers will attest it can also lead to an array of stalling tactics and protests at bedtime The authors of the study say there is no scientific evidence to continue having children older than  nap and recommend discontinuing it especially if the child has trouble sleeping at night  We know that not getting enough sleep causes all kinds of harm to our minds and bodies no matter your age Study after study tells us so Sleep deprivation causes us to     is linked to   leads to slow reaction time that  and can even cause   And that list could go on and on  So how much sleep do we need The National Sleep Foundation recently issued new recommendations on   we should all be getting They are based on a review of research and a consensus from a group of  experts in sleep science physiology and medicine    There are now nine age categories some of them new Anything more or less than the identified range is simply not recommended      to  months   to  hours per day     to  months    to  hours per day     to  years old   to  hours per day     to  years old   to  hours per day     to  years old   to  hours per day    to  years old   to  hours per day     to  years old   to  hours per day    to   years old   to  hours per day     and older   to  hours per day While there is plenty of research confirming all that goes wrong when you dont get enough sleep there are also proven steps people can take to help fall asleep and sleep better once they do fall asleep A new study published in the journal   says mindful meditation helps adults fall asleep and stay asleep  Researchers at the University of Southern California Los Angeles randomly assigned  adults age  and older who experienced minor sleep disturbances to one of two groups for one year  One group was taught mindfulness meditation which they practiced for  minutes per day  The other group went through sleep hygiene education intervention which changes daily behaviors and other factors believed to be causing sleep problems Those who used mindful meditation ended up sleeping better than those in the other group  Of course a larger study is needed to confirm this finding But the idea of relaxation leading to better sleep is not so farfetched In fact the National Sleep Foundation recommends a relaxing bedtime ritual and winding down before bed Meditation certainly qualifies It  waking up and going to bed at the same time every day using bright lights to help wake up avoiding naps and avoiding heavy meals alcohol and cigarettes at night Its a lot to think about Hopefully it wont keep you up and youll be having sweet dreams and enough of them in no time
