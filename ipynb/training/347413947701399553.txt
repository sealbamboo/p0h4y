Obesity in adolescents is associated with a range of cardiovascular and other health risks Now a new study adds one more hearing loss Several studies have demonstrated the association of obesity with hearing loss in adults but now researchers examining records of a nationwide sample of  boys and girls ages  to  have found the same association in teenagers The   The researchers controlled for various factors including poverty sex race and previous exposure to loud noises They found that being at or above the th percentile for body mass index  the definition of obesity in teenagers  was independently associated with poorer hearing over all frequencies and with almost double the risk of lowfrequency hearing loss in one ear They suggest that this may represent an early stage of injury that will later progress to both ears as it does in adults The reason for the connection is not known but the scientists suggest that inflammation induced by obesity may be a factor in organ damage  Its quite possible that early intervention could arrest the progression said the lead author Dr Anil K Lalwani a professor of otolaryngology at Columbia University This is another reason to lose weight  but not to lose hope
