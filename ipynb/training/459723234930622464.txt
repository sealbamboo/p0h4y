The US Food and Drug Administration   its authority over new tobacco products on Thursday including ecigarettes cigars pipe tobacco and nicotine gels Its a basic first step extending the FDAs regulatory power but the rule would immediately make ecigarettes offlimits to kids under  and would require makers to tell the agency whats in their products They would have to report to us the constituents of their products and also how they are making them said FDA commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg But the agency does not propose for now limiting Internet sales or television advertising something that disappoints health experts who fear the new cigarettes make smoking attractive and are hooking a whole new generation It should not take several more years for the FDA to be able to specify how it intends to regulate the unfettered marketing of many dangerous tobacco products The American Heart Association agreed We believe the rule falls short by allowing industry to continue to advertise ecigarettes often with attractive and seductive flavorings and increases the risk that we will raise yet another generation addicted to nicotine before we even fully understand the health dangers of these new nicotinedelivery products said Heart Association CEO Dr Nancy Brown Makers of ecigarettes said they were happy I think we are pleased the FDA is treating electronic cigarettes differently from combustionbased cigarettes said Miguel Martin president of Logic You should always be suspicious when the tobacco industry applauds something retorted Tom Glynn senior director of cancer science for the American Cancer Society Congress gave FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products in  but the law didnt include ecigarettes and certain other products The legislation also does not allow FDA to ban tobacco products outright but it can limit sales and marketing and require warning labels Public health experts  for FDA to extend its authority as ecigarettes have exploded in popularity Its like the wild wild West Hamburg said Companies can do whatever they want and they can market however they want Use of ecigarettes called vaping has taken off in a big way with sales hitting an estimated  billion in  An ecigarette product ranges from  to  depending on how many charges it provides The little metal or plastic tubes that look like cigarettes have been around in some form since  but only became popular within the past decade Now more than  brands have proliferated The new regulations would extend limits that are currently on cigarettes to other tobacco products including ecigarettes That means makers will have to register with FDA and disclose what is in them Ecigarette enthusiasts say vaping is far safer than smoking cigarettes and some experts say that may well be the case Cigarettes and other tobacco products contain hundreds if not thousand of chemicals and companies were known to add chemicals to enhance flavor and to make the products more addictive Supporters and some researchers say they may be useful in helping people quit smoking what they call combustible cigarettes but the research is limited Hamburg says its important to find out just how people really are using them  whether as an aid to kicking the habit or as a crutch to get them past nosmoking zones And most health advocates are suspicious of the motives of ecigarette makers The tobacco industry are very vigorously looking at alternative products to smoking tobacco and are betting a lot that this will be a product for them that will be viable in the future said American Heart Association president Dr Mariell Jessup Its being marketed a lot that the smoke is harmless and we dont know that We shouldnt be fooled by the promises that these devices these nicotine delivery systems are safe The Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids was more blunt It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the Administration so long to act This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids and their use has skyrocketed the group said in a statement Ecigarettes contain at the least nicotine and compounds such as propylene glycol as well as water to make a flavored mist that looks like smoke and that users can inhale like they would a cigarette But Hamburg says no one really knows what else is in them or what the effects are of inhaling the heatedup mixture We dont know as much about the safety and risks of ecigarettes and that is why we want to be able to regulate them Hamburg told NBC News The current situation is of great concern to us she added It is an unregulated environment with respect to these products Flavors such as strawberry and thin mint make it clear the products are being aimed at children teens and young adults Hamburg said They are an easy way for kids to take up a nicotine habit and then go on to cigarettes and other tobacco products that we know carry very serious risks she said Thursdays proposals are just the start of a cumbersome process FDA will publish the suggested regulations and then the public and industry may weigh in FDA must consider the comments before it enacts a final rule  something that can take months or even years We want to move as quickly as we can but it is a process and it will take time Hamburg said We think the fact that we are beginning the process is important The FDA banned fruit and candyflavored cigarettes soon after the agency was given regulatory power over tobacco in  Hamburg noted that tobacco companies then started making flavored cigars and she said that worries her Last year the FDA found that menthol cigarettes   than nonflavored cigarettes but did nothing to limit their sale
