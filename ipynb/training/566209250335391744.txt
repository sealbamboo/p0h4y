Do you think I should do medicine asked my brighteyed teenage cousin poised on the edge of one of the biggest decisions of his life so far As current holder of the esteemed title of the first doctor in the family he came to me for advice I told him I needed to think about it That week I went about my daily firefighting routine with the bleary eyed commute the inevitable bleating monologues to friends explaining why I couldnt make their lunchweddingbirthday and the familiar feeling of lying in bed at the end of a  hour day churning over the patients Id seen and I wondered what would I say to my yearold self Ive felt undeserving of the proud superlatives from my relatives Its not quite been the picture I warbled about in my medical school interview There have however in my admittedly shortlived career so far been plenty of moments where Ive felt glad that I chose to be a doctor But I realised that if I was being honest my answer would depend on something he probably didnt expect how much he imagined spending time with his family in the future There was a point as a medical student when I realised that the GP path was going to be inevitable for me I remember my own GP at the time declaring If you want to have a family and a life this is the only way to go as she left to pick up her children from school Those words echoed in my ears as I plugged away at my foundation jobs trying not to pay too much attention to how much I enjoyed being the AE doctor or the acute general medic on call I know I dont have to dig deep to find   and I dont for a moment think Im in for an easy ride But Im yet to be convinced that any other path will give me quite the same flexibility in terms of managing a family life alongside my career There are plenty of options to go parttime in hospital specialties and I admire those around me doing just that Equally many of my colleagues echo my view that the seemingly endless training treadmill that results from this is unappealing It doesnt absolve you from working unsociable hours either and in some specialties I still get the feeling thatthe part timers arent held in quite the same regard A year into their chosen specialties and Ive noticed a gradual shift in the mood of my female friends Their initial enthusiasm now seems laced with doubt how will they juggle their careers with the other jigsaw pieces of their lives that are coming together to paint a picture that seems incompatible with the demands of their specialty Should our yearold selves have known what we were letting ourselves in for Do we just want to have our cake and eat it too There is a distinct lack of women at the top as highlighted recently by the Kings Fund   This varies widely among specialties with just   The   has been highlighted before I felt a glimmer of hope recently after seeing some interesting examples of specialists working in ways that transcend the boundaries of primary and secondary care I think these new models of care could define innovative roles in the future especially for those who want to find a way to combine a speciality career with the flexibility of primary care beyond being a GPSI GP with a special interest For example the Imperial Healthcare Child Health GP Hub was recently featured in a   The hubs comprise groups of GP practices working with hospital paediatricians and GPs can refer patients to an outreach clinic A consultant and a hub GP sit side by side and lead this clinic every four to six weeks in the GP surgery itself Ive heard several of my female paediatric colleagues wishing that this could be a permanent post with its own training programme Another example is the   Elderly frail patients can be referred to the EMU which is seen as an alternative to an acute hospital AE by their GP or paramedic It operates seven days a week with limited weekend hours with some basic diagnostic facilities and a full multidisciplinary team I spent some time here as a foundation doctor and could definitely see the appeal of a career path that led to a permanent role here as an acute medic The potential is there but   working patterns just dont seem to have caught up with the changing demographic of the modern workforce yet with women expected to make up the majority over the next  years My cousin listened to my rambling and went ahead to apply for medicine anyway Im sure its hard for him to imagine what his priorities will be like in  years time just as it was for me I only hope he has some more options when he gets there
