The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a warning for Americans Get ready for a potentially nasty flu season So far this flu season the influenza strains most active in the US are versions of HN viruses Dr Tom Frieden said Thursday We know that in seasons when H viruses predominant we tend to have seasons that are the worst flu years with more hospitalizations from flu and more deaths from the flu Frieden said A total of  flu samples have been analyzed in laboratories since Oct  and  of them were of the HN variety according to data from the CDCs   for the week ending Nov  the most recent report available Making matters worse this years flu vaccines are a good match for only  of these these HN strains That means the vaccine  though still the best defense against the flu  is likely to offer less protection than in years past Frieden said The   in the US are designed to prime the bodys immune system to fight three or four strains of influenza This years vaccines protect against two types of influenza A viruses  one HN and one HN  as well as one or two influenza B viruses The CDCs FluView report says that only one type of HN virus has been tested since Oct  It was a good match with the ACalifornia strain in this years flu An additional  influenza B viruses have been analyzed and they are good matches as well Ten of them were of the Yamagata lineage thats in all North American vaccines and the seven others were of the BVictoria lineage thats in the quadrivalent versions of the vaccines But most of the flu strains subjected to laboratory testing have been of the HN variety according to the CDC And slightly fewer than half matched the ATexas strain thats in the vaccines given in the US Most of the rest of the HN samples were similar to a strain called ASwitzerland which was picked for the flu vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere according to the FluView report Flu watchers first detected these strains in the US in March By then it was already too late to include them in this seasons vaccine Frieden said Its not clear that vaccine makers would have made the switch at that point even if it were possible Back then the ATexas strains were still by far the most common of the HN viruses he noted The ASwitzerland strains appeared in significant numbers only in September he said The dominance of HN viruses and the mismatch with the vaccine mean that doctors and patients should be vigilant this flu season Frieden said Thats especially true for people who are more vulnerable to influenza because they have lung diseases asthma heart disease or diabetes or are pregnant Five children have died of the flu this year he said  like Tamiflu and Relenza can make the flu milder and shorter and reduce the likelihood that youll end up in a hospital or in intensive care Frieden said WeÂ  believe treatment with antiviral drugs can reduce the risk of dying from influenza Yet only  in  patients who really need the drugs gets them Frieden said We strongly recommend that if doctors suspect the flu in someone who may be severely ill from the flu they dont wait for the results of a flu test before starting antivirals Frieden said But these drugs are only the second line of defense against influenza The first Frieden said is the flu vaccine Though far from perfect it still offers us the best chance for prevention he said
