Health care spending grew at a record slow pace for the fourth straight year in  according to a new government report But the federal officials who compiled the report disagree with their bosses in the Obama administration about why The   from the actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published in the journal   found total US health spending totaled  trillion in  or  per person Health spending consumed  percent of the nations gross domestic product but that was slightly down from the previous years  percent And in a rare event the growth rate of  percent was actually slower than that of the overall economy which grew at a rate of  percent The report found several things that led to the slower spending increase especially the residual effects of the recession But one thing that did not lead to slower growth according to the authors was the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act had a minimal impact on overall national health spending growth through  the report said Instead the law likely produced a small overall increase in spending for the first three years that the law was in effect the actuaries say And the persistent slow growth in health spending even a few years after the economy has begun to recover is what youd expect to see now according to Aaron Catlin deputy director of the National Health Statistics Group that leads the annual study What we can tell you is that the period of stability is consistent with the historical experience he told reporters at a briefing on the report In other words health inflation has traditionally remained in check for at least a few years following a recession But the actuaries view  that health spending is simply following historical trends  is not universal The White House struck back at the reports contention that the health law hasnt had an impact We have already seen powerful examples of hospitals and other providers who have already begun to embrace changes to their practices to bring down costs in the wake of the Affordable Care Act wrote White House health policy advisor Jeanne Lambrew in a   Other economists support the administrations contention that the law has had an impact on the current slowdown in cost increases Theres a big unexplained component says David Cutler a Harvard health economist who recently coauthored a   about the subject Even though slower economic growth has reduced spending spending has fallen by even more than the slower economic growth would suggest In particular says Cutler Medicare spending which by itself accounts for a fifth of the nations health spending has slowed dramatically And Medicare spending is not traditionally tied to what happens in the rest of the economy If you look historically the link between how the economy is doing and whats happening to Medicare spending is very very weak Cutler says He thinks that changes made by the Affordable Care Act are affecting Medicare spending From reduced error rates in hospitals to reduced rates of readmission for Medicare beneficiaries to reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and hospitals  those are a direct result of the Affordable Care Act Cutler says The bottom line is no one really knows exactly why health care spending continues to grow slowly and how much impact the Affordable Care Act is having on spending But most policymakers agree on one thing  they hope the current trend will continue
