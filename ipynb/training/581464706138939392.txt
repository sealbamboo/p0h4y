The   regulator has abandoned its system of bandings for GP practices after criticism from doctors representatives The   last year placed all  GP surgeries in England in bands from one to six under its intelligent monitoring system with one indicating the greatest risk to patients One in six practices were   which under the CQCs classifications meant they put patients either at risk or elevated risk through inadequate care but GPs representatives criticised the classification as simplistic and misleading  The scrapping of the bandings was announced in a letter from David Behan the CQC chief executive and Prof Steve Field the chief inspector of general practice  It also included an apology The letter said CQC has listened to the concerns of the GP profession and as a result it has agreed not to continue with the use of bandings for GP Intelligent Monitoring as well as changing the language used to highlight variation between practices so that it does not imply a risk to patient safety  What we published wasnt right regarding the use of language around risk and on the analysis of variation between practices We apologise We also acknowledge that bandings have been perceived as judgments about the quality of care That was not our intent but today we confirm we are removing them for GP Intelligent Monitoring nonetheless Shortly after the bandings were published in November last year the CQC was   after it wrongly labelled  GP practices as being at risk of offering patients a poor standard of care The   hailed the CQCs decision  taken after a meeting with GP leaders and experts in GP data and quality on Thursday  as a victory for common sense The RCGPs chair Dr Maureen Baker said GPs across England will be very relieved and reassured by this decision We are pleased that the CQC have acted on our concerns and agreed to abolish the banding system until a suitable alternative can be agreed by all relevant parties CQC inspections were introduced to demonstrate that patients were receiving high quality care from their GP practice But anomalies in the banding systems resulted in confusing patients and shaking the confidence of hardworking   across the country at a time when they are already trying to deliver excellent care in very difficult circumstances
