Jim Cooke blames his hearing loss on the constant roar of C aircraft engines he experienced in the Air Force He didnt wear protective gear because like most yearolds you think youre indestructible he said By the time he was  he needed hearing aids for both ears Still he had a long career as a telephone company executive while he and his wife Jean raised two children in Broadview Heights Ohio Only after retirement he told me in an interview did he start having trouble communicating Mr Cooke had to relinquish a couple of parttime jobs he enjoyed because I felt insecure about dealing with people on the phone he said He withdrew from a church organization he led because he couldnt grasp what members were saying at meetings He didnt want to be in social situations Mrs Cooke said It gave him a feeling of inadequacy and anger at times Two years ago when their grandchildren began saying that Granddad needed to replace his hearing aid batteries  although the batteries were fine  the Cookes went to the Cleveland Clinic where an audiologist there   told Jim that at  he might consider a cochlear implant Perhaps the hearttugging YouTube videos of deaf toddlers suddenly hearing sounds have led us to think of cochlear implants as primarily for children Or perhaps said   a Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist we consider latelife hearing loss normal which it is an unfortunate but inconsequential aspect of aging and dont explore treatment beyond hearing aids In any case the idea of older adults   has been slow to catch on even though by far the greatest number of people with severe hearing loss are seniors Often when patients start to withdraw from conversation and activities families chalk it up to aging or the beginning of cognitive decline when in fact their hearing loss has progressed to the point where they cant engage Dr Sydlowski said Beyond the social and emotional toll  isolation withdrawal depression  the kind of hearing loss well all develop   dementia and even physical decline Dr Lin said A brain constantly working to try to interpret degraded sound he explained has less ability to handle other kinds of thinking and memorybuilding Dr Lin estimated that  Americans over age  could benefit from an implant But you can understand why the idea gives older people pause Some find the technology daunting Unlike hearing aids which amplify sound an implant directly stimulates the auditory nerve bypassing the damaged part of the ear Users usually wear the external parts of the device including a small processor and microphone behind the ear To allow time for healing surgeons wait about a month past surgery before activating the device When they do the implant doesnt miraculously restore normal hearing The sounds it transmits arent what an ear hears but an approximation Patients should expect to spend months perhaps a year practicing at home and working with therapists to learn to interpret those signals This is not something you get and turn on and go said   a Cleveland Clinic otolaryngologist It takes time to learn to use it and to learn to listen again People she said with considerable cognitive deficits may be unable to handle those tasks Moreover though cochlear implantation is an outpatient procedure any surgery involving general anesthesia poses greater risk at older ages The most common problem dizziness after the procedure usually only lasts a few days But at Johns Hopkins which annually performs more than  cochlear implantations on patients over age  about  percent of patients complain of dizziness after a month and have to work with physical therapists to strengthen their balance Medicares strict eligibility policy has probably prevented some candidates from having implants too The most common speech recognition test involves a patient with hearing aids sitting in a sound booth trying to repeat sentences an audiologist reads aloud The Food and Drug Administration has approved cochlear implants for patients who correctly repeat fewer than  percent of the sentences But Medicare will only reimburse for patients who get fewer than  percent right Thats worrisome because studies at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere have demonstrated that   After prolonged hearing loss the pathways in the brain that handle auditory processing may begin to atrophy Dr Lin said So while the attitude among a lot of people is Lets wait until it gets really bad results are better if you dont Medicare will undertake a national study of cochlear implants in older people so that policy could change eventually Meanwhile the absurdity of Medicares willingly paying  to  for implant surgery and all the associated costs at the Cleveland Clinic but not  to  for a digital hearing aid continues Still even for those in their s and s the results can be dramatic Patients   significantly several studies have found and   At Johns Hopkins for instance a review of speech outcomes a year after surgery in  patients over age  found an average  percent improvement in speech scores Its common for them to say I should have done this  years ago Dr Lin said Jim Cooke who had no pain or dizziness after his outpatient surgery is a satisfied customer Six months after the operation I felt more confident in communicating he said The following year a cousin who hadnt seen him since his implant came to visit and declared This is the old Jim I knew before Mr Cooke still practices listening  using an online program   minutes each day and gets weekly aural rehab at the University of Akron And he uses assistive devices for his phone and TV But we spoke by phone for  minutes and though he asked Mrs Cooke for help a few times we had a perfectly satisfactory conversation Could we have talked like this before your implant I asked Mr Cooke answered quickly No
