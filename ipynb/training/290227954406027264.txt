  Cuddling and caressing help boost   according to a new study of middleaged and older couples The study also found that tenderness is more important to men than to women that men are more likely to report being happy in their relationship and that women are more likely to be satisfied with their sexual relationship said the researchers from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University The study included more than  couples from the United States Brazil Germany Japan and Spain who had been together for an average of  years The participants were  to yearold men and their female partners Men were more likely to be happy in a relationship if they were in good health and if it was important to them that their partner experienced   during sex Frequent cuddling and kissing also predicted relationship happiness for men but not for women Both women and men were happier the longer they had been together and if they had higher levels of sexual functioning the investigators found Japanese men and women were significantly happier with their relationships than Americans who were happier than Brazilians and Spaniards according to Kinsey Institute director Julia Heiman and colleagues Sexual satisfaction for both women and men was associated with frequent   and cuddling sexual caressing by a partner high sexual functioning and frequent sex For men having had more sex partners in their lifetime was a predictor of less sexual satisfaction the report indicated Sexual satisfaction for women increased over time Those who had been with their partner for less than  years were less likely to be sexually satisfied but satisfaction increased significantly   Possibly women become more satisfied over time because their expectations change or life changes with the children grown Heiman said in a university news release On the other hand those who werent so happy sexually might not be married so long Japanese men reported  times more sexual satisfaction than American men while Japanese and Brazilian women were more satisfied sexually than American women We recognize that relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction may not be the same thing for all couples and in all cultures Heiman said Our next step is to understand how one persons health physical affection and sexual experiences relate to the relationship happiness or sexual satisfaction of his or her partner So we hope for more couplecentered than individualcentered understanding on relationship functioning and satisfaction
