Thinking about national policies from parties that do not expect to win national elections is a slightly odd exercise but I think it is worth looking at UKIPs policy on healthcare  That is because Labour in particular has continued to claim that UKIP is in favour of usercharging in the NHS I have heard that a few times this week That is actually not UKIPs stated policy But if people want to talk about UKIP and the NHS there are things that repay some consideration UKIPs heart is in European withdrawal and immigration policy more than anything In negotiation with another party health is unlikely to be a big issue Still what does UKIP think UKIP like Labour opposes the inclusion of health services in a trade deal between the European Union and the US Fighting the inclusion of the NHS in the deal  the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership known as TTIP  also puts UKIP in the company of Unite the trade union  UKIPs objections to TTIP echo those of Labour and Unite Their main worry is that the agreement will make it nighon impossible for any government to take back control of a service currently provided by the private sector should they fail to perform adequately I should note that neither NHS leaders nor the European negotiators expect this to happen The deal seeks to create a framework to enable investment by US companies in the EU It is not expected by negotiators to create new obligations to outsource nor to allow companies to breach contracts  UKIP also opposes the Private Finance Initiative PFI a financial process that has been used since the s by the Treasury to build run and manage some hospital buildings  The idea of PFI is that the Treasury will in effect commission a private company to build and run a facility for say  years If something goes wrong with it say  years in the same private company has to pay to fix it The risk should stay with the contractors who built the thing It is now widely accepted that PFI has not worked as was hoped The Treasury acknowledges that private companies in practice take on too little risk to make the price worthwhile There is also evidence that the government has sometimes straightforwardly overpaid via PFI  In fact concern about it is so widespread that this is actually a rather mainstream position The coalition sought to reform the practice  it remains to be seen how well  and But UKIP differs from Andy Burnham Labours shadow health secretary in one important respect Mr Burnham is not a fan of outsourcing health services in the NHS He often rails against doctors buying medical services from private companies if there is a public sector alternative   but when I pressed Louise Bours UKIPs health spokeswoman on camera a few weeks ago she was pretty relaxed about it And Labour has made great hay about opposing the coalitions promarket NHS reforms But when I asked Ms Bours about the reforms she was agnostic On TTIP UKIP sides with Labour On Andrew Lansleys NHS changes they side with the Conservatives But UKIP has one very distinctive policy a major change to the NHS plumbing The party would abolish Monitor Englands main hospital finance regulator and the Care Quality Commission CQC which regulates hospital care quality These roles would be taken up by local health boards run by clinicians This strikes me as a bold proposal There is always a risk that regulators get to use the jargon captured That means that they shift from being regulators that work for patients and start to make excuses for the hospitals If the regulators are run by local doctors I would assume that is a greater risk There is also a question of capacity Will these miniMonitors and miniCQCs be able to support the same level of expertise as the national agencies Will they have the breadth of experience to spot trouble Or the national contact book required to arrange a new set of leaders for a hospital So its a policy that raises big practical questions but the idea behind it is that there will be a local person you can ring up and complain to UKIP thinks the potential problems are worth the risk Mr Farage has refused to say whether he would protect the NHS budget from cuts were he elected So we will wait to see on that score but I would be surprised if anyone sought budget reductions from the NHS in the immediate future    There is plenty for voters of all parties to chew over there  even if usercharging isnt part of it
