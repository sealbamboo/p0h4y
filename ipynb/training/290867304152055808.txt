 Interest remains high in drugs for diabetes that force glucose out of the bloodstream and into urine: An FDA advisory committee recommend approval of one such agent,. , while Eli Lilly and Boehringer- Ingelheim announced favorable results from phase III studies with another agent called empagliflozin.. Drugs in this class inhibit SGLT-2, a sodium glucose transporter molecule, which impels the kidneys to extract and excrete glucose from the bloodstream.. One of the studies tested empagliflozin as monotherapy for patients with type 2 diabetes, while two others evaluated it as an adjunct to other standard drugs including metformin, sulfonylurea agents, and pioglitazone (Actos). The fourth was primarily a safety study in patients with renal impairment.. The studies met their primary efficacy endpoint, the companies said, which was a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin relative to the placebo groups.. Although the pioneering compound in this class,. , was rejected last year by the FDA, companies still believe that such drugs can be blockbuster products because they reduce blood sugar so directly..
