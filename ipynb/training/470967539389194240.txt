The wild hikes in health insurance rates that blindsided many Americans in recent years may become less frequent because of the health care overhaul Final rates for  wont be out for months but early filings from insurers suggest price increases of  percent or more That may sound like a lot but rates have risen as much as  or  percent in recent years The rates that emerge over the next few months for  will carry considerable political weight since they will come out before Republicans and Democrats settle their fight for Congressional control in next falls midterm elections Republicans are vowing to make failures of the law a main theme of their election push and abnormally high premiums might bolster their argument In addition to insuring millions of uninsured people the other great promise of the massive health care overhaul was to tame the rate hikes that had become commonplace in the market for individual insurance coverage No one expects price increases to go away but some nonpartisan industry watchers say they do expect the big hikes to hit less frequently in the years to come even though its still early in the laws implementation They point to competition and greater scrutiny fostered by the law as key factors Public insurance exchanges that debuted last fall and were created by the law make it easier for customers to compare prices The overhaul also prevents insurers from rejecting customers because of their health That means someone who develops a health condition like high blood pressure isnt stuck in the same plan year after year because other insurers wont take her She can now shop around The Urban Institute a nonpartisan policy research organization said in a recent report that competition will help restrain individual insurance prices next year And it could have a lasting impact once the new markets for coverage stabilize in a few years said Larry Levitt an insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation which analyzes health policy issues Now if a plan tries to raise premiums a lot people can vote with their feet and move to another plan Levitt said Greater scrutiny by regulators could also keep rates from skyrocketing The overhaul requires a mandatory review of rate increases larger than  percent which can lead to public attention that insurers dont want Nobodys going to get a rate increase unless they truly deserve it said Dave Axene a fellow of the Society of Actuaries who is working with insurers in several states to figure out pricing The rigor that we had to go through to prove that the rates were reasonable its worse than an IRS audit at times To be sure insurers and others in the field say its too early to fully understand what pricing trends will emerge for individual insurance plans which make up a small slice of the insured population And some experts arent convinced of any one outcome of the law Industry consultant Bob Laszewski called the idea that the exchanges will reign in prices by promoting competition an unproven theory No one has any idea what this risk really looks like yet and probably wont for two to three years he said Karen Ignagni agrees The CEO of the trade association Americas Health Insurance Plans which represents insurers said competition between insurers will mean little if too many sick people sign up for coverage on the exchanges Insurers need a balance between sick and healthy people to avoid big claim hits that lead to future rate hikes Either way the rates that emerge over the next few months for  will carry considerable political weight since they will come out before Republicans and Democrats settle their fight for Congressional control in next falls midterm elections Republicans are vowing to make failures of the law a main theme of their election push and abnormally high premiums might bolster their argument Laszewski the industry consultant expects some plans to seek either big premium increases or decreases in  but he says that says nothing about the longterm implications of the overhaul He noted that insurers entered  without a good feel for what their competitors would charge so price swings are inevitable as companies adjust Charmaine Piquette  said shes petrified of a big increase for next year I finally feel like in my life I have a break and can afford to take care of myself even though Im not living on very much a month said Piquette who lives outside Milwaukee Piquette used Wisconsins public health insurance exchange in March to get coverage from the nonprofit insurance cooperative Common Ground The plan costs her only about  a month thanks to a  tax credit she receives as part of the overhaul She lives mainly on about  a month in Social Security disability payments but her health coverage helps her afford things like visits with a diabetes counselor to get her blood sugar back under control I said Praise the Lord every single time I use this she said
