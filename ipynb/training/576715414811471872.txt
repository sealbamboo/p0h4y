Crunch prides itself on offering oddball group exercise classes like pole dancing cycle karaoke and sandbag weightlifting on indoor surfboards So no surprise that its so far the only gym in LA with Disq The class is based on the Disq fitness device a pair of retractable resistance cords on a belt that thread down through anklecuff pulleys and come up to handheld grips Its like wearing a robot suit that makes every movement harder with resistance as you raise lower and punch your hands you use knobs on the belt to dial your preferred resistance I gave the Disq a great review in my Gear column a year ago for being a convenient portable customizable and functional strength workout Crunch made it fun for group exercise by adding music and dance moves Our highenergy instructor yearold Elle Young a former backup dancer for Rihanna Shakira and Mary J Blige kept it moving for  minutes  Deceptively intense The movements are fluid noimpact and fun  but the resistance takes its toll Swept up in the beat doing chorus line kicks and biceps curls I soon noticed my lungs heaving my coordination failing and my sweat raining As we moved back and forth across the floor alternating dance moves and strength exercises kettlebellstyle squats lunges sideways burpees planks to donkey kicks and bentleg Vups it began feeling like the Boot Camp From Hell My problem toohigh resistance Halfway through the workout I gave in and dialed down Drop the machismo advised Audrey Adler  a Los Angeles cycling teacher Disqing for the first time She loved the workout as did Dennis Arrue a yearold Sun Valley customer service rep who said hed gotten some toning and weight loss  pounds from four onceaweek classes since his New Years resolution  Young was a stickler for form running from person to person making corrections Erika Aguilar  a firsttime Disqer from Glendale appreciated it Im not knowledgeable about strength exercises and need a segue into weights This kicked my butt I definitely will be back next week   Crunch members free
