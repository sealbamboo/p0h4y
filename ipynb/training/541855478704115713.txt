fter the scandals of     and   the health and care system promised to get better at listening to and addressing reports of poor care negligence and abuse As chief executive of Healthwatch England the consumer champion for health and social care I have been watching their progress intently in particular around the complaints system and the drive to inject a real sense of compassion into how people are dealt with when failed by the system To see how they are getting on we submitted a freedom of information request to every hospital trust in England and asked them to share details of their complaints process We found there is still huge variation The most startling finding however was the attitude of hospitals towards complaints raised by those who witness poor care rather than experiencing it themselves Of the  trusts we contacted we received responses from  with one in three saying they dont record complaints made by third parties Only  were able to provide us with enough information to suggest they were dealing with these sorts of complaints in the right way Many of the trusts stated incorrectly that they could not investigate complaints unless the patients permission was secured While we would not expect a hospital to share confidential information with a stranger there is nothing in the rules that says an incident reported by a third party shouldnt be properly investigated just like any other Its perhaps time that government revisited and clarified the rules around complaints underpinning the principle that everyone has the right to complain about poor care backed up by proper penalties and fines for those that fail to up their game All complaints no matter how minor or indeed who makes them should be recorded and submitted to a central repository so we can track performance This goes for social care complaints as well Just measuring the number of complaints isnt enough Every hospital GP surgery and care home in the country should be required to report on how it has used complaints to drive improvement When hospitals do listen and take action complaints can lead to positive change In Rotherham for example when two members of the public got into a lift at the local hospital and were asked by a member of staff to escort a lostlooking patient back to his bed they were outraged The man had been let outside to smoke a cigarette but the doctors and nurses hadnt given him any shoes or proper clothes to put on After getting nowhere with the hospital the two women took their complaint to their local Healthwatch which was able to apply some pressure The hospital agreed to review the CCTV footage and has now implemented new policies around which patients are allowed out and the checks that need to happen first It is worth noting that where hospitals do record thirdparty concerns they account for about a fifth of the overall number of complaints To ignore them risks a huge number of incidents going under the radar but also wastes a huge learning opportunity to improve services and ensure that everyone receives a compassionate response when they experience or witness poor care It is important to remember that complaints arent case files they are reallife stories of what happens when things go wrong in health and social care Without injecting this sense of compassion into how all such incidents are dealt with no matter how efficient the system becomes it will continue to fail to deliver what people need Its time for the system to stop hiding behind red tape and legal loopholes and get serious about complaints
