Quite possibly youve noticed some new food labels out there like Not made with genetically modified ingredients or GMOfree You might have seen them on boxes of   or on   If youve shopped at Whole Foods that retailer   it now sells more than  products that have been certified as nonGMO But where does nonGMO food come from After all  percent of Americas corn and soybeans are genetically modified and producers of eggs milk and meat rely on those crops to feed their animals Soy oil and corn starch are used throughout the industry Can big food companies really avoid GMOs Looking for the answer I ended up at one of the first links in the nonGMO supply chain a corn processing facility just north of the small town of Cerro Gordo in westcentral Illinois Truckloads of corn arrive here and stop at the scale house where theyre weighed A remotecontrolled steel probe dives into each load and sucks out some grain for testing Thats all standard at any corn handling facility But at this processing plant operated by   theres one more test a quick fiveminute check to see if this corn contains specific proteins that are the signature of genetic modification Farmers have embraced these novel proteins they protect a growing cornstalk from some insects or weedkillers So at almost any corn processing facility in America this test would come up positive But here a positive test means rejection the truck has to turn around and leave Clarkson Grain only accepts GMOfree grain because thats what its customers want We dont tell people what their values should be We inquire and then we do our best to support those values says   the companys founder Clarkson has been in the grain business for  years He doesnt seem terribly excited about prices and profits but he loves to talk about relationships about the customers and suppliers whove stayed with him for decades or the telegram of thanks he got years ago after his first foreign deal That was the first compliment I had ever received in the grain business in  years he recalls Most of us want to make money but we also want to do something that somebody appreciates That story and the story of Lynn Clarksons company helps explain how American food companies can in fact go GMOfree in a world filled with GMOs And the story starts years ago long before any GMOs existed Lynn Clarkson was a smalltown grain dealer looking for new buyers for his corn He drove to Chicago to talk to food companies and he realized that they had a problem If you ask food processors anywhere in the world  percent of them will tell you theres too much variation in incoming raw materials he says The corn that these food processors were buying wasnt consistent Theyd cook it and get widely varying results Clarkson told them that this problem had a simple cause They were getting perhaps  different genetic types of corn in each shipment Clarkson also proposed a solution buying a single variety a single hybrid delivered at any one time so youre not mixing different cooking characteristics Clarkson set up a system that allowed him to deliver exactly that He signed contracts with farmers near his hometown of Cerro Gordo agreeing to pay them a little extra to supply specific corn hybrids or particular varieties of soybeans He delivered this uniform predictable grain to food companies first in Chicago and then to those appreciative foreign buyers  in particular in Japan When GMOs came on the scene about  years ago it turned out that his Japanese customers didnt want them Japanese food companies were suspicious of the new technology and didnt want to risk a hostile consumer reaction So Clarkson tweaked his supply chain to deliver what the Japanese wanted He made sure his farmers grew varieties that werent genetically engineered The nonGMO niche was born He wasnt the only one doing this Clarkson shows me on a wall map the concentration of farmers who supply the Japanese market Many are along the Illinois and Ohio rivers with easy access to ships heading toward Asia There are thousands of them and theyre now happy to supply customers in the US too US buyers often think that were starting from scratch with nonGMO grain Clarkson says Well were not Were starting from millions of bushels of demand that are in place and being satisfied on a regular basis for Asian clients Most of these farmers dont have any philosophical objection to genetic engineering In fact most of them grow both GMO and nonGMO crops Allen Williams who grows grain for Lynn Clarkson says the choice to grow nonGMO grain simply comes down to money Youre just trying to improve your profit he says Theres not a lot of ways to do that if youre growing commodities This is one way to do that Hell sell his nonGMO grain for  percent or  percent more than the standard market price But there are complications Some of the extra income gets eaten up by extra costs Hell spend more money on pesticides for instance for his nonGMO soybean fields He also has to make sure the grain he sends to Clarkson Grain doesnt contain any traces of his GMO crops So when he finishes harvesting one of his GMO fields he has to spend hours cleaning out his combine You know time is of the essence during harvest he says So to take time during harvest to clean out equipment and storage locations and transportation equipment is very expensive for a farmer Also because corn pollen blows in the wind he has to make sure his nonGMO fields of corn are a hundred feet from any GMO corn fields The separation doesnt always work perfectly But Lynn Clarkson says the food industry is pragmatic companies know that they have to tolerate small traces of GMOs It always comes down to How do you define GMOfree he says Whats the tolerance level If its zero we might as well have a drink and part friendly because we cant do business We cannot hit a zero standard People just need to know he says that in the US GMOfree means that something contains no more than  percent GMOs Demand for nonGMO grain is growing Lynn Clarkson has told farmers that hell buy about  percent more nonGMO grain next year At the companys modest offices beside the railroad tracks in the small town of Cerro Gordo Wyatt Muse is fielding calls and emails We have everything from the home survivalist wanting a gallon bucket for their basement up to people wanting a Panamax vessel to ship it into East Asia he says The latest query sitting on Muses desk is from a snack food company in Europe It wants nonGMO corn Were going to send one container next week and assuming they like the quality we would probably be doing a  to  containers over the next few months he says In the world of international grain trading thats still pretty small But theres a potential development that could transform this small niche market Clarkson says a surge in orders for animal feed A few poultry and egg producers already are going GMOfree if others do the same the nonGMO wave could turn into a tsunami
