Dr Barron Lerner is a doctor and the son of a doctor He grew up thinking his father was a wonderful gifted and caring physician which he was But after Lerner started studying bioethics he began questioning some of his fathers practices  practices which were typical of many doctors in the s There were times when his father would conceal information from his patient if he thought that was in the patients best interest there were times he didnt reveal that a patients cancer was terminal there were times in the era before donotresuscitate orders that his father would make that decision for a patient without consulting the family This kind of paternalism would be considered a breach of ethics now In Lerners new book   he compares his fathers approach to medicine with the bioethics that are applied today Lerner is a bioethicist historian of medicine and internist at NYUs School of Medicine Hes the author of several books and has contributed to     column Well The Atlantic and The Huffington Post His father Meyer Lerner was an infectious disease specialist and kept a journal in which he wrote about his medical experiences from  until Parkinsons disease ended his career in  Lerner drew on those diaries for his book He joins  s Terry Gross to discuss medical paternalism and the ethics of doctors treating their relatives Certainly throughout my career particularly in the years when I was training and subsequently I did see patients where I felt that resuscitation was inappropriate They were so endstage and in such suffering that it just seemed as my dad wouldve said inhumane to pound on their chest and break their ribs  These patients by and large get resuscitated We try these days  theres palliative care teams and all sorts of interventions  we try to talk to patients and families to really make them understand the situation but by and large most of the cases that Ive been involved with do get resuscitated His decisions were based on what I think he wouldve called knowing the patient incredibly well So he didnt have hard and fast rules In some cases when he felt that patients wanted the information and wanted to be involved in decisionmaking he would give the information But in other instances he sort of quietly decided not to or he parsed out information in various ways Again this was not uncommon in that era In fact oncologists routinely didnt tell patients they had cancer they used all sorts of euphemisms My dad rationalized this by his intense involvement with the patients and their lives and their families He felt indeed that it was his duty as a doctor to obtain the information that would help him guide their decisions He felt for example just telling patients what they had and what their options were was a dereliction of his duty as a doctor This was all about doctors doing the best for their patients Patients were supposed to cooperate There was a sort of a contract and if you do what we tell you to do were going to do the best we can do to get you better And indeed people believe that patients who followed their doctors orders did better because they were doing what they were supposed to do I think theres a consensus these days that its a bad idea to treat your family members Theres all sorts of potential problems there First thing youre not going to be as objective as you otherwise might be Youve got an emotional attachment to these folks and they have an emotional attachment to you Its pretty hard to imagine a family member saying no to their relative who is their doctor Most ethics organizations or people who have weighed in on this say that its OK to be interested in your family maybe give them some advice guide them to other doctors but to actually be involved in the daytoday care youre probably not going to give them the best care and theres just an inherent conflict of interest there I generally do tell them I give them a lot of caveats I will tell them Look pay attention to the other options Im telling you And if I do have an opinion  sometimes its a toss of a coin I suppose  but if I do have an opinion Ill tell them and Ill explain why and I will remind them to not do it simply because Im telling them that its my opinion But they really I hope will consider all the options I think my wife and I are on the same page about not being aggressive at the end of life We did living wills and advance directives I think many years ago once we had kids I think Ive certainly in the hospital seen enough endstage suffering to be very much where my dad was for much of his life in saying that its good to have thought about these things and to try to set some limits because it makes it easier for your family members if youve articulated these things And in a sense it made it easier for me with my dad at the end because he had talked about these things for so long and for so many years  I feel comfortable saying that if I get a severe illness and theres no chance of any sort of recovery that I would not want aggressive measures done
