A spice commonly found in curries may boost the brains ability to heal itself according to a report in the journal Stem Cell Research and Therapy  The German study suggests a compound found in turmeric could encourage the growth of nerve cells thought to be part of the brains repair kit Scientists say this work based in rats may pave the way for future drugs for strokes and Alzheimers disease  But they say more trials are needed to see whether this applies to humans Researchers from the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine in Julich Germany studied the effects of aromaticturmerone  a compound found naturally  in turmeric  Rats were injected with the compound and their brains were then scanned  Particular parts of the brain known to be involved in nerve cell growth were seen to be more active after the aromaticturmerone infusion  Scientists say the compound may encourage a proliferation of brain cells  In a separate part of the trial researchers bathed rodent neural stem cells NSCs in different concentrations of aromatictumerone extract  NSCs have the ability to transform into any type of brain cell and scientists suggest they could have a role in repair after damage or disease Dr Maria Adele Rueger who was part of the research team said In humans and higher developed animals their abilities do not seem to be sufficient to repair the brain but in fish and smaller animals they seem to work well The research found the higher the concentration of  aromaticturmerone the greater the growth of the NSCs And the cells bathed in the turmeric compound seemed to specialise into certain types of brain cells more rapidly too  Dr Rueger added It is interesting that it might be possible to boost the effectiveness of the stem cells with aromaticturmerone  And it is possible this in turn can help boost repair in the brain She is now considering whether human trials may be feasible Dr Laura Phipps at the charity Alzheimers Research UK said It is not clear whether the results of this research would translate to people or whether the ability to generate new brain cells in this way would benefit people with Alzheimers disease  Wed need to see further studies to fully understand this compounds effects in the context of a complex disease like Alzheimers and until then people shouldnt take this as a sign to stock up on supplies of turmeric for the spice rack Aromaticturmerone is the lesserstudied of two major compounds in turmeric that may have an effect on the human body  Previous studies suggest the other compound curcumin could reduce inflammation in the body and have anticancer benefits
