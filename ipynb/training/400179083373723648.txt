Images of the swath of devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the central Philippines are reminiscent of the tsunamis aftermath a decade ago in Banda Aceh Indonesia And indeed the World Health Organization grades the great typhoon of  as a category  disaster  its most severe category The scale of the typhoons damage is huge Dr Richard Brennan of the World Health Organization tells Shots Its monumental This is one of the biggest emergencies weve dealt with for some time Brennan the WHOs director of emergency risk management and humanitarian response ticks off the grim metrics And yet as bad as it is Brennan and others say the tally of killed and injured will fall far short of the   which killed around  people in  countries or the   who perished in the Haitian earthquake of  Theres little doubt that Typhoon Haiyan known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda will go down as one of the deadliest and most destructive weather events ever recorded  a   of surge very high winds and torrential rains Haiyans sustained winds reached an estimated  to  mph    than Hurricane Katrina In Haiyans wake the relief effort must deal with an enormous zone of destruction making it very difficult to get food water temporary shelter and medical supplies and personnel to millions in need Logistically I think it will be a more challenging response than the early days of the Haitian earthquake Brennan says He says the Philippine government has put out a plea for portable field hospitals Germany and Japan are in the process of deploying them and Australia will send medical response teams Thats just the beginning of the international medical relief that may be necessary Brennan says the most immediate health concerns are tetanus and untreated injuries that pose a risk of infection In the next days and weeks poor sanitation and overcrowding pose a high risk of diarrheal and respiratory diseases Those who have survived this disaster are going to suffer from dehydration starvation and diseases that have to do with lack of access to clean water says   a disaster medical relief specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who spent months in posttsunami Indonesia and responded to the Haitian quake The most common problem will be death due to dehydration from diarrhea That risk is not expected to be from cholera but from more common pathogens such as   Cranmer says The Philippines has done quite a good job in handling cholera so I dont anticipate that to be a problem Later in the recovery period theres a risk of other infections such as measles especially if vaccination campaigns are disrupted tetanus rabies meningitis and even polio Polio has been eliminated in the Philippines but we thought it was eliminated in   too Cranmer tells Shots And of course everyday medical needs and problems will need attention  dialysis patients heart attack victims women giving birth The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs   there are  pregnant women in the typhoon zone Brennan says  percent of those births can be expected to involve complications But the Philippines has some advantages compared to Indonesia and Haiti The sprawling archipelago has a better medical and public health infrastructure Brennan says A hint of that is readily apparent in the Web postings of the Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council    that Cranmer calls unbelievable in their detail The Philippines is not the lowest of the low Cranmer says In fact they do quite well  on some indicators better than the States do In yesterdays report for instance you can find pages of known injured and killed Filipinos listed by name  such as a yearold man in Quezon named John Erwin Orriza Capuno who was killed by a falling tree while riding his motorcycle or yearold Ofilia Laurella of Capiz who suffered cardiac arrest due to panic while evacuating at the height of Typhoon Yolanda Other logs describe lost and damaged houses road closures and numbers of displaced people down to the village level One thing that has improved over the decade since the Indian Ocean tsunami is the technology of postdisaster communications Satellite phones carry messages initially and cellphone towers are put back into service as soon as possible Texting is an important new tool for assessing the situation locating people and supplies and coordinating deployments We have much better graphics and much better mapping capacity Brennan says We can see much more quickly and concretely where the needs are where the resources are and where new incoming teams should be better deployed Now do some needs go unmet for a period of time Certainly he adds But thats less than it used to be in large part because were much better at information management
