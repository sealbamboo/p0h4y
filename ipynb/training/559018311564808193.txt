As a nurse who works in AE I run on fear I take no breaks spend  hours without going to the toilet and go home in tears each night Or thats what I hear Except this fractured picture that is painted daily is not what I recognise as my life or at least not the full story Every day I get up and as I drink the coffee that will help me through my shift I watch on TV as people debate our weaknesses and politicians engage in pointscoring arguments that fail to produce a solution I read blogs from staff such as myself relishing their opportunity to finally say Yes its awful were drowning in drunks fenced in by bed blocking I go to work Its busy At times its overwhelming Cubicles are full Sometimes patients are put wherever theres space Its undignified and imperfect and despite being beyond my control it makes me ashamed But every one of those patients knows their plan of care has had a cup of tea a repeat set of observations and a friendly face My feet hurt and my jobs list is never ending but I get my breaks We care for each other as well as our patients After a bad resus call we debrief we make the time to give each other two minutes to our tears The Kings Fund recently published   Much of what is discussed  decreased district nurses outdated scheduling of GP care reduced social care  is beyond the control of individual AE departments We cannot in the shortterm change the context in which we work but we can control aspects of our response to it In our department this includes a forthcoming   to better direct people to more appropriate services improving links with primary care and plans to offer brief alcohol advice in the hope of reducing future attendances Despite the dark looming clouds there are still chinks of light in my day For every drunk person who monopolises my time there is someone we help who wouldnt have been reached if we didnt exist For every angry person who shouts about the wait time to have their sore throat looked at there is a wealth of understanding from the general public who know we are doing the best we can Time is still found to hold the hand of a dying patient to comfort a loved one to make a frightened child laugh to be the one person who listens to someone affected by mental illhealth These moments are a privilege and still happen even when its busy even when while doing so my mind races with all the other tasks I need to do Of course more staff would be useful and the independentlyrecommended   would be welcomed but surely we can simultaneously voice this while celebrating the positives of our job Yes there is the risk of burnout and mass exodus of staff but the constant talk of this alone may be a selffulfilling prophecy Every day I work in an organisation I am passionate about Every shift I do something that makes a difference I am proud to be part of this team How many people can say that about their job We are doing what we do in undoubtedly pressing circumstances but are for the most part continuing to do it There is no doubt in my mind that we and the failings of the current system are being used as a tool in an ideological war By joining in we serve only to shore up that war This health service of ours is precious and we need to start caring for it as such This includes not contributing onesidedly to the broken NHS rhetoric
