If the prestigious Institute of Medicine pays attention to your disease thats usually considered a good thing But some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome fear that the review of the condition by the institute an independent organization that advises the government on health issues might perpetuate the widespread belief that their condition is purely psychological The controversy begins with the name Everyone experiences fatigue and lots of people are tired most of the time But longstanding fatigue is just one of many debilitating symptoms There are many people  scientists clinicians advocates  who believe the name chronic fatigue syndrome does harm to patients said   a deputy assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services I agree Lee spoke at a meeting Monday in Washington DC to launch the IOM review That harm includes trivializing the condition and a chilling effect on highquality research patients say A far more serioussounding name myalgic encephalomyelitis is used in other parts of the world and is increasingly being adopted in the United States For the review both the IOM and HHS are referring to the condition as MECFS The IOM panel is being asked to  on the best way to diagnose the disorder It will also consider whether the name should be changed Core to the diagnosis patients and doctors who specialize in the disorder say is a physical and mental crash of extreme exhaustion and ill feeling after even mild exercise requiring days to weeks of recovery The official term is postexertional malaise Sleep disturbance also affects nearly all patients who typically wake up unrefreshed no matter how long they sleep Muscle and joint pain and problems with thinking concentration and memory are also nearly universal Other common symptoms include gastrointestinal problems dizziness heat or cold intolerance sore throat and swollen lymph nodes The syndrome often follows a viral illness and many patients can pinpoint exactly when their symptoms began No blood test has been developed to diagnose it although researchers are  on that Current treatments address the symptoms and not the underlying disease believed to affect about  million children and adults in the US Several definitions have been published over the years But because most focus primarily on the fatigue people with other fatiguing conditions like depression have probably been included in studies And that advocates say has yielded misleading conclusions about the disorder particularly that exercise and psychological treatments are effective And if the IOM panel relies on those studies in redefining the disease some patients say it could lead the group to give it a psychological diagnosis which could perpetuate the stigma and limit the medical care they receive Patients already have a hard time getting care according to Carol Head CEO of the   She presented findings of a survey from  of her organizations members Twothirds reported that it took more than a year to get a diagnosis and most saw more than four doctors before receiving the diagnosis Over and over again patients told us stories of delayed diagnosis lack of treatment a need to educate the doctor increased disability and even hostility due to physician lack of knowledge and empathy she said How the IOM defines MECFS will affect research clinical trials health policy and treatment according to patient advocate   The stakes are very very high and thats why the controversy is so high she said Some patients and physicians say the United States should simply adopt a   written by a Canadian panel in  because it requires that a person have malaise after exertion as well as other core symptoms That way some patients suggest the  million designated for the IOM review could be used instead to fund biomedical studies The annual federal research budget for the condition is  million to  million But Head is hopeful that the IOMs effort will make a difference The credibility and authority of this IOM committee is important to making MECFS widely recognized and diagnosed she said And that will help the  million Americans who struggle with this serious illness
