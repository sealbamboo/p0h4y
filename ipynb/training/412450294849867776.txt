In October Maja Djukic was rollerblading in Greenwich Conn when she heard a woman screaming for help Ms Djukic an assistant professor at New York University College of Nursing rushed to a nearby house to find monthold Griffin Greene limp and blue He had inhaled a Goldfish cracker and his mothers attempts to dislodge it by holding the toddler upside down and slapping his back had failed While the childs father called  Ms Djukic performed chest compressions she recalled in an interview By the time the ambulance arrived  about four minutes later  Griffin was breathing again and crying Although he needed treatment to extract the cracker which had become lodged in his lungs Griffin is now fine thanks to the quick action of a passerby Not every child who chokes is so lucky Choking is the fourthleading cause of unintentional deaths in children under age  every five days at least one child dies after choking on food The trachea or windpipe of a young child is about the width of a drinking straw and if food or a small object is inhaled instead of swallowed it can block the airway Even when something is swallowed and becomes lodged in a childs throat or esophagus it may compress the trachea enough to impair breathing After just four minutes without oxygen a childs brain can be permanently damaged Even though both of Griffins parents were with him when this neartragedy occurred neither knew what to do to save him Few parents of newborns are taught how to prevent choking and what to do if it occurs Yet infants and toddlers routinely explore the world with their mouths and anything they may find lying about can become a choking hazard Nearly every day I see a statistic in the making among small children in my neighborhood Under the care of a parent grandparent or nanny they are routinely given all manner of snacks and allowed to run back to their activities  while still chewing It is a disaster waiting to happen and sometimes I cant resist saying aloud that the child should not get up until his food has been thoroughly chewed and his mouth is empty A child should not eat in a moving vehicle either If the driver stops short or the vehicle is bumped from behind the sudden lurch may cause a child to inhale food or to swallow it unchewed Food accounts for  percent of pediatric choking cases according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Any food can become a choking hazard The   cites hot dogs meats sausages fish with bones cheese cubes popcorn chips pretzel nuggets hard candy gum lollipops jelly beans marshmallows whole grapes raw vegetables cherry tomatoes nuts peanut butter especially eaten from a spoon or on soft bread and even ice cubes Many parents now know that grapes should be halved for a young child but fewer realize that a hot dog should be cut lengthwise for a child until at least age  Better yet skip nutritionally questionable hot dogs altogether Parents should wait to introduce pured food until after  months of age when motor skills for swallowing are better developed Always supervise meals and snacks when babies and children feed themselves But nearly a third of choking cases in children are caused by objects The pediatrics society lists these among the most common offenders coins buttons marbles small balls deflated balloons watch batteries jewelry pen caps paper clips arts and crafts supplies small toys and detachable toy parts Toys and games that are safe for an older sibling may not be for a younger brother or sister Always check packaging for age recommendations and keep toys meant for older children away from younger ones And while it may be hard to believe   It is critical to know what to do if a child appears to be choking If the child can cough speak or cry the airway is not completely blocked Encourage the child to cough and if that fails to dislodge the object call  Caregivers should always have a cellphone on hand If a choking baby can make little or no sound ask someone to call  if you are alone attempt a rescue for two minutes before calling  Place the baby face down over your arm with the head lower than the chest and support the babys head with your hand Then give five quick blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of the other hand If no object is dislodged turn the baby faceup on a firm surface place two fingers in the middle of the breastbone just below the nipples and give five quick thrusts Repeat this sequence until the baby begins breathing or help arrives If breathing is not restored within a few minutes begin CPR see box For a child over  who is choking stand or kneel behind the child and wrap your arms around her Make a fist and place it just above the navel Grasp the fist with the other hand and make quick upward thrusts with it Repeat until the object is dislodged or the child begins breathing Any child who required a choking rescue should be examined by a physician afterward A baby or child who cannot breathe and loses consciousness  because of choking an accident or any other reason  will need CPR modified for the young If you are alone perform CPR for two minutes before stopping to call  The American Heart Association sells kits to teach caregivers how to perform CPR on infants and children as well as on adults Each costs  and includes a mannequin on which users can practice Go to   Click on CPR  EEC at the top of the screen and follow
