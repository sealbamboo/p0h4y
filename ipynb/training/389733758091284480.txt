The viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine which means they cannot cause infection The vaccine batches are then tested with a group of people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or salt water The only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot the CDC found There were no differences in terms of body aches fever cough runny nose or sore throat Still some people feel bad after a flu shot Soreness at the injection site is one reason but it usually dissipates within two days Its caused by the immune system making antibodies to the killed viruses in the vaccine that help a person fight off the flu The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says symptoms in rare instances include fever muscle pain and discomfort or weakness which also typically go away after a day or two And though a flu shot wont give you the flu its protection doesnt kick in for two weeks from the time of injection During that time you are vulnerable In addition its easy to confuse seasonal flu for an illness caused by a number of other pathogens including rhinovirus Or you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the vaccine Finally the flu shot does not always work  particularly among the elderly and people with weak immune systems But even among these highrisk groups the vaccine can prevent complications No The shot lasts an entire flu season except for some children who may need two doses The CDC recommends that all people older than  months get a flu vaccine No The flu vaccine is an essential element of prenatal care and is recommended for all pregnant women according to the  Pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia infections and dehydration Though babies cannot be vaccinated until they have reached  months of age antibodies they received in utero from their mothers may help protect them But note that the group recommends against the nasal spray  the live attenuated version  for pregnant women The  says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies No Seasonal flu exacts a bigger toll in some years than in others Between  and  the flu was linked to a low of  to as many as  fatalities in the United States with more than  hospitalizations There are two main reasons The viruses that circulate in one year may differ from those that circulate in another And of course people change from year to year meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another It doesnt work all the time but it does confer some level of protection For example  says preliminary data for the  season show that it was about  effective for all age groups combined and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to
