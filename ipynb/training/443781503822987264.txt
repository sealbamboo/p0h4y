The particular assortment of microbes in the digestive system may be an important factor in the inflammatory bowel condition known as Crohns disease Research involving more than  patients found that people with   had less diverse populations of gut microbes This basically for the first time identifies what might be the bacterial changes in patients with Crohns disease says   of Masssachusetts General Hospital in Boston who led the work More than a million Americans suffer from Crohns which seems to start when an overreactive immune system causes abdominal pain diarrhea bleeding weight loss and other symptoms Many patients have to take powerful steroids which can have serious sideeffects and some have parts of the digestive tract surgically removed Mounting evidence has suggested that microbes living in the gut might contribute to the problem So Xavier and his colleagues compared the species of bacteria in more than  Crohns patients to the mix of microbes in more than  healthy people In their   published in the journal   the researchers detailed the clear difference they discovered The patients with Crohns seemed to have too many of the sorts of bacteria that rile immune systems In addition to having less diversity in their gut microbes Xavier says the Crohns patients had fewer bacteria that have been associated with reduced inflammation and more bacteria associated with increased inflammation The findings were confirmed in  Crohns patients from other studies Interestingly children whose doctors had tried to treat their Crohns symptoms with antibiotics before they were properly diagnosed had a mix of microbes that was the most out of whack We may have to revisit the use of antibiotics in these patients with earlyonset Crohns disease Xavier says Instead doctors might eventually do better to identify and prescribe treatments that mimic the helpful bacteria he says along with foods or other pharmaceutical agents that reduce or counteract the harmful bacteria Theres the possibility that we might be able to identify some sort of super  that might be able to correct the gut back to the healthy state Xavier says UCLA pathologist   who studies microbial ecology says the paper offers important first insights into illnesses beyond Crohns Other diseases are thought to be driven at least in part by bacteria he says such as some inflammatory and autoimmune disorders Bacteria may also be involved in obesity Humans should work harder to understand bacteria Braun says and live with them when theyre helping us or get them to   when they are causing harm
