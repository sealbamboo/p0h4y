A health care worker in Texas who cared for Ebola patient   has been confirmed to have the virus according to the Centers for Disease Control The head of the CDC says the infection stems from a breach in protocol that officials are working to identify The worker helped treat Duncan during his second stay at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital officials say Duncan   The case is the first instance of an Ebola infection being transmitted inside the US The new patient a woman is not being identified   that shes a nurse citing an official familiar with the case The worker reported a low fever Friday night and went to the hospital a blood sample was sent for testing at the state public health laboratory in Austin The preliminary result was released late Saturday The CDC has announced that its followup tests on the patients blood confirm that she has Ebola Our hearts really do go out to the patient in Dallas and her family says Dr David Lakey commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services He added that the health care worker did what was appropriate in coming in for a blood test after noticing symptoms Lakey said the woman is not among the  people who were identified as having had potential contact with Thomas Eric Duncan before he was put in an isolation unit That group which includes some health workers is still being monitored Lakey said adding that none have shown signs of being infected Speaking by phone at a the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention news conference Lakey said that officials in Dallas are working to ensure they understand how the virus was transmitted in the new case to improve health workers procedures Responding to questions Dr Tom Frieden the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the worker hasnt identified a specific moment that might have led to the breach Both health officials also said theyre confident the virus will be contained saying they would break the chain of transmission I firmly believe that were going to stop this here Lakey said referring to the Dallas hospital Were deeply concerned by the emergence of a second Ebola case in Dallas says Dr Tom Frieden speaking at a CDC news conference in Atlanta He said the agency is carrying out a second test Sunday to confirm or disprove the patients initial positive test result for Ebola At some point there was a breach in protocol Frieden said of the new case which then resulted in the infection Frieden said that so far the level of Ebola in the patients system is low He said that after extensive interviews with the patient experts have determined that only one person may have had contact with her when she may have been infectious Frieden said they are evaluating other potential exposures Frieden went on to outline several steps health agencies are undertaking with a focus on protocols that will prevent the spread of Ebola They include a review of the protective gear he said noting that putting on more materials isnt always a guarantee that the level of risk will fall The CDC chief said that removing gear is a particularly critical process in preventing an Ebola infection In another highprofile Ebola case thats ongoing Teresa Romero the nurse who contracted Ebola in Spain after treating an infected patient has said she may have touched her face as she was removing her protective gear Asked whether the worker treated Duncan on his first or second visit to the hospital last month Dr Dan Varga the chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources the hospitals parent company says it was on the second visit He spoke at a Sunday morning news conference about the new Ebola case Varga said that all of the health care workers are following CDC precautions He added that the worker had been wearing protective gear when treating Duncan including a gown gloves mask and shield The new patient had been working up until two days ago Varga said Varga added that officials are confident in the measures theyve taken to protect health care workers As an added precaution Texas Health Presbyterian will not provide emergency services instead ambulances will be sent to other hospitals The worker had been selfmonitoring after caring for Duncan Varga says a process that included taking ones own temperature twice a day The worker was admitted to an isolation unit at the hospital immediately after arriving The entire process from the patients selfmonitoring to the admission into isolation took less than  minutes Varga said He added that the patients condition is currently listed as stable A close contact has also been proactively placed in isolation he said At the news conference Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the patients house has been decontaminated and access to it is being controlled by police He added that neighbors have been contacted in a doortodoor campaign as well as by phone Officials of the Texas department of health urged people not to panic stressing that Ebola can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated by an infected person On the question of how contagious Ebola is   recently noted Even in the current epidemic in West Africa where the virus has been out of control each person who has gotten sick has spread Ebola to only about two others on average No details about the patient were released with officials citing the workers wish for privacy The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta will perform further tests to confirm the diagnosis We knew a second case could be a reality and weve been preparing for this possibility said Dr David Lakey commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services in the statement We are broadening our team in Dallas and working with extreme diligence to prevent further spread Officials are identifying the patients contacts and will monitor them based on the nature of their interactions with the patient Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and is not contagious before patients show symptoms such as fever The worker helped care for Duncan the yearold who contracted Ebola in Liberia and flew to Texas on Sept  He first developed symptoms on Sept  Duncan died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday
