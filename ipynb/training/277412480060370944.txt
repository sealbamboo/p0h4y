Most people pay more attention to the muscles on the front of the body than the ones on the back, leaving them hunched and their shoulders prone to injury.. The reverse fly, demonstrated by celebrity trainer Harley Pasternak and featured on his "Harley's Hollywood Workout" video game, is a great way to balance your strength, giving you better definition and posture.. The exercise strengthens the rhomboid muscles in your upper back and rear deltoids in the backs of your shoulders.. Start by standing with your arms at your sides and feet apart. Push your hips back as you hinge forward, bringing your hands (with or without light weights) in front of your thighs.. Keeping your back in a straight line, extend your arms up and out to the sides in line with your shoulders with the palms facing in. Return to the starting position.. Do 15 repetitions of the exercise, working up to three sets of 15.
