He liked to joke around with his neighbors And he always gave them a helping hand The neighbors that Thomas Eric Duncans generous spirit is what cost him his life Duncan  was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first to die of the disease on American soil He likely contracted the disease in Liberia when he carried a pregnant woman sick with Ebola into her house after no clinic would admit her That was just before Sept  when Duncan flew from Monrovia to Dallas with stopovers in Brussels and Washington DC He was traveling to Texas to visit his fiancee and son His relatives insist he didnt know hed been exposed to Ebola when he boarded that fateful flight to the United States In East Monrovia where Duncan rented a room he was known as Eric And he was wellliked by his neighbors Eric is a nice man says yearold Irene Seyou who lived next door He aint got a problem with nobody She saw him carry the landlords pregnant daughter into her house just days before he left for the United States The girl was bleeding profusely from her mouth and could no longer walk says Seyou Eric helped the family she says He carried her inside The pregnant woman died of Ebola the next day Three other members of her family died from the disease soon after Yesterday the girls father was lying on the porch of the house barely able to lift himself from a mat his eyes bloodshot in what Ebola doctors refer to as black and red Sweat glistened across his cheeks Duncan did not know hed been exposed to Ebola by the pregnant woman says his brotherinlaw John Lewis The family said that the girl did not die from Ebola they continued to say it until they went and buried this girl says Lewis Around the corner from where he lived Duncans family runs a small restaurant and shop where he often used to eat As word spread that Duncan had died neighbors gathered in flimsy plastic chairs outside the shop to console each other Some of the mourners were angry A young man blasted the Liberian government for threatening to prosecute Duncan for checking No on an exit form about whether hed had any exposure to Ebola Instead of praying that this guy did not die from this disease and they are saying theyll prosecute him Im disappointed in the government he said This man one of Duncans neighbors didnt want his name used out of fear that the government will in his words hunt him down for his comments Hes equally critical of the US government asking why the American citizens treated for Ebola in the US have survived but the one Liberian treated there did not Why is that they couldnt save the brothers life he asks Why is that they didnt save Eric
