A computer programmer and a kid in a Batman suit walk into a pancake house  It sounds like a joke but it really happened and now the programmer     has a   to bring to market Its an app to help seniors talk to their doctors about medical care Like all great health care breakthroughs it happened at the International House of Pancakes he says halfjokingly Venture capitalists are pouring more money than ever into digital health startups  more than  billion so far   according to the venture capital firm Rock Health These investors are betting that entrepreneurs can help doctors hospitals and insurers become leaner  which the Affordable Care Act strongly encourages Vockells endeavor started back in April when Medicare released a huge database detailing how much it   The government health plan   had kept that payment information secret for decades So when Medicare suddenly dumped an entire years worth of data finally making public millions of transactions coders like Vockell tried to figure out how to make it useful for seniors Enter the IHOP My kids go there after school one day for the funny face pancake lunch he says There were lots of seniors there And my kids run around and the seniors love when they come up and sit with them Thats when it hit him Vockell says I could totally use my kids to source a whole bunch of interviews pretty fast His yearold in a Batman suit proved a great icebreaker over a lot of pancakes  seniors told Vockell that knowing which doctors charge more and which charge less wouldnt necessarily send them shopping for the lowest price Seniors generally like their doctors and dont want to shop for new ones But many in the pancake house that day did tell Vockell that they had some medical procedures on the horizon and werent sure what the procedures would cost entail or require of them Id love to get some insight into that they told him They also asked Could you make the print really big Vockell says And several added he says with a laugh The blueberry syrup is magnificent So Vockell developed a website that helps seniors understand the procedures their doctors are recommending and the costs  so they can start conversations with their doctors The site also helps users print out the information in really big type Its too early to say whether his product will be the hot new topic on the shuffleboard circuit but it was a winner at the big   conference this month in Washington DC Big data on health care is the raw material for a whole new segment of the information technology sector Entrepreneurs like   are also exploiting databases such as the price list that Medicare released this spring Thats hot he says Anytime anybody releases a new set of data we get excited Powers company   is founded on the idea that software engineers can find ways to use big data to save the government or large companies money  and that such organizations will share some of their savings with him Theres a lot of opportunity in streamlining health care Power says Its a great time to be starting a company in the health care data space he says I think the gold rush is on Just like in a real gold rush hitting pay dirt requires a lot of prospecting Entrepreneurs cant always find the information they really need to make a truly useful product  is with a startup called   This firms big idea is to help families estimate future health care spending So you could type in that Grandpa has hypertension Mom has diabetes and one of the kids has asthma and then get some idea of how much thats all going to cost  and maybe even shop for the best price A great idea Alvi says but he adds Each patient is very different And so in order to be able to make a meaningful prediction you have to have a lot of data so you can say that patients just like this went through these problems as they moved through the medical system Thats really where it requires hundreds of millions of data points And not even close to the millions of data points that Alvis company needs are available yet A lot of information about procedures cost and effectiveness remains locked up inside insurance company computers or in hospitals and doctors medical records  information that insurers hospitals and doctors dont want to share
