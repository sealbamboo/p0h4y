After an American GI is wounded in combat his or her life depends on the speed of evacuation the degree to which blood loss can be stanched and the skill with which military surgeons can clean patch and stitch But it also depends on a factor thats even harder to predict especially when a wound has been inflicted on foreign soil and in the fog of war the microorganisms  viruses bacteria and fungi  that find their way into the service members wound and take up residence there New research suggests that physicians treating future US troops and perhaps those treating some of todays wounded warriors may be able to take a fast and thorough census of the microorganisms living in a combat wound and tailor their treatment accordingly The result could mean not only speedier and more thorough healing but fewer limbs  and lives  lost to postsurgical infection For civilians suffering from traumatic injury burns diabetic sores and other complex wounds the new research may also prove lifesaving In a study published online in the   and slated for the journals July print edition a group of physicians microbiologists geneticists and technology experts describe a system capable of comparing the DNA of microorganisms colonizing a wound with a vast library of stored viral bacterial and fungal genetic sequences A research team from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory UC Davis and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences evaluated  wound samples from  US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan Within  hours of a tissue samples arrival at Lawrence Livermore the system of microarrays described in the research was able to sort through some  microorganisms that had previously been genetically sequenced to find matches for microbes thriving in a wound The research was funded by the Defense Departments Medical Research and Development Program If such a system of computerized genetic interrogation could be made fast economical and widely available it would mark a radical change from current practice Currently the microbes in burns and traumatic wounds are painstakingly collected and one by one cultured in a dish so that physicians can guess at which antibiotics or antifungals might prove useful Not all microbes are so easily grown in a lab and thus go undetected But a microbes DNA fingerprint captured on a chip wont elude detection By identifying a wounds colony of microbes faster and more thoroughly and by potentially tracking a colonys shifting composition the microbial detection array developed at Lawrence Livermore could guide the use of targeted antimicrobial medicines to drive down infection and even promote healing the authors said Study coauthor Dr Eric Elster professor and chairman of the Uniformed Services Universitys surgery department said the method of determining which microbes are present in a wound is a century old It is far too crude to allow inferences to be drawn about the roles that particular strains may play in promoting healing or the chronic inflammatory response that can impede it he said And for those wounded in combat its a particularly clunky method of gleaning information that could guide better treatment Over the last decade alone fatalities among troops wounded in combat have fallen from nearly  to about  despite wounds that are more serious and extensive Elster said who said that the injury patterns that we are presented with are among the most complex and challenging seen in modern medicine The treatment of infection in these patients requires innovative care he said Studies such as this one will allow us to better understand the interaction between the body and pathogens and develop new treatment strategies A growing body of research has begun to demonstrate that the diverse populations of microorganisms that coexist in our guts on our skin in our mouths and around the genitals are not just incubators of infection but a competing and everchanging mix of good and bad microbes more complex than long believed In that vein the researchers sought to detect classes of microorganisms that were present in wounds that heal readily and others that signal a wound will require more aggressive care While the sample of wounds was small and the findings preliminary the authors found that when bacteria such as the   species and   which are common hospitalrelated infections were present in wound samples they were less likely to heal well By contrast the robust presence of bacteria often related to the gastrointestinal system such as   and strains of the   species were associated more frequently with wounds that did heal well Livermore Labs microbiologist Nicholas Be the lead author of the study said the preliminary finding fell far short of suggesting that adding certain bacteria to a patients wound could promote healing But it certainly is an indication that tracking or manipulating the bacterial population of wounds might come into play in a patients treatment Were trying to create a more informative diagnostic  one that might allow personalizing treatment to an individual with extensive burns or wounds that are massive or heal slowly Be said
