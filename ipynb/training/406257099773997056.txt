December  is as it has been every year since  World Aids Day  Much progress has been made but in this weeks Scrubbing Up Chris Beyrer presidentelect of the International Aids Society and Michel Kazatchkine the UN Secretary Generals Special Envoy for HIVAids in Eastern Europe and Central Asia warn that we are at a turning point in the fight against the disease  They are cochairs of the Nobody left Behind campaign an International Aids Society initiative  Living in Paris in  Andre was a drug user with no hope of access to an effective treatment for HIV since there was none and no access to harm reduction since it did not exist   She had lost her friends and family she was stigmatised  and she ultimately died a lonely death after a few months in a hospice  Larissa from Kaliningrad in Russia started antiretroviral treatment late in her HIV disease and only because of her privileged contacts but had no hope of treatment for her hepatitis C  She had been rejected by friends neighbours and family She too was stigmatised  and she had been repeatedly arrested and incarcerated   But Larissas story is from  not   While  years has passed in the circumstances of these two women their predicament was depressingly tragically the same    How this can possibly be so in a period when so much progress has been made  We seem to have come full circle and now have to face what will certainly be an uncomfortable truth for many of us working in the sector we have made very little if any progress in getting prevention and treatment  to those groups of  people most vulnerable to HIVAids wherever they are  These groups people who inject drugs transgender people and men who have sex with men They make up the majority of those affected by the epidemic except in subSaharan Africa where they also make up an increasing share of infections in urban settings Against a backdrop of some truly extraordinary responses to the global HIVAIDS epidemic over the past  years it is both painful but necessary to acknowledge that the response for these groups remains so often a  story of indifference and neglect  Indeed we can compare our failure to adequately address these issues to the situation that prevailed in  At that time effective HIV drugs had been available in rich countries for years but were inaccessible in developing and emerging economies because of cost   Today cost is not the primary obstacle we have drugs and we have proven interventions  Rather it is economic social and political obstacles that prevent them from being made available to those who need them most We have plenty to be immensely proud about the global response to HIVAids antiretroviral treatment has been provided to m people in developing countries with notable success in Africa where  of people in urgent need of these medicines now have access to them something unthinkable just a few years ago  As a result at a global level we are seeing steadily declining rates of new HIV infections a third fewer in  than in    Around  million people died of Aids in  down from m in     Of the  countries that have achieved a  reduction in the rate of new HIV infections in the last  years more than half are in subSaharan Africa  The successes are due to factors such as some extraordinary advocacy from civil society activists and community mobilisation courageous and compassionate political leadership and remarkable advances in science and technology which have enabled new drugs and tests to reach parts of the developing world at unprecedented speed and relatively low cost This is the Aids response that has generated extraordinary hope sort of hope we see reflected in recent headlines that predict the end of Aids or a world without HIV or the possibility of an Aidsfree generation in our lifetimes Sadly however this is not the whole story  One can draw upon an almost infinite supply of statistics that tell the true picture for those most affected by the epidemic in low and middleincome countries men who have sex with men and female sex workers are  and  times more likely to have HIV respectively than the rest of the population  Men who have sex with men alone account for more than  of new infections in China and projections indicate that this group could make up half or more of all new infections in Asia by   The fuel for these figures for the lives being adversely affected are the recurring  themes of stigma and discrimination at the social cultural and political levels Public health access for these groups is being driven underground there are repressive government drug policies which advocate criminalisation over public health and there is a failure and unwillingness of too many governments to base health policy on the scientific evidence before them Growing urbanisation and the accompanying movement of marginalised groups to cities seeking to explore their sexuality and increased freedom of cultural expression is having an impact So too is the transition of many developing countries into middle income status  accompanied by increasing economic and social disparities as well as the sudden ineligibility for  crucial Global Fund finance that was previously the backbone of the national HIVAids response Quite simply we are at a turning point And if we are honest with ourselves we ought to admit  that we are somewhat in disarray  We dont know quite what it is that we should do  Here we are we have all the technology we have extraordinary scientific progress and we just cannot translate that into making a difference in these populations But it is abundantly clear that there is an urgent need for rethink of how we approach the epidemic  A failure to do so will mean that there is a serious risk that Aids will become more and more concentrated everywhere  And that means we will not be able to end Aids
