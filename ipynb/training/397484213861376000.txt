The average teenage boy is likely to have an interest in chicken only when it hits his dinner plate But after a trip to Israel for his sisters bat mitzvah Jack Millman came back to New York wondering whether the higher costs of kosher foods were justified Most consumers perceive of kosher foods as being healthier or cleaner or somehow more valuable than conventional foods and I was interested in whether they were in fact getting what they were paying for said Mr Millman  and a senior at the Horace Mann School in New York City That question started him on a yearlong research project to compare the prevalence of antibioticresistant E coli bacteria on four types of chickens those raised conventionally organically without antibiotics and those slaughtered under kosher rules Every other week for  weeks I would go and spend the entire Saturday buying chicken he said We had it specifically mapped out and we would buy it and put it on ice in industrialstrength coolers given to us by the lab and ship it out All told Mr Millman and his mother Ann Marks gathered  samples of chicken drumsticks from supermarkets butcher shops and specialty stores in the New York area Now they and several scientists have published   based on the project in the journal F Research The results were surprising Kosher chicken samples that tested positive for antibioticresistant E coli had nearly twice as much of the bacteria as the samples from conventionally raised birds did  And even the samples from organically raised chickens and those raised without antibiotics did not significantly differ from the conventional ones I was pretty sure that blessings wouldnt protect chicken from antibiotic resistance said   a professor at George Washington University and an expert on antibiotic resistance who worked with Mr Millman on the study They were introduced by Mr Millmans uncle   a biology professor at Northern Arizona University who suggested the project and is also listed as an author But it was a surprise to me Dr Price continued that we found as much antibioticresistant E coli in chicken that was organic and raised without antibiotics The contamination does not mean the chicken is dangerous to eat Generally poultry is safe if handled carefully and cooked to an internal temperature of  degrees Fahrenheit according to   About threequarters of the antibiotics sold in this country are used in animal husbandry primarily as feed additives and concerns are growing about how the practice is contributing to   Organic chicken is raised without antibiotics  at least from the time the chicks are two days old But before that they can be treated with antibiotics and it is common for chicken breeders to inject eggs with antibiotics to prevent diseases and to administer antibiotics to chicks right after they hatch That might be one reason so much resistant E coli was found on the organic chicken in the study said Thomas B Harding Jr   who reviewed the study at The New York Timess request Or the chicken might have been contaminated in processing he said  a potential problem also identified in the study Consumers Union publisher of Consumer Reports   of chicken for contamination and antibiotic resistance Over all having an organic meat be resistant to one antibiotic is pretty common said Urvashi Rangan the director of the consumer safety and sustainability group at Consumer Reports When we start to see resistance to multiple antibiotics thats when we would be concerned Ms Rangan agreed that the organic chicken in the sample might have been processed in facilities that also process conventional chicken Slaughter plants with split operations where someone didnt properly clean a piece of equipment things like that she said
