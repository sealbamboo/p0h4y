Tobacco control advocates disagree on whether ecigarettes are a useful tool to get smokers off tobacco or just a sleeker form of one of the worlds deadliest addictions A lot of that discord comes from the fact that theres just not enough science to know the risks and benefits of ecigarettes which deliver nicotine in a vapor rather than through tobacco smoke And it could take years to find out if vaping causes cancer and other deadly diseases But that lack of certainty means that people need more protection not less according to a   released Tuesday by the World Health Organization The global health organization called for a ban on indoor use of ecigarettes in workplaces restaurants and other public spaces The vapors pose a serious health threat to adolescents and fetuses the report says and increase exposure of nonsmokers and bystanders to nicotine and a number of toxicants Some studies have found that bystanders absorb more nicotine from vapor than from tobacco smoke the report says One of the biggest selling points for ecigarettes  that they can help people quit tobacco  hasnt been systematically tested the WHO report finds Ecigarettes are probably less toxic for smokers who switch completely the report says The amount of risk reduction however is presently unknown Advertising of ecigarettes should be banned the report says to reduce the risk to children and teenagers The liquid used in the devices is often candy flavored And ecigarettes dont necessarily deter young people from smoking tobacco according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Monday Earlier studies have found a modest deterrent effect But this   found that  percent of those who used ecigarettes say they plan to try tobacco cigarettes in the next year compared with  percent of those who havent tried ecigs The number of teenagers who had never smoked a cigarette but used electronic cigarettes more than tripled in three years the study found rising from  in  to more than  in  The results were published in   And if thats not enough the American Heart Association issued its first   on ecigarettes saying that the devices should be regulated like tobacco products by state and local governments including them in smokefree laws and taxing them to discourage use by teenagers In April the Food and Drug Administration issued  for ecigarettes but final rules are the focus of intense lobbying by tobacco control advocates and the tobacco industry Both the WHO and AHA reports voiced fears that rather than help get rid of tobacco forever ecigarettes could make smoking culturally acceptable once again The reports were issued in advance of a global health meeting in Moscow in October where regulation of ecigarettes will be debated
