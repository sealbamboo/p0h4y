Is that  am workout getting in the way of good sleep Dont think your fat cells wont notice A new   published in the   finds that inadequate shuteye has a harmful response on fat cells reducing their ability to respond to insulin by about  percent Over the longterm this decreased response could set the stage for Type  diabetes fatty liver disease and weight gain The study adds to a growing body of evidence that theres an intimate relationship between the amount of sleep we get and our ability to maintain a good healthy body weight says sleep expert Helene Emsellem director of the   in Chevy Chase Md But Americans dont seem to be getting the message that we need seven to nine hours per night More than  in  of us according to a   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting six or fewer hours of sleep per night on average So how did researchers study fat cells in the   paper   of the University of Chicago and a group of colleagues recruited seven volunteers  all young lean and healthy  who agreed to sleep for eight nights in a sleep lab For four nights they were allowed to stay in bed for  hours a night says Brady Then a month later they came back for four additional nights  but this time they were allowed just  hours of sleep per night And after each visit researchers got a sample of their fat Brady explains that the fat cells responded significantly to the loss of sleep I was very surprised to be honest he says Bad things can happen when fat cells become less responsive to insulin Fat cells are actually your friend he says Theyre there to store lipids When lipids stay inside the cells your body can utilize the fat when youre exercising or sleeping or going about your day However when fat cells start to become insulin resistant the lipids start to leach out of the fat cells and rise in the circulation Brady says Once fat starts to accumulate in other tissues in the body such as in the liver it can lead to fatty liver disease or it can interfere with the bodys ability to clear glucose sugar from the blood into the muscle This is what sets the stage for the metabolic problems The fat cells of the healthy young volunteers likely rebounded after returning to their normal sleep patterns But over a lifetime this new body of evidence challenges the assumption that we can control our weight solely by watching how much food we take in What the message is in this article is that your body may decide to store more of the food you eat as fat if you havent gotten enough sleep Emsellem says If you short yourself just a halfhour a night the sleep deficit can really accumulate Even tiny changes will have dramatic effects on our bodies says   of the University of Warwick in the UK
