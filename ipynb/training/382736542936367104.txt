One of the most entrenched beliefs about running at least among nonrunners is that it causes arthritis and ruins knees But a nifty new study finds that this idea is a myth and distance running is unlikely to contribute to the development of arthritis precisely and paradoxically because it involves so much running Its easy to understand of course why running is thought to harm the knee joint since with every stride ballistic forces move through a runners knee Common sense would suggest that repeatedly applying such loads to a joint should eventually degrade its protective cartilage leading to arthritis But many of the available longterm studies of runners show that as long as knees are healthy to start with running does not substantially increase the risk of developing arthritis even if someone jogs into middle age and beyond An impressively large crosssectional   published in July for instance found no evidence that running increases the risk of osteoarthritis including participation in marathons The runners in the study in fact had less overall risk of developing arthritis than people who were less active But how running can combine high impacts with a low risk for arthritis has been mysterious So for   helpfully entitled Why Dont Most Runners Get Knee Osteoarthritis researchers at Queens University in Kingston Ontario and other institutions looked more closely at what happens biomechanically when we run and how those actions compare with walking Walking is widely considered a lowimpact activity unlikely to contribute much to the onset or progression of knee arthritis Many physicians recommend walking for their older patients in order to mitigate weight gain and stave off creaky knees But before the new study which was published last week in Medicine  Science in Sports  Exercise scientists had not directly compared the loads applied to peoples knees during running and walking over a given distance To do so now the researchers first recruited  healthy adult recreational runners half of them women with no history of knee problems They then taped reflective markers to the volunteers arms and legs for motion capture purposes and asked them to remove their shoes and walk five times at a comfortable pace along a runway approximately  feet long The volunteers likewise ran along the same course five times at about their usual training pace The runway was equipped with specialized motioncapture cameras and pads that measured the forces generated when each volunteer struck the ground The researchers used the data gathered from the runway to determine how much force the men and women created while walking and running as well as how often that force occurred and for how long It turned out to no ones surprise that running produced pounding In general the volunteers hit the ground with about eight times their body weight while running which was about three times as much force as during walking But they struck the ground less often while running for the simple reason that their strides were longer As a result they required fewer steps to cover the same distance when running versus walking The runners also experienced any pounding for a shorter period of time than when they walked because their foot was in contact with the ground more briefly with each stride The net result of these differences the researchers found was that the amount of force moving through a volunteers knees over any given distance was equivalent whether they ran or walked A runner generated more pounding with each stride but took fewer strides than a walker so over the course of say a mile the overall load on the knees was about the same This finding provides a persuasive biomechanical explanation for why so few runners develop knee arthritis said Ross Miller now an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Maryland who led the study Measured over a particular distance running and walking are essentially indistinguishable in terms of the wear and tear they may inflict on knees In fact Dr Miller said the studys results intimate that running potentially could be beneficial against arthritis  Theres some evidence from earlier studies that cartilage likes cyclical loading he said meaning activity in which force is applied to the joint removed and then applied again In animal studies such cyclical loading prompts cartilage cells to divide and replenish the tissue he said while noncyclical loading or the continued application of force with little onandoff pulsation can overload the cartilage and cause more cells to die than are replaced But thats speculation Dr Miller said His study was not designed to examine whether running could actually prevent arthritis but only why it does not more frequently cause it  The results also are not an endorsement of running for knee health he said Runners frequently succumb to knee injuries unrelated to arthritis he said and his study does not address or explain that situation One such ailment is patellofemoral pain syndrome which is often called runners knee But for those of us who are  or hope to be  still hitting the pavement and trails in our twilight years the results are soothing It does seem to be a myth Dr Miller said that our knees necessarily will wear out if we continue to run
