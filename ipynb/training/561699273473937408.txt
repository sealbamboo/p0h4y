 Every year nearly  people round the globe die by drowning making it one of the worlds most common causes of accidental death  Now several projects  from playpens to drones  are attempting to tackle the problem Unlike malaria and malnutrition there is no global programme aimed at reducing the death toll from drowning Its sporadic nature means prevention can be difficult  patrolling every shore and riverbank would be impossible But some things can be done such as preventing overcrowding on ships and ferries improving flood defences and having national water safety plans And it can often be local efforts that make the real difference In Bangladesh up to  of deaths in under fives are due to drowning with as many as  children drowning every day It is also where one of the most innovative efforts to reduce drowning has been targeted the Solid Saving of Lives from Drowning programme led by researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Researchers there realised that a major cause of drowning there was Bangladeshi mothers being unable to keep an eye on their children while going about their daily work  Young children would  often wander off and find themselves in difficulty after falling into a ditch or pond I was always worried about my sons safety says Laboni Khatun a mother in northern Bangladesh who lost her son to drowning two months ago  There are a lot of ponds and ditches around my house and whenever he went too close I would bring him straight back home  Laboni says I just dont know what happened that day The solution developed by the Johns Hopkins team was to create a literal barrier between the children and the dangers of Bangladeshs many waterways  in the form of locally made wooden and plastic playpens They keep children out of danger and give mothers like Anita Rani Malarkar muchneeded peace of mind when it comes to her daughters safety When I didnt have this playpen I was always scared about safety because I couldnt look after her while doing the household chores Now I dont have to worry she says To date over  have been distributed to families most at risk but the project is still at a trial phase  The researchers behind the programme hope to eventually supply  playpens and save countless children from drowning The Nile is the longest river in the world running almost  km  miles through  countries in East Africa It has provided a livelihood for the people in these countries since ancient times but those that depend on it are all too familiar with the risks of the river  Try to remain calm  Get on your back and attempt to float  Try to conserve as much energy as possible  Call for help  Never enter the water to rescue someone else  Try to pull them in from the shore or throw them a flotation aid In Khartoum Sudan where the White and Blue Nile meet civil defence pull a body from the  mile stretch of river surrounding the city every day  Some suggest the true toll of drowning may be even higher UKbased Dan Graham heads up the charity Nile Swimmers which works in Sudan training lifesaving and swimming instructors to work in communities that live on the Nile  Dan explains the impact that one motivated student of his Al Rashid had on his community He was brimming with energy during his training and when he finished went home and taught every child in his village to swim He then went on to the next village and trained all the children there  Thats one man without any resources who has trained hundreds of children to be safer around water in their daily lives Nile Swimmers supports instructortrainees to select techniques that are appropriate and relevant to their local situation but Dan is conscious of the challenges of expanding the scheme Weve seen from our own work in Sudan and from similar programmes in other countries what can be achieved for relatively little money in relatively small schemes  Nobody has yet managed to expand these programmes to a countrywide or even continentwide scale For that more funding is required Drones are used for everything from shooting films to monitoring livestock but now two Iranian engineers are attempting to use drones to rescue people in danger of drowning With nearly  drowning off the Caspian coast of their country the every year roboticist Amin Rigi and engineer Amir Tahiri decided to look at how they might alleviate the problem We attempted to create a submersible robot then a surface based robot before we realised that a flying robot was the best approach recalls Amin  as their new robot is called is designed to work by flying out to potential drowning victims and dropping life rings allowing people in the water to stay afloat until they can be rescued The current prototype model is remote controlled and boasts a range of four kilometres with the ability to rescue to four people at once  Search lights allow it to perform night rescues and it can be launched from both the shore and from the decks of ships  Their tests have shown that it can perform a rescue four times faster than a human lifeguard First generation robots will begin operations in Brazil Italy and Mexico in April this year  The current model costs   a unit but Amin hopes the next generation will be cheaper He also hopes future models will be able to perform rescues with less human input eventually performing fully automated rescues
