Rice and lentils was the free lunch on Aug  at the Government Model Senior Secondary school in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh Teachers took a look at the meal  Lunch was not served Seven hundred students reportedly went home hungry after their school day Indias free school lunch program is the largest in the world The program was started in the mids with two goals to fight chronic hunger and child malnutrition and to increase school enrollment and attendance As many studies have shown   The MidDay Meal Program currently feeds about  million of Indias poorest children Food is cooked in  lakh  million schools says Dipa Sinha an economist at the Center for Equity Studies in New Delhi It is also a program that has made headlines for its missteps one of which was tragic In   students at a school in the Chapra district of Bihar died after eating food contaminated with pesticides Many more fell ill A government investigation later found that like most schools in the state this school had no separate kitchen or storage place for the food items As a result ingredients were stored in the principals house right next to pesticides stored for her farm Since then theres been no tragedy of similar scope But there are worms And lizards Earlier this summer a child found a dead lizard in the lunch served at his primary school in the city of Bhagalpur on the Ganges River in the state of Bihar Later that day  students complained they were feeling dizzy and had to be admitted to the local primary health care center A government   later found that the animal had fallen into the meal while it was being cooked     As the   and   reported this was the fourth case of students being sick after eating their school lunch in the state of Bihar In these cases  and other instances where students became sick after eating a contaminated school lunch  the cause is often a lack of proper storage facilities The rice and wheat supplied to schools come from government warehouses says Sinha who was a member of a team appointed by the Indian government to track the school lunch program in different states This past year the government bought more grains from farmers than it had room to store them she says A lot has been stored in the open Schools are also short on storage space The government sends grains to schools every two or three months And many schools around the country dont have a separate kitchen or larder to store the grains This is monsoon season says Sinha Insects thrive in the damp weather So if theres no storage in the schools then its a problem Back in Bihar where most of these recent incidents have occurred local activists agree You have to improve the facilities in schools says Rupesh Kumar a longtime food rights activist Since the  poisoning in Bihar the government has been building separate kitchens in schools As of March of this year  schools had kitchen sheds says Kumar But thousands more are yet to be built Theres also a need to better train cooks about best practices in the kitchen says Kumar Cooks at schools are often illiterate or poorly educated and arent aware of health standards He says the government has already given schools in Bihar a set of standard operating procedures or guidelines to maintain health and sanitation standards But theres no way to ensure that the cooks follow those guidelines Ultimately he says all of this reflects a lack of monitoring and accountability Currently a teacher is assigned to monitor the program and make sure everything runs smoothly says Kumar Teachers do this on top of regular duties and are not paid extra One person is overseeing everything he says This is the main problem The problems can be fixed says Sinha For example the states of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have created a separate position for a noon meal organizer As a result she says their school lunch programs have fewer problems than do other areas The Indian government has appointed a handful of independent committees to periodically monitor programs in randomly selected schools But such efforts need to be more comprehensive says Sinha Meanwhile despite all these cases of contaminated food kids havent stopped eating the free lunches  a sign of how much they depend on the MidDay Meal Program
