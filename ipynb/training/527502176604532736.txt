This is a week for reflecting on lessons learned from those whove survived Ebola    on the experience of medical personnel at Emory Hospital which has cared for four Ebola patients three evacuees from West Africa including Dr Kent Brantly and one of the Texas nurses Goats and Soda has also been looking into this topic Of the  people who were infected in West Africa and evacuated to Europe or the US  have survived and one is currently being treated The only three deaths were the two Spanish physicianpriests and a Senegalese medical worker from the UN who was transported to Leipzig Germany By comparison nearly half the number of people infected with the virus in West Africa have died The sample size of evacuees isnt large enough to draw any definitive conclusions But we did ask several Ebola specialists for their insights After the first few cases of evacuees we began to understand that any early intervention allows the patients time to heal and have a better chance of surviving says   an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan The first six days or so after symptoms appear is a critical time After that the virus completely overwhelms the body and becomes really tough to treat even with good supportive care Wells says Thats why the public health campaigns in West Africa emphasizing that Ebola is real are vital Two common symptoms of Ebola are severe diarrhea and vomiting A patient can lose  to   gallons of body fluids a day says   director of Georgetown Universitys Center on Medical Product Access Safety and Stewardship These lost fluids contain important proteins and salts the body needs to function So patients must be constantly hydrated not just with bottled water but with oral rehydration solutions fortified with electrolytes that keep cells functioning salt and potassium for example as well as protein But providing additional fluids will not help if the patient continues vomiting Youll need antinausea medication says   of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Thats one of the medical needs in West Africa On a daytoday basis doctors need equipment to monitor how much fluid is lost as well as electrolyte balance Throwing both out of whack can cause blood vessels to collapse Such patients are at risk of organ failure In US hospitals dialysis and respiratory machines can help keep them alive The hope is that stateoftheart medical care might become available in countries like Liberia as additional treatment units are built says Goodman Then the question would be How much of a difference does this equipment make in the survival rate As for experimental drugs and blood transfusions provided to the evacuees no one knows the role theyve played in recovery Its unclear whether the experimental drugs have had any effect or if its just good supportive care that is responsible for the recovery of the American patients says Adalja We need a study that compares supportive care plus experimental therapy versus supportive care alone
