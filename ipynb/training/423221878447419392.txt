Young people account for less than one quarter of those who have enrolled in the health care exchanges. Their participation is considered crucial for the success of the Affordable Care Act, and so far it's low. The administration had been hoping for a higher figure, but it predicts that more 18- to 34-year-olds will sign up in the next three months. If that doesn't happen, insurers will likely raise premiums for 2015, and that could spell deep trouble for the health care program.
