I told myself I wasnt going to write about any more memoirs at least not for a while The act of honoring thy aging father or mother has already generated so many magazine articles and opeds and blogs and books including Katie Hafners account of   and Katy Butlers story of her familys   while his brain and the rest of his body failed But heres one more The Fifth Season A DaughterinLaws Memoir of Caregiving by Lisa Ohlen Harris Im passing it along for three reasons First her book is eloquent and honest about the pressures of having Jeanne the active motherinlaw who moved in to help with the kids and the mortgage suddenly get sick and then sicker I married Todd promising to stay with him till death separates us Ms Harris wrote I did not marry his mother At times she believes that being good to Jeanne has made her a lessthangood mother to her own four girls Second it is forthright about the pride that accompanies the frustration Ms Harris is so conscientious whatever her private misgivings that health care types regularly mistake her for Jeannes daughter not her daughterinlaw Caregivers so often feel guilty and inadequate that they cant see what they have accomplished Ms Harris kept her motherinlaw in their shared home for seven years and knows that there is something comforting almost empowering in knowing how to dress a wound in being able to recognize symptoms of a dangerous respiratory infection even before Jeanne realizes she is short of breath Ive become an excellent caregiver and along the way Im the one who has created the illusion that she doesnt need anyone else Third readers will get yet another lesson in the barely noticed ways sick old people slide onto the conveyor belt of contemporary medicine even if  like Jeanne  they have always said they dont want aggressive treatment The Fifth Season shows how doctors evasiveness patients hopefulness and their families hesitance to discourage them combine to keep very frail people undergoing futile treatments and then more of them Jeanne gets scans infusions drugs a port This is all so much fuzzier than it seems from afar Year after year Jeanne gets weaker and sicker and her daughterinlaw infuriatingly gets misinformed about hospice eligibility Yet it still comes as a shock when Ms Harris sees the doctors notes that say how poor Jeannes prognosis is I finally realized that the experts all these specialists the ones who are supposed to be the educators of their patients have been looking at Jeanne and seeing a dying woman she wrote But they kept sending us all over Fort Worth on wild goose chases despite the mass of physical ailments signaling that Jeanne is at the end of her life Why the hell didnt anybody speak up Thats why people keep writing memoirs like this one I think and why I keep reading them This is one way people   speaking up These are the stories my fellow baby boomers feel compelled to tell one another The plot can come to feel familiar Often it begins with some odd behavior nobody quite recognizes at the time frequently a harbinger of dementia though in this case Jeannes longtime smokers cough she smoked and mostly denied it for  years meant chronic pulmonary disease In Act II the family pulls together vowing to keep their loved ones out of nursing homes sure they can care for them And the older people decline and the younger ones reel from exhaustion and it goes on And on Death comes usually later than people wish it had Jeanne for instance dies after  days in home hospice care when she and her family could and should have had that support and comfort for months Perhaps women especially have always shared their elder care stories with those closest to them Now authors have more ways to bring these sagas to a wider audience and they are taking advantage of them They are creating support groups in print safe spaces where people can share the unsayable I hope The New Old Age serves that purpose too of course In the wrong hands the stories can become maudlin or simply tiresome but Ms Harriss are the right hands The Fifth Season is brief potent and gutsy I have seen scant evidence that anybody besides Mitch Albom who hardly qualified as Morries caregiver has made any real money on these memoirs That is not usually why people write them They are cautionary tales full of anger and love  and warning They are bulletins from the front meant to guide those following behind
