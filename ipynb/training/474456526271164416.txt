Big bold wines have their fans But with the arrival of summer make room for a bumper crop of lighter more subtle wines Lowalcohol wines are super hot right now says wine writer   Theres Txakoli or Txakolina wines from the Basque region of Spain Rieslings from Germany and New York state and Vinho Verde from Portugal to name a few These wines typically hover in the  percent to  percent alcohol range This compares to about  percent to  percent in a typical California chardonnay Were seeing from our stores more requests for more balanced lightbodied loweralcohol wines   sommelier and global wine buyer for Whole Foods tells us And I see this trend gaining momentum So what explains the trend For starters budding wine aficionados are more cashstrapped than their predecessors Cole says And these same consumers also value novelty They want to look around the corner to new wines made from quirkier more obscure grapes she says Cole says a Txakoli may offer more bang for the buck than say an overoaked overpriced higheralcohol California chardonnay And she says other wine grapes Americans arent as familiar with such as gamay noir a highyield grape used to make Beaujolais are gaining traction too One producer is a small Portlandbased winery   There are several factors that determine alcohol levels The climate and grape varietals play a role And winemakers have several techniques that can manipulate alcohol concentrations For instance they can halt the conversion of sugar in the grapes to alcohol keeping more sugar in the wine Moscato wines which are known for a signature sweetness and have   in recent years are a good example of that In other cases winemakers use grape varietals that dont concentrate high amounts of sugar And they can adjust how long grapes stay on the vine Lower alcohol is indicative of grapes that were picked not overripe but maybe just barely ripe Broglie says Vinho Verde  which translates from the Portuguese as green wine or young wine  is a good example These wines which have been dubbed   by   wine critic Eric Asimov are traditionally produced from valleygrown grapes that dont get super ripe so sugar concentrations are lower And since its the sugar that converts to alcohol as a result theres less alcohol And why the lower price points In the case of Vinho Verde wines part of the story is geography Portuguese winemakers can produce wine more cheaply compared with say French winemakers In part theres not as much pruning or fussing over the grapes And unlike champagne which is aged before its sold Vinho Verde is produced to be consumed quickly Some wine critics   Vinho Verde and say the good value is not lost on consumers Imports into the US have   Cole says in many instances higheralcohol wines can cost more because theyre made from grapevines that have been pruned down to squeeze the highest concentration of flavor from each berry And the cost of the labor behind this intensive technique can add up The move to lower alcohol concentrations is not just about cost In fact often its an afterthought Whats driving the trend is changing preferences in wine styles Broglie says after years of winemakers pushing the envelope to produce overripe grapes that make bold hityouoverthehead wines the tide has turned Now were seeing a natural trend in the other direction to more subtlety in wines Broglie says And I see this continuing Wine writer Dave McIntyre agrees There is a move to roll back alcohol levels from the blockbuster  to  percent and higher wines so popular the last  years or so McIntyre says there are also some wine companies purposely making  marketed to dietminded consumers Take for instance   and   which makes Slim Chardonnay Mini Moscato and Thin Zin which has just  percent alcohol And in other cases the move to more balance and subtlety has winemakers experimenting with all kinds of techniques McIntyre  a New Zealand producer who makes a sauvignon blanc and a Riesling at about  percent alcohol which is  percent lower than whats typical And he does nothing more than picking some leaves off the vine to inhibit sugar growth The loweralcohol trend goes beyond just vino Beerwine crossovers are starting to catch on For instance Odell Brewing in Colorado makes a Rieslingpale ale mashup with  percent alcohol And newer takes on hard ciders such as   with  percent alcohol content are getting notice too But dont expect to see a downward trend in alcohol in many red wines The lowalcohol reds are a challenge for winemakers explains Andrew Waterhouse a professor of oenology at the University of California Davis Loweralcohol wines have a more subtle complex taste and higher acidity than wines made from riper grapes And he says the trend has been that most consumers prefer the distinctive fruity tastes that arise in very ripe red grapes
