A proper diet exercise stress management and social support could go a long way toward addressing the vast majority of health problems  including cancer says Dr Brent Bauer director of the Complementary and Integrative Medicine program at the   It just comes down to adopting  and sticking to  some simple habits Load up on antioxidantpacked superfoods like blueberries and kale to keep cancer away right Yes fruits and veggies are a crucial part of a healthy diet and antioxidants do seem to thwart tumors at least in lab studies  see Anticancer Foods right But in recent years a more sophisticated understanding of how food affects our cancer risk has emerged  Individual foods arent the answer  its the overall dietary pattern that likely makes the most difference says Colleen Doyle director of nutrition and physical activity at the   ACS Translation We should be focusing not just on what we eat but on how much Obesity is a key culprit in a number of diseases from diabetes to heart conditions and it might contribute to cancer as well in different ways  After menopause for instance extra pounds can keep estrogen levels high which can push breast cells to divide more aggressively in some cases leading to tumors Two small changes that help you stay in shape and may lower your cancer risk First eat more fruits and vegetables  any kind but especially brightly colored ones which are high in antioxidants Consuming at least five servings a day can significantly lower your chances of getting cancer Doyle says Second have less red meat and more plantbased proteins such as beans and tofu Cooking red meat at high temperatures releases compounds that when digested have been linked to some cancers The good news Doyle notes is you dont have to change absolutely every single thing to see a real difference in your risk Doctors are increasingly aware that being physically active goes hand in hand with eating well when it comes to preventing cancer  Investing in a healthy diet but not getting enough exercise could negate the benefits of all that responsible eating working out fanatically but overdoing it on highcalorie favorites wont do your body much good either Some studies have linked higher levels of physical activity with lower levels of breast cancer although the reason for the association isnt exactly clear Exercise might adjust your hormonal balance to make it less hospitable for tumors to grow or trigger metabolic changes that make cancer less likely How much is enough  Though theres no specific anticancer formula for exercise yet the ACS recommends  minutes a week of moderate physical activity  walking briskly gardening playing tennis whatever you like   Constant stress over months and years may drive the bodys systems to extremes  contributing to an increased risk for heart disease and even a weakened immune system which can create fertile ground for tumors experts believe  While no studies directly connect stress to your cancer risk a link isnt unrealistic Lab and animal research has shown that hormones released in response to stress can actually help a tumor grow  they may promote the formation of blood vessels that tumors need to survive So minimizing stress might help ward off cancer One simple way to start As soon as you wake up think about five things that make you happy and why they do says Dr Amit Sood chair of the Mayo Clinic Mind Body Initiative  That keeps your brain from falling into worry mode and staying there for the rest of the day Think of cancer as a weed Sood says We change the soil so the weed doesnt grow    While we slumber both our body and brain are hard at work repairing tissues and tuning up neural connections People who skimp on the eight to nine hours that the average adult needs tend to have higher rates of heart disease diabetes  and possibly cancer  In a large study of Japanese women those who slept less than six hours a night over several years were more likely to develop breast cancer though that might have been due to family history or other factors for which researchers didnt control Another study that did control for family history published in the journal Cancer found that people who slept that little were almost  percent more likely than subjects who got seven hours or more of rest to grow colorectal adenomas  precursors to colon cancer Why  Being deprived of the sleep hormone melatonin might be the cause Normally melatonin levels in your body peak at night triggered by the absence of light and drop during the day But when production of the hormone is interrupted it can have serious effects Recent findings from a longterm study revealed that nurses who were on call more frequently at night had higher rates of breast cancer than those who worked days   That doesnt mean you will absolutely develop cancer if you work nights or if you cant always snag a solid seven hours of shuteye  just that your overall risk might be higher But the research does suggest that its beneficial to keep melatonin flowing  say by lying in the dark instead of turning on the lights if you wake up in the wee hours It also tells us that getting a good nights sleep should be a top priority  Thats one doctors order were happy to take
