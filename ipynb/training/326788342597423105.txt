Nutrition labeling has been required on packaged food since  and the new federal food safety law will require calorie counts to be posted for restaurant food  all in an effort to get the American public to eat healthier But most studies on calorie count labels show they dont do much to nudge people toward better food choices If I want that ohsodelicious Chunky Monkey ice cream knowing that a halfcup serving    calories and  grams of fat isnt going to stop me But what if I knew that it would take me an hour and  minutes of brisk walking to burn off those Chunky Monkey calories Would I think twice Probably says Ashlei James a graduate student at Texas Christian University She tested how much people ate when given menus with labels that stated how much brisk walking would be required to burn off the calories in a given food item She compared that to menus with calorie counts and those with no information and tracked how much people ordered and ate The menus with and without calorie counts had no effect on how much the  participants ages  to  ordered and ate But the people who saw the walking times listed ordered fewer of the burgers fries chicken tenders salad dessert sodas and water on the menu They ordered less food and ate less too Consumers should become more aware of how much exercise it takes to burn the calories from energydense foods says   a professor of nutrition at TCU and James mentor Once people learn that it takes an hour or two to burn calories from one food item they might think twice It would take a woman two hours of walking to burn off a double cheeseburger the researchers said The research was presented in Boston at the Experimental Biology  meeting so it hasnt been published in a peerreviewed journal But other studies have also found a benefit from putting the amount of exercise needed to burn a food choice front and center In  researchers at Johns Hopkins University   that when they put labels on soft drinks stating that it would take  minutes of jogging to burn off that sugar teenagers shopping in a corner market were more likely to avoid soda and buy water instead And TV chef Jamie Oliver   on his show   by letting teenagers pick a snack  and then making them walk around a track until they burned off the calories That approach squares with how the Hopkins researchers viewed their findings Why is it that listing the minutes of jogging was most effective   an assistant professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins told The Salt back in  My personal feeling is that jogging works because its a negative thing The idea of matching up food intake with energy expenditure isnt new The Internet abounds with calorieexercise calculators type in exercise calorie calculator to find them And weightloss programs like Weight Watchers build those calculators into their online tools Would knowing how much work it takes to burn off a food persuade you to order differently Or walk more
