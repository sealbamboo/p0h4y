Wikipedia page views can predict disease outbreaks nearly a month before official health advice a team of US scientists says The Los Alamos National Laboratory team says people are searching online before seeking medical help  They managed to forecast tuberculosis and influenza outbreaks four weeks in advance Other experts said they were wary about the value of using online searches to predict outbreaks  Traditional disease surveillance involves collecting data from laboratory tests calls to doctors surgeries and tracking the number of people who visit health facilities  The US team writing in the journal PLoS Computational Biology argued these methods were accurate but slow and expensive Previous attempts at using the internet to predict disease outbreaks include   The US scientists instead turned to Wikipedia and tracked page views between  and  on visits to diseaserelated Wikipedia pages They mapped the languages the information was written in using this as an approximate measure for peoples locations  Their data was then compared with disease outbreak information provided by national health surveillance teams  In eight out of  cases there was a clear increase in page views four weeks before health officials declared an outbreak  Their statistical technique allowed them to predict emerging influenza outbreaks in the United States Poland Japan and Thailand dengue fever spikes in Brazil and Thailand and a rise in tuberculosis cases in Thailand  Lead researcher Dr Sara Del Valle said A global diseaseforecasting system will change the way we respond to epidemics  In the same way we check the weather each morning individuals and public health officials can monitor disease incidence and plan for the future based on todays forecast  The goal of this research is to build an operational disease monitoring and forecasting system with open data and open source code  This paper shows we can achieve that goal  But it is not clear from the present study whether the model will be useable in countries where access to the internet is poor Dr Heidi Larson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the Wikipedia research data was compelling but she would be wary about using it as a tool for predicting outbreaks of all disease She said that people needed to have internet access be literate and be familiar with Wikipedia and with the disease itself Dr Larson added There are different things that drive people to Wikipedia sometimes a new piece of research can drive people to go online  While online trends could provide valuable signals about disease questions remained as to what extent you used the data to inform policy or for intervention she added Im not sure how much Wikipedia is used in Africa she said For issues like Ebola I dont think people at the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa would have been searching because they wouldnt have had it Ebola before
