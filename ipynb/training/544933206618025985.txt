For more than two decades, Tony Coles has worked at a succession of drug makers, large and small. Among them have been Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. But he garnered headlines last year when he sold Onyx Pharmaceuticals, where he was chief executive for more than three years, to Amgen for $10.4 billion.. Coles, 54 years old, is in the news again this week, though, with the announcement that he is heading a newly formed company called Yumanity Therapeutics. The start-up is devoted to combating diseases caused by protein misfolding with three proprietary technologies developed at the Whitehead Institute and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The first targets will be Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and ALS. We spoke with him about the effort.
