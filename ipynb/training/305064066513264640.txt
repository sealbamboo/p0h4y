Disease detectives are kind of the rock stars of public health They travel around the world on a moments notice to track down an Ebola outbreak in Uganda or stop a cholera epidemic in Haiti And Kate Winslet and Lawrence Fishburne   in the movie   for crying out loud So when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   a free iPad app that lets you solve disease puzzles  a kind of CDC CSI  I was totally stoked to try it The gamelike app didnt disappoint Its slick polished and pleasing edutainment as my husband put it  simulates problems caused by three different contagions  two in the US and one in Kenya  and takes you through the steps the CDCs   use to pinpoint the pathogenic culprit and stop it from spreading Should you quarantine the sick Order up more lab tests Or perhaps slaughter a herd of sheep My favorite puzzle was Birthday Party Gone Bad which starts off with this scenario What is the worst thing that can happen at a yearolds birthday party Sticky fingers Fights in the bouncy house  Usually but after this party these things would have been a welcome side effect Kids went home with stomach cramps and watery diarrhea Was it the homemade ice cream or an unmentionable accident in the pool After downloading the app I immediately solved all three outbreaks And I craved more It was fun And even though I feel like I live and breathe infectious diseases as a global health reporter I learned something from the puzzles Who knew you could catch a fever from raw mutton But how does the app stack up to real infectious disease games like   For that answer I turned to my husband who is far removed from public health but more immersed in gaming than hed care to admit He says the CDC app is much more educational than other outbreak games and not as much fun Its mildly amusing he cracks I might be tempted to play one more round The CDC   the app as an educational tool for teens science teachers and young adults Since its launch earlier this month the app has an average rating of  stars out of  based on  reviews at the iTunes Store A   from jmconde nicely sums it up I can feel the Epidemiologist growing in me now Well done application and the most fun one could have while talking about diarrhea
