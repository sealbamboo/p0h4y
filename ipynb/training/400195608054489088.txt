The British Medical Association wants them banned  but more than a million people are now using electronic cigarettes   And a poll of nearly  people for BBC Breakfast suggests most support their use in public places and dont want to see a ban  At Westfield shopping centre in London Katherine Devlin who represents the electronic cigarette industry is vaping  not smoking  What looks like smoke coming out of her mouth is actually largely water vapour But should she be allowed to use her ecigarette in an enclosed public place like this She says Its really important that electronic cigarettes are allowed to be used in public as widely as possible so that as many smokers as possible are aware that they have this option  The more smokers we can get to make the switch the bigger the public health gain we can achieve Ecigarettes work by vaporising liquid nicotine Theres no tobacco no smoke Its the smoke in normal cigarettes that kills   But shoppers had mixed views about Ms Devlin using her ecigarette inside  I dont like it one woman said I dont like anything that leads to addiction Its related to cigarettes isnt it  Its nicotine Its a substitute for cigarettes said a male shopper I think its great for people who are trying to give up smoking The smoking ban doesnt apply to ecigarettes because theres no smoke It means in theory they can be used anywhere  trains planes even hospitals   When asked by BBC Breakfast Would you feel uncomfortable if someone used an ecigarette near you are your family   said no And asked if ecigarettes should be banned in public places  said yes  but  said no The debate around ecigarettes has sharply divided medical opinion Some see them as a huge potential public health prize that could save millions of lives Others worry about the effects of their longterm use their regulation and their safety It is clear they are less harmful by several magnitudes than smoking says Dr Ram Moorthy from the British Medical Association  But we still need to have a much greater evidence base about how safe they are The BMA has called for ecigarettes to be banned in public places Our concern with the use of ecigarettes is that it normalises behaviour that has become socially unacceptable says Dr Moorthy  Our biggest concern is that something that looks like smoking becomes glamorous again and may be attractive to children Many have now followed the BMA advice  Airlines train companies and the pub chain JD Wetherspoon have all banned the use of ecigarettes as has the University of London which introduced a ban last month We were heavily influenced by the advice from the BMA says Kim Foster from the university We had people sitting next to each other in cafes and actually saying Well youre smoking you shouldnt be smoking in here and arguments were developing  At one point a security guard had to be called Arguments were developing and you just dont want that Many other institutions offices and pubs do allow ecigarettes  The government says its up to individual companies and institutions to determine their own policy  The result is somewhat bizarre Ecigarettes can be used for example in Asda supermarkets but not in Sainsburys Back in the shopping centre Ms Devlin cannot use her ecigarette in an openair Starbucks but can just outside where it becomes Westfield The current situation where youve got different rules in different places is reflective of the absolute and utter confusion there is she says  If the BBC poll is right the public seems to be fairly relaxed about ecigarettes at a time when more and more places are deciding to ban them
