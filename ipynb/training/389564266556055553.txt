Cancer costs countries in the European Union bn euro bn a year according to the first EUwide analysis of the economic impact of the disease  The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a huge burden The figures   included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care  Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease The team from the University of Oxford and Kings College London analysed data from each of the  nations in the EU in  The showed the total cost was bn euro and of that bn bn euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors time and drug costs Lost productivity because of work missed through sickness or dying young cost bn bn euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at bn bn euro Overall richer countries such as Germany and Luxembourg spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania  Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor However the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease  An EUwide study by the same research group showed cardiovascular diseases including high blood pressure and stroke cost   while dementia cost   in just  countries in Western Europe  Dementia has very high costs associated with longterm care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer One of the researchers Dr Ramon LuengoFernandez from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford said By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment Prof Richard Sullivan from Kings College London said It is vital that decisionmakers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas  More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point  a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer  and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates Sara Osborne head of policy at Cancer Research UK said The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden  This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer  so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness We also need to understand why the UKs cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care
