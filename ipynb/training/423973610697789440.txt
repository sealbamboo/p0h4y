The nations capital is a pretty old city by American standards It dates back to the late th century Despite frequent facelifts parts of it are wearing out  for example its underground gas pipelines New research shows that Washington DC suffers from thousands of leaks of natural gas We drove  road miles in Washington DC and found about  leaks says   an ecologist and environmental scientist at Duke University Thats roughly four leaks every mile Four leaks per mile is even more than the scientific team   in  where it did the same thing  drive the streets with a special instrument that detects methane the main component in natural gas In fact the average amount of gas lost to leaks in Washington is more than twice the national average for cities Jackson adds that at many sites he measured the concentration of methane in the air was higher than anything he saw in Boston And its not swamp gas Jacksons technique identifies the type of methane by its chemical structure and the presence of ethane and propane with it forms of gas not usually found with the socalled biogenic methane created by rotting plants bacteria and the like  In  cases the gas concentration was potentially explosive Jackson says he informed the local gas company about those early last year The really surprising thing he says is that when we went back four months later after calling in these leaks nine of the  hadnt been fixed And that really shocked me The citys gas company   declined an interview request about this study   this week in the journal   In a written response the company said it immediately responds to every report of natural gas odor and repairs leaks  days a week  hours a day  days a year Jackson notes that leaks can be hard to trace without the kind of sophisticated equipment he uses Moreover he doesnt track the leaks down to their exact location on a pipeline Sometimes whole blocks have to be investigated to find one leak Also onethird of Washingtons gas mains are castiron  an old technology thats prone to leaks Washington Gas is replacing many of these But plugging leaks is like plugging holes in a dike We have been plagued by a series of ongoing gas leaks says Doug Johnson who lives in an older part of the city As in much of the District theres remodeling going on all around him with lots of new construction heavy equipment and truck traffic Johnson says gas company workers return over and over to fix leaks on his block and he always asks the workers Whats going on Basically he says hes told these streets werent really built to handle the large construction the cranes He says workers tell him  You know the pipes are old Theyre being put under enormous stress  that probably is your answer right there  Besides the inconvenience and the cost of lost gas that customers have paid for methane leaks contribute to global warming Dukes Jackson is one of many scientists measuring how much methane comes from cities industry and farms but its been hard to get consistent numbers The scientific community is still trying to figure why those differences occur Jackson says and what the differences are in practices that might explain them Oil and gas operations are the biggest contributors to methane from human activities in the US for many countries the biggest methane contributor is livestock but cities appear to be significant contributors too Even within Washington there was a lot of variation in leak levels One area that turned out to be fairly gasfree was the National Mall  with the White House near one end and Congress at the other Science is full of surprises
