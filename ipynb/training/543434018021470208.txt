It is widely known that being overweight or obese is linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular and other diseases Now a new study has found that even in young adults of normal weight increases in body mass index also lead to increased risk Researchers studied  young adults testing them for  gene variants known to be associated with higher BMI and assigning a gene score to each depending on how many of the genetic variants they carried By studying such a large population they were able to separate genetic tendencies toward weight gain from other variables that may contribute to being overweight such as diet physical activity levels and socioeconomic status  Elevated BMI and numerous blood indications of metabolic risk closely matched higher gene scores strongly suggesting that higher BMI alone causes the increase in cardiovascular risk factors independent of fatty food consumption exercise smoking and other variables The study   also analyzed  people who had metabolic profiles done after six years and found that increases in BMI even within the normal range led to extensive adverse metabolic changes while modest weight loss led to multiple favorable changes  Our study in young adults shows that even a modest weight loss tends to improve the metabolic profile said the lead author Peter Wrtz head of molecular epidemiology at the University of Oulu in Finland It doesnt have to be a large change to have a beneficial role Even with a normal BMI of  its worth it to try to get it lower
