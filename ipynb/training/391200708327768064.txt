A care home where  residents died was riddled with institutionalised abuse a coroner has said Penelope Schofield has ruled neglect contributed to five of the deaths at Orchid View in Copthorne near Crawley The West Sussex coroner said the home then run by Southern Cross was mismanaged and understaffed Ms Schofield has also criticised the Care Quality Commission CQC which gave the home a good rating in  a year before it closed down  A serious case review has now begun into the elderly residents deaths At the final day of a fiveweek inquest into the deaths which were all unexplained Mrs Schofield said the problems at the home were from the top down and started at an early stage but nobody did anything to address them Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management Ms Schofield said it was disgraceful Southern Cross was allowed to run the home in the way it was for about two years Referring to the CQCs rating of the home she said I question how this could be the case and I question whether the inspection that did take place was fit for purpose Its a heartbreaking case We all have parents who will probably need care in the latter part of their lives Andrea Sutcliffe the CQCs chief inspector of adult social care said she had ordered a rootandbranch review of the organisations actions in relation to Orchid View While summing up Ms Schofield said she had found that medical documents for resident Jean Halfpenny  were falsified and that she was given too much of the bloodthinning drug warfarin Home manager Meera Reed had earlier denied ordering staff to shred documents and filling in new forms to cover up the overdose  Continuing the coroner said that another resident was found naked and in pain with his catheter twisted while a family member found staff eating toast and drinking tea with their feet up  Whistleblower Lisa Martin who first informed police of problems at Orchid View said she felt she had no choice but to come forward Speaking outside the inquest she said I had witnessed too much poor management and care to vulnerable adults I couldnt live with the knowledge any longer and felt I had no choice but to tell the police She said she knew she had done the right thing morally but said she had not worked for two years and the case had had a huge impact on her life Speaking of her former colleagues she said They shouldnt be allowed to work in the industry During the inquest the coroner also said it was a cause for concern that many people who worked at Orchid View were still working in the industry Ms Martin said when Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital Ms Reed looked at her forms and said We cant send her to hospital with those They will shut us down She said other forms were filled out and she was asked not to disclose the shredding of the original documents to anyone She added that the final straw came when she was told by a nurse they had found  drug errors from just one night shift She called the police who arrived the next day Ms Schofield said that all  residents whose deaths were unexplained had suffered suboptimal care She said they had all died of natural causes but the deaths of yearold Enid Trodden yearolds Wilfred Gardner and John Holmes and yearolds Margaret Tucker and Jean Halfpenny had been attributed to by neglect After the hearing Mrs Halfpennys daughter Linzi Collings said the horrific details that had emerged were beyond comprehension She said How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled She said her mother deserved to be treated with dignity and compassion but Orchid View failed to provide her with even basic care despite being paid a significant amount of money Lawyers for some families have called for a public inquiry to be set up but the coroner said she would await the outcome of the serious case review first Ian Christian of Irwin Mitchell solicitors which represented seven families said the situation at Orchid View raised questions about the quality of care provided across the industry He said before Southern Cross closed it had owned  care homes The evidence revealed in this inquest is deeply concerning as it shows signs of profits being put before the wellbeing of residents he said Amanda Rogers director of adult services for West Sussex County Council said the inquest showed a shocking example of poor care but such examples were isolated and the public should remain confident about the levels of care in West Sussex The CQCs Ms Sutcliffe said she was shocked at the descriptions of care at Orchid View in  and  She said it was completely unacceptable and lessons needed to be learned She added that she would personally oversee a rootandbranch review of our actions Ms Sutcliffe said she had already   to how care homes would inspected monitored and regulated in the future
