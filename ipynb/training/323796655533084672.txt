Heres welcome news You may have inherited your moms slowmo metabolism but youre not stuck with it New research shows you can trick your body into burning calories more efficiently especially if you hit the gym By strengthtraining just a couple of times a week for example youll reverse  of the seemingly inevitable metabolism slowdown that comes with age says Gary Hunter PhD a professor of human studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham So take control of your metabolism by making these boosters part of your routineand finally stop sweating every cookie The next time you run swim or even walk ramp up the intensity for second intervals returning to your normal speed afterward Using this strategy will help you consume more oxygen and make your cell powerhouses the mitochondria work harder to burn energy explains Mark Hyman MD an integrative and functional medicine specialist in private practice in Lenox Massachusetts and author of   You increase the number of mitochondria and how efficiently they burn throughout the day he explainsThis way you can exercise for less time than it takes to plod along at the same pace and still get great results  Exercise for  minutes at  mph Increase your speed to  mph for  seconds Then go back down to  mph for  seconds Repeat the entire sequence  times twice a week To get a more challenging workout increase the incline or your pace Why does eating lots of fish rich in omega fatty acids salmon herring and tuna help amp up metabolism Omegas balance blood sugar and reduce inflammation helping to regulate metabolism They may also reduce resistance to the hormone leptin which researchers have linked to how fast fat is burned A study in   found rats that ingested large doses of fish oil while exercising lost weight Take omega fatty acid supplements Hyman recommends  to  milligrams per day Hate the fishy afterburp Try flaxseed oil walnuts or eggs fortified with omegas Or check out supplements by brands such as   that have no fishy taste Not only does muscle weigh more than fat but it uses more energy too The average woman in her s who strengthtrains  to  minutes twice a week for four months will increase her resting metabolism by  calories a day That means youre resetting your thermostat to keep running at that rate even on the days when you dont make it to the gym Hunter explains Green tea has long been heralded for its antioxidant polyphenols But new evidence shows the active ingredient   may crank up metabolism Researchers conducted a series of studies in dieters and found that those who went green lost more weight than those who didnt suggesting that catechins may improve fat oxidation and thermogenesis your bodys production of energy or heat from digestion But how much do you have to drink According to one study if you drink five eightounce cups of green tea a day you can increase your energy expenditure by  calories a day Sounds like a lot of tea but its not hard to do if you also drink it iced Its one of the most frustrating realities of dietingif you cut out too many calories your metabolism thinks times are lean and puts the breaks on fatburning to conserve energy Hunter explains Heres the trick to keeping your metabolism revved up while dieting Eat enough calories to at least match your resting metabolic rate what youd burn if you stayed in bed all day   Thats about  calories for a feetinch pound yearold woman Exercise is a gift to yourself that keeps on giving In a phenomenon known as excess postexercise oxygen consumption EPOC your body can take hours to recover from a robust workout one intense enough that you cant hold a conversation and return to its previous resting metabolic rate The windfall Your body is actually burning more calories than it normally wouldeven after youve finished exercising Theres a catch though The better shape youre in the less benefit youll get because your fit body replenishes its energy stores efficiently You can improve your burn by increasing how often or how hard you work out think intervals suggests Walt Thompson PhD professor of kinesiology and health and nutrition at Georgia State University Make sure you eat breakfast Eating a nutrientrich morning meal like oatmeal with almonds and berries or a spinachandfeta omelet with a slice of wholegrain toast shortly after getting out of bed literally wakes up your metabolism Eating breakfast gets the engine going and keeps it going Hyman explains Its hard to argue with these results According to the National Weight Control Registry an ongoing study that tracks  people who lost an average of  pounds and kept it off more than five years  of those who keep it off eat an am meal every day Noshing throughout the day is a proven strategy to help you curb hunger and eat fewer calories overall Now experts are promoting nibbling versus gorging as a way to keep metabolism running by holding blood sugar levels steady and preventing weightgainpromoting insulin spikes Enjoying six small meals a day should do the trick keep them around  calories each or divide your usual days calories by six Youve heard theyre bad for you But trans fats also slow down your bodys ability to burn fat They have an altered shape and make your biochemistry run funny Hyman says explaining that trans fat binds to fat and liver cells and slows metabolism Eating trans fat can also lead to insulin resistance and inflammation both of which cripple metabolism and can cause weight gain If youre on the fence about whether to buy organic this news may sway you Fruits vegetables and grains grown without pesticides keep your fatburning system running at fulltilt because they dont expose your thyroid to toxins Hyman says Nonorganic produce on the other hand blocks your metabolism mainly by interfering with your thyroid which is your bodys thermostat and determines how fast it runs he explains Your body digests protein more slowly than fat or carbs so you feel full longer this is especially true when you have it for breakfast Plus it may also give your metabolism a bump In a process called thermogenesis your body uses about  of its calorie intake for digestion So because it takes longer to burn protein than carbs or fat your body expends more energy absorbing the nutrients in a highprotein diet Another bonus One recent study from Purdue University found that diets higher in protein may help preserve lean body mass which is the best fatburner of all
