I have fond memories of listening to NPR while lounging at the physical therapists with a heating pad on my shoulder Dont do that the nations physical therapists association says Heat therapy electrical stimulation ultrasound and other passive physical agents almost never help according to a list released Monday by the Choosing Wisely campaign Instead they siphon time and money away from what you really want from a physical therapist  an exercise program that will restore strength and mobility Well this is certainly going to make physical therapy less restful But seeing as Ive been to several physical therapists over the years and theyve all used this stuff the fact that the   put passive physical agents on top of their list of things not to do seems like big news So I called up   chairman of the department of physical therapy at the University of Pittsburgh to find out what gives He was chairman of the group that wrote the what not to do list for   Its aimed at getting health care professionals and civilians to pick medical treatments that are proven to do good Heating pads in the PTs office alas are not on the list The evidence for any beneficial effect is almost nil Delitto told Shots When I graduated with my physical therapy degree in  these physical agents were a large part of practice Weve had a hard time getting rid of them One reason why Delitto says is that insurers continue to pay for passive physical agents I know my health insurer did The Choosing Wisely campaign which is run by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation aims to put pressure on insurers to change their ways too Also on the physical therapists list If you detect a pattern there youre right The emphasis is on physical activity and on doing it yourself with the guidance of a physical therapist so you work hard enough to get stronger and dont get hurt Youre leaning on the physical therapists expertise to see what activities you can do and how to carry them out on your own Delitto says What to look for so you dont overdo it and how to progress Many physical therapists are hesitant to give older people challenging exercises but as a result the exercises dont do any good We underestimate what they can do Delitto says Its a bit trickier to hit the right balance between challenge and safety he notes but it can be done safely The continuous passive motion machines were thought to prevent stiff knees in people who had knee replacements but  have found that they dont help It turned out to be a very expensive device that was not adding any quality Delitto says But people make money on the machines Physical therapy can be a costeffective first stop for people Delitto says because therapists are trained to recognize when a person needs to see a doctor instead Were sort of an inexpensive route for patients Without the heating pad that is I guess Im going to have to find another place to
