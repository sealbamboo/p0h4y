Call it a mid-summer dimming of the sunshine. U.S. doctors and teaching hospitals remain unable to review an online federal government database of payments they have received from drug and device makers, after a government agency shut it down to investigate a data mix-up.. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services took the so-called “Open Payments” system offline Sunday night and doesn’t have an estimate of when it will be working again, a CMS spokesman said Thursday. The data mix-up involved at least one doctor being able to see the payment data for another doctor whose records were erroneously linked.
