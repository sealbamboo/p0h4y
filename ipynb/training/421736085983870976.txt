When you take a pill you and your doctor hope it will work  and that helps it work Thats not a new idea But now researchers say they know just how much of a drugs effect comes from the patients expectation at least half When patients in the midst of a migraine attack took a dummy pill they thought was a widely used migraine drug it reduced their pain roughly as much as when they took the real drug thinking it was a placebo There was no difference between the pharmacology of the drug in reducing pain and the placebo dressed up with a nice word study author   tells Shots Basically we show that words can actually double the effect of a drug Thats pretty impressive And if it works when treating   it also might work for a wide variety of other ailments from asthma to intestinal cramps to back pain that involve the subjective experience of symptoms The   in this weeks   have interesting implications for doctors and patients because what physicians say about a medication appears to have a lot to do with its benefits Beyond that it raises a question of whether drug companies should take subjects expectations into account when they test a new drug That question may explain why drugmaker Merck helped fund the study along with the National Institutes of Health The study is the latest in a series thats helping to decipher the mysteries of the placebo effect The research is conducted at a newly established   at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and other Boston hospitals The group has shown that placebos rival the effect of active medication in   that   theyre taking a placebo they can get relief from the cramps bloating and diarrhea of irritable bowel syndrome and that those   can activate patients placebo response This time Kaptchuk and colleagues decided to use migraines to untangle the placebo component of patients expectations Migraine is ideal Kaptchuk says I cant think of another instance in which a real disease happens and then disappears and then comes back That allowed the group to test patients responses against themselves by watching what happened during seven successive migraine attacks in  subjects   attacks in all Another advantage is that theres an effective drug   that has been shown to work better than placebo pills The researchers asked all of their subjects to refrain from taking any medication for two hours after the onset of their first migraine Then they were given six envelopes each containing a pill to be taken during their next six migraine attacks Two of the envelopes were labeled Maxalt Two indicated that the pill inside could be either Maxalt or a placebo And two were labeled placebo Subjects rated their amount of pain two hours after taking each pill When subjects took no pills they reported a  percent increase in migraine pain after two hours When they took a placebo that was accurately labeled they reported  percent less pain When they took a Maxalt pill that was properly labeled they reported  percent less pain And when they took a mystery pill that could have been either a placebo or Maxalt they also reported a  percent decrease in pain When subjects took Maxalt that was labeled as placebo their decrease in pain was statistically no different than when they took a placebo labeled as Maxalt We were surprised that the efficacy of Maxalt mislabeled as placebo was not significantly better than the efficacy of placebo mislabeled as Maxalt the researchers write One striking thing in the findings is the power of uncertainty Patients had just as much pain relief when they werent sure whether an envelope contained Maxalt or a placebo Theres something going on here that we dont understand Kaptchuk says But I think uncertainty engages you in a different way It might be analogous he says to how doubt can increase the faith of a religious person  it may strengthen the desire to believe Kaptchuk says a doctors or researchers manner or words had no effect because patients were only influenced by the words on the pillcontaining envelopes Whats exciting is that all we did is change one or two words on an envelope the Harvard researcher says There was no doctorpatient interaction after the first meeting But in one significant way the placebo didnt beat the real drug When the researchers asked patients if they were totally painfree   hours after taking the pills patients said Maxalt was almost four times better   percent versus  percent Thats consistent with previous placebo studies Kaptchuk says For instance the asthma study showed that asthma inhalants open patients airways while placebos dont But placebo inhalers reduce patients perceived symptoms of asthma Being free of migraine pain is a yesno question whereas theres more wiggle room in being asked if pain is lessened Thats a judgment call Kaptchuk says Being painfree is not a judgment call Kaptchuk says the results shouldnt be seen as undermining the effectiveness of Maxalt Its a really good drug If I had migraines Id take this drug too he says But Id want a physician to understand that every word counts
