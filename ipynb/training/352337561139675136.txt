David Green is a man on a mission to drive down the cost of medical devices and health services His tactic Use market forces and slightly tweaked business strategies to make health care accessible to even the poorest people And hes had some amazing success I caught up with Green no relation to NPRs David Greene at a company he is launching in Chicago thats taking on the high cost of hearing aids Hes demonstrating how to program his companys new hearing device on a cellphone So Im putting the device on my ear and Im turning on my Bluetooth enabled phone he says I click personalize on the phone and I start the hearing test And right now Im hearing tones and Im clicking a box It must be the smallest Bluetooth earpiece available  about the size of your thumbnail He has helped create   to market a new highquality hearing device developed by his partner Stavros Basseas The device which we   will be sold in the US But the main market will be in developing countries where it will sell for a couple hundred dollars  a fraction of the cost of highend hearing aids One reason its so cheap is that its based on offtheself Bluetooth components Green says his strategy is to minimize the cost of technology production and distribution so he can push prices to the lowest possible level and force other companies to compete My competitive juices get flowing when I start to think about a big  billion medical device company and how Im going to beat them Green says How do we make sight and hearing or even life itself affordable to poor people That might sound like hopeless idealism but Green has helped create a number of companies that do just that The most notable may be a company named Aurolab in India that manufactures   These lenses are implanted in the eyes of cataract patients to correct their vision At an operating theater at Aravind Eyecare in Madurai India on a reporting trip two summers ago eye surgeon Hari Pria told me about one of the cases This is called the phacoemulsification procedure Pria says describing the use of ultrasound to break up the old lens and remove it This is considered the goldstandard of cataract surgery across the world Aravind does more than  cataract surgeries a year And through Aurolab Green helped drive down the price of the lenses from several hundred dollars apiece to  now Aurolabs lenses have helped millions of people regain their sight Green has also set up eyecare programs in countries from Nepal to Kenya created less expensive testing for people with diabetes and helped set up social investing funds He eschews charity and turns to market forces and business strategies in his enterprises He sets up forprofit companies or nonprofits that run operating surpluses so the firms have the ability to invest and grow Green describes his approach as empathetic capitalism Yes you have to have an economic model that ensures you can be profitable and sustainable he says but how do you channel that sustainability to serving others where you can be in empathy with their predicament with their suffering And in this case we try and address suffering in a very direct and pragmatic way with restoration of sight if somebody is blind or in the case of hearing by helping people who cant hear very well hear again So whats Greens payoff As a more traditional entrepreneur in the medical sphere he could be making millions He says hes happy making between  and  a year He says most of his rewards cant be put in a bank account When I think of Aurolab I think they have helped something like  million people see to date he says And so thats what I have And of course thats something I really cant put in my pocket but maybe from a karmic point of view thats money in the bank I dont know I hope so
