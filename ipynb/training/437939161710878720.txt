Complacency by doctors is leading to late diagnosis of HIV a health group worker has alleged BBC Inside Out has found that  of those diagnosed with HIV in the Eastern region and the Midlands were diagnosed late the highest rate in the UK Cambridgeshire HIV counselling group worker Todd Thorpe said a number of people had come for advice after their GP did not recognise HIV symptoms The Royal College of General Practitioners rejects the criticism A spokeswoman said GPs do receive training provided by groups endorsed by the Royal College Mr Thorpe of Ramsey Cambridgeshire was diagnosed HIV four years ago after he was raped and said he struggled to seek support He now works with counselling group Dhiverse and offers training to GPs but claimed out of  surgeries only two have signed up to training  Mr Thorpe said I believe they have become complacent  Weve had guys go to the GP with their symptoms and not once have they been offered an HIV test Sharron Spindler the chief executive of Dhiverse  said Sadly we have had a number of people who have come to us for support who have been diagnosed late because their GP didnt recognise that they could have HIV so didnt recommend an HIV test  We have also had a couple of reports of GPs telling their patient that it was unlikely they were at risk of HIV because they were married  This shows that there is still some misconception about how HIV is contracted and that you cant be at risk if youre not gay or have been in a number of relationships  Mr Thorpe added  It took me two years to finally seek support and help both for the rape and being HIV positive I didnt tell anyone It just left me devastated Mr Thorpe claimed stories of late diagnosis  made after treatment should have begun  are common He recently supported a man who waited  years to be tested  People are still dying whether through fear ignorance or burying their head in the sand he said It is estimated by Public Health England that one in five people with HIV still goes undiagnosed
