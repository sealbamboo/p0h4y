Changing the way people think about and deal with schizophrenia is a moderately effective treatment say researchers  Cognitive behavioural therapy   but is available to less than  of patients in the UK with schizophrenia  indicates CBT could help the many who refuse antipsychotic medication Experts say larger trials are needed About fourin patients benefit from taking antipsychotic medication  But the drugs do not work for the majority and they cause sideeffects such as type  diabetes and weight gain Up to half of patients with schizophrenia end up not taking the drugs The study looked at cognitive behaviour therapy in  people  The therapy works by identifying an individual patients problem  such as hearing voices paranoid thinking or no longer going out of the house  and developing techniques to deal with them Prof Tony Morrison director of the psychosis research unit at Greater Manchester West Mental Health Foundation Trust said We found cognitive behavioural therapy did reduce symptoms and it also improved personal and social function and we demonstrated very comprehensively it is a safe and acceptable therapy CBT had a moderate effect which was roughly similar to the effect size of antipsychotics  although a headtohead study directly comparing the two therapies have not been made Douglas Turkington professor of psychiatry at Newcastle University said One of our most interesting findings was that when given the option most patients were agreeable to trying cognitive therapy He added that drugs and cognitive therapy combined were the best treatment But while nearly everyone will be offered drugs only a small proportion have access to cognitive behaviour therapy Prof Robin Murray from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London said Many patients dont like to take antipsychotics in the long term this is not surprising as they have significant sideeffects  So what to do for patients with continued psychotic symptoms who dont want to take antipsychotics  Until now little was done except lecture them on how silly this was with the usual result that the patients would simply stop attending  This study suggests that there may be a better option and that offering CBT is better than just leaving such patients to languish
