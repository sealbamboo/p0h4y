When Kwagne Elian came down with a high fever the young woman in Cameroon did what many of us would do in the United States She went to a private health clinic in her neighborhood But unlike the clinic at the local CVS here in the US the one Elian goes to is illegal And its the target of a crackdown by the government Cameroon is tackling a health care crisis The countrys  million people face high rates of HIV malaria and tuberculosis And the country has one of the highest   in the world But public health care is too expensive or simply not available for many families So theyve have turned to unauthorized clinics for care One such clinic is the Family Health Medical Center in Cameroons largest city of   Elian says she goes to this facility because the doctor is understanding and the treatment is affordable They put patients before money and take good care of them she says When you step inside the clinic it feels like walking into someones home To the left theres a room outfitted with an old mattress on a wooden frame and right above it a mosquito net A pregnant woman in distress gave birth to a premature baby there earlier in the day The clinic often receives patients from nearby government hospitals when people run out of money for treatment there says Sylvestre Mebam who operates the Family Health Medical Center Mebam says he also sends people to public facilities when a patients situation is beyond his ability such as the woman whod gone into labor prematurely Her baby died at the state hospital hours after birth Mebam says he treats about  to  people each day And there are hundreds of clinics similar to his around the country But the government sees these private unauthorized facilities as a threat to public health And it has kicked off a campaign to shut them down The clinics that meet standards in regards to their staff equipment and hygiene will be asked to legally register the Ministry of Public Health says The ones that do not successfully register will be closed Most of these clinics do not have the qualified personnel says Dr Henry Luma medical director of the General Hospital in Douala one of the bestequipped facilities in the country And there is no way that they have a system to control the quality of the care they are providing he says There is every right why those clinics should be closed
