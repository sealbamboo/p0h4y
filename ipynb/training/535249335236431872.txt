As a group of celebrities that includes Bono Will Ferrell Morgan Freeman and Ben Affleck calls for increased efforts to battle Ebola the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it was contributing  million for the study of an experimental bloodbased treatment The initial response to the Ebola outbreak was too slow and too uncoordinated said Michael Elliot president of the advocacy organization ONE which launched a celebritystudded media campaign Wednesday Some countries have now stepped up to lead in a big way  with traditional donors like the US UK France and Germany all making meaningful contributions  but this is a global crisis and it demands a global response Elliot said in a prepared announcement The campaign includes   of the performers sitting silently before a camera waiting for the world to take action an Internet petition drive and an   The tracker shows how much money has been pledged by nations versus how much has actually been spent The effort comes as  of Americans express concern that the world beyond the United States would see a large number of Ebola cases over the next year according to   released Wednesday by the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research Of  individuals interviewed across the nation  said they were concerned that the virus might strike themselves or their family The survey also concluded that  of respondents got their information on Ebola from television By comparison only  learned about Ebola from newspapers  from Internet search engines and  from public health officials According to the World Health Organization at least  people have died of Ebola during this outbreak with a total case count of  The WHO acknowledges that its weekly case counts underestimate the true number Ebola cases Most of the cases have occurred in three West African nations Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia In effort to fight the disease which is spread through contact with bodily fluids the WHO has approved the use of experimental drugs and convalescent plasma That action was taken three months ago but production issues and ethical debates have delayed the rollout of these treatments On Tuesday the Gates Foundation said it was committing  million to help launch a trial that will evaluate the use of convalescent blood plasma and various drug candidates including the antiviral compound brincidofovir To date the foundation has invested about  million of an original  million commitment to fight Ebola said a foundation spokesman Trevor DeWitt Roughly  million has gone to support the emergency response and improved disease surveillance and the remainder to research and development investments Blood plasma is the clear part of blood that contains antibodies Researchers say that by taking this plasma from people who have survived an Ebola infection and are no longer sick and giving it to people who are infected with the virus they may be able to boost a patients immune response The technique although used in a number of highprofile Ebola cases in the West remains unproven and critics say its use may be impractical in West Africa due to the risk of passing along other bloodborne pathogens and the lack of proper equipment and medical staff The Gates Foundation initiative which includes more than a dozen partners will attempt to address these concerns by providing three buslike mobile donation units as well as technology that will inactivate a number of blood pathogens Ebola survivors who are potential donors will be tested to ensure that they are cured of Ebola and are not infected with other bloodborne diseases said a foundation news release For added safety the trials use of pathogen inactivation technology will substantially reduce the risk of any transfusiontransmitted infection from blood components Blood plasma will be collected in a process called plasmapheresis in which  whole blood is collected from a donor and separated into plasma and red blood cells The red blood cells are then returned to the donor while the plasma is used to treat a patient Each airconditioned blood collection unit will be equipped with four beds a  reception area and a lab space equipped with a pathogen inactivation system said Vicki Tifft president and chief executive of Clinical Research Management Inc which is overseeing the trial These selfsufficient units are not intended to travel around West Africa but rather be stationary clinics associated with hospital facilities in each of the affected areas Tifft said in an email The mobile units will operate using permanent electrical lines or generators depending on the power supply for each hospital The technology that will be used to inactivate blood pathogens was developed by the Concord Calif firm Cerus Corp The photochemical technology which is called INTERCEPT is awaiting FDA approval but has been authorized for use under an investigational device exemption According to a company statement INTERCEPT uses ultraviolet light to activate an added compound that prevents the replication of DNA and RNA
