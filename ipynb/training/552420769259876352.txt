ve worked as doctor in the NHS for over  years Its a world class institution and was last year   for quality of patient care and value for money by the respected Commonwealth Fund But the position of the NHS as the gold standard of health services is under threat Looking back on the last  months if I had to sum up what  meant for the   it would be the year that the cracks began to show In the last year  more than any other period during my time as a doctor  Ive seen a combination of years of underfunding and an unstoppable rise in demand really start to bite Overstretched services are no longer able to keep up with rising demand patients face longer waits to see their GPs who are now conducting  million more consultations a year than in  AE waiting times are some of the worst theyve been in a decade waiting lists are at a recent high with millions of people waiting for treatment in hospital In  the NHS experienced not just a winter crisis but a spring summer autumn crisis as well with hospitals reaching capacity during the summer months well before the seasonal spike in demand kicked in Doctors nurses and other frontline staff are working flat out but the system simply cant cope with the number of patients coming through the door Staff are left frustrated that time pressures and excessive workloads mean they cant deliver the quality of care that they want to for their patients While workloads are rising wages have been chipped away at and are now at  levels Morale is low This matters because frontline staff are the beating heart of our health service The NHS needs a motivated and enthusiastic workforce if it is to rise to the challenges facing it yet in many parts of the NHS especially general practice and emergency medicine the pressure is becoming too much sparking a recruitment and retention crisis In October talks stalled over changes to consultant and junior doctors contracts with the BMA refusing to agree changes that would compromise patient care and safe working patterns for doctors The doctors pay review body the DDRB has been tasked with looking at the contracts and making recommendations in  on pay and working patterns but doctors faith in the independence of the DDRB has been damaged in recent years as real term cuts to pay have become the norm In the last year weve also started to see the effects of the governments topdown reorganisation take hold Despite politicians claims that the   and Social Care Act would not lead to privatisation  instead marked a year of creeping privatisation Enforcing competition in the NHS has not only led to services being fragmented at a time when we need to deliver more joinedup care but it has also diverted vital funding away from frontline services to costly complicated tendering processes It also means that the NHS is now subject to the same  as banks and supermarkets Were seeing ludicrous examples of NHS providers not being able to bid for the services theyre currently providing because of a perceived conflict of interest and reports of   Looking ahead in the shortterm at least it seems that politicians are finally getting the message on NHS funding While the NHS will be a key election issue this year its crucial that it doesnt become a political football In the longer term the scale of the challenge facing the NHS is eye watering One in three people in the UK are aged over  The number of over s is expected to increase by  in the next  years By  a third of Britons are projected to be obese Remarkable advances in healthcare mean people are living longer and survival rates for diseases such as cancer are improving But this also means more people are living with lifelong conditions such as diabetes and have complex medical needs Unless we find a sustainable way of dealing with an unprecedented rise in demand our health service will not be able to cope If the NHS is to survive then we need to get back to basics  a health service which is properly funded adequately staffed with patients and clinicians in the driving seat Healthcare which is public integrated not a two tier partprivatised health market Its not too late to turn things around but if we dont act now it soon will be Healthcare isnt a privilege or a charity it is a fundamental human right We need to fight for it
