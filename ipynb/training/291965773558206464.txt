Theres no doubt that the plague has staying power The deadly bacterium has probably been infecting people for  years And its genes have   since it killed nearly half of Europes population during The Black Death Now microbiologists have evidence that strains of the plague may be able to reactivate themselves and trigger new outbreaks  even after lying dormant for decades Thats the conclusion of a   just published in   which looked at recent plague outbreaks in Algeria and Libya In Algeria as in many parts of the world the   was thought to be pretty much extinct But plague cases cropped up there in  and again in  Then in  the disease appeared in neighboring Libya after what had been a year hiatus Some epidemiologists assumed that the plague bacteria had simply hopped across the Algerian border into Libya Flea bites   and the fleas love hanging out on rats and other mobile rodents But microbiologist   wasnt so sure about the Algerian connection She thought that perhaps the bacterium could have somehow reactivated itself in Libya and started infecting people after a long dormancy So she and her team at the   in Paris compared the DNA from the bacteria in Libya with samples from Algeria The two sets of sequences didnt match up The plague in Libya most closely resembled bacteria that originated in Central Asia thousands of years ago while the Algerian plague looked like a strain that probably came from Vietnam during World War II We think the plague is extinct in these places but its not Carniel tells Shots The plague is still there Carniel says the plague is probably hiding out in rats and squirrels Its circulating in the rodent reservoirs she says Her team didnt have access to bacteria from older outbreaks in Libya so she couldnt say for sure that the new cases came directly from the old ones But she says there was other evidence  like fleas and rats infected with the same bacteria  supporting her conclusion that the plague can resurface in regions after years of silence This could spell trouble for countries that no longer are looking out for the bacteria she says In many places like the former Soviet Union surveillance for the plague has stopped because of financial reasons or because it was thought to be eliminated she says I hope that I m wrong but Im afraid that the plague will reappear in this part of the world So what triggers its reemergence No one knows for sure Carniel says But the outbreak in Libya came right after an especially humid winter and fleas love humidity she says Plus farmers had a bumper crop that season which probably increased the rat population Carniel thinks that weather changes and increased development around the world could shift where the plague shows up Indeed the bacteria has already shown signs of reactivation elsewhere India had large outbreak in  after  years of being free of plague
