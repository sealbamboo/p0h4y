On Tuesday MPs will decide whether to allow the creation of babies from three people  mum dad and a second donor woman It could prevent deadly mitochondrial disease but has provoked a fierce ethical debate  DNA for mitochondria  tiny compartments within cells which unlock the energy from food  is passed from mothers to children so a donor womans mitochondria might stop the disease Prof Doug Turnbull head of the centre in Newcastle that has pioneered the research said the disease affects organs that are heavily dependent on energy metabolism So in the heart you have cardiac failure progressive weakness in the muscles leading to extreme fatigue and respiratory failure and in the brain epilepsy strokelike episodes and cognitive decline he said In the most severe cases Ive looked after the children died in the first  hours of life That is unusual often these conditions are associated with increasing levels of disability I saw a patient on Tuesday that Ive looked after for  years That patient was one of Prof Turnbulls first when he started out in the field as a young neurologist fascinated about understanding diagnosing and  more recently  preventing the disease The centre in Newcastle sees patients from across the UK and is acknowledged as one of the best in the world for caring for people with mitochondrial disease Yet even with the best available medicine there are many heartbreaking stories including those of families who have lost multiple children  Six of Sharon Bernardis children died within days of birth Her son Edward survived to the age of  although he was often ill Prof Turnbull said the huge desire of families to have healthy children motivated the team at the Newcastle centre Weve been discussing it since  he said It was the stories of the patients the whole team saw over the years that made us go Look weve got to do better We have very limited treatments so the most important thing for those families is to have children that are unaffected The idea featured in a   that year and the Newcastle teams first application for funding was made in  What emerged at Newcastle was a massive team effort between fertility experts doctors caring for patients and experts in the genetics of mitochondria Their objective was to reach a point where healthy DNA from parents could be combined with healthy mitochondria from a donor The proposed therapy  called pronuclear transfer  is controversial Last week the Catholic and Anglican churches urged UK politicians to delay their decision to allow more research and debate The destruction of embryos as part of the process is among the ethical concerns raised Others say it is a first step towards creating socalled designer babies where genetic characteristics could be chosen by parents In pronuclear transfer the mothers egg and the donors egg are both fertilised as part of IVF to create a pair of embryos  The DNA from mum and dad form two balls of genetic information in the embryo called pronuclei which will fuse to create the genetic blueprint for a child These are transferred to the donor embryo which is packed with healthy mitochondria and has its pronuclei removed The Newcastle research passed a significant barrier in  The group published a   showing the technique was possible using eggs that would have been discarded as they were unsuitable for IVF When we published that paper there was a recognition that if we can make this work with abnormal eggs surely we should be moving forward with this Prof Turnbull said He credits his colleague Prof Alison Murdoch from the Newcastle Fertility Centre for having the foresight to begin making the case for starting the process that could lead to a change in the law  She was very wise at the time she said we could get the science finished but if we dont push forward with trying to get the regulations through Parliament then we could get the science sorted and it could take years to go through he said This is one of many times Prof Turnbull diverts the attention to colleagues  particularly to Prof Mary Herbert another leader in the field of mitochondrial transfer He comes across as a man keenly aware he needs to make the case but unwilling to be the centre of attention An awful lot of expertise has to go into developing anything like this this is a massive team effort he said This has never been about the scientist its about the patients The    left provision for babies to be created from material provided by two women But it required a debate and a vote in both the Commons and the Lords for it to be enacted Five years three scientific reviews and a public consultation later the UK is about to decide The whole process has been suitably rigorous and the UK should be suitably proud of its ability to regulate in such a sensitive area Prof Turnbull said However there was a sense of frustration in his voice when I suggested things had progressed quickly since  It was first mooted in  discussed extensively prior to the  act a lot of the ground work was done in  he said Is that quick Any child born through this technique would have about  of their DNA from their parents But mitochondria have their own DNA so that   It has given rise to the headline that frustrates many in the field Threeparent babies Prof Turnbull responds We know precisely what those genes do Those mitochondria are not going to influence any of the characteristics of these children theyre going to provide healthy mitochondria But its a catchy headline Do I think its accurate Of course I dont Is there anything I can do about it Even less he concludes with a resigned chuckle  But the headlines point to a deeper issue The change to the childs genetic composition will be passed down through the generations It is known as germline therapy and is illegal in many countries  Some argue we are   and opening the door to other forms of genetic modification of children I put these arguments to Prof Turnbull I think people are perfectly entitled to their view Ive always felt that he said That the critics say I wouldnt have this is of course reasonable but I think the thing we all struggle with here at Newcastle is that they are denying other people the right to make those sorts of decisions When you talk to patients with mitochondrial disease they want to make those decisions If the vote in the Commons goes through on Tuesday and the House of Lords agrees in the coming weeks the UK fertility regulator could grant Newcastle the first license this year The first attempt would then be expected this year with the first baby born in  Prof Turnbull admits to being a natural pessimist and says he is anxious ahead of the vote by MPs His final argument is This is research that has been suggested by the patients supported by patients and is for the patients and thats an important message
