A new centre dedicated to studying brain development in newborn babies and assessing those at risk of brain damage has officially opened in Cambridge The Evelyn Perinatal Imaging Centre at the Rosie Hospital is equipped with noninvasive optical imaging scanners research facilities and a laboratory The centres Dr Topun Austin said the unit could help babies deprived of oxygen or blood flow during delivery These infants can experience lifelong neurological problems he said These facilities help us identify babies at risk of longterm brain injury and better understand how they respond to different treatments Dr Austin a consultant neonatologist at the Rosie added To date weve been very good at looking at what the brain looks like in terms of structural brain imaging This new centre is about trying to understand how the brain works as well as what it looks like The centre is close to the maternity hospitals neonatal intensive care unit birthing suites and postnatal wards As much of the equipment is portable staff can monitor sick babies at their bedside rather than moving them to another unit The goal is to identify those infants who are most vulnerable of injury and problems later in life and also look at the response to treatments were developing on the intensive care unit and see how those treatments affect brain development Dr Austin said By getting a handle on how the brain is working well be better able to predict those babies who are most at risk The centre was funded by a grant from the Evelyn Trust a charity which supports medical research and healthcare in Cambridgeshire
