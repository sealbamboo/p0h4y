A   by the dairy industry to allow milk sweetened with aspartame or other alternative sweeteners to be labeled on the front of the carton simply as MILK is drawing criticism from the nations leading group of nutritionists The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is urging the FDA to reject the petition which we first   in March The Academys   to deny the petition is not based on the safety of artificial sweeteners writes Ethan Bergman the groups president in a release explaining its opposition So whats the academys rationale Well as we previously reported the petition is aimed at boosting consumption in schools where many kids have decided that milk is not their drink of choice Given the options of water juice or milk milk is losing out Studies show that offering flavored milk such as chocolate or strawberry turns more kids on to milk but critics have pointed to the extra sugar as a drawback In an effort to get around the sugar problem the dairy industry has petitioned to change whats known as the standard of identity of milk which is basically the definition of milk allowing aspartame or alternatives such as stevia to be used to sweeten the milk So whats the academys beef with the petition Well it goes back to the assertion that the dairy industry makes in its petition that the change allowing no or lowcalorie sweeteners in milk could promote healthful eating and help reduce childhood obesity Not necessarily says the academy Flavored milk is not a major source of added sugar in childrens diets says Bergman The academy points to studies including   one that show that schoolage kids who drink flavored chocolate and strawberry milk meet more of their nutrient needs and dont consume more added sugar fat or calories These kids are also similar in weight compared to nonmilk drinkers according to a statement released by the academy In other words theres no need to try to cut sugar and calories with artificial sweeteners And theres criticism among consumers too A petition by the group Sum Of Us which says the goal of the dairy industry petition is to turn the wholesome drink milk into another artificial flavorladen sweet snack has received about  signatures
