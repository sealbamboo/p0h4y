Hospital mistakes and infections are still one of the leading causes of preventable death indeed   hospitalacquired conditions kill more people than car accidents or diabetes   True a   saving tens of thousands of lives But what else can hospitals do to    Can technology like eprescriptions and electronic health records prevent problems that most often occur the     It has been called   The World Health Organization calls antibiotic resistant infections   Each year   become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least  people die each year   Most of these deaths   How can we respond Well research teams around the world have already started searching for the next generation of infectionfighting drugs But it remains to be seen if time will run out   a time before antibiotics where even a cut that becomes infected could kill you   Technology has made   much easier  This goes beyond just    There are apps to help with autism apps that can   apps that can monitor conditions Wearables can motivate you to walk more or sleep more or check a diabetics glucose level But how does all this  make your health care better   How much is too much And what does this mean for your privacy After all the health care industry   Meanwhile although  of health care data requires protection by law some surveys suggest only  of it is somewhat protected What could this mean for your privacy and personal information if security doesnt get better  While not everyone agrees with the term food desert the    million people live in these urban neighborhoods and rural towns with   to fresh affordable healthy food  Without grocery stores in these areas residents often have to rely on fast food and convenience stores that dont stock fresh produce It takes a real toll on their health Families who live in these areas struggle more with obesity and chronic conditions and they   than people who live in neighborhoods with easy access to healthy food  More farmers markets are now accepting food stamps and many nonprofits have stepped in to try to bring community gardens and healthy food trucks to these areas but so far its not enough  Will cities offer incentives to grocery store chains to relocate to these neighborhoods     We are heading into a kind of caregiver crisis  The number of people  years and older is   between  and  yet the number of family members who can provide care for these older adults is only expected to rise  This raises a series of related questions not least who is going to step up to fill the gaps  Will cities that dont traditionally have strong public transportation systems add to their routes Will developers create more mixeduse buildings to make shopping and socializing easier to access  Could the government create a kind of caregiver corps that could check in on the isolated elderly  Who will pay for this expensive kind of safety net  Currently   That number is expected to double every  years With a cure some way off what can be done to ease the emotional and financial burden on families and communities affected by the disease The   that by  US costs for care will total  trillion making it the most expensive condition in the nation  How will we be able to afford the costs of caring for this population What can the country do to achieve the goal the White House set for preventing and effectively treating Alzheimers by  With the growing acceptance of weed   will change to allow medical and recreational use of marijuana   How will the rest of the laws in this country adjust  For instance Washington state is coming up with a Breathalyzertype device to check if drivers are high But it will be interesting to see how   Will legalization improve the scientific understanding of the longterm consequences of the drug What other uses could this drug have to help those who may need pain relief most Americans spend more time on the job than most other developed countries We dont get as much vacation we dont take what vacation we have and we are prone to working nights and weekends This stress has a negative impact on Americans health  What are companies doing to help What technology can change this phenomenon Will millennials who say worklife balance is a bigger priority than other generations rub off on the rest of us What can we personally do to    We may not be able to answer all these questions in  but we sure will try  And the health team and I look forward to exploring these issues with you in the coming New Year
