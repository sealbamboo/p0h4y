The Ebola epidemic is still far from being under control but a few successes show it can be slowed down the World Health Organization said Monday About  cases of Ebola have been reported in West Africa and more than  people have died but the case count is slowing in Liberia and stable in Guinea WHO assistant secretarygeneral Bruce Aylward said However the most optimistic forecasts dont have the epidemic under control until the middle of next year and even that might not be possible without steppedup aid efforts In some areas aid groups and WHO have achieved their goal of making  percent of all burials safe Aylward said But the virus is still spreading out of control in western Sierra Leone and its moved to rural hardtoreach areas There is no room for optimism as long as you are dealing with an Ebola virus Aylward told a news conference The disease has already started to slow down in some areas he added That includes parts of Liberia and the two major cities in Guinea Gueckedou and Conakry The good news  is that in all three countries it is clear now that more than  percent of the Ebola deaths that we know about are buried safely Safe burials are one of the three keys to stopping an Ebola outbreak WHO says The other two are immediate isolation of patients before they can infect others and meticulous tracing of all people who have been in contact with a patient so they can be watched and isolated if need be Much of the spread of Ebola in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea can be blamed on funeral practices that are similar to burials around the world  washing the body and hugging or kissing the body Ebola virus builds up in patients as they get sicker and the bodies of people who die of Ebola are frequently awash with the virus So people have to be first persuaded and then helped to change their practices A couple of really bad burials and couple of really bad events and couple of really bad infections in hospital settings  things can really turn around quickly Aylward said And people are still carrying the virus from one region to another The intensity of the Ebola transmission in some parts of Sierra Leone is very high and the situation is getting serious each day and could worsen UN Ebola chief Dr David Nabarro told reporters in Freetown Sierra Leone But aid efforts are having an effect Ebola treatment units safe burial teams and teams of experts tracing contacts have started to change the trajectory of infections in some areas Aylward said In the last  days across the three countries there has basically been a doubling of the number of Ebola beds Aylward said In Sierra Leone for example there were  beds devoted to treating Ebola patients in September Now there are  And treating people does make a difference Aylward said the death rate is about  percent for people who dont get any treatment at all while it drops to about  percent for those who are treated Very definitely you can catch up with Ebola even on this scale That is a very important message Aylward said Still more money people are supplies are desperately needed WHO said  billion was needed for the immediate response but so far only  million has been spent Gaps in funding result in real gaps in operations he said And it doesnt take long for people to become complacent In Liberia for example Aylward says he has seen people cramming into taxis again and you were already seeing a little bit of loosening of that handwashing behavior The risk is still very very high he added So long as theres a single case of Ebola he said the risk remains that it will spread This all began with one case Youve got to find every single case
