The news that the cost of personal genome sequencing will soon drop as low as  has generated a quite a bit of interest and concern  from medical researchers biotech companies bioethicists and the average consumer alike NPRs Rob Stein explored many of the implications of this technology in his fourpart series   Theyre complicated to say the least How many people out there would be willing to get their entire genome mapped And are they prepared for the revelations it could make about their health and risk for disease So we decided to ask you readers of Shots in an online survey we added to Steins posts from the series The survey is certainly not scientific But given the interest in the series we thought a few questions would be worth a try It turns out the respondents leaned strongly in favor of the tests and the insight they may lend to understanding health First we asked Would you have your genome sequenced if you could afford it Of the  people who participated  percent said yes About  percent were undecided while  percent said no Next we asked If you had your genome sequenced would you want to know everything As Stein reported even   who shared a   for discovering the structure of DNA told the researchers who sequenced his genome that he didnt want to know the tests prediction for Alzheimers Theres nothing you can do to prevent it so why would you want to know Watson said About  people weighed in on this question and the majority  percent said would they would want all the details while  percent said they would not and  percent said they werent sure So it seems among the people who weighed in on Shots at least most welcome the arrival of this tool and are hungry to learn from it Thats despite the possibility of discovering some unsavory risks they hadnt anticipated
