I ran into my father at a deli the other day An undramatic encounter I was waiting at the counter for a takeout order when I spotted him sitting at a corner table yakking with friends from his senior residence their walkers and canes carefully folded or propped against the wall I was happy to see him and we had a hug and a few words I kibitzed with his buddies for a moment too Then we said goodbye and I went on my way without thinking much about it because after all we would go out for lunch together on Saturday the way we usually did Dad looked fine except perhaps for a lessthanflattering white sweater he didnt in reality own In my dream  thats what this was  I didnt know that he had died He has been   now so I was glad to have this fleeting visit I once dreamed of my late mother too a hippie version of Ruth Span standing on a hilltop in a gauzy flowered dress and long windblown curls She actually wore polyester pantsuits and had sprayed hair that gales couldnt rearrange Are people undergoing makeovers in the afterlife My sister has also occasionally dreamed about our parents Seeing Dad left me wondering how often deceased family members enter their survivors dreams and what we know about what  if anything  that means So I called Alessandra Strada a clinical psychologist and director of integrative medicine and bereavement services at MJHS Hospice and Palliative Care in New York She has listened to patients talk about their dreams for  years Dreams are quite a prevalent component of the bereavement process Dr Strada told me In fact a study recently published in The American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care surveyed  caregivers mean age  nearly  percent of whom reported   in hospice care When and how often we experience such dreams vary enormously We dream of someone who died last week or years ago the dreams come sporadically or repeatedly they are reassuring or sometimes troubling If you have had dreams of the departed Id like to hear about them We know theyre mostly related to waking life experiences Dr Strada said We process events that occur in our lives almost like digesting Theorists have tried to identify common categories of bereavement dreams In the hospice study respondents most often described pleasant memories of loved ones who died and saw them as free of disease But sometimes they dreamed of family members during their illnesses too There are dreams where the person who died is not dead and the griever has an interaction with him Dr Strada said The sometimes surprised survivor may see a chance to behave differently than when the person was alive Theres a doover she said And in many cases the doover doesnt succeed and thats unpleasant In other dreams the deceased appears and dispenses advice  even about everyday questions like whether the survivor should move or take a new job People find these comforting Dr Strada said  evidence of a continuing bond Dreams can offer resolution too especially if the survivor feels he or she should have somehow prevented death The person who died appears and explains There was nothing you could do It was my time Dr Strada said It relieves some of the guilt People with religious orientations sometimes describe the loved one as bathed in light More distressingly survivors tangle with unresolved matters in dreams Dr Strada remembers a patient in her late s whose mother had died Because the family had little preparation or understanding of how sick she was they had expected her to recover instead she endured emergency hospitalizations and a difficult death  Afterward her daughter repeatedly dreamed about trying to reach her mothers bedside and being thwarted unable to get there in time She awakened feeling guilty and griefstricken But Dr Strada said the content of dreams changes over time As psychotherapy helped the daughter accept what had happened the scenario involving her mother shifted She had dreams where she was able to hug her and it was extremely healing to have that goodbye to rewrite the script Dr Strada said Sometimes Dr Strada finds caregivers under pressure dream about relatives deaths before they occur  anticipatory grief  triggering a range of emotions including relief and guilt Because they are so common dreams about those weve lost probably shouldnt worry us unless they repeatedly interfere with sleep or affect our ability to function The question is when one wakes up what feeling is left Dr Strada said Is there distress People who awaken weeping night after night without relief might consider a support group bereavement counseling or individual therapy I wasnt distressed though I awakened remembering the dream and feeling glad for the moment Id had with my father who was enjoying schmoozing and eating just as he had during his  years of life They are going to be present in our lives forever Dr Strada said of the departed And sometimes they show up
