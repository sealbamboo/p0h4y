In January parttime workers who have socalled minimed health insurance plans with very limited benefits and annual caps on payments will begin to lose that coverage Under the health care overhaul they   after the beginning of the year For some that may be just as well Parttimers likely will have better options in January Minimed plans often favored by retailers and restaurants with lots of lowwage and parttime workers generally provide an extremely limited range of benefits and total coverage may be capped at just a few thousand dollars a year After the Affordable Care Act passed in  nearly all plans were required to eliminate lifetime and annual dollar limits on benefits But some businesses that offered minimed plans said that if they had to conform to the new rules they would drop the plans Their workers would lose what little protection they had Some employers received waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services that permitted them to continue offering the limited plans temporarily Starting in January they cant offer plans that have annual benefit caps although some large employers   When Roberta Grindle was diagnosed with colon cancer in October she blew through the  coverage limit on her minimed plan almost immediately Grindle  worked  hours a week at a bigbox store near her home in Sebring Fla and paid  every two weeks for the stores plan the only coverage available to parttime workers She woke up with severe pain in her lower abdomen one morning and drove herself to the emergency room Doctors suspected a ruptured appendix and while performing emergency surgery discovered a cancerous tumor in her colon Grindle needs a second surgery to remove the tumor but has had to delay it until she recovers from an infection She says she doesnt know how shell pay for her medical care but its certainly not going to be with the coverage she had on the job I have no idea what exactly it covered but clearly not much of anything she says I would have been better off without it Most employers dont offer parttimers any coverage at all Only a quarter of companies that offered employee health insurance made coverage available to parttime workers in  according to the   Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation When they do offer health insurance the coverage is often not equivalent to that available to fulltime workers Existing plans are not going to be super robust says Tracy Watts a senior partner at human resources consultant Mercer Parttimers might be offered access to fulltime benefits but have to pay more for them or might not be eligible at all and just get a minimed plan The health law requires that employers offer health insurance to employees who work at least  hours a week or face penalties starting in January but the Obama administration delayed that provision until  With the delay speculation over whether employers would reduce workers hours in order to avoid penalties has subsided at least for now Many parttime workers will have more options for better coverage starting in January If their employer doesnt offer a health plan they can shop for insurance on the online marketplaces and subsidies will be available to those with incomes up to  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual in  If they do have access to coverage on the job parttimers can still shop on the exchanges but theyll only qualify for subsidies if the jobbased insurance costs more than  percent of their family income or pays less than  percent of medical costs on average In addition parttimers may be eligible for Medicaid if they live in a state thats expanding coverage to adults with incomes up to  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual in  The health law requirement was made optional following a Supreme Court challenge half of the states have so far opted to expand eligibility As for Grindle Medicaid isnt likely an option since   She and her husband whos  and on Medicare have a combined income of  each month about  percent of the federal poverty level of  for a couple in  With a premium subsidy Grindle can buy a silver plan on the exchange for about  a month according to Laurel Lucia a policy analyst with the Center for Labor Research and Education at University of California Berkeley Though more expensive than the roughly  a month Grindle paid for her minimed plan the coverage would definitely be better than the minimed they had says Lucia Grindle says she plans to apply for coverage on the marketplace soon As for the bills shes racking up now shes been talking with the hospital to see what can be done Im just not letting it get me down she says Im just going to put the bills in a file What can you do Its a shame because weve had excellent credit all our lives
