About three million people who developed tuberculosis in  have been missed by health systems the World Health Organization has said Finding these missed cases is one of the biggest challenges in TB care and control the WHOs report says Twelve countries including India South Africa and Bangladesh account for the majority of undiagnosed individuals But the WHO says the target to halve the number of TB deaths by  is still within reach Global TB programme director Dr Mario Raviglione said  million people had been cured and  million lives had been saved in the past  years and half of the highestburden countries were on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals targets but there remained a number of major challenges The two major challenges we identified are that of detecting in the system what we call the missed cases he told the BBC  There are about three million people that we estimate had TB and that are not officially in the system that are not reported  Some of them may actually be never detected some of them are in fact hidden in the private sector in the nonstate sector that does not notify the cases  So that is I think one of the biggest challenges we have to face and there are opportunities there because we know where these cases may be The WHO says TB testing services need to be urgently improved in many countries with help from nongovernmental organisations NGOs and volunteers  And in others particularly Asian countries more needs to be done to ensure figures on TB are compiled and reported centrally  The other major challenge highlighted is drugresistant TB  The WHO estimates that  people became ill with multidrugresistant TB MDRTB in   China India and Russia have the highest rates But the report adds that by  deaths from TB had been reduced by  since  meaning the target of a  reduction by  is within reach  Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF infectious disease specialist Dr Philipp du Cros said Three in four people with multidrugresistant tuberculosis are still not diagnosed and  of those diagnosed in  did not even start treatment He said These shocking figures are an indictment of the global failure to tackle drugresistant tuberculosis head on People are paying for this failure with their lives Dr Du Cros added Unless we take urgent action we will continue to see an increase in hardertotreat drug resistant strains of TB He said more research was needed to make treatments for TB shorter more effective and less damaging for patients  An extra bn was needed to plug a funding gap in the treatment of TB he added
