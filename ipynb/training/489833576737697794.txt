NPRs   is in Sierra Leone covering the Ebola outbreak that began in March in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries When we spoke Thursday  he had just toured the treatment center built by Doctors Without Borders in the town of   With  beds its the largest Ebola isolation ward ever built Currently there are  patients Never a dull day here Its basically a compound with a series of different tents There are tents where people get suited up to go in Another tent seems to be for storage and one of the tents contains a lab  Then theres a double fence about   feet high made of orange plastic mesh They designed the fence so people can see where the patients are so it wouldnt seem as if the patients are completely walled off So no one can get within  feet  of someone who has Ebola In case a patient from the isolation area reaches out or vomits Doctors Without Borders wants to make sure there wont be any accidental contamination Doctors go into the isolation area completely suited up do their rounds and write down whats happening with patients Then they stand next to the fence and shout out to people on the other side of the fence information about each patient Say for patient  the doctor says diarrhea vomiting Then the doctors notes made inside the isolation area are burned They have a big pit in the back They burn everything They say nothing comes out of isolation  although obviously theyre taking blood samples out People come out They strip off their protective gear the   they put over their entire body and shoes When they get suited up you do not see a bit of skin as theyre going in There are multiple layers of gloves goggles a mask As theyre coming out all that stuff gets stripped off Some things like rubber aprons and boots are disinfected and reused But they burn the whole suit A suit costs about  euros  about  and they use  or  suits a day A cloth similar to a painters suit But I assume its a little more rugged There are about nine tents inside with patients separated by whether they are suspect probable or confirmed cases And theres a morgue made of rough wooden twobyfours wrapped in a gray tarp with a tin roof Because they are completely covered when they come out they are dripping in sweat and pretty exhausted The temperature varies When its overcast its in the high s or low s But as soon as the sky clears temperatures shoot up into the s and it gets quite hot But its the rainy season and were getting a fair amount of relief from the intense sun with rainstorms that come in Thats a bit of a problem Construction workers are going into the treatment area to put up black netting so the patients have places to sit in the shade The construction workers suit up in personal protective equipment They take their hammers and saws in and have to leave the tools there In this sun the workers cant be there very long As soon as they come out of the isolation area they have to take off this suit that costs  euros which gets burned Then theyre sent back in in another suit There have been intense storms like sheets of water dumping down and the storms rip the shade structures theyre trying to put up So the workers have to go back to repair them It is Some people dont want to work there because their families are terrified of infection Families will sometimes tell them not to come home They have to pay people incentives especially people theyre sending in to clean up the wards the vomit the diarrhea Doctors Without Borders wouldnt allow me in Thats their policy And quite frankly Im fine with that
