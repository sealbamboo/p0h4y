An expansion of weight loss surgery in England is being proposed to tackle an epidemic of type  diabetes  New draft guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence NICE aim to reduce debilitating complications  Diabetes UK estimates  people could be eligible for surgery but NICE expects it to be tens of thousands  Type  diabetes is closely linked to lifestyle and obesity  Wales and Northern Ireland are not bound by the guidance but do tend to follow them closely The inability to control blood sugar levels can result in blindness amputations and nerve damage A mounting body of evidence suggests a gastric bypass improves symptoms in around  of patients  is spent on diabetes The surgery can cost between  and  and the move by NICE has raised concerns that the NHS will not be able to afford the treatment even if there are savings in the longer term Current guidance says surgery is an option for people with a BMI above  who have other health conditions Bariatric surgery also known as weight loss surgery is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat This type of surgery is only available on the NHS to treat people with potentially lifethreatening obesity when other treatments have not worked Around  people a year are currently receiving the treatment The two most common types of weight loss surgery are The update in guidance strengthens the focus on those with type  diabetes  It explicitly states that people who have been diagnosed in the past decade and have a BMI over  should be assessed for surgery The guidelines also suggests doctors should consider those with a BMI of  or more on a casebycase basis  It means a man who is ft m tall and weighs st lb kg would be sent for an assessment and doctors would be expected to consider sending a ft in m woman weighing st lb kg as well Diabetes UK says around  people will meet the criteria for an automatic assessment under the guidance But the total jumps nearer to  when those with a BMI of  are also considered it says The figures may be even higher as those of Asian descent should be considered at lower but unspecified BMIs But NICEs Prof Mark Baker who drafted the guidelines said it was ridiculous to think so many people would be operated on He told the BBCs website The first line of attack will be diet and exercise and we would expect clinicians to consider the risks and benefits of surgery for patients He said some would not be operated on because of age concluding It would be between  and  operations a year but we havent done the modelling And speaking to the Today programme he said evidence showed that relatively early bariatric surgery in the course of overweight peoples disease can make their diabetes much easier to manage and in a proportion of cases actually reverse the diagnosis Simon ONeill from Diabetes UK said bariatric surgery should only be considered as a last resort And Baroness Barbara Young the charitys chief executive told the BBC Give me the  quid that you would spend on an operation and put it into a weight reduction programme earlier on and we could win Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum also told the BBC A considerable number of people who have had diabetes for some time and have been receiving medication will see a way out which has been sanctioned by NICE and theyll say thats for me  But the problem is the health service is going to say No were out of money you cant have it and thats going to create great friction James Halstead a bariatric surgeon at Leeds Nuffield hospital said recent data showed that the number of NHSfunded bariatric surgical procedures in the UK was falling not rising Its falling from such an incredibly low baseline level of around  cases annually that the idea that one can deal with  people in the next three years with this avenue alone is nonsensical he said As with so many policy decisions its all about costs and benefits NICE is insistent that the cost of bariatric surgery is more than outweighed by what might have been necessary to care for deteriorating health perhaps running to hundreds of thousands of pounds over a patients lifetime But the proposal will potentially more than double the number of operations carried out in England Patient awareness of the procedure is growing   It is another example of a demand pressure on the NHS Budget   A growing population and the increasing needs of the elderly are creating stresses and strains for health service finances   In the case of obesity many experts are stressing that the answer is prevention and education and that surgery on the NHS is no long term solution Meanwhile the same guidance also says people should not be put on extreme diets to help them lose weight NICE acknowledges the diets have become increasingly popular but warns they do not keep weight off in the longterm A very lowcalorie diet consists of fewer than  calories a day The normal level advised for an average man is  calories and for a woman it is  Prof Baker earlier said new draft guidance recommended low calorie diets should not be used routinely for the obese  The diets can still be used in the shortterm for a maximum of  weeks for rapid weight loss before hip or knee replacement surgery or to meet criteria for fertility treatment  The guidance states that regaining weight is likely but that is not down to either their own or their clinicians failure Prof Baker told the Today programme The mainstay of weight reduction in people who are obese whether they have diabetes or not continues to be diet and exercise But for some people whose lives are threatened by the fact that they have diabetes can be transformed if they are offered they are offered bariatric surgery earlier than our current guidance would allow
