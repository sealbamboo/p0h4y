Any athlete will tell you Rest and recovery are critical to any workout regimen John Platero director of education for the National Council for Certified Personal Trainers created this threemove pool circuit to provide a recovery workout that will get your heart pumping even as it helps care for hardworking joints As we get older we tend to move less and less Platero says and thats why the pool is magic It acts as a compression sleeve protecting the joints When youre doing these moves Platero said dont think workout  think controlled movement with the resistance coming from the water Ideally this circuit  the scarecrow the Michael Jackson and the bear hug  is done in water thats roughly chestdeep Please keep safety in mind Youre likely to get winded so you might want to stay near the edge of the pool where you can rest and catch your breath Gives you a recovery workout on days when your body needs a break but you still want a calorie burn If you wear a heartrate monitor youll be surprised to see how this circuit sends your heart soaring with very little impact  Gently squat in the water until its shoulder depth Position your upper arms straight out at your side and your hands up palms facing forward like a scarecrow Hold your core tight as you lower and raise your forearms slicing through the water Let your comfort level dictate your range of motion This mimics a move you likely saw from the performer Raise the knee to hip height and then gently sway the foot and ankle side to side for an inner and outer leg workout Alternate legs You can bend the knee so your foot is reaching out behind you or simply allow it to dangle as the foot and ankle sway  Gently squat in the water until its shoulder depth Bring your arms forward and around like youre hugging a barrel Then reverse the movement so you squeeze the shoulder blades and stretch the chest muscles The faster you go the harder it will be This is going to really help your posture Platero said Perform these three moves in a circuit with  to  repetitions for each move Repeat the circuit three to five times Over time add more repetitions
