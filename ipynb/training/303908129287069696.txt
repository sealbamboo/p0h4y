 Once you develop a cough how many days should you expect to have it Researchers at the University of Georgia in Athens found that our expectations for how long a cough should last dont quite match up with reality and that this gap may account for why so many people go to their doctors and ask for antibiotics when they have a cough The researchers looked at data in  studies that included  to  subjects each to find out how long an acute cough lasted in patients with    a condition people often refer to as a chest cold as opposed to a head cold in which the symptoms are mostly nasal They found the average duration of a cough among the people in the studies was  days Then they surveyed almost  adults to find out if their expectations for how long a cough should last matched up with clinical data In the survey they asked about  Georgia residents  yearsold and older Suppose that you get sick and the main symptom is a cough You are coughing up yellow mucus and have a slight fever You are not taking any medicine for the cough About how long do you expect that it will take from the time you first feel sick until the time where you feel well and the cough is gone Study author Mark Ebell MD Associate Professor at the College of Public Health at the university says that those polled generally thought a cough should last an average of seven to nine days Men and nonwhite respondents predicted a shorter cough duration while those with selfreported asthma or chronic lung disease predicted a longer cough duration I knew that bronchitis will often last a couple of weeks but I wanted to see if this was my impression or if it is real says Dr Ebell Now we have pretty good evidence the mismatch between patient expectations and clinical data is real so we need to do more to educate patients about what they can expect when they get a chest cold He says he often sees patients in his practice who if they dont get better from bronchitis after four or five days think they need antibiotics As soon as people see a doctor for a cough or cold he says  percent or more will get an antibiotic for it while only a small percentage would need an antibiotic or benefit from it Of course some people with a chest cold or cough should seek treatment from a doctor those who are chronically ill elderly or very young or patients who are short of breath or cough up blood But most people dont fit in those categories and could ride out the sickness and let the cough run its course  without taking antibiotics says Ebell There are many downsides to taking antibiotics One of the main reasons physicians worry about overprescription of antibiotics is that they are concerned bacteria will become resistant to the medicines available which could be dangerous for those who develop   or another serious infection and desperately need antibiotics to work Another reason is nasty side effects About  to  percent of those that take antibiotics experience diarrhea nausea or vomiting and in some cases people develop severe diarrhea that can be lifethreatening and lead to hospitalization Ebell says Theres also the cost of antibiotics Going to the doctor and paying for antibiotics is a lot more costly and timeconsuming than simply going to the nearest drug store for an overthecounter cough medicine Ebell says We spend so much more than any other country in the world on healthcare because were spending money on things that dont make us healthier and this is a good example of that The study was published in the JanuaryFebruary issue of the  While many coughs can be treated with an overthecounter cold medication and Moms advice to rest up and drink lots of fluids sometimes a   Make sure you see a doctor if your cough is accompanied by chest pain wheezing or shortness of breath if you cough up blood or yellow or green mucus if you have a fever of  or higher if youve lost weight or if youre soaking the sheets with night sweats A cough that lingers past eight weeks is considered a chronic cough and could be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma   smoking and in rare cases even lung cancer
