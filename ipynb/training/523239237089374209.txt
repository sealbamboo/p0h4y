Remember how challenging it was to navigate the new government database of payments made by drug and medical-device makers to U.S. doctors? Well, the transparency initiative just became a little easier to use – more than two weeks after the database was posted online.. Late Friday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services issued a so-called beta release of an online search tool on its Open Payments website. The tool lets you search by a physician’s name, location or specialty, as well as by the names of teaching hospital and companies. The results list each individual payment, which can be sorted from high to low, and vice versa.
