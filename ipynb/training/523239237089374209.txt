Remember how challenging it was to navigate the new government database of payments made by drug and medicaldevice makers to US doctors Well the transparency initiative just became a little easier to use  more than two weeks after the database was posted online Late Friday the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services issued a socalled beta release of an online search tool on its Open Payments website The tool lets you search by a physicians name location or specialty as well as by the names of teaching hospital and companies The results list each individual payment which can be sorted from high to low and vice versa
