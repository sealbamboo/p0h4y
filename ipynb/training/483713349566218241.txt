In a  decision Monday the Supreme Court allowed a key exemption to the health laws contraception coverage requirements when it ruled that closely held forprofit businesses could assert a religious objection to the Obama administrations regulations What does it mean Here are some questions and answers about the case The courts majority said that the forprofit companies that filed suit  Hobby Lobby Stores a nationwide chain of  arts and crafts stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties a maker of custom cabinets  didnt have to offer female employees all Food and Drug Administrationapproved contraceptives as part of a package of preventive services that must be covered without copays or deductibles under the law The companies had argued that several types of contraceptives violate their owners religious beliefs The ruling also covers a Hobby Lobby subsidiary the Mardel Christian bookstores As part of the laws coverage of preventive health services health insurance plans are required to cover all    for women without any costsharing such as deductibles or copayments Those methods include birth control pills intrauterine devices and sterilization procedures Employers with  or more workers that offer coverage that doesnt meet that standard would face fines of  These large employers that dont offer any coverage face a fine of  for most employees The contraceptive guidelines apply to women only Writing for the majority Justice Samuel Alito stated that Hobby Lobby would have faced fines of  million a year and Conestoga  million for excluding some forms of birth control from their health plans If the employers had decided to drop coverage altogether Hobby Lobby would have paid roughly  million in penalties and Conestoga  million far less than the fine for not covering all FDAapproved methods of birth control The Department of Health and Human Services set the contraception requirement based on an Institute of Medicine study that   prescription contraception and services including all FDAapproved methods of contraception be included as preventive services for women Most health plans had to cover contraceptive services for plan years beginning on or after Aug     HHS   that hadnt changed significantly after the health law passed do not have to offer preventive health care  including contraception  without costsharing Hobby Lobby and Conestoga are familyowned and they said that the health laws contraception requirement   While both employers health plans cover some forms of birth control the employers object to emergency contraceptives such as Plan B and Ella that can prevent a pregnancy if taken within a short window after unprotected sex The owners contend that these contraceptive methods prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womans uterus and therefore are a type of abortion Hobby Lobbys owners also object to two types of intrauterine devices or IUDs for the same reason The companies argued that they should be exempted from the contraceptive requirement because the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA says that the government may not pose a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion unless that burden is the narrowest possible way to further a compelling government interest The federal government and advocates for the health laws contraception requirements argued that only individuals  not corporations  can exercise religious rights No US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said during the oral arguments in the case on behalf of the Obama administration Federal law and State law  which do preclude funding for abortions  dont consider these particular forms of contraception to be abortion A   filed by  medical groups led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists noted there is a scientific distinction between a contraceptive and an abortifacient and the scientific record demonstrates that none of the FDAapproved contraceptives covered by the Mandate are abortifacients Thats because the standard medical definition of   is when a fertilized egg implants in a womans uterus not when sperm and egg first unite But while blocking implantation of a fertilized egg doesnt fit the medical definition of pregnancy it does qualify as ending a life for many religious people Churches and other houses of worship are exempt from the requirement to provide contraceptive services at no cost to employees However religiousaffiliated institutions such as universities and hospitals would have to provide coverage for all FDAapproved contraceptive methods Those organizations objecting to such coverage can turn to a third party such as an insurer   under a plan outlined by the Obama administration last year Some of these religious organizations including some Catholic and other Christian groups have also brought suits against the government mandate Those are still being adjudicated in lower courts More than   have their own laws mandating contraception coverage and most of them have some sort of exemption for religious employers One key difference between the federal law and state laws is that under the federal health law employers offering nongrandfathered health coverage must provide contraceptives without costsharing to female employees Some analysts who agreed with the Obama administration think the ruling means that employers could use religious objections to opt out of other areas of health care coverage For example   Barry Lynn executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State told KHN that in health care alone Scientologybelieving employers could insist upon noncoverage of its nemesis psychiatry And Jehovahs Witnesses corporations could demand exclusion of surgical coverage under the theory that so many of such procedures require the use of whole blood products forbidden by their faith But Justice Alitos decision went to lengths to limit the scope of the decision This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurancecoverage mandates eg for vaccinations or blood transfusions must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employers religious beliefs
