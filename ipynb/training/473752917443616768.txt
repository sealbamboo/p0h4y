My late father had a longtime friend a retired kosher butcher who lived down the hall in their South Jersey apartment building Past  Manny was older and frailer than my father he leaned on a cane and could barely see well enough to recognize faces But every morning and again in late afternoon he walked through my dads unlocked front door to be sure he was all right and to kibitz a bit Manny made the rounds also looking in on several other aged residents in their socalled NORC naturally occurring retirement community Unless he was ill himself he never missed a day Mannys regular reconnaissance missions come to mind when I read about purpose which is one of those things we recognize without quite knowing how to define To psychologists purpose reflects a commitment to broader life goals that helps organize your day to day activities Patrick Hill a psychologist at Carleton University in Ottawa told me in an interview Its a hard quality to measure so researchers rely on how strongly people agree or disagree with statements like these 
It turns out that purpose is on many counts a good thing to have long associated with satisfaction and happiness better physical functioning even better sleep Its a very robust predictor of health and wellness in old age said Patricia Boyle a neuropsychologist at the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center in Chicago She and her colleagues have been tracking two cohorts of older people living independently in greater Chicago assessing them regularly on a variety of physical psychological and cognitive measures The subjects agreed to donate their brains after their deaths What have the scientists learned Lets start with arguably the most feared disease of old age Following almost  people age  on average for up to seven years Dr Boyles team found that   they were also less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment often a precursor  It also slowed the rate of cognitive decline by about  percent which is a lot Dr Boyle added In a subset of  people who died autopsies found that   But even for people developing the plaques and tangles in their brains having purpose in life allows you to tolerate them and still maintain your cognition Dr Boyle said Purposeful people were less likely to develop disabilities And they were less likely to die a sample of  people followed for up to five years average age  by Rush researchers found that   of those with low purpose This   according to a recent study by Dr Hill which relied on a national longitudinal study that enrolled  Americans aged  to  Those who died in all age groups scored significantly lower on purposeinlife scales The researchers looked at whether purpose had less effect after retirement when youre starting to lose those structures you had a natural way to organize your daily life Dr Hill said Somewhat to his surprise work status didnt matter In fact both the Rush and the Carleton teams controlled for a host of other factors known to correlate with wellbeing  depression or negative affect social relationships chronic medical conditions and disability demographic differences  and report that purpose in life all by itself appears to have a potent ability to improve and extend lives So how can we help older people hang onto a sense of purpose if their strength and mobility declines and their dependence on others increases Id like to hear your ideas Isnt that one of the most dispiriting aspect of life in nursing homes or assisted living after all  the sense some residents develop that theres no reason to live Older people can stay busy with activities and multiple medical appointments but many feel that what they do doesnt matter They want to make a contribution Dr Boyle said They want to feel part of something that extends beyond themselves Though what provides purpose in ones life varies merely taking care of oneself probably doesnt qualify People with purpose have a sense of their role in the community and the broader world Dr Boyle said She particularly mentioned mentoring passing ones memories or experiences on to younger people as a way to stoke a sense of purpose The Jewish Association Serving the Aging which provides services in metropolitan New York takes a different tack The organizations Institute for Senior Action has trained more than a thousand older people to be rabble rousers graduates have mobilized to restore city funding cut from a center for the elderly for example Or maybe you adapt the things youve done and valued all your life Manny my dads friend used to make home deliveries from his butcher shop He was used to regularly visiting members of the small Jewish community in my hometown hearing about their families and their lives as he dropped off bundles of kosher meat wrapped in paper Decades later when his world had contracted he was essentially still at it He was providing a service he did actually once find a neighbor on the floor and summoned an ambulance and he was very diligent about it Id call that purpose wouldnt you
