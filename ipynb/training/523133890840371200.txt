Not long ago I heard a respected senior colleague recount to a group of medical students and trainees the story of a patient who had died under his care some  years earlier Afterward he had spent hours talking with the family trying he said to be as kind to them as I possibly could The family had been grateful for all his efforts but my colleague still struggled even to tell the story Were you afraid of getting sued one of the students suddenly asked My colleagues eyes widened and he answered slowly the tone of his voice shifting from grieving to professorial In medicine malpractice isnt something we just think about when a patient dies Malpractice is   in the back of your mind The handful of senior doctors in the room nodded in grim agreement Every one of us either had been named in or knew of a colleague embroiled in litigation That evening we all urged the aspiring clinicians to be the best and most compassionate doctors they could be We knew all too well how much easier it is simply to order more tests and procedures than necessary and to overtreat in hopes of avoiding a lawsuit But a study   has revealed that a group of doctors at YaleNew Haven Hospital has been quietly working to change the culture of defensive medicine that so many have come to accept as inevitable Beginning in  the hospitals department of obstetrics and gynecology in collaboration with their malpractice insurance carrier initiated a series of reforms to improve care Those in charge had no illusions Obstetrics was and remains one of the most   accounting for the highest proportion of malpractice   Their goal was only to make a small dent in adverse patient outcomes They first asked outside experts to review their work With those recommendations in hand they instituted guidelines and certification requirements to standardize practices like the interpretation of fetal monitoring or the administration of oxytocin a drug used to help with labor  Taking a cue from the airline and defense industries the leaders of the safety initiative trained their physician and nursing colleagues to communicate better resolve conflict and work in teams They created a computerized system for individuals to report anonymously events that might have caused harm to a patient or a visitor like a medication error a fall or the spread of infection and a patient safety committee to track and review those cases They established the TwoChallenge Rule which allows colleagues to question why a particular test or procedure has been ordered if they are not sure its right and then to halt the action or order if after two tries the clinician in charge can offer no reasonable explanation And they mandated that a fully trained obstetrician be at the hospital  hours a day in person and not just by telephone to supervise inpatient care and doctorsintraining  To foster greater interdisciplinary understanding they required obstetricians beginning their training to shadow nurses for a day or two to learn about their work challenges Most important they hired a nurse to lead the safety program Her responsibilities included overseeing the training sessions meeting regularly with providers for feedback and working with the safety committee to evaluate patient outcomes The changes resulted in a   like traumatic birth injuries admissions to the intensive care unit and death   But leaders of the initiative also discovered that their changes had had a dramatic effect on malpractice suits The number of liability claims against obstetricians in the Yale department dropped more than  percent And while the values of malpractice claims awarded or settled in Connecticut continued to rise Yales obstetric liability payments fell by  percent a saving of     People sue when something goes wrong with their care said Dr Christian Pettker chief of obstetrics at Yale You cant turn that into a happy situation but you can mitigate it by reducing the level of harm The changes did not come without challenges Startup costs for the first year were over  and the program required an additional  annually to maintain  There was also significant resistance to the reforms Some clinicians chafed at the time and bureaucratic demands of undergoing training and then certification for skills they had been using for years Others felt stifled and even threatened by the level of oversight implicit in the new array of clinical guidelines and protocols  But because the departments malpractice insurance carrier was a cosponsor of the initiatives and had made them a requirement for coverage clinicians had no choice but to accept them As the departments patient outcomes began to improve however   Dr Pettker and his colleagues found that over time the percentage of doctors and nurses who approved of the changes nearly doubled with some of the most resistant doctors and nurses becoming champions of the teamwork and safety initiatives  Medicine can be scary because we have such power to do harm Dr Pettker said But in a culture of teamwork you feel like everyone has got your back Dr Pettker and his colleagues are   to help other departments across the country incorporate similar changes Their greatest challenge however lies at home A safety and teamwork culture is not something you can just implement then walk away from and expect to continue Dr Pettker said The really hard work is the daily work you need to do to keep it going But I think our results show that it pays to do the right thing both for patients and for the system at large he added
