Air pollution even at relatively low levels is associated with a significant increase in the risk for lowbirthweight babies a new study has found European researchers pooled data from  studies that included more than  motherchild pairs in  countries The scientists also estimated concentrations of airborne particulate matter at the mothers home addresses during their pregnancies Concentrations of particulate matter as low as  micrograms per cubic meter were linked to   the researchers found After controlling for a variety of factors the scientists estimated that each  microgram per cubic meter increase in particulate matter was associated with an  percent increase in the risk for low birth weight Over all they estimate a reduction in particulate matter levels to  micrograms per cubic meter would lead to a  percent decrease in the number of lowbirthweight infants in these countries The report appears online in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine We have evidence from animal studies that the tiniest particles enter the bloodstream and go to the fetus said the senior author Rmy Slama a senior investigator at the Institute of Health and Medical Research in Grenoble France Can we expect other health effects in these children There are hints that there might be  low birth weight is a marker of negative effects in adulthood
