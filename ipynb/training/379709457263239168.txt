More than two million people are infected by drugresistant germs each year and  die of their infections federal health officials reported Monday The biggest killer by far is C difficile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports in its first big overview of a growing problem Doctors have been warning of the problem for decades yet up to half the prescriptions written for antibiotics are unnecessary the CDC report says And all these unneeded antibiotics are making the superbug problem worse But there is some good news  CDC experts say better care has cut the number of a frightening infection called methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA There were more than  fewer MRSA in  compared to  they reported separately in the Journal of the American Medical Association The report rates the germs for the first time ranking as urgent threats Clostridium difficile a group of stomach bugs called carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae CRE and drugresistant gonorrhea This is the first time that we have divided these bacteria into categories and called some of them urgent says Dr Steve Solomon director of CDCs Office of Antimicrobial Resistance We are trying to sound the alarm on these bugs that we call urgent Solomon told NBC News These are particularly frightening Worse the CDC report points out there arent any new antibiotics in the immediate works that will kill any of these bugs So patients may have to be treated with older more toxic drugs or with cocktails of antibiotics that may cause sideeffects  If we are not careful the medicine chest will be empty when we go there to look for a lifesaving antibiotic for somebody who has a deadly infection CDC director Dr Tom Frieden told reporters in a telephone briefing Without care we will soon be in a postantibiotic era Frieden added For some infections  we are already there C difficile has become a scourge of hospitals and infection is often made possible when patients are heavily treated with antibiotics to fight other infections It can cause unstoppable diarrhea and the  doesnt even involve antibiotics but a   from healthy patientsÂ  CREs are a group of bacteria that resist even the strongest antibiotics They include Klebsiella pneumoniae which saw its infection rate   between  and   CRE is a nightmare bacteria we reported on in March bacteria that can resist virtually all antibiotics Frieden said Gonorrhea may not be immediately lifethreatening but its developing resistance to the drugs that used to easily treat it  and in January Canadian researchers reported that seven percent of patients   by the only pill left to treat gonorrhea Nearly  cases of gonorrhea were reported in the US in  making it again the second most commonly reported notifiable infection in the nation Sufferers often show no signs so more than  are infected every year in actuality Frieden says The CDCs list of serious threats includes Concerning threats include Bacteria develop resistance to drugs quickly Even before penicillin was introduced in  staphylococcus germs were identified that were resistant to its effects Just nine years after tetracycline was introduced in  a resistant strain of Shigella evolved Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureas MRSA evolved just two years after methicillin hit the market in  The last new antibiotic to be introduced was ceftaroline in  It took just a year for the first staph germ to emerge that resisted its effects The most immediate problem is in hospitals Frieden says but there are also problems when people dont finish taking their prescribed course of antibiotics and the heavy use of antibiotics in farm animals that arent sick the CDC says We have to change the culture of how healthcare is delivered in this country Thats not easy says Dr Ed Septimus of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HCA Healthcare System in Houston Part of it is in fact the culture of antibiotics that goes back to the s Septimus added in a telephone interview He says he faced the same dilemma as many doctors do  patients who demand antibiotics A patient comes in and says I have this cold and I know about the problems with antibiotics but every other doctor I ever had gave me this antibiotic and it knocked it out after a few days he said Its a hard demand to resist Septimus added There is something about the culture of antibiotics that is deeply imbedded in patients and in doctor that has us treating antibiotics differently from any other drug Septimus says hospitals and doctors must be help more accountable for their use and abuse of antibiotics It cant just be done in one hospital It has to be in all hospitals across a community he said Longterm care clinics dialysis clinics nursing homes all have to be part of the effort he added The Health and Human Services Department   to penalize hospitals for some practices that spread infections but more needs to be done Septimus added Unless you put some accountability around it people are going to be very slow to change Septimus added
