Fortyfour years after President Nixon declared war on drugs   and most Americans support legalisation  Across the world drug laws are being relaxed from Uruguay to Portugal Jamaica and the Czech Republic  Does this mean the war on drugs has been lost     hears from four expert witnesses including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer About  years into my career it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers They were mothers they were fathers and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking One Colombian drug runner had a big impact At  he had a choice go work in the emerald mines or do something else  So he started in the emerald mines and it was a horrible experience And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel He started as a driver and ultimately rose up through the ranks In countries like Colombia  sometimes if you want to support your family  and you dont come from a wealthy family or youre not highly educated  drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty She noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain We would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia  We prosecuted one we shut it down and the next day another one opened up in the same location Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers either in the US or in Colombia and once they were extradited someone else came in to take their place Weve shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated and theyre moving through Guatemala and Honduras and those countries are turning into narco states She argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed The prison system is a disaster Theres virtually no rehabilitation Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective because they go to jail they come out they get involved with drugs again and they go right back to it I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents Ive worked with but so many of them have said to me were fighting a war that cant be won the way were fighting it  The war itself is at a draw And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless theres a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking Our recommendation is regulation for everything Thats what Portugal did  If you look at the last  years what has been done In the US  people in jail bn bn of spending a year The highest rates of consumption of the whole world You have to say that it doesnt work Its a failed policy and public opinion knows that  Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis  That taboo has been broken In the US a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana He cites the example of Uruguay the first country to legalise the marijuana trade  All Latin Americas looking at Uruguay Its a country that also looks how to deal with the production with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands  I dont expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place From the beginning in  the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs but its a utopia  Its something unreachable  Its not to recognise human nature A  reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves Thats been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than  drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets This is a global business As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes  ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency  When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we dont have to do the hard and dirty work but thats not the reality on the ground  The reality is its a tough slog it is a cancer and it is worth fighting Sure its discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric  The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs and signal to the population that being tough on drugs was a priority was an important part of the war itself   Theres going to be less and less of that I think theres going to be a change both in tone and substance so the war on drugs will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy I think its going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition  And we have a sense that that did not work well And so were now trying to find better ways of managing the problem and I think thats welcome If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences at least in the US thats an important indicator of the change in real policy and those numbers are starting to go down  Not dramatically but they are definitely going down and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline As drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key as happened when gambling was legalised  Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters You have slogans like Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily just the kind of slogan youd associate with the worst commercial promotion but done by the state Alcohol is still heavily promoted and its promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies and weve only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions   So I think theres considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available its regulated like alcohol what we see is very aggressive promotion advertising You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation wont lead to more marijuana dependence   Choose your problem There is no solution Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems We manage it And we may manage it better or worse but the notion that we solve a problem is simplistic Were simply managing a problem
