My last hill ride was epic  just not in the way Id hoped it would be Ill always remember the date June  The route was called Hells Delight Seventy miles of the steepest hills I had ever done And trust me Ive done a lot But Hells Delight was a new kind of suffering And although we road racers enjoy suffering that day I went too far About  miles before the finish I crashed My jaw and left cheekbone broke Half my face was bleeding so was my brain There were abrasions on my arms shoulders neck and left leg I needed surgery to fix my jaw What got me into that mess My ego I had just won a road race the past weekend It was a very technical course with hairpin turns After the victory I wasnt afraid of anything So on that long ride I took all the downhills at full speed no brakes I even sprinted when I was out of fuel I wanted to see how strong my body was even on three hours of sleep When we had almost completed  miles I was exhausted but I was doing OK  until I smashed my face onto the ground I fell in and out of consciousness My friend later explained that I was descending too fast I ran off the road hit the brakes too hard and flipped over the handlebars I was so angry And heartbroken It was the middle of racing season I had just started my own womens racing team I had people to lead and more races to win Sure you can say I was stupid Reckless I wont argue with that But can I just tell you I didnt believe in limits My mind always said to keep going and just ignore the pain and fatigue Suffer now to be stronger later My body always obeyed But finally that one day came when it would not My brain needed to listen to my body Stop when the body says stop That was lesson No  Lesson No  Im actually pretty lucky The crash couldve been way worse I didnt break my legs or neck or spine I still had my vision even though my left eye wouldnt open for days afterward And yes it was annoying that I couldnt chew food or see my mangled face in the mirror without wanting to cry It was tough and long and being trapped inside got me really frustrated But those were just details The big picture I survived Final lesson and the most important one Family is everything Yes blood family but Im also talking about my DC cycling community NPR colleagues friends near and far They all came rushing to offer help  visiting me in the hospital and at home bringing me food clothes and of course the one thing a journalist appreciates a good story I got lots of surprises in the mail even from people I never met in person Also text messages asking how I was doing and reminders to stay positive During the lowest point of my recovery one stood out recovery is more difficult than any race but patience always wins That kind of love made all the difference As for the friends who helped me get through this I want to tell them this Id say all your names if I could Theres just no airtime for that You know who you are And I want you to know Im grateful and Im sorry for the all panic and worry that I caused But Ill make it all up by winning another race for you Tell Me More
