Why you might ask would a hoitytoity medical institution like Johns Hopkins be offering up free Webbased consults for people with Parkinsons disease To prove that it works  director for the Johns Hopkins Movement Disorders Center is on a mission to convince America that videochats with doctors are as good or better than the traditional office visit Its a tough sell since outofstate doctors are barred from treating patients remotely in most states and Medicare doesnt pay for telemedicine delivered to a patients home Right now Medicare pays more when care is provided in a highcost environment like a hospital Dorsey says We should stop subsidizing highcost centers of care and start subsidizing care in lowcost convenient patientcentered locations So Dorsey has been hacking away at those barriers data bit by data bit First he showed that patients with Parkinsons disease could get quality specialist care care via teleconference at a nursing home as   back in  The project was cheap using a  webcam and  videoconferencing software The patients said the care was better than the nonspecialist care theyd been getting from office visits Next Dorsey tried video house calls The results of that experiment  this week in   In the study  patients with Parkinsons teleconferenced from their home computers for specialist visits while another  made the schlep to the office A shlep it was It took the patients with office visits  hours to go to the doctor compared with  minutes for the teleconferencers The home consults were not just more convenient and comfortable the patients said they were cheaper with costs dropping by  to  per visit The downside less personal contact incomplete information and tech issues At the end the sevenmonth experiment all the telemedicine patients said theyd like to continue And  percent of the clinic patients said theyd like to try it Patients with Parkinsons a neurodegenerative disease do much better if they can see a neurologist who specializes in the disease because its tricky to treat Theyre also  percent less likely to die says Dorsey But  percent of Medicare recipients with Parkinsons dont get to see any sort of neurologist at all Dorsey is trying to erase that deficit Well do everything we can to remove every conceivable barrier he says So hes now offering up   The minute consult can include advice on diagnoses tests medication changes physical therapy and the patients prognosis You call us tollfree and well set up a visit for you and your family members for free Dorsey says The number  But the freebie is available only to people who live in California Delaware Florida Maryland and New York because Dorsey cant deliver medical care even via the web in states where hes not licensed People outside the US dont have to worry about that so the offers open to people worldwide Now were saying remove distance remove disability remove the distribution of doctors Dorsey says Patients will come into an era where anyone anywhere can get the care they need The free doctor visits are funded by a  grant from Verizon which along with Google and Excellus BlueCross BlueShield has also helped pay for Dorseys research Those first two are unusual funders for clinical trials Using telemedicine allows the hospital to save patients thousands of miles of travel and improve lives by increasing access to specialized care Verizon said on Facebook when it made the award Still  seems like a pretty meager sum for paying specialists But Dorsey says Parkinsons care is actually pretty cheap He gets only  from Medicare for a followup visit With the grant money at least  people could get a free visit But so far only  or so have used the service probably because its been promoted on an   on the Hopkins website Avail yourself of this offer and you could be in the vanguard of the longdelayed telemedicine revolution
