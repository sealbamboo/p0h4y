From the doorway my patient looked pregnant  but his protuberant belly was actually a sign of serious liver disease that had quickly worsened Given the fluid pressing on his abdomen he was no doubt in pain Yet his spirits were high and raucous laughter often accompanied his nearly toothless smile After our team drained the fluid he was ready to leave the hospital We added a new medication to his already long list of medicines sending his prescriptions to the hospital pharmacy as usual When I nonchalantly told him that he could pick up his medications on his way out he suddenly seemed nervous I thought perhaps he was unsure about how to take the new drug and asked him if he had any questions His smile dimmed and his voice dropped to a whisper I know how to take the pills but I cant buy them he said his eyes refusing to meet mine as he stared at a spot on the hospitals beige floor I was confused because his insurance was supposed to cover nearly all of his medication costs Was there a problem with his coverage The medicines were crucial to helping him avoid landing in the hospital again so I went down to the pharmacy to see what the problem might be The copay is  the pharmacist told me matteroffactly referring to a white paper bag with a few pillfilled bottles inside I was speechless The medications cost less than a subway ticket but were still more than my patient could afford If he ended up in the hospital again because he couldnt take them the medical costs would be thousands of times greater than  And if he couldnt afford the medications he was no doubt also having trouble affording the basic grocery items that would speed his return to good health I ended up paying for that patients medicine out of my own pocket But I thought about him again after reading a   that found that onethird of Americans suffering from a chronic illness such as diabetes or high blood pressure said they had trouble affording medications food or both Doctors should be asking patients about an inability to get good food or medications every single time we see them especially when we encounter patients who have poorly controlled chronic conditions said Dr Niteesh Choudhry a study author and a hospitalist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Although diseases such as high blood pressure and heart disease can vary greatly in severity medication underusage plays into all of them he said Looking back I wonder whether my patients poverty was the real reason he had landed in the hospital Maybe he wasnt taking any of the medicines we had prescribed for him but was too embarrassed to volunteer that information without prodding But we caregivers need to prod said Dr Seth Berkowitz another of the studys authors and a fellow in general internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital We should inquire not only to find out whether patients are really taking their medications but also because we may be able to help If we asked we might be able to lower the cost of a drug regimen by for example prescribing drugs that are cheaper or can be obtained at a steep discount Dr Berkowitz added that programs to assist patients in paying for care are also available in most areas and that every doctor at clinic should know about those  So why did it not even occur to me to ask my patient whether he could afford the medicine and food he needed to be healthy Why do so many health care providers shy away from even raising the topic Maybe we are afraid of prying or worried about embarrassing a patient Or maybe these are just rationalizations and the real reason for our lack of interest in patients like this one is that we are just too busy and too focused on the next patient to give this one the attention he or she needs Whatever the reason we need to change As a medical student rotating in a community pediatrics clinic I saw the benefit of being aware of a patients financial struggle At the clinic I met a young mother recently emigrated from East Asia who had brought her two elementaryaged daughters in for a checkup Normally youngsters heights and weights increase steadily over time following a graceful curve that is mapped out during each visit to the doctor But these girls heights and weights had stopped rise in tandem over the past few months Instead their weight had dropped and they had essentially stopped growing When the attending physician and I walked in the girls were sitting quietly on the exam table reading dogeared paperbacks The pediatrician I worked with broached the topic cautiously inquiring about the familys diet which consisted mostly of vegetables tofu and rice with some milk for the girls for extra fat and protein The doctor encouraged the mother to add more caloriedense foods including cheese and nuts and to return with the girls in a few months After she answered a few more questions we got up to leave the exam room And whats the cost for this visit the mother asked nervously as we approached the doorway I glanced at my attending and we sat back down closing the door for privacy The standard copayment was  the doctor told her and then gently asked if it would be a problem to pay The mother shook her head but tears were welling up in her eyes But we cant come back in a few months she blurted out Its just too expensive Tears rolled down her cheeks and she looked away as her cheeks flushed Her daughters sat silently on the exam table their thin legs swinging back and forth I felt the familys shame and embarrassment and in retrospect it seems obvious they lacked enough to eat Yet we wouldnt have known they were pressed for funds if our patient hadnt brought up the issue at the last minute The pediatrician was able to waive the copayment but it was just another shortterm fix to a longerterm problem Neither doctors nor medical students can solve a patients financial problems on the spot Yet any one of us can be the first to detect a problem If weve done the research we can help patients get the assistance they need or at least direct them to social workers pharmacists and other members of the health care team who can What we cannot do is fail to ask  is
