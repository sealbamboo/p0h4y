One day in the summer of  yearold Seteng Horo found herself on a bus to the nearest public hospital about four hours away from her remote village in the eastern Indian state of   Its not a trip she can afford to take often  buses are infrequent the journey is long and the cost of about a dollar roundtrip is not insignificant But she had no choice She was running a temperature and had been bleeding for days The reason an unsafe abortion performed by a village midwife Horos story is not uncommon in India An estimated twothirds of abortions performed are unsafe done illegally at home or by quacks and midwives and the annual death toll is about  Many women end up with lifelong health problems And women in rural India are disproportionately affected And yet abortion has been legal in India since  Thats the irony of the situation says Vinoj Manning the director of the India office of   an international nonprofit organization that works to increase access to safe abortions The Indian public health system has failed to provide any abortion services to poor women in rural areas he says All good health care is concentrated in urban centers  and is not affordable by Indias poor When Seteng Horo a mother of two became pregnant last year she and her husband decided to terminate her pregnancy I dont want more kids she says My husband doesnt either Raising two children was expensive enough she says But they had few options for an abortion Her village Serotoli doesnt even have a public health clinic or hospital and they are too poor to afford private health care Besides Horo had no idea that abortion is legal and that she should only undergo the procedure at a facility certified by the government Horo first went to what is known in these parts as a  doctor a doctor with a bag Theyre men who travel from village to village with a bagful of medicines But they arent qualified doctors Some are trained in alternative medicine but have little or no understanding of modern medical science Others have no medical training at all They are basically quacks The  doctor gave her an expensive pill that didnt work Then she went to a   an elderly woman in her village who serves as both a midwife and traditional healer especially for womens reproductive health A   is an important figure in Indias villages at once a medicine woman and a confidante and adviser on matters of reproductive health Abortion like all matters related to sex is a taboo Anything about sex and sexuality is stigmatized says Manning We dont even talk about it in our own homes And when it comes to abortion it is even more stigmatized  because a womans primary role is still seen as a child bearer This creates a culture of silence around the topic he says And women prefer to go to a  knowing she will keep the abortion confidential Horos  gave her an abdominal massage a commonly used abortion practice in the region The massage usually done with hot oil and plant leaves is intended to destroy the fetus At first I thought it worked says Horo Days later she was feverish and bleeding profusely It was only then that she decided to take the mile bus ride to the nearest public hospital But like most public hospitals and health clinics in rural India this one did not have a doctor trained to perform an abortion The hospital referred her to a small clinic nearby in Khunti run by the   FPAI a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health services at little or no cost to the poor As more people have learned about the clinic in the four years since it opened Dr Mahesh has seen the number of patients grow The clinic currently performs an average of  abortions every month she says They come from very farflung areas she says There are two other clinics elsewhere in Jharkhand and others around the country But they probably dont reach as many women as they should says the doctor The government of India recognizes the problem and is trying to solve it This year   in government hospitals It also launched a media campaign to raise peoples awareness In addition the government is trying to amend the law so that trained nurses can perform abortions and not just certified doctors This will increase access to safe abortion especially in poor and rural communities What theyre trying to do is move abortion from informal backstreet culture to a mainstream one and to bring abortion closer to communities says Manning As for changing the culture of silence around abortion thats will probably take a long time to address he says Those practitioners have another role to play When I met Horo earlier this year at the clinic in Khunti she had come for a second abortion Ill come here again and again if I have to she said But she may no longer need to contemplate ending an unwanted pregnancy Until she came to the clinic Horo had no easy way to obtain birth control pills Now she relies on the clinic for birth control and recently got a contraceptive injection
