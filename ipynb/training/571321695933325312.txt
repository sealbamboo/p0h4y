People should listen to music for no more than one hour a day to protect their hearing the World Health Organization suggests It says   are at risk of permanently damaging their hearing by listening to too much too loudly It said audio players concerts and bars were posing a serious threat WHO figures show  million people aged  have hearing loss and the prevalence is increasing  In that age group the WHO said half of people in rich and middleincome countries were exposed to unsafe sound levels from personal audio devices Meanwhile  were exposed to damaging levels of sound from clubs and bars The proportion of US teenagers with hearing loss went from  in  to  in   Dr Etienne Krug the WHOs director for injury prevention told the BBC What were trying to do is raise awareness of an issue that is not talked about enough but has the potential to do a lot of damage that can be easily prevented The full report argued While it is important to keep the volume down limiting the use of personal audio devices to less than one hour a day would do much to reduce noise exposure Dr Krug said that a good ambition aim Thats a rough recommendation it is not by the minute to give an idea to those spending  hours a day listening to an mpplayer But even an hour can be too much if the volume is too loud The louder the noise measured in decibels the faster it damages the ear  The WHOs safe listening times are  The World Health Organization recommends keeping the volume to  of the maximum as a good rule of thumb For people trying to drown out the noise of flying or train journeys it says noisecancelling headphones allow music to be heard clearly at a lower volume  And the WHO adds that ear plugs should be worn at noisy venues and advises taking listening breaks and standing far away from speakers at gigs But what is the point of a concert if you are going to avoid the music We do realise this is a bit of a struggle like alcohol consumption so many risk factors linked to pleasure are not easy to change but we have to make people aware Dr Krug said But as well as calling for personal responsibility the WHO says governments and manufacturers have a responsibility It says clubs should provide chillout rooms and give out free ear plugs headphone manufacturers should set limits on the volume and governments need to adopt stricter laws  Paul Breckell the chief executive of the charity Action on Hearing Loss said When listening to loud music for every three decibel increase in level to stay safe you should halve your listening time  For example at  dB safe allowable exposure is cut to four hours at  dB two hours and so on   I urge music lovers to consider the long term risks of listening to loud music from their personal music players over the dB safe level as over exposure can trigger tinnitus and remember that a good pair of noise cancelling headphones can make all the difference
