Dr Paul Cleary, consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England (PHE), said: "Investigations into the recent .  outbreak are progressing, at both a national and European level. . "There is now evidence to indicate that cases in Europe with the same strains of salmonella infection were associated with consumption of eggs from a single source. This egg supply also reached distributors and food outlets in England, but at this stage we cannot conclusively demonstrate this is the infection source in this country. . "We are continuing to work with the Food Standards Agency and public health organisations in Europe but, importantly, the decline in salmonella case reporting this week, alongside other elements of our investigations, reassures us that the current risk to public health is low." .
