A new study suggests that emergency surgery done on children during the weekend results in more complications and deaths than similar surgery done during the week The study   used a large national database to matchÂ   weekend operations on children younger than  with  operations performed on weekdays The selected operations were performed on the day of admission and the procedures performed  appendectomies brain shunts hernias bone fractures and abscess drainage procedures  were coded as emergencies in the database Only about  percent of cases had complications and less than onetenth of  percent of the children died But even after controlling for sex age race the type of surgery and other factors patients having a procedure on the weekend were  percent more likely to sustain an accidental puncture or cut  percent more likely to receive a transfusion and  percent more likely to die The lead author Dr Seth D Goldstein a surgical resident at Johns Hopkins said that even though mortality was quite low if weekend treatment had matched weekday treatment over the year period of the study about  deaths would have been prevented Parents should know that as providers of surgical care we are not satisfied with excellence he added We want these things to be never events
