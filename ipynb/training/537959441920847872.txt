More than  of fresh chickens being sold in the UK are contaminated with the Campylobacter bug the Food Standards Agency FSA has revealed The figure is higher than in previous tests which suggested a  contamination rate The highest rate was found in chickens being sold by Asda Tesco was found to have relatively low rates of contamination Asda said it was disappointed but was working hard to find a solution It is the first time that individual retailers have been named by the FSA in an attempt to improve standards The agency said the results showed that there was still  a long way to go before consumers are protected from the bug However it reassured consumers by saying that Campylobacter is easily killed by thorough cooking Campylobacter is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the UK responsible for  cases a year and around  deaths Poultry is responsible in the majority of these cases In  the FSA tested just under  fresh chickens When measured at the highest levels of contamination it found that Asda was the worst offender with  of its chickens having a concentration of more than  colonyforming units per gram Marks and Spencer was the next worst with  of its birds contaminated Tesco with an  contamination rate was the only one of the major retailers with a better record than the industry average These results show that the food industry especially retailers need to do more to reduce the amount of Campylobacter on fresh chickens said Steve Wearne the director of policy at the FSA If chicken is cooked thoroughly and preparation guidelines are properly followed the risk to the public is extremely low Mr Wearne added Other advice from the FSA includes Some experts believe roasting chicken inside a bag is also useful as it eliminates skin contact Asda said it welcomed the transparency of the FSAs findings but said it was already working on new technical solutions to reduce contamination We take campylobacter seriously and it goes without saying that were disappointed with these findings said an Asda spokesperson There is no silver bullet to tackle this issue but along with other retailers were working hard to find a solution he added  Among the new solutions being worked on is SonoSteam being trialled by Asda across its poultry suppliers The technology uses steam to kill bacteria on the surface of the chicken during processing Marks and Spencer has developed a fivepoint plan of interventions along the food chain to tackle the issue The British Poultry Council said there was little statistical difference between the retailers which have levels in the same range Professor Chris Elliott director of the Institute for Global Food Security who led a government inquiry into food safety said he was satisfied that enough was now being done to tackle the issue Im not aware of any region in the world working harder to find solutions to this problem but in my opinion having looked at all the evidence there is no quick fix he said  Further tests will now be carried out by the FSA particularly on chickens sold by smaller retailers and butchers
