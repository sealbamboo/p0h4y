The Veterans Affairs Department says investigators have found no proof that delays in care caused any deaths at a VA hospital in Phoenix deflating an explosive allegation that helped expose a troubled health care system in which veterans waited months for appointments while employees falsified records to cover up the delays   Revelations that as many as  veterans died while awaiting care at the Phoenix VA hospital rocked the agency last spring bringing to light scheduling problems and allegations of misconduct at other hospitals as well The scandal led to the resignation of former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki In July Congress approved spending an additional  billion to help shore up the system   The VAs Office of Inspector General has been investigating the delays for months and shared a draft report of its findings with VA officials   In a written memorandum about the report VA Secretary Robert A McDonald said It is important to note that while OIGs case reviews in the report document substantial delays in care and qualityofcare concerns OIG was unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the death of these veterans   The inspector generals final report has not yet been issued The inspector general runs an independent office within the VA   Deputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson confirmed the findings in an interview with The Associated Press Gibson however stressed that veterans were still waiting too long for care an issue the agency was working to fix   They looked to see if there was any causal relationship associated with the delay in care and the death of these veterans and they were unable to find one But from my perspective that dont make it OK Gibson said Veterans were waiting too long for care and there were things being done there were scheduling improprieties happening at Phoenix and frankly at other locations as well Those are unacceptable   In April Dr Samuel Foote who had worked for the Phoenix VA for more than  years before retiring in December brought the allegations to Congress   Foote accused Arizona VA leaders of collecting bonuses for reducing patient wait times But he said the purported successes resulted from data manipulation rather than improved service for veterans He said up to  patients died while awaiting care   In May the inspector generals office found that  veterans were waiting for primary care appointments at the Phoenix VA but did not show up on the wait list Until that happens the reported wait times for these veterans has not started said a report issued in May   Gibson said the VA reached out to all  veterans in Phoenix and scheduled care for them However he acknowledged there are still  veterans in Phoenix who requested appointments but will have to wait at least  days for care   The VA has said it was firing three executives of the Phoenix VA hospital The agency has also said it planned to fire two supervisors and discipline four other employees in Colorado and Wyoming accused of falsifying health care data   Gibson said he expected the list of disciplined employees to grow He took over as acting VA secretary when Shinseki resigned and returned to his job as deputy secretary after McDonald was confirmed   The fundamental point here is we are taking bold and decisive action to fix these problems because its unacceptable Gibson said We owe veterans we owe the American people an apology Weve delivered that apology Well keep delivering that apology for our failure to meet their expectations for timely and effective health care   To help reduce backlogs the VA is sending more veterans to private doctors for care   Congress approved  billion in emergency spending over three years to pay private doctors and other health professionals to care for veterans who cant get timely appointments at VA medical facilities or who live more than  miles from one   The new law includes  billion for hiring more VA doctors nurses and other medical staff and  billion to open  new VA clinics across the country   The legislation also makes it easier to fire hospital administrators and senior VA executives for negligence or poor performance
