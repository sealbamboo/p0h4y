Radiographers are set to go on strike a week after the rest of the NHS workers involved in industrial action.. On Monday, health workers, including nurses, midwives and porters, in England will take part in a four-hour walkout in a dispute over pay.. But the Society of Radiographers has announced a UK strike on 20 October - as it did not have enough time to give formal notice to join the other unions.. The action has the potential to affect X-ray and ultrasound services.. Emergency or urgent services are not expected to be disrupted.. The results of a ballot - announced last week - showed 53% of society members who took part had voted for industrial action.. Ministers have awarded NHS staff a 1% increase, but only for those without automatic progression-in-the-job rises.. These, designed to reward professional development, are given to about half of staff, and are worth 3% a year on average.. An independent pay review board had said the 1% increase should be across the board, but ministers disagreed. . Radiographers will be on strike from 09:00 to 13:00 BST on 20 October. They will also work to rule for the rest of that week. . Richard Evans, the society's chief executive officer, said: "There is the possibility of more action by radiographers in the future. . "The anger that they and other health professionals feel is very strong."
