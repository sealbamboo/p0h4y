A bacterium called Bacillus cereus has been identified as the cause of   Two other cases are likely to be confirmed  A special intravenous liquid feed given to some premature babies is thought to have been contaminated by the bacterium Babies at nine hospitals in England have been affected Public Health England said the cases were strongly linked with certain batches of an intravenous liquid made by ITH Pharma The company has launched a product recall and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency MHRA has alerted all hospitals If babies are born very early they tend to be small weak and unwell and may not be able to be fed by mouth Babies born before  or  weeks are likely to need something called total parenteral nutrition TPN a speciallyprepared liquid feed which is gently pumped into their bloodstream to help them grow The access point is normally through a large central vein A very thin feeding line is then inserted into the vein to allow the liquid nutrition to enter the babys body These babies tend to be particularly vulnerable to infection It is difficult to know how many babies are fed this way in the UK It can vary from just a two or three babies a week in smaller units to many more in larger hospitals  These special feed bags contain sugar vitamins and amino acids all vital for a babys growth  Fatty acids are also given to them but in a separate syringe Premature babies need this form of food because breast milk is often not nutritious enough to support them and some are simply unable to digest it The feeds can be made up in the hospital or may arrive in packs from the manufacturers in which case they should be sterile and ready to use The liquid feeds are manufactured by a number of companies around the country They are often made to order and sent to hospitals when they are needed A company based in London called ITH Pharma Limited has been linked to the feeds used in this incident  It is now helping the MHRA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency with its investigation Public Health England says a possible point when contamination entered the products has been identified   which is thought to have been present in the feed bags is widespread It can be found in soil dust plants and some food such as reheated rice High temperatures or powerful disinfectants are needed to get rid of the spores formed by the bacterium which can survive for long periods on surfaces and materials It is often present in food production environments One baby has died and  are ill with blood poisoning Most were premature and were being cared for in neonatal intensive care units The infection can cause fever problems with breathing and vomiting among other symptoms  In sick premature babies a serious infection like this can kill them because they have virtually no immune system to protect them The hospitals affected by the contaminated feeds stopped using the product immediately and switched to using a different supplier In this way babies who need intravenous feeding will not go without food for a prolonged period
