Better training is needed for dementia carers to deal with issues around relationships intimacy and sex the Care Quality Commission has said It told the BBC it was looking at how staff tackled such issues as part of its new inspection regime which began last month for care homes in England The Alzheimers Society said training and awareness about intimacy was hit and miss The Department of Health said care homes should follow guidelines  Alzheimers Society director of operations Kathryn Smith said care workers tackled difficult situations every day and all care homes should put specific policies in place to help them Theres no mandatory level of training for people working with dementia she said  That means it often comes down to the judgement of the manager of the care home and the resources they have available Care homes should work with families to manage potentially difficult situations Ms Smith said   These can be very sensitive conversations to have so it is vitally important that staff have the right level of training and awareness in this area she said Eve Carder who was senior nurse manager at Landermeads Nursing Home in Chilwell just outside Nottingham told   the staff were regularly faced with tricky dilemmas One situation in particular involved a lady and a gentleman who were both married before not to each other and living with a form of dementia she said They believed they were living in a different reality where they were in a relationship together as husband and wife  They would walk round the care home hand in hand sit on the sofas within the lounge area and cuddle up together  Occasionally theyd lie down on a bed together Care staff and nursing staff management found the situation very difficult to manage because they saw it as wrong  They saw the gentlemans real wife very distressed She would come in and openly cry and voice that she couldnt handle seeing her husband with another woman  At one point in a conversation it was likened to him having an affair Eventually Ms Carder said his wife had agreed to telephone  to  minutes before her arrival to allow staff to separate the couple But that had caused a lot of negative feelings because they had been unable to fully comprehend the situation  Ms Carder said it was important families understood people living with dementia could not rely on logic or reason They are overwhelmed with feelings and trying to make sense of the world around them she said And they will seek comfort attachment and love in a way that feels right at that time The man didnt recognise his spouse as his wife anymore but it didnt mean he didnt connect with her  His reactions were very positive on her visits but thats because she dropped the part of trying to bring him back to reality  She just came in and loved him for who he was in that moment  It was really hard for her and its a massive step for families  but it is possible to work with families and create culture of change through education Karen Tidy a senior nurse at Landermeads said One lady will always be seen kissing another lady or man on the lips just as an outward expression of her affection and love for people and we embrace that We embrace people feeling that they are fulfilled and experiencing love and comfort from each other  Its not a problem to us Theres no management strategy were just happy to see people connecting emotionally  But Prof Julian Hughes consultant in old age psychiatry at North Tyneside General Hospital said changes in sexual behaviour were not always so benign Its a form of sexual disinhibition he said Mostly this is put down to problems with the front of the brain which controls our personalities and if its damaged by dementia then people can start to do things they wouldnt otherwise normally do  That can show itself in terms of aggression but it can also show itself in terms of sexual behaviour
