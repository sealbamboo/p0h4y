Planning ahead I was all set to devote this weeks recipes to potatoes which I have always defended against the anticarb brigade because potatoes are a wholesome food high in B vitamins and vitamin C potassium and fiber with some protein and lots of complex carbohydrates A plain sevenounce baked potato eaten with the skin contains half the daily amounts of Vitamin C and Vitamin B recommended for adults I had Thanksgiving in mind the most popular time of the year for this tuber or is Hanukkah the most popular time As it turns out both holidays fell at the same time this year All the more reason for five new latke and potato pancake recipes that combine potatoes and other vegetables If you made  mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving you can use the leftovers for the mashed potato and broccoli raab pancakes and for the mashed potato and cabbage pancakes or just steam up some potatoes I made more traditional shredded potato and vegetable latkes with the other fall vegetables and potato combos  carrots and parsnips butternut squash kale and leeks But I introduced some spice as well using chiles cilantro and nigella seeds in my carrot and parsnip latkes and cumin in my potato kale and leek latkes You can serve these with Greek yogurt or lowfat sour cream or make a yogurt sauce that Yotam Ottolenghi serves with leek fritters published in his book Plenty which is a mix of Greek yogurt sour cream garlic lemon juice olive oil parsley and cilantro all blended together in a food processor Here are five new ways to make latkes 
  Indian flavors add a new dimension to potato latkes  Purple potatoes add a bit of color and some extra nutrients but regular white potatoes work too
