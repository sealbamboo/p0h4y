Knowing that it seems absurd that I weighed  pounds at   The reason for my weight gain was simple I loved food I still do I ate way too much and I hated exercise Well thats not totally true My friends and I were passionate soccer players  sometimes I would even start sweating when my Xbox game got too exciting  If I dont eat greasy fastfood stay away from sweet soft drinks and avoid candies I wont get fat I used to think So while my brother was having two potatoes I ate four He would have enjoyed a glass of milk in the morning if I hadnt already emptied the whole liter He loved bread with some bacon I preferred a lot of bacon with some bread  If you eat more calories than your body needs you will gain weight Its as simple as that We are constantly told to focus on what were eating and yet we forget to think about how much we are eating Of course I got bullied for being overweight When youre fat youre a target I struggled with the teasing in the beginning but got used to it very quickly That was dangerous  getting used to people picking on your size means youre accustomed to being that size so there is no need for change  I would still be extremely obese right now if it wasnt for a school trip to Paris in   I like French food and had a lot of it But on the trip I got food poisoning and lost  pounds Those  pounds were the spark that started the fire  I realized that sometimes you have to RSVP yes when life sends you an invitation for change At first I thought Cool I lost  pounds I will try not to regain that weight  Then I remembered there was something called exercise and that experts said it could help you lose weight  So I started using my mothers elliptical machine I worked out for  to  minutes every single day I also tried to eat half of what I had eaten before Instead of four potatoes I ate two instead of drinking a whole bottle of milk I would only drink half of it My body responded well Within two years I had lost  pounds If I had known I would eventually be writing a weight loss story for CNN I would have gone for   I realized that if you and your body are hungry for change weight loss can be fun instead of a burden Luckily Ive never encountered the dreaded yoyo effect I have maintained my slimmer figure for seven years now I never stopped exercising After youve come so far you dont want to take a risk and regain the weight because of laziness I purposefully gained  pounds working out in the gym because I wanted to build muscle Now my foot inch frame weighs  pounds My body mass index is   There are countless books on how to lose weight All the authors seem to have priceless pieces of advice theyve skillfully converted into cash But in the end I believe losing weight is a simple trade  You feed your body the right amount of food and exercise In return your body burns fat Even your wallet gets a little lighter because you have to buy new clothes After seven years of medical education I have learned a lot about the health dangers of being overweight Im glad I took lifes invitation to change as a teen As a doctor who has been where they are I hope to help others who are struggling with their weight do the same
