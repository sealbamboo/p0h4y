Many people who are watching their weight  or trying to lose some pounds  turn to their bathroom   But that old familiar standby is not the only way to measure ones size Another possibility to consider is your body fat percentage When most of us hear the words body fat they have immediate negative connotations However in the right proportion fat is actually critical to our   and health In the notsodistant past the ability to store extra body fat allowed our ancestors to survive in times of famine when food was hard to come by Even today its essential to keep the body functioning to preserve body heat and to protect organs from trauma Problems arise when our bodies store too much fat This can lead to a variety of health issues including   hypertension glucose intolerance and insulin resistance Especially dangerous is fat stored at the waist creating what is often called an appleshaped body as opposed to fat on the hips and thighs a pearshaped body Normal body fat for men is around  to  percent of their total body weight and for women approximately  to  percent says Caroline Apovian MD associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine and director of the Center for Nutrition and Weight Management at Boston Medical Center There are a variety of ways to measure the amount of body fat a person is carrying The most accurate way is underwater weighing which weighs the person on land and then underwater says Mary M Flynn PhD RD chief research dietitian and assistant professor of medicine at the Miriam Hospital and Brown University in Providence RI But equipment for this is very expensive and not readily available Another fairly accurate option is Bioelectric Impedance Analysis BIA BIA consists of electrodes being placed on a persons hand and foot while a current which is not felt is passed through the body Fat has less water and is more resistant to the current whereas muscle which contains more water is less resistant The resulting numbers are entered into an equation which figures the percentage of fat and lean tissue The easiest method is measuring waist circumference and determining the   BMI A waist circumference over  inches for women and  inches for men is cause for concern Figuring BMI involves a little more calculation BMI is done by multiplying your weight in pounds by  then dividing that number by your height in inches two times If the end result is less than  the individual is underweight to  is normal  to  is overweight and over  is obese However you must be aware of this disclaimer BMI alone is not an indication of body fat especially in athletes and bodybuilders Growing children under  years old should also avoid using BMI says Elizabeth Downs RD clinical dietitian at the Montefiore Medical Center at the University Hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx NY One final way of determining body fat is using skin calipers to measure fat at specific places in the body However not only is it easy to make errors but this method also doesnt measure any interior fat or fat contained in thighs and womens breasts Ultimately the percentage of body fat is just another number in the health equation And if you are not happy with the result all it takes is adding   and cutting calories to get it moving in the right direction
