When youre in your s you think youre invincible she said   At first she thought she might have a clogged milk duct but she went to the doctor anyway What followed were mammograms ultrasounds biopsies and then the diagnosis She had breast cancer  Doctors told her other bad news She had an  to  chance of being sterile after her treatment  She and her husband Bubba really wanted another child  They were hoping for a son to carry on the family name That was shocking  It was a very hard pill to swallow Wolford said  Luckily she found another option an ongoing clinical trial designed to help preserve a womans fertility during chemotherapy The studys results were published Friday at the annual meeting in Chicago Since there would be about a month between surgery and chemotherapy her doctor initially suggested that the couple seek fertility treatment That way they could set aside embryos to be used later  The Wolfords thought about it but the treatments  price tag was too much They also struggled with what they felt was a moral dilemma of what theyd do with the embryos they didnt use  Ultimately they decided that fertility treatments werent for them   Its a good thing too Wolford later learned that she had hormonenegative cancer The fertility drugs she would have needed for egg harvesting could have made her cancer worse When Wolford went in for her treatment at   in Houston she learned about the clinical trial which is funded largely by the National Institutes of Health  Honestly I dont know if my poor husband even had a vote in this I saw it as my only hope she said  Trial researchers wanted to know whether the drug   brand name Zoladex could preserve the fertility of hormonenegative cancer patients  Its a drug that suppresses ovarian function or puts the ovaries at rest said the lead study author    Goserelin is normally prescribed to women with advanced hormonepositive breast cancer to put them into menopause and stop estrogen production which can fuel cancer growth  Studies have shown high rates of return of menstrual function Moore says but there have been no conclusive trials looking at ovarian function over the long term The goal of the trial was to temporarily halt ovarian function and then assess it two years after treatment Basically if the ovaries are inactive then they would hopefully be less sensitive to the chemotherapy effects said Moore a breast cancer specialist at the Cleveland Clinic More than  women between the ages of  and  were recruited for the trial All were given standard chemotherapy but half added goserelin to their treatments  Wolford was in the latter group  I put my ovaries into menopause without the chemotherapy doing it first with the hope that the ovaries would wake up afterwards she said She had to get an injection one week before starting chemotherapy and then once every four weeks as long as she was on chemo The drug is actually quite painful Its like a shooting a rice grain into your abdomen Wolford said Wolfords chemotherapy lasted six months finishing in September  Her menstrual cycle returned about four months later   Obviously at that point it doesnt mean that youre ovulating and at that point we were trying to figure out what to do next for our family Wolford said Two months later she was laid off from her job Believing Lauren would probably be their only child the couple decided to open a preschool in Colorado because if we cant have more children then well spend time with other parents children Wolford sasaid In late  they decided to see if they could get pregnant again  When Wolford informed her doctors at MD Anderson they asked her to come in for more tests particularly because triplenegative breast cancer has the highest recurrence rate five years after diagnosis Only  women including Wolford met the criteria for ovarian function testing at the twoyear mark and among those patients researchers found that  of the women in the chemoonly group had premature ovarian failure compared with  in the group that also got goserelin  Thats a twothirds reduction Moore said Researchers also found that the women in the goserelin group were nearly twice as likely to have a successful pregnancy  Wolford was one of them She found out she was pregnant in February  and believes she delivered the first baby in the goserelin group Alexander was born eight months later Then came Everett and finally baby Lukas All told among the  women enrolled in the trial  patients in the goserelin group became pregnant compared with  in the chemotherapyonly group   Finding a simple and accessible way to protect fertility in young breast cancer patients while not harming cancer outcomes is an important issue said   deputy director of the  s Division of Cancer Prevention and one of the studys coauthors I think this is convincing enough that we can use this standard practice for women with hormonenegative breast cancer Moore said MD Anderson breast cancer expert   who was not involved in the study cautions that the study size was small  She says the research does show that its not harmful to take goserelin to preserve fertility  But she suggests for patients who are sure they want to have children after chemotherapy it is still imperative to meet with a reproductive endocrinologist to understand all their options and not just rely on goserelin Although the study results are narrowly applicable to hormonenegative breast cancer the concept may have broader applications in other cancers said   president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York Moore agrees saying that goserelin may also be applicable with cancers that are treated with similar chemotherapy drugs like lymphoma but that more research is needed Wolford is now almost nine years cancerfree  Her message to other young women in a similar situation  Be strong  Its a hard road fighting cancer she says but do your research and consider participating in clinical trials that could help you and other women in the future To have the life you always hoped to have  its a really huge thing she said  It was definitely a painful experience but the upside was my three sons and I would do it again in a heartbeat
