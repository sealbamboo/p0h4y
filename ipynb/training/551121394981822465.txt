Misty Copeland the third African American soloist in the prestigious American Ballet Theatre has affected millions with fame that surpasses the world of toe shoes and plis  including a video for the athletic wear company Under Armour that has been viewed more than  million times on YouTube She was chosen to perform with Prince and is to star in Swan Lake this year All of this accomplished by someone who was told she shouldnt pursue ballet So in this season filled with often shortlived resolutions we chat with Copeland who knows a thing or two about discipline and perseverance Just the way ballet is so beautifully structured it ingrains this commitment into you Theres so much happening and so much youre trying to understand and something thats so beautiful about a dance class is that you dont feel like youre just doing repetitive movements but youre enjoying it and youre listening to music and it doesnt seem like work When youre really dancing or exercising the way you feel your body starts to crave it The more consistent I am about going the easier it becomes to go because I need that feeling again I mentor a lot of young dancers and something Ive learned from being a mentor and being mentored is that its so powerful and important to surround yourself with people who act as your support system So many of us think I can do this on my own Im strong Ill be fine But were human beings and we have those moments of being fearful and having doubts and thats the time you need to be surrounded by people who are going to reassure you that you have a purpose and a mission A lot of the time its about being in a situation where it may be more about the energy in the room than you not being confident  an environment where the people are there because they want to feel cute or feel like theyre showing up but arent really there to be involved in the workout I would suggest an activity where maybe there arent mirrors Something like taking a Pilates mat class or some type of yoga where youre getting exercise thats more about your internal experience and not about looking in a mirror or looking at the people next to you I cant speak for a lot of people because ballerinas are kind of crazy in their discipline But when it comes to nutrition I dont believe in dieting Theres always going to be an end to dieting and then youre going to end up gaining weight I think its about adjusting your lifestyle forever For me its about portion control and having things in moderation I do so much I like to swim I take floorbarre classes I do Gyrotonics with a private teacher I go on the elliptical occasionally without any resistance for  minutes if Im in the offseason and I just want to get my heart rate up I take Pilates mat classes I really enjoy that even though theres no music involved its this very Zen feeling I like to close my eyes even though my instructors always like Open your eyes and focus on something because it feels like its just me there
