The American governments goal of vaccinating young girls against the human papillomavirus has been disappointing with   having completed a full course of HPV vaccine But now the United States can look to Australia which six years into a successful nationwide HPV vaccination campaign has experienced a sharp decline in the number of new cases of genital warts among young men and women The country one of the first to establish a nationally financed HPV vaccination program for girls and young women has also seen a decrease in the number of cases of cervical abnormalities a precursor to cervical cancer Australias program which started in  offers free HPV vaccination to girls who are  and  years old and catchup programs for girls and women under  The vaccine protects against genital warts as well as cancers of the cervix head and neck The vaccine is typically administered in three doses beginning around age  In  coverage rates for girls that age in Australias schoolbased programs reached  percent for the first dose  percent for the second dose and  percent for the third The findings suggest that Australias program which has experienced little of the resistance that has stymied vaccination efforts in the United States has been an overwhelming success said Basil Donovan an author of the study and a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney As part of the new research   a British medical journal Dr Donovan and colleagues compared rates of HPVrelated diseases in the three years before the vaccine program began and in the four years afterward The study included data on nearly  people who visited clinics in Australia between  and  The researchers found that diagnoses of genital warts among young women ages  to  plummeted  percent in the two years after the program began For men in the same age group genital warts cases dropped  percent During the same period there was also a striking decline in the rate of highgrade cervical abnormalities in teenage girls a sign that a decline in cervical cancer cases may be on the horizon Although a driving force behind the vaccine recommendations is the prevention of cancer it is too soon to measure an impact there The incubation period from HPV infection to the development of an HPVrelated cancer is typically two to three decades But for genital warts the incubation period is about three months The findings showed a trend of sharply decreasing diagnoses among younger age groups The rate of genital warts cases among girls younger than  for example fell to less than  percent in  from about  percent in  a decline of nearly  percent Among women ages  and  the decline in diagnoses was roughly  percent to just  percent in that age group in  from about  percent in  At the same time however there was no significant decline in cases among women  and over A similar pattern was seen in every age group of men with the infection rate falling more and more sharply with decreasing age Dr Donovan said it was clear that the high rate of immunization among young women was protecting young men who have not been vaccinated a phenomenon known as herd immunity The mathematical modelers told us that a large decline was to be expected but we tend not to believe it until we see it Dr Donovan said We were particularly surprised to see a  percent drop in genital warts in young women when only  percent were vaccinated This suggests that the herd immunity that is protecting men is in turn also protecting unvaccinated women Australias vaccination campaign sharply contrasts with the program in the United States where studies show parents often opt out of HPV vaccination for their children calling the vaccine unnecessary citing concerns about its safety or saying they have difficulty explaining to their teenagers what the shots are for Some parents have also hesitated over fears that HPV vaccination might give their teenagers license to have sex even though   the notion that the vaccine alters sexual behavior There was little resistance to the HPV vaccine in Australia just the usual antivaccination people and a few religious groups Dr Donovan said But even the religious groups have gone quiet and I suspect that many of them are quietly getting their children vaccinated
