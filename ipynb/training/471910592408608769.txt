The attacks near the University of California Santa Barbara are renewing focus on programs aimed at requiring treatment for people who are mentally ill as a way to prevent mass shootings and other violence In California a  law allows authorities to require outpatient mental health care for people who have been refusing it Proponents argue that this kind of intervention could prevent violent acts But counties within the state have been slow to adopt the legislation and mental health professionals are divided over its effects The story behind Lauras Law begins in  In rural Nevada County near Lake Tahoe yearold Laura Wilcox was shot and killed by a yearold man with a history of mental illness He had walked into the countys behavioral health center and opened fire Tom Anderson was the countys chief public defender at the time and represented the gunman in court He recalls that the mans family had tried to alert mental health officials numerous times before the shooting Officials were declaiming privacy issues and stuff and wouldnt communicate with the family Anderson says He  started amassing guns and setting up booby traps around his house and he had this psychosis of he was going to be attacked any minute Now Nevada Countys presiding judge Anderson is also a vocal advocate for Lauras Law which was passed by the state Legislature in  The law allows counties to compel outpatient treatment for people whose family or friends are concerned about their mental state Its seen as an intermediate step before someone is forced into inpatient psychiatric care Anderson says this tool could be one way to prevent future violent incidents including mass shootings And he says the patients often respond positively The beauty of the program  the wonderment of it to me  is that roughly about  percent of the people that they do outreach to where they go out to intervene after a person has been referred voluntarily accept services at that time he says So far only two California counties  Nevada County and Orange County  have gone forward with implementing Lauras Law And the state hasnt allocated any funding to it The legislation is controversial There are concerns that involuntary treatment could make mentally ill people vulnerable to civil rights abuses You do have to be conscious that even though these people are mentally ill they do have rights says Steve Pitman board president of the Orange County chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Pitman whose brother dealt with mental illness for  years says family members need more power to intervene and force treatment He says theyre the ones who often know whats really going on while police or a county mental health official may have just a few minutes to drop by for a welfare check The problem in so many of these cases is that when theyre interviewed to see if they meet those kind of threshold requirements they dont give off any signals of being a danger to themselves or others Pitman says Somebody whos experienced in these kinds of things knows all the right answers to give They dont want to go to the hospital so they say all the right things That scenario echoes Elliot Rodgers alleged behavior prior to the   in which he allegedly killed six people then himself But Pitman and others are cautious about linking policy changes like Lauras Law too closely to recent mass shootings For one thing they say intervention cases that fall under Lauras Law may take weeks if not months to fully implement And that may be too late I simply dont think that involuntary commitments are going to be an effective tool toward stemming mass shootings says Jeff Deeney a social worker in Philadelphia who writes about mental health for     Deeney says just a tiny fraction of mentally unstable people are a threat to public safety I think what we dont have that people want so desperately is the program that stops nonviolent nonoffenders from committing their first violent crime because of a mental illness he says Deeney wants to see the conversation shift away from involuntary treatment programs like Lauras Law and toward preventive measures at high schools and college campuses
