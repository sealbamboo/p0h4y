Responding to the Food and Drug Administrations move to banish trans fats from the nations diet some public health advocates grumped Thursday that the agency was playing catchup to a trend already well underway nationwide Still many of the same experts expressed hope that the FDAs move will open the way to a new era in the agencys regulation of food additives By setting several new precedents   may bring some of our most beloved ingredients  salt and sugar  under new scrutiny by the agency they predicted Sodium is next said Dr Dariush Mozaffarian a Harvard University epidemiologist and cardiologist at Bostons Brigham and Womens Hospital In this case said Mozaffarian the FDA has acknowledged a scientific consensus on trans fats that they are hazardous to the publics health The role of excess dietary sodium in eroding public health has drawn a similar scientific consensus he added That should be an equally powerful prod to FDA action said Mozaffarian Tom Neltner an analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington DC said that sugar too may become a target in the wake of Thursdays FDA decision In regulating food additives the FDA has historically focused on removing chemicals that cause death and acute injury Neltner said With Thursdays trans fat decision the agency showed that it is willing to step in when a food additive contributes to chronic diseases that kill many people slowly I hope this presages a new willingness to regulate with an eye to these chronic illnesses Neltner said Even compared with saturated fat  a frequent fellow traveler  trans fatty acid is a bad actor knocking the bloods lipid levels into dangerous territory on two fronts Not only does it raise levels of LDL cholesterol the bad kind Trans fat consumption depresses levels of HDL cholesterol which is considered protective against heart disease Harvard University public health professor Walter Willett and colleagues   in  that consumption of trans fatty acids caused  Americans to die prematurely of coronary heart disease and other estimates have soared as high as  premature deaths per year In a more recent update of trans fats toll the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reckoned that eliminating remaining trans fat from American diets would prevent the premature cardiovascular deaths of  Americans and head off three times as many nonfatal heart attacks In an interview Thursday Willett cautioned that regulating sodium and sugar as additives would hardly be as easy as making a decision to ban trans fats While trans fats have no nutritional value salt is an essential nutrient And sugar when consumed at reasonable levels is not harmful he said If it is to act on mounting scientific concern about dietary sodium and sugar the FDA will have to rethink the assumption that an additive it considers as safe is safe in any amount Willett said The FDAs regulation of food additives has come under growing criticism in recent years and again on Thursday with the release of   of the FDAs program by the Pew Charitable Trusts As the number and variety of substances added to food in the United States has exploded the agencys resources  as well as its regulatory powers under the  Food Additives Amendment  have been overwhelmed the Pew report concludes The FDA has the legal authority to scrutinize any new chemicals before they are added to food and are introduced to the market and to approve or deny their use But in  the agency acknowledged it was sitting on an overwhelming backlog of requests and announced that it would accept voluntary notifications of planned additive use from food manufacturers That policy would allow a food company pondering use of a new chemical in its product to make the case that the proposed additive was generally recognized as safe Unless the FDA challenged the companys argument the company would then be free to use the additive as it saw fit The review by Pews experts found that many manufacturers of foods and food additives have bypassed the voluntary notification process altogether The result the report estimates About  new chemicals have been introduced into the US food supply as additives without any FDA oversight at all And its not often that the FDA kicks a food additive off the list of edibles it calls generally recognized as safe or GRAS as it did Thursday with trans fats The agency last did so three years ago when it   three makers of alcoholic beverages that it considered caffeine an unsafe food additive when mixed with alcohol and ordered their products off the market Before that youd have to go a long way back In  the agency removed cyclamate  a potent artificial sweetener that a  study found to increase bladder cancer liver damage and birth defects in rats  from the list of food additives that were generally recognized as safe Subsequent research found that cyclamates health dangers do not extend to humans and in  there was a request to reinstate the sweetener to the GRAS list but the FDA said the request is not actively being considered
