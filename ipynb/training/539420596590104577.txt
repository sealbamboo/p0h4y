Welcome back, everyone. We hope the long holiday weekend was full of fun and relaxation, and created many pleasant memories. Now, though, another working week has just begun, and you know what this means – deadlines, meetings and looming surprises. So please join us as we fortify ourselves with a few cups of needed stimulation. Call it a workplace pick-me-up. So, time to get on with it. As always, we have gathered some tidbits to help you along. Hope you ease in to the routine and have a productive day. Good luck and do stay in touch….
