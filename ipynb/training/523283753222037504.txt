The Texas hospital where the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US died and two nurses were infected fell short of our own expectations at the beginning of the crisis but will bounce back one of the facilitys executives told NBC News on Friday Dr Daniel Varga chief clinical officer and senior vice president at Texas Health Resources said its still unclear how nurses   and   were infected while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan a Liberian man   on Oct  He had come to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with symptoms only to be sent home with medication he returned two days later and was admitted but even then caregivers did not don full protective clothing until Ebola was confirmed Varga   Thursday for how the hospital handled the cases On Friday he talked to NBC News about the hospitals initial response Vinsons travel to Cleveland and back after she cared for Duncan and how hospital staffers who also treated him are doing Here are excerpts from the interview  Is this hospital getting an unfair amount of blame  We have accountability in this particular situation There are things we couldve handled better you know the places where we didnt perform up to our expectation have devastated us Mr Duncans death was really hard on staff and everybody at Presby and Texas Health Resources and then right after that were looking at the double punch of Nina and Amber both getting ill  Amber traveled Should the hospital have told her not to travel  We coordinated all of that activity with the county and in terms of monitoring essentially our role  was to make sure we had an accurate and comprehensive list of folks who mightve been contacts And most of the monitoring has actually been done by the county  Do you wish you had had better guidance on travel to give your employees  You know the guidelines have been pretty fluid of late and I guess actually wouldnt really call the guidelines the recommendations have been pretty fluid and I think theres some of it thats science And some of it is being built to deal with the publics concern science or no science So I think you have to expect in a situation like this that those things are going to be very fluid  The public perception right now in this country is that this hospital failed at every turn  I think thats an unfair characterization I think theres two really important things to understand Theres a big difference between diagnosing Ebola and treating Ebola I think Presby has done a great job of managing Ebola patients both Mr Duncan and Nina here in our hospital theyve gotten exceptional care  The diagnosing Ebola piece was one where we fell short of our own expectations there  For the first time in the history of the United States somebody with Ebola walked in the front door and we missed that  Was the protective gear adequate  So the personal protective equipment we had in place meets and met the CDC guidelines for diseases where you have to implement contact and droplet precaution Clearly the protection was inadequate for Nina and for Amber I got two sick nurses And you cant explain that away  Do you know now how perhaps they were infected  We dont  Theyre both experienced nurses they both knew what they were doing Everything we can see relative to documentation is that they absolutely followed the PPE guidelines that they had and did them religiously  What do you wish youd done differently as a hospital  I think our learning on this is that communication and dissemination of information is critical but you really have to train you have to simulate you have to reinforce to really make sure that when the first one happens youve got a high enough level of awareness to actually deal with it On the Hill yesterday one of the congressman who is former military was raising this issue of combat readiness You know one of the things most combat units I would assume have is a mix of combat veterans people whove actually been there in harms way and other folks who are new but highly trained and been in a lot of simulation Unfortunately in our world this was a scenario where there are no combat veterans everybody is new  How confident are you that the  hospital workers who had contact with Duncan are gonna be okay  Im very confident I think that we have a small cohort of folks who were you know caregivers from the ED through the first of October that live in a highrisk exposure cohort right now The good news is that that window is about running out and were hopeful for that We think and are fairly confident that all of the folks after the first of October had everything they needed from the standpoint of protective equipment to be secure  Are the staff frustrated Are they angry that the outside world isnt seeing them in the best light Whats the mood  I think youve seen all five levels of grieving here Weve had several moments of gut punches here Everybody grieved and was devastated when Duncan passed away And right as people were kinda getting their feet again around that one of our own Nina comes in and then Amber and so these folks have taken some body blows but theyre great people Theyre incredibly dedicated really smart really effective health care workers here our doctors our nurses all of the caregivers involved Theyre tired right now They do resent you know kind of constant negative coverage but theyre resilient theyre gonna bounce back get a long weekends worth of sleep and be back in the saddle so Presby will bounce back just fine
