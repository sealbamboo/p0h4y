Natika Halil, of the FPA (Family Planning Association), said: "We welcome a continued decrease in the rate of teenage pregnancies. . She said it was "proof of all the hard work of sexual health and education professionals and the lasting legacy of the decade-long Teenage Pregnancy Strategy.". But she said there was "no room for complacency" and there should be a continued focus on high quality sex and relationships education.. Ms Halil added: "While the figures are promising, we are still not at the levels recorded in comparable western European countries, so we must keep up the momentum.".

Some 19% of women born in 1967 did not have children by their 45th birthday, compared with 11% of women born in 1940.
