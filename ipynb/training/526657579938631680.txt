Translating from one language to another is a tricky business and when it comes to interpreting between a doctor and patient the stakes are even higher Consider the story of yearold baseball player   In  Ramirez was taken to a South Florida hospital in a coma says Helen Eby a certified medical interpreter in Oregon His family apparently used the word intoxicado to talk about this person she says Well intoxicado in Spanish just means that you ingested something It could be food it could be a drug it could be anything that has made you sick The family thought something Ramirez had eaten might have caused his symptoms But the interpreter translated their Spanish as intoxicated So the doctor immediately made a diagnosis of drug overdose Eby says A couple of days later the health team figured out that Ramirezs problem was actually bleeding in his brain But by then hed suffered lasting damage The guy ended up quadriplegic Eby says In medical situations doctors and hospitals often turn to family members for help with interpreting but that can be problematic she says You know youve got a yearold in a gynecology appointment she says Is this where you would normally take a yearold Not likely Or youll have a child  an adult child even  interpret a parents cancer diagnosis Thats got to be highly traumatic And the chance that important medical details will be misunderstood increases significantly Thirteen years ago the state of Oregon recognized the problem and required doctors and hospitals to start using professional interpreters The Affordable Care Act also has expanded the kinds of materials that hospitals and insurers are required to translate for people who dont speak English But more than a decade after its state law passed Oregon still has trouble getting all patients the medical interpretation help they need For example many hospitals and doctors turned to a phone service where they can quickly get help in several languages But the people who work for those language services often arent certified medical interpreters  so arent necessarily conversant in medical terminology  and are working at a distance which can lead to other problems Dr Angela Alday an internist at   a community hospital in Hillsboro Ore says that up to  percent of her patients require an interpreter One problem that I run into with the translator phone is a lot of our elderly patients seem to be kind of confused by it Alday says You know some of them dont hear very well so that can be a problem with the phone translator And then particularly if the patient has dementia sometimes using the telephone translator is confusing They dont know whats going on Isidro Hernandes a yearold landscaper in Oregons fertile Willamette Valley says via medical interpreter Armando Jimenez that he too prefers an inperson interpreter to one on the phone Hernandes who speaks primarily Spanish landed in Tuality hospital for treatment of heart problems after feeling tightness in his chest at work A lot of times the overthephone interpreter cant see what youre doing cant describe or relay that message Hernandes says via Jimenez And sometimes they might have errors or mistakes in communications Gerry Ewing the director of corporate communications at Tuality says the hospital has largely been relying on qualified phone interpreters but it plans to use more inperson interpreters Were trying to reflect the demographics of our community which is changing rapidly Ewing says Washington County is around  percent Hispanic so we need to reflect that in the services we provide our patients Alday says shes pleased that the hospital is planning to use more inperson interpreters In the meantime she says she often relies on phone interpreters but also sometimes will turn to a family member for particularly touchy issues I feel like if theres a family member standing there beside them then they understand more whats happening she says Oregon has about  medical interpreters But Eby says only about  of those have the right qualifications So you have a  percent chance of getting a qualified or certified interpreter in Oregon right now she says Thats pretty low in my opinion She says it takes a long time and costs a lot of money to become certified And after going through all that training a person may find that he or she can make more money and have a more stable lifestyle in another career  like being a translator for court reporting Thats because medical interpreters tend to be consultants and dont get paid to travel The hours can also be sparse and sporadic But Eby remains hopeful Now that the Affordable Care Act is   reducing medical errors should be more of a priority than ever she says  its better for patients and it can save hospitals money A   by the American College of Emergency Physicians in  analyzed interpreter errors that had clinical consequences and found that the error rate was significantly lower for professional interpreters than for ad hoc interpreters   percent as opposed to  percent And for professionals with more than  hours of training errors dropped to  percent To help ease the shortage of interpreters in Oregon the states   reports that it is trying to increase training and add  new interpreters over the next couple of years
