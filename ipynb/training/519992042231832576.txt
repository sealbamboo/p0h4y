The Nobel Prize for chemistry just went to a team that discovered a better way to take a picture Really    and   received about  million and a lifetime of adding Nobel Prize winner to their biographies for creating a new way for scientists to look at living cells  peering closer than ever before or even thought possible The method called   is based on the principles behind two separate techniques Stimulated emission depletion    microscopy which uses a laser to light up molecules in certain areas of the cell and   which stacks together many images of fluoresced molecules to reveal fine details The approach offers scientists new ways to study how molecules move inside living cells It could eventually help researchers better understand the connections among nerve cells in the brain or among proteins involved in diseases like Parkinsons Alzheimers and Huntingtons Since the development of basic techniques behind superresolved microscopy in  STED and  singlemolecule many researchers have used variations of the method to create their own detailed images And if youre itching to try you can too  just dont expect a Nobel Prize for it Heres Shots guide to making your own
