A large review of studies has found that vitamin D supplements have little or no benefit beyond the low levels required for bone health The metaanalysis   combined data from  observational studies and  random trials All the studies used blood levels of vitamin D to measure outcomes Dosages varied but most trials used  units or more The observational studies generally found an association of lower vitamin D levels with increases in cardiovascular disease lipid concentrations glucose levels weight gain infectious disease and mood disorders But random trials showed little or no effect of vitamin D supplements on any of these problems The authors conclude that low vitamin D levels are almost surely an effect of these diseases and not a cause Current guidelines recommend supplements for anyone with a blood level under  nanograms per milliliter but the lead author Dr Philippe Autier said that only at levels of  or less would there be a risk to skeletal health Less than  percent of Americans he estimates fall into this category  Dr Autier is a researcher at the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon France Unfortunately there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people he said
