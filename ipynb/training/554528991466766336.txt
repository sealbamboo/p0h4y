Both the American Medical Assn and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise doctors to talk to their teenage patients about sex but discussions about sexual feelings and health occurred in only  of the checkups analyzed in a new study Even when physicians and adolescents did talk about sex those conversations lasted for only  seconds on average according to   published online Monday in JAMA Pediatrics The data in the study make clear that most teens didnt feel comfortable speaking with their doctors about sexual issues Out of  adolescent patients included in the analysis a grand total of zero broached the issue during their checkup In the  visits where sex was discussed parents broached the subject four times and doctors did so the rest of the time In most cases to call these talks a discussion or a conversation would be a gross overstatement In order to get an adolescent patient to say anything beyond a simple yes or no doctors had to talk for at least  seconds and make more than  statements on average Only  of the visits achieved this level of discourse researchers found The findings were based on recordings of doctor visits that were made as part of an ongoing Duke University study called   which monitors the way healthcare providers discuss weight loss with overweight adolescents As such the patients who participated in the JAMA Pediatrics study all had a body mass index that put them in the th percentile or higher compared with other kids of their age and gender All of them were between the ages of  and  with an average age of  years and about  months For the purposes of this study the research team considered sexuality talk to be any comment question or discussion related to sexual activity sexuality dating or sexual identity Two researchers listened to each recording of a patient visit which lasted for  minutes on average Among their other findings  Girls were more than twice as likely as boys to have longer talks about sex This may be because doctors see girls as more vulnerable to the consequences of sex especially pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections the researchers reported One doctor was overheard telling his patient that It is girls who take the hit  African American teens were nearly  more likely than other patients to talk about sex with their doctors When they did they were nearly twice as likely to talk for at least  seconds  The older the patients the greater the odds that his or her doctor would bring up the subject of sex For each additional year of age the odds rose by  the study found  Patients were more likely to engage in a discussion about sex when their checkups were longer and when they were able to spend some time alone with their doctor that is when parents were asked to leave the room  Doctors of Asian descent were  less likely than other physicians to talk about sex with their patients Overall the findings seemed to be a disappointment to the researchers Its clear that doctors cant simply wait for their patients to initiate a discussion about sex they must be proactive in addressing sexuality issues with adolescents they wrote The doctors who are already broaching the subject arent lingering on the topic long enough to give teens a chance to warm up the researchers added If a doctor simply went through a list of questions already laid out by the American Academy of Pediatrics it would take longer than  seconds to read them all  and thats not counting the time needed for teens to answer according to the report Even if their patients seem too young for sex its important for doctors to talk about it so teens realize that sexuality is an appropriate and normal discussion topic at health maintenance visits the researchers wrote That message may pay off with more extensive and detailed discussions during future visits they added In   that accompanies the study adolescent health expert  challenged doctors to step up their efforts in the sex education department Considering that American teenagers are more likely than teens in other developed countries to get pregnant and contract STIs the need for frank talk is clear he wrote While parents family members teachers coaches faith leaders and peers are important sources of sexual information primary care physicians have access to objective sciencebased sexual information that adolescents need wrote Boekeloo a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health    and like   on Facebook
