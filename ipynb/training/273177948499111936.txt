For the growing number of teenage girls who are incarcerated each year detention may be the only time they get health care But the care provided to girls in juvenile detention is often a poor match for their   One reason Its a system that was designed for boys Girls in detention are one of the most vulnerable and unfortunately invisible populations in the country says Catherine Pierce a senior adviser at the federal governments   Up to  percent of these girls have experienced physical sexual or emotional abuse Pierce says Their health statistics are particularly grim  percent have signs of vaginal injury consistent with sexual assault up to a third have been or are currently pregnant  percent have had positive skin tests for tuberculosis and  percent need glasses but dont have them according to research from the National Girls Health and Justice Institute Reylene who asked that her full name not be used was  a few months ago when she arrived in handcuffs at the   in Albuquerque NM after being arrested for larceny and breaking and entering She received much the same treatment as if she were a boy First Reylene was given a full patdown to check for contraband like drugs or weapons After showering and putting on her uniform she was given a brief health screening to make sure that she didnt need emergency medical services before being booked The screening lasts about  minutes and is given by the facilitys staff nurse in a small room attached to the intake area The door remains open for security purposes with guards and new residents passing by Without privacy girls are unlikely to reveal important health information especially when they have previously been victimized says   a psychologist and researcher who has studied the health care of girls in detention for more than a decade Reylene was weighed and measured and had her vital signs taken The nurse briefly evaluated her physical and mental state noting her judgment speech and mood Next the nurse asked a series of about  questions from the facilitys medical intake form including a list of her current medications whether she had taken alcohol or drugs in the past  hours was feeling suicidal or if she had a history of selfdestructive behavior There are a handful of questions given only to girls Are you pregnant If so have you started prenatal care What form of birth control do you use During the screen however Reylene didnt mention a major health issue painful red burns across her breasts Usually Im pretty straightforward but like I lied to the nurse when I first came in here about my burns says Reylene who explains that she doesnt know exactly what happened because she was passed out when she was burned The nurse saw the burns through her tank top but Reylene was evasive because she didnt want them to be investigated If were in the detention center  we dont know who to trust because were vulnerable she says Reylene says she had to ask several times for ointment Acoca wants to improve the situation faced by girls like Reylene Shes developed a tool that she believes will vastly improve the situation  a   specifically for girls that would replace the current intake procedure in detention centers The Girls Health Screen consists of  questions that would be asked of all girls upon arrival in a detention facility The screen can be given by a nurse or the girls can fill it out on their own on a computer The Bernalillo center recently agreed to try out the Girls Health Screen Of the  girls at the facility who participated in the pilot  were identified as needing immediate medical care and  as needing medical care within  hours Some of these health issues had been missed when the girls went through the centers standard health screening procedure Acoca says that if Reylene had taken the Girls Health Screen on a computer the burns would have triggered an immediate medical response There would be a little flag that would go Ding ding ding Ointment for burns  Acoca says But Veronica Crespin one of the nurses at the facility says that Acocas screen takes too long and finds problems they already knew about And they dont have the staff Its just very busy Most of the time its one nurse per shift And theres multiple intakes Crespin says Acoca argues its worth it to make the time Her research has yielded a surprising finding Poor physical health seems to increase girls risk of recidivism In other words girls who have health problems are more likely to reoffend and end up back in the criminal justice system The Albuquerque center hasnt decided yet whether to adopt Acocas health screen But Los Angeles County began using it in June and six other California counties are considering it
