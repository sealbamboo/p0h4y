Safe staffing levels should be extended beyond nurse numbers in England to include midwives and doctors especially in AE units MPs say  The Health Select Committee also suggested breaches should automatically trigger inspections by the regulator Currently ministers have ordered only nurse staffing levels to be routinely monitored and published The system  ordered in response to the Stafford Hospital scandal  comes into place in April But the crossparty group of MPs said there was no reason why it should not be extended across the NHS and social care systems Committee chairman Stephen Dorrell said This should be applied across the delivery of health and care  doctors midwives practice nurses and social workers  Part of the difficulty in AE is driven by the fact there are not enough doctors of all levels Figures from the College of Emergency Medicine show that there are shortages among trainees middlegrade doctors and consultants For example the college recommends  consultants for each AE unit and  for the largest ones But the current average is just below eight Labour MP Barbara Keeley who is also a member of the committee added Staffing levels are absolutely fundamental It is ludicrous not to be transparent about something that patients and their families can see every day The suggestion was put forward in a report that looked at the progress the Care Quality Commission has been making The regulator has been under fire ever since it was created in  Reports in the past by the National Audit Office and the Health Select Committee have criticised the Healthcare Commission for a tickbox culture and failing patients But the MPs said the regulator had a renewed sense of purpose since a new chairman and chief executive were appointed in  Last year the leadership appointed three new chief inspectors covering hospitals GPs and social care to herald an era of tougher more specialist investigations It has also sought to recruit more inspectors  although it is still  short of its  target Mr Dorrell said We are not yet saying all the challenges have been met But by and large we agree with the management of the CQC about their objectives and we endorse them CQC chairman David Prior said This report marks an important milestone
