Zaki Jackson was  months old when doctors diagnosed him with a form of epilepsy so severe that it sparked as many as  seizures a day  For years his mom Heather Jackson feared for his life He would stop breathing she told NBC chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman All the air leaves his lungs and he does not take another breath until that seizure is over After  years and  medications Zaki wasnt getting any better Then finally his doctor wrote a prescription for a medication that calmed the electrical storms in Zakis brain The surprise was that it wasnt for a standard antiseizure medication  it was a prescription for marijuana Zakis case isnt unusual as it may seem Eighteen states plus Washington DC allow use of medical marijuana A number of them provide prescriptions to children with parental supervision to treat a host of ills ranging from autism to cancer to seizures Critics including the American Academy of Pediatrics argue that the remedy hasnt been clinically tested in kids and might have some longterm ramifications Zakis parents were surprised at first and a bit taken aback We are Christians Jackson said We are conservative And were using medical marijuana Thats a kind of big hump for people to get over Despite the stigma associated with cannabis we owed it to Zaki to give it a try Jackson said the results were immediate and stunning I probably stared at him for a good three hours after his first dose and then I fell asleep I didnt feel any seizures after his first dose his mother said In fact its been eight months since Zakis last seizure and hes finally starting to do normal kid activities like ride a swing  Zakis pot is provided specifically for him by a team of brothers who legally grow medical marijuana It has been bred to have low levels of TCH but higher levels of another cannabinoid called cannabidiol or CBD While both cannabinoids impact pain nausea and seizures CBD isnt psychoactive said Dr Margaret Gedde of the Clinicians Institute for Cannabis Medicine That means that kids using this type of marijuana wont get high  Cannabinoids work by hijacking normal brain circuitry  In other words the cannabinoids in pot are very similar to substances our own brains naturally make called endocannabinoids These substances serve to quiet excessive activity whether its in the immune system in the gut or in the nervous system Gedde explained to NBCNewscom  When cells become overactive a switch is thrown and endocannabinoids are released Once they lock on to receptors in the brain a message is sent to tell the cells to calm down she said Its a balancing system and its what keeps seizures from happening in healthy brains In these kids the system is overwhelmed It needs a little extra help Thats where the pot comes in For Zaki its delivered in a syrup that he takes each day which contains an extract of purified cannabis oil that is high in CBD Gedde said  While the drug seems to be working miracles for Zaki some doctors believe its safety in children needs to be tested in clinical trials   I worry that we just dont know enough about it said Dr Sharon Levy of the Boston Childrens HospitalHarvard Medical School I think theyre putting their child at risk of longterm consequences of marijuana use that we dont fully understand There are plenty of examples of highly touted therapies that turned out to be ineffective or in some cases downright harmful A couple of generations ago physicians were recommending tobacco as a good method of relaxation or to relieve stress Levy said It seems unbelievable now While clinical trials are all well and good there are children like Zaki who need help right now Gedde said adding medicine existed before the Food and Drug Administration While there may still be some questions about the impact of marijuana on growing brains this is a substance thats been used for thousands of years and it has a known safety profile Gedde said And theres a long history of women using it in pregnancy If there was some terrible defect that came up in children exposed in utero wed know about it by now Ultimately for a child like Zaki with a dangerous condition even approved antiseizure drugs can cause side effects Gedde said For the Jacksons it was an easy decision Medical marijuana is definitely saving Zakis life his mother Heather said Its saving his life and its giving him a quality of life
