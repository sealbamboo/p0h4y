Each year one in  babies around the world will be born prematurely and over a million of those will die But could measuring the size of a babys feet help save lives  In the final weeks of pregnancy the idea of going into early labour might not seem like such a bad thing But giving birth prematurely  officially classed as before  weeks gestation  can lead to longterm health effects  Depending on quite how early the baby is born infants can either be completely unaffected or left with permanent disability and learning difficulties The issue of prematurity is particularly pronounced in South Asian and SubSaharan Africa which accounts for over  of the deaths caused by preterm birth complications  In rural Tanzania for example about one in every  premature babies wont make it past four weeks  However most of those lives could be saved with simple advice for mothers  And that advice says an international group of researchers could start with just a footprint Most mothers in highincome countries will give birth surrounded by medical equipment or with the support of a highlyskilled midwife  This means that any problems such as a low birthweight or the mothers waters breaking early can be dealt with immediately  In contrast around  of women giving birth in lowincome countries will do so without the help of a trained medical professional  And due to inaccurate dating of pregnancy many of those women will have no way of telling if their baby is too early or too small  However measuring the babys footprint could be used as a simple proxy for birth weight  Theres this grey area when the baby is between around kg lbs oz and kg lbs oz when the baby is more vulnerable to infection and other issues says Dr Joanna Schellenberg of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine But when a baby is born at home there is no way of weighing them she told the BBC To help solve the problem Schellenberg and her colleagues at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania have implemented a strategy called Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga  which means protect the newborn baby It includes using a picture of two footprints on a piece of laminated card and a local volunteer placing the babys foot against the images  If the baby has feet smaller than the smallest foot around mm then the mother is advised to take the baby to hospital immediately If it measures in between the big and the small image then the mother is told about the extra care she needs to provide to increase the babys chances of survival Although the card is fairly accurate for five days after birth it should be used it to identify small babies in their first two days of life which is when theyre most at risk of dying without specialist care Mariam Ulaya is one of the volunteers at Namayakata shuleni village and visits the women before and after the birth If Ive measured the childs footprint and seen that the child is smaller than usual then I instruct them to carry the child skintoskin so that the child can share and feel the mothers warmth says Ulaya  I also carry a small doll with me called Opendo I use the doll to illustrate the proper way to breastfeed the child Such advice may seem simple but can really be the difference between life and death  A   by the World Health Organization WHO says that of the  million premature births globally each year more than  will occur between  and  weeks gestation  Most of these babies will survive if given extra warmth through skintoskin contact and very regular breastfeeding to help fight off infection  In fact the report states that an estimated  of deaths in preterm infants can be prevented in this way  without the cost and emotional upset of intensive care Salima Ahmad is  and has three children who live with her in Namahyakata dinduma village Tanzania Her youngest son Alhaji was born prematurely  I was a little bit shocked because many premature babies end up dying but I was also happy because I had a live baby says Salima  Although Alhaji was born at the local hospital Salima was given advice and support by volunteers from Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga about how to care for him once she got home  Carrying skintoskin was good but difficult in the beginning But when the volunteer was visiting me and encouraging me I could see myself managing it slowly It is good it has helped my child to survive she says Salima also feels that understanding more about premature birth helps mothers like herself to deal with it properly   It helps a lot for the mother not to be surprised when having a premature birth It is useful to know in advance as you get good knowledge on how to handle the premature Myself I do thank the volunteer who talked about it when I was pregnant and she even taught me how to carry skin to skin The project is still underway and it will take another six months before its clear whether measuring feet has the ability to save thousands of lives  However it is already having a positive effect on the way mothers in the area are preparing for childbirth  When I had my first child she was small and was not breastfeeding well and I did not know where to get help says Rukia Twarib who is currently pregnant with her second child  Now I have information if the situation ever happens again I know can go to the health centre to get help Advice from volunteers like Miriam also appears to be contributing to the increase in women now choosing to deliver at a health centre rather than at home  Dr Isa Lipupu works at the nearby Nangururwe health centre  In the last two years we had about  deliveries at the health centre But this time we have already delivered more than  babies This is about  of all the mothers that were pregnant he says If the strategy proves successful then there are already plans to roll out the footprint scheme to the rest of Tanzania giving more health volunteers the ability to quickly spot atrisk babies  Right now many people are aware of the work I do All the families have been very welcoming and have accepted me and this programme says Mariam Ulaya I have seen a lot of changes in the area I can see that there are more mothers visiting the clinic and giving birth there  much more than they used to do  and so I am grateful for that
