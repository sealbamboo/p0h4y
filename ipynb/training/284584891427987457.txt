Its wellknown that chemotherapy often comes with side effects like fatigue hair loss and extreme nausea Whats less wellknown is how the cancer treatment affects crucial brain functions like speech and cognition For Yolanda Hunter a yearold hospice nurse mother of three and breast cancer patient these cognitive side effects of chemotherapy were hard to miss I could think of words I wanted to say Hunter says I knew what I wanted to say  There was a disconnect from my brain to my mouth Before getting treated for cancer Hunter led a busy active lifestyle But the effects of chemotherapy on her brain made it difficult for her to do even the most basic things I couldnt even formulate a smile I had no expression she says I might feel things on the inside but it didnt translate to the outside  It literally felt like you were trying to fight your way through fog Some cancer patients call this mental fog chemo brain And now researchers are trying to quantify exactly what chemo brain really is Oncologist   a professor at West Virginia University says about a quarter of patients undergoing chemotherapy have trouble processing numbers using shortterm memory and focusing their attention Using positron emission tomography or PET scans to measure blood flow and brain activity Abraham looked at the brains of  breast cancer patients before they started chemotherapy and then again six months later On the second brain scan he found significant decreases in brain activity in regions responsible for memory attention planning and prioritizing Those results were recently presented at the Radiological Society of North America   Chemotherapy can cause damage to bone marrow hair cells mucosa Abraham says In the same way it can potentially cause changes in the brain cells too But   a brain imaging specialist at the University of Virginia says the findings bring up more questions than answers Do brain changes occur with all types of chemotherapy or just one type Do they only happen to breast cancer patients or to all cancer patients Wintermark says these are critical questions that warrant further study In the meantime Wintermark says there are some simple ways cancer patients can work around chemo brain reminders on sticky notes and detailed grocery lists And fortunately Abraham says chemo brain is almost always temporary He says patients usually regain their full cognitive abilities within a year or two after chemotherapy treatment ends
