When Congress passed a farm bill earlier this year it expected to save  billion over  years by tightening what many say is a loophole in the food stamp or SNAP program But its not going to happen You see Congress left states an opening to avoid   And so far nearly half of the states participating have decided to take that option  a move that could erase the promised savings So many states are rebelling against the cuts that House Speaker John Boehner is urging his fellow members of Congress to act Since the passage of the farm bill states have found ways to cheat once again on signing up people for food stamps Boehner an Ohio Republican told reporters Thursday And so I would hope that the House would act to try to stop this cheating and this fraud from continuing The cuts were related to a program known as heat and eat In the past it had allowed the participating states to give lowincome households as little as  a year in home heating aid so theyd qualify for more food stamps States said it made the program   and got help to those who needed it But the maneuver was called a loophole by both Republicans and Democrats So last month Congress agreed to raise the amount of utility assistance states would have to pay to trigger the provision  to more than  a year The idea was that many of the states that use heat and eat would decide it wasnt worth their while The expected result Some  food stamp recipients would have their benefits cut an average  a month which is where the savings would come in Turns out Congress was wrong The heat and eat program covers  states plus the District of Columbia Six states  Pennsylvania New York Connecticut Rhode Island Oregon and Montana  have already declared that they will boost home energy benefits to avoid the food stamp cuts Two other participants  Vermont and DC  are actively working to do the same thing Last week Pennsylvanias Republican governor Tom Corbett   he would spend an additional  million in heating assistance this year to prevent a  million cut in food stamp benefits for state residents Gov Corbett took the appropriate steps to make sure that Pennsylvanias children are fed and that families in need are not impacted by what is one of the most substantial federal cuts to food benefits said Kait Gillis a spokeswoman for Pennsylvanias Department of Public Welfare Gillis says its kind of a winwin for the state because the  million that individuals receive in SNAP assistance is then spent in Pennsylvania A spokeswoman for Washington DCs Department of Human Services told NPR that the agency is planning to do the same And the head of Vermonts Department of Children and Families   told Vermont Public Radio this week that the state also wants to avoid hurting food stamp recipients who already had their benefits cut by Congress   This is real important Yacovone told VPR because if we dont make this change thats on top of an actual  million reduction Michigan Democratic Sen Debbie Stabenow  who shepherded the farm bill through the Senate  told NPR on Wednesday that she and her fellow lawmakers will have to evaluate what states are doing and whether it will indeed eliminate the expected savings I dont know yet what that all means Stabenow said  of the conservative Heritage Foundation says shes not completely surprised I mean this is you know a way that states can draw down greater federal dollars and theyre not accountable for those dollars so why not Sheffield says Needless to say antihunger advocacy groups are thrilled Jim Weill president of the   says the whole debate over whether heat and eat is a loophole just missed the point Food stamps are not enough to get the vast majority of recipients through the month Weill notes The farm bill should have had a debate about how to improve benefits not how to cut benefits Hes hoping even more states will now use the heat and eat option to boost benefits even higher than they are today
