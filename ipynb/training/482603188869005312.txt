Whats worse a shot in the arm or a spritz up the nose Children increasingly have a choice when it comes to vaccination for influenza On Thursday the   a panel that advises the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccinations voted for the spritz up the nose It recommended that healthy children ages  through  get   a nasal spray flu vaccine instead of the traditional flu shot But the nations pediatricians arent quite so ready to chuck the needle Recent studies show that FluMist which is made with live attenuated influenza viruses does a better job of prompting an immune response But because it has live viruses unlike the flu shot its not recommended for people with chronic diseases or people who are immune compromised like cancer or transplant patients That also includes children with asthma according to   president of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children who get the nasal spray could actually get their wheezing worsened Perrin told Shots Since  percent of children or  million have   that means a lot of kids are not going to be getting FluMist if their doctors follow the academys   The pediatricians also recommend that children ages  to  who have had significant wheezing or a lot of respiratory illness in the past year shouldnt be given FluMist because they may be on their way to an asthma diagnosis Whats more the pediatricians differ with the advisory committee on the superiority of FluMist saying that they dont think it gives substantially better protection against the influenza virus Perrin says There may be a very slight benefit but its not clinically important This may come as unhappy news to children nationwide but Perrin isnt convinced that the nasal spray is that much more pleasant than a shot Its not something that children would drive around to get Plus shots have become much less painful thanks to smaller needles and better techniques I think weve learned over the years that shots arent always terribly obnoxious to children Perrin says Its very brief discomfort now The advisory committees recommendation has to be approved by the CDC before it becomes official And the American Academy will publish an updated recommendation on flu immunizations for children sometime this fall So stay tuned
