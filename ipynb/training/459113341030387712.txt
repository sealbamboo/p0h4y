The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said Wednesday it would help fund a clinical trial of a promising drug regimen that, if effective, would offer a powerful new tool to fight drug-resistant tuberculosis.. The foundation didn't disclose the amount it would contribute toward the $58 million trial, but the TB Alliance, the nonprofit organization developing the regimen, called it "significant" and said it would now seek funds from other donors to fill in the gap and get the trial under way.
