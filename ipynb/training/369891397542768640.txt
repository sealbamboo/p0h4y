This new preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous public health problem in the United States and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention said Dr Paul Mead chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the CDCs Lyme disease program in a statement Lyme disease which comes from a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi is the most common illness spread by ticks in North America and Europe   Blacklegged ticks can spread such bacteria while feeding on the blood of animals and humans  Most humans are infected by immature ticks called nymphs the CDC says which generally feed during the spring and summer months Ticks carrying this disease hang out in grassy and heavily wooded areas  Patients who take appropriate antibiotics early on in the disease are likely to make a full recovery according to the Mayo Clinic It may take longer to respond to treatment in later stages of Lyme disease but with appropriate treatment most people recover completely Fever headache fatigue and a rash called erythema migrans are all typical symptoms of Lyme disease  This rash often resembles a bulls eye and can appear within a few days of infection Between  and  of people with Lyme disease develop this rash and some patients develop it at more than one location on their bodies  Left untreated the Lyme disease infection can spread to the joints heart and nervous system according to the CDC This can lead to joint pain and swelling After several weeks to months patients may also experience swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain temporary paralysis of one side of the face and brain fog forgetfulness or confusion  Ticks can be tiny Deer ticks may be as small as the head of a pin so look for them carefully  Removing a tick within  hours cuts your risk of developing Lyme disease because it takes time for the bacteria to move from the tick to the host The longer the tick is attached to the human body the more likely that person will be infected Use tweezers to carefully and steadily pull the tick off grasping near its mouth or neck Then put antiseptic on the infected area  Contact your doctor immediately if youve been bitten by a tick and start to experience symptoms Even if your symptoms disappear you should still see a doctor  The standard treatment for Lyme disease in early stages is oral antibiotics Usually a  to day course is recommended but some studies suggest that a  to day course is equally effective according to the Mayo Clinic If the central nervous system has been affected by the disease intravenous antibiotics may be given for  to  days This treatment eliminates the infection but you may need more time to recover from symptoms The side effects from this treatment may include a lower white blood cell count diarrhea or infection with other organisms resistant to antibiotics that are unrelated to Lyme disease  The CDC recommends wearing insect repellent with at least a  DEET concentration and avoiding wooded areas with high grass areas where ticks are most often found It also suggests checking for ticks daily and showering soon after being outdoors Using a washcloth while bathing may remove any unattached ticks lingering on the skin  Covering yourself outdoors can also help Wear shoes long pants longsleeved shirt hat and gloves in wooded or grassy areas says the Mayo Clinic Your pets can also bring ticks into the house so check them regularly  These arachnids cant fly or jump but rather wait for a host  whether it be a mammal bird reptile or amphibian  to feed on while resting on the tips of grasses and shrubs They hold on to leaves and grass with their lower legs a position called questing  As the host passes by the tick climbs on and finds a place to bite  Besides Lyme disease ticks can also transmit other illnesses such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever Make it your quest to stay safe
