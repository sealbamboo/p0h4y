Every year my husband and I wonder what kind of birthday gift to give his dad now  years old  The newest gadget which may be admired but almost surely will be put in a drawer Something much more ordinary like one of the cardigan sweaters he wears day in and day out We know very well what Mel would really enjoy  a weeklong visit with us and our children with lots of time spent eating out in comfortable restaurants where he doesnt have to strain to follow the conversation  But that is hard to engineer since we all live far away A recent study helps me better why understand Mel so appreciates the same triedandtrue interactions that provoke a not again groan from my husband  The report scheduled for publication this year in The Journal of Consumer Research finds that     When were young and believe we have a long future ahead the authors found we prefer extraordinary experiences outside the realm of our daytoday routines  But when were older and believe that our time is limited we put more value on ordinary experiences the stuff of which our daily lives are made Why  For young people trying to figure out who they want to become extraordinary experiences help establish personal identities and are therefore prized said Amit Bhattacharjee the lead author of the study and a visiting assistant professor of marketing at Dartmouth College  As people become more settled ordinary experiences become central to a sense of self and therefore more valued   Its just what you would expect this emphasis on savoring what you already have when your time starts to become limited said Peter Caprariello an assistant professor of marketing at Stony Brook University who wasnt involved in the research   The study findings are drawn from eight experiments all revolving around the same theme In one of them Dr Bhattacharjee and coauthor Cassie Mogilner an assistant marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania asked people aged  to  to recall an experience that was extraordinary or ordinary and then asked them to rate their emotional responses  The conclusion happiness derived from extraordinary experiences remained fairly constant but pleasure from ordinary experiences increased as people got older  Another experiment demonstrated that an individuals perception of the future  whether it was openended or limited  was a critical factor in explaining the results  This is consistent with studies by Laura Carstensen a professor of public policy and psychology at Stanford University which posit that older adults sense that time is limited alters their emotional perspective causing them to   I really like this paper because it ties together several important lines of research said Jim Bettman a professor of business at Duke University  Previous research has shown that   and that     Adding a developmental perspective Dr Mogilner demonstrated in  that the perception of happiness changes over time with younger people feeling more rewarded by feeling excited and older adults getting    One notable limitation in this new study is the relatively small sample of people in their s who participated in the experiments  It would be nice to know how long the effect theyve observed persists but this cant be established Dr Caprariello said The implications  The things we enjoy arent necessarily what will make our older parents or relatives happy The point isnt to rip them from their routines and get them to try something new because you think thats good for them Like my fatherinlaw they may much prefer to do the things they do ordinarily with us at their side
