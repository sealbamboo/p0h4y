Nina Pham the yearold nurse who became infected with Ebola after treating a patient with the disease at a Dallas hospital will be transferred to a highlevel containment facility at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md Dr Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in testimony before a House committee that Pham will be admitted to the NIH tonight There she will will be given state of the art care in a highlevel containment facility he says Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas where Pham is being treated and also where she contracted the disease said transferring Pham was the right decision With many of the medical professionals who would normally staff the intensive care unit sidelined for continuous monitoring it is in the best interest of the hospital employees nurses physicians and the community to give the hospital an opportunity to prepare for whatever comes next the hospital said in a statement Officials have said Phams condition is good Another nurse Amber Vinson who also cared for index patient Thomas Eric Duncan has also contracted the disease Duncan died from the disease last week Dr Daniel Varga a top official from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where Duncan was treated by both Pham and Vinson acknowledged the facilitys mishandling of the original diagnosis and subsequent handling of the situation We made mistakes   in a video link with lawmakers Vargas testimony comes as President Obama for a second day canceled outoftown trips to stay in Washington DC and monitor the response to the outbreak The president had planned to travel to Rhode Island and New York today By late afternoon Obama announced he was meeting with his cabinet again and issued an order giving the Pentagon the power to call up reserve National guard troops if they were needed to help fight the outbreak in West Africa NPRs Scott Horsley said this did not indicate a mass mobilization but was instead the authority to call up people with very specific skills eg engineering communications and Chaplains Duncan first sought treatment at the hospital on Sept  but was sent home with antibiotics despite a high fever and having told a nurse of his recent travel to Liberia an Ebola hot spot Two days later he returned to the hospital was placed in isolation and subsequently diagnosed with Ebola Thats when officials believe Pham and Vinson  became infected In his testimony Varga acknowledges that the hospital did not correctly diagnose the disease on Duncans first visit We are deeply sorry he says After treating Duncan but before she exhibited symptoms Vinson traveled by commercial airliner to and from Cleveland That has raised questions about why she was allowed to travel with the public and   Her reported temperature was below the threshold set by the agency and she had no symptoms according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman David Daigle who talked to The Associated Press The CDC has said that the likelihood of her passing the virus to a fellow passenger is considered very low By Thursday afternoon however CDC officials in Ohio began to make contact with passengers on Frontier flight  which Vinson took from DallastoCleveland According to NPR member station WKSU Dr Chris Braeden the head of the CDC team in Ohio said the widening investigation had to do with the CDCs evolving definition of symptoms In an interview with CNN Dr Marguerite Erme the medical director for Summit County Public Health explained that through interviews the CDC found out that Vinson may not have been feeling well days before she tested positive for Ebola Vinson Erme said is believed to have presented with nonspecific symptoms earlier than first thought so the people on her flight to Cleveland and those who may have been in a bridal shop while she was there are now considered contacts In a statement issued early Thursday from Texas Health Presbyterian the hospital responded to allegations by   that protocols and equipment were not up to the task of treating Duncan The hospital   at the time Texas Health Presbyterian also   to any of our impacted employees who would like to stay here to avoid even the remote possibility of any potential exposure to family friends and the broader public according to a statement late Wednesday adding We are doing this for our employees peace of mind and comfort This is not a medical recommendation Dr Thomas Frieden the director of the CDC is also expected to testify before the House subcommittee   he calls the current epidemic the biggest and most complex Ebola challenge the world has ever faced Frieden confirmed that after Vinson cared for Duncan and while she was being monitored for symptoms she called the CDC and asked for guidance on whether she should take a flight from Dallas and Cleveland I have not seen the transcript of the conversation My understanding is that she reported no symptoms to us he said and wants to make sure what happened in Dallas doesnt happen elsewhere across the country He said efforts are being taken very seriously at the highest levels of the government As soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola we want a rapid response team a SWAT team essentially from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible  hopefully within  hours  so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed that the use of protective equipment is done effectively that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly Obama said after Wednesdays Cabinet meeting
