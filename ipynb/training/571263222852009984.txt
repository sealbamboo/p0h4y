Eric Wang dropped the bar Three hundred thirtyfive pounds bounced on the floor He let out a tired breath as he turned toward a mirror hanging to his right It was his third set of the deadlift Chady Gemayel his workout partner pointed out Wangs mirrorchecking Bro dont hate on the aesthetics replied Wang as he chuckled while flexing in the reflection A junior at UCLA Wang works at a chemistry research lab and is studying for graduate school entrance exams One of his life goals is to become the most jacked chemistry professor of all time His prospects look good He bench presses more than  pounds and maintains a  GPA Wang is a selfdescribed gym bro  a man in his s who works out with other young men recreationally to build muscle Often associated with fraternities and the surfing subculture in Southern California gym bros travel in packs of two or three to the gym egging on one another in lifting routines According to Katherine Martin head of US dictionaries at Oxford University Press people began using bro to refer to male friends in the s Over the last decade its become associated with more of a conventional guys guy and included subcultures like preppy bros frat bros surfer bros and gym bros The bro is relatively affluent he has been to college but is not too intellectual he is lighthearted and likes enjoyable pursuits and he hangs out with other men of the same ilk Martin said Of course that definition is not always a rule Chemistry is not often associated with bro culture Gym bros are defined by their intensive cycles of musclebuilding bulking routines characterized by lifting heavier weights and eating a lot of calories followed by cutting routines which involve more cardio and eating lean proteins to burn the fat left over from a bulk They often take supplements such as creatine and whey protein powder but he explained that his is a natural routine meaning he takes no steroids But what makes their workouts particularly bro is the presence of other bros with their advice and friendly competition Realizing that having a partner  one of your boys  whos looking out for you like you are looking out for him you guys can accomplish more and have that time be more enjoyable said Ben Conlin a Pepperdine senior who works at  Hour Fitness He says he has seen many bros come by his gym most of them working out together You like to check out other dudes in a sense that you like to compare yourself to other people Wang said I think in a male culture thats more frowned upon But I think in the gym bro culture  it doesnt matter whether you are straight or gay you can check out other dudes and it wont matter You can admire the qualities of other people Protein and dietary supplements populate the countertops of Wangs small Westwood apartment next to scraps of completed chemistry homework From the walls hang a photo of astronaut Neil Armstrong  an alumnus of his fraternity Phi Delta Theta  along with an American flag and a poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger When he walks to the UCLA gym a trip he makes five days a week he occasionally wears a replica of the yellow Golds Gym tanktop Schwarzenegger made famous in the film Pumping Iron  one of Wangs favorite movies Its this competitive culture with lifting where you like to go to the gym and make your muscles look big and get that pump in when you do curls and your veins are popping said Wang Its kind of the aesthetic lifestyle In high school after being the skinny guy for years Wang said he began his first bulk He started lifting and drank a gallon of milk every day The result He added  pounds of fat and muscle in one month After more regulated cycles of weight gain and fat burning the footer now weighs  pounds Only  of that is body fat He hasnt yet competed as a bodybuilder but is considering it In high school I wanted to get big and impress the girls and impress my friends said Wang But then after I got into it working out became more of a lifestyle because it just made me feel really good  now I just do it for myself For him being a bro means leading a balanced lifestyle between his studies his health and his social life He said that a lot about being a bro is not taking it all too seriously Academics come first said Wang I think its a great kind of lifestyle to have to try to be fit in many ways But if youre studying chemistry or studying math that is your foremost job in college But being a gym bro has its benefits Look good feel good and live a good life in general Wang said That is the core of the culture to live the best possible life  If you want to get big you need to do what workout bros call bulking These routines involve lifting heavy weights over the course of many sets until you tire out different muscle groups Each day Eric Wang targets certain muscle groups with two days off a week Often such workouts focus on expanding muscle size rather than purely building strength or developing good form In a more professional setting these workouts would be used by bodybuilders rather than Olympic powerlifters who want to lift as much weight as possible without a need to look big Diet is also a key component of any bulking routine When lifting bros often refer to and repeatedly look at their pump which is the swelling of a muscle when blood rushes to it during a workout A good bulking diet has about  total calories a day with  grams of fat and  grams of protein One day a week Wang eats as he pleases with the calories still adding up to about  Bros often gain whatever they want and a lot of it during a bulk building a lot of both fat and muscle during the process After about three months they then start a cutting routine with about half the daily calories to burn off the fat
