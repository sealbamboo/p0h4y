I tried a Shift class in North Hollywood because three of Dana Perris students emailed me to say how much fun it was They were right Which is not to say it wasnt a tough class because it was But Perri a former dancer and acrobat is so genuinely engaging and encouraging that like for any good teacher students want to put out their best effort Adjust dont quit she told the class when it got tough and some of us were flagging The class offered once or twice every morning aims to work every muscle group through a series of exercises using resistance bands weights and a medicine ball Theres a good stretch at the end   Lankershim Blvd North Hollywood   Mostly women in a full class Lots of positive reinforcement Shift stands for shaping how I feel today Varied music with salsa Pharrell Williams and plenty of peppy vocalists  Serious with joy Lowimpact workout on a bouncy floor used otherwise by martial artists that took a bit of getting used to Easy to make the workout harder with heavier weights or higher resistance  I felt as if Id been invited to join a bunch of friends who work out together Perri knows everyones name and talks throughout the class to people individually noticing that one student could do something he couldnt just a few weeks earlier Or that a woman was back after a few weeks off Bring water and a towel   with discounts available for multipleclass packages
