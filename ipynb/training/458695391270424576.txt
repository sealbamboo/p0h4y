Seven cases of a rare fatal birth defect were reported in a remote region of Washington state in  making it the fourth consecutive year that rates have more than tripled the national average health officials said Tuesday Theres still no clear reason for the spike in anencephaly a severe defect in which babies are born missing parts of the brain or skull according to Washington state health officials NBC News  in February But it brings to  the number of cases reported since  in the area that includes Yakima Benton and Franklin counties in central Washington state The anencephaly rate jumped to  cases per  births in the region far exceeding the national rate of  cases per  births Were really concerned about the fact that the anencephaly rates are still so high said Mandy Stahre an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in Washington state We were sort of hoping that this may have been a statistical anomaly or would go away State and federal officials plan to convene an advisory committee of national experts to review options for investigation and prevention Stahre said Next month theyll hold listening sessions in the community to hear public concerns about the rise in birth defects in the region The community members they live here Stahre said They may be seeing things that we dont But that hardly seems like enough said one mother whose baby was born with spina bifida last year and was considered part of a cluster of cases of neural tube defects in the region Its good that they want to know everybodys thoughts but what are they doing about it said Andrea Jackman  of Yakima Her daughter Olivia is  months old Why are they going to put the time and money into chatting with people who dont know Do the research Stahre said one of the goals of the advisory committee will be to decide what focus future investigations should take Do we go back and look even further back Or do we just focus on current conditions and looking foward Stahre said The new count follows a   that found more than two dozen cases of babies born with anencephaly and other neural tube defects in the region between  and  Researchers found no geographic seasonal or other type of pattern to the cases Stahre said Medical records indicate low rates of folic acid vitamin supplementation in the region which has been linked to anencephaly Other studies have shown ties between the defect and exposure to molds and pesticides Critics have said state and federal officials need to do detailed interviews and a thorough investigation of the central Washington cluster Many local residents are convinced that leaking tanks of nuclear waste from the regions nearby Hanford nuclear plant must be to blame but Dr Edith Cheng a University Washington Medicine expert on birth defects said there has not been a good evaluation of the plants impact on anencephaly or other problems Experts emphasize the need for all women of childbearing age to take folic acid supplements
