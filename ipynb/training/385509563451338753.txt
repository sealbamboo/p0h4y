The health benefits of eating fish are pretty wellknown A lean source of protein fish can be a rich source of healthful omega fatty acids and has been shown to benefit     and   health But for years pregnant women have been advised to go easy on the fish The   advises expecting mothers to eat no more than  ounces of seafood like salmon and shrimp per week and to steer absolutely clear of bigger catch like swordfish and shark The reason for this caution concerns that mercury found in nearly all seafood could harm their babies developing brains Now fresh research suggests that advice might have been too restrictive Researchers at the University of Bristol in England have found that eating fish accounts for only  percent of the mercury in a persons body That was much lower than people have assumed lead researcher   tells The Salt It really implies that if women are worried about mercury affecting their children stopping eating fish will not be beneficial The   published in   analyzed  types of food and drink items consumed by more than  pregnant women The team at Bristol sent blood samples from the expecting mothers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis The women had a broad range of mercury levels in their blood from as little as  micrograms per liter to as much as  micrograms per liter The researchers concluded that the  foods analyzed contributed about  percent to these differences seen across the women The seafood items examined  white fish oily fish and shellfish  were the biggest dietary contributors to the variation But herbal teas alcohol white rice and fresh fruit were also associated with higher levels of blood mercury Women should realize that any adverse effects there might be of a small amount of mercury is totally counterbalanced by the beneficial effects of eating fish says Golding a pediatric and perinatal epidemiologist at the University of Bristol The study looked at data from the longterm   study which has been following mothers who were pregnant in  and  and their children A   based on the same group of women and their children showed that eating fish during pregnancy can benefit kids IQ and eyesight Since diet is only one source of mercury  its also found in some beauty products and medications as well as in water and air  pregnant women can only do so much to limit their exposure The bottom line according to Golding is that expecting moms should maintain a balanced diet And Golding says definitely to include fish in that balance as well as fruits and vegetables If women want to cut something out she says maybe it should be herbal tea rather than fish  herbal tea is not something that is contributing anything particularly nutritious Dr Margaret Dow an obstetrician and gynecologist with the Mayo Clinic says the studys findings didnt surprise her A  study she notes linked moms fish consumption with slight deficits in their kids language and memory But other subsequent studies havent been able to replicate the results The quality of those older data were not very good Dow says Even so Dow says shell be sticking with the same nutritional advice shes always given her patients based on the US government recommendations This is just one study she says I imagine we will probably relax the fish recommendations in the very near future  but its difficult to make that jump off of one study
