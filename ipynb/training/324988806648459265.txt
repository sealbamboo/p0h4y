It was just about a year ago when Well readers first met Suleika Jaouad who at  was facing a cancer diagnosis and a potentially lifesaving bone marrow transplant Her first column   captivated readers and transformed Ms Jaouad from an unknown writer to a national advocate for young people with cancer Although Ms Jaouad is now cancerfree she is still undergoing a yearlong chemotherapy regimen She recently took some time to talk about her writing schedule the challenges of being a cancerlebrity and a new love in her life Oscar a rescue dog Heres our conversation Can you start by giving us an update on your health and treatment  I just celebrated my first posttransplant anniversary which was really exciting I have mixed emotions about it because the same day I celebrated my transplanniversary which is what I call it I had to go into chemo that morning As much progress as Ive made and as grateful as I feel to be here today cancer is still part of my daytoday life in a big way  Where are you in treatment right now Ive completed eight cycles of chemotherapy since my transplant I have about four more left Im beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel Im kind of up and down Because these treatments are cumulative I have been feeling more and more exhausted by them Luckily I have only about four more and then it looks like Ill be done hopefully forever  Looking back youve had so much professional success in the past year with your writing Is it hard to reconcile that your success coincided with having cancer Its confusing sometimes I dont consider cancer a gift by any means Ive seen it take peoples lives and the toll its taken on my life and my family As with any difficult experience there is always a silver lining The biggest silver lining for me has been not only finding my voice as a writer but having an opportunity to know my audience hear their stories and learn from them During my transplant the highlight each week for me was reading the comments section of Life Interrupted Receiving that support was unlike anything else Ive ever experienced Hearing from other people who have gone through what Ive gone through but were many years out from it  it was so inspiring and continues to be On a professional note it was exciting to me to see my name in print to have my first byline during the very same week that I was going in for a lifethreatening procedure It gave me hope for the future and hope that one day I might be able to be a writer without the cancer as my main message How do you feel about   Did you ever expect that writing about your cancer would create so many new opportunities Its been a strange feeling When I first started writing these columns I was completely bedridden For the first few months I was in isolation and couldnt leave my room or go to public spaces It was only when I got well enough to walk around that I realized just how public my story had become I was sitting in a coffee shop and the barista came over to me  this healthy normallooking something and she said Oh youre that girl who writes the Life Interrupted column She didnt have a cancer history but she could relate to the lifeinterrupted message and found inspiration in that Thats happened to me several times since then and every time it takes me by surprise Its been incredible for me to meet so many new people in the cancer community and outside of it Some of my best friends today are young women who are living with cancer whom I met through   or  or the comments section of my column What are some of the other opportunities that writing the column has created for you One thing Ive enjoyed has been doing the video series and doing other television and public speaking Thats something I never thought Id be doing particularly because I had horrible stage fright For me to stand up in front of  people and share my story and talk about advocacy or blogging and social media was something I never dreamed of doing Its been very empowering to face that fear headon Now a lot of what I do is travel around and speak at colleges and hospitals Next week I go to Las Vegas for a young adult cancer conference Ill be speaking there and hosting a workshop called Healing Through Writing Then Im off to London  it will be my first time abroad since I got sick in Paris two years ago Ill be speaking at a blood cancer gala and Im very excited Lately you have not been writing your column as frequently as in the beginning Readers often worry this means you are not doing well Do you have a response to that I think postbone marrow transplant complications are quite common I did struggle with a minor case of graftversushost disease And recently I had to have a new port catheter placed into my chest because my veins had become difficult to access It was a minor procedure but it did put me out of commission for a little while And as anyone who has done chemotherapy can tell you the exhaustion doesnt come just the week of chemotherapy but most often the week after when side effects start to take effect I guess I would say that over all Im doing really well as well as can be expected but because of the additional year of chemotherapy I had to do after my transplant I have been very fatigued and unable to write at times But when you are feeling well arent you also incredibly busy Yes thats part of it too I think the thing that helps me the most is seizing those moments when Im well and trying to make the most of them whether its writing a column or traveling to host a young adults cancer symposium I really try to stay as busy as possible My way of coping with my disease has been to constantly try and look for those silver linings and when I find one to make the most of it  You have such a large following on Well Is there a way for readers to catch up with you between columns Im constantly posting updates through my     and   For those who want more regular updates for whats going on medically with me or otherwise they are welcome to look there In your videos and column you have shared moments in your relationship with your boyfriend Seamus McKiernan whom you had known only a short time before your diagnosis How is he doing now Everything is really great Were living together with our dog trying to find a new normal I think thats something Id like to write about  what does that expression mean I think as a cancer patient when you transition into that survivorship period it can be difficult For me its been hard to know whats the next step where do I go from here Weve been trying to figure that out together So much of our relationship has been dominated by disease we are both looking forward to moving on with our lives Seamus recently started   a platform for other young adults to blog about their cancer I feel really grateful to him for doing that because not only has he stood by me for all of this but hes taken time out of his workday to offer other young patients the chance to share their stories publicly Hes seen how much writing has helped me and he has found a way to give that gift to other young people You also wrote about how cancer interrupted the last year of college   who was your bone marrow donor What is he up to now  My brother is doing really well Hes in the Dominican Republic studying Spanish and working odd jobs He hopes to enroll in the Peace Corps I think all of this has been very difficult for him as my donor Hes felt a lot of responsibility in regards to how Im doing so I think its a really nice feeling for him to know Im well enough that he can travel and leave the country without worrying about how Im doing With your personal health and life now so public do you have a way to escape the constant focus on cancer that your column brings It can be too much cancer  all the time Ive started drawing a lot and painting which is something I did a lot growing up because my mother is an artist I find a lot of pleasure and comfort in doing things that are completely unrelated to writing or speaking Its also been so incredible to   Im able to take walks with him which is something I wouldnt have necessarily done on my own Its a distraction thats set in stone four or five times a day Thats been really wonderful I know you have thought about writing a book Are you still considering that I am working on a book proposal Thats the next step for me Im hoping to write about my relationship with Seamus Id like this book to be a comingofage love story Cancer is part of that story but not necessarily the focus of it Im hoping to call it Life Interrupted but instead of focusing so much on the interruptions Id like to focus on the Life part of the title
