The first trial of an Ebola vaccine in Africa has started researchers said Thursday with the vaccination of three health care workers in Mali Its the latest vaccine to be rushed into clinical trials after the worstever outbreak of Ebola in West Africa turned into a full scale epidemic Ebolas infected more than  people and killed about half of them and the World Health Organization says the true toll is likely even higher Itll be months before any vaccine would be available and even then it will be a small amount probably used to protect health care workers But experts say its a vital first step to getting doctors nurses and technicians to even come and help fight the outbreak Health workers are among those at highest risk of getting infected This is just the critical first step in a series of additional clinical trials that will have to be carried out to fully evaluate the promising vaccine said Samba Sow Director General of Malis center for vaccine development However if it is eventually shown to work and if this information can be generated fast enough it could become a public health tool to bring the current and future Ebola virus disease epidemics under control The vaccine was developed at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases part of the National Institutes of Health A consortium led by the University of Maryland is carrying out the trial Ebola vaccine trials are also under way at NIH outside Washington DC and in Britain Mali isnt affected by Ebola but experts agree its important to conduct trials in Africa Another trial is expected to start in Gambia soon This research will give us crucial information about whether the vaccine is safe well tolerated and capable of stimulating adequate immune responses in the highest priority target population health care workers in West Africa said Dr Myron Levine director of the Center for Vaccine Development CVD at the University of Maryland School of Medicine If it works in the foreseeable future it could help alter the dynamic of this epidemic by interrupting transmission to health care and other exposed frontline workers Levine said in a statement The vaccine is made using a common cold virus called an adenovirus that does not make people sick Its had a little piece of Ebola virus attached  a small part that cannot cause disease either In animals such a vaccine has been shown to stimulate the bodys immune response against Ebola virus The trial has been set up quickly Usually it takes six to  months to get a vaccine trial started because of all the regulatory and ethical hoops This one got started in two months Ebola is among the most urgent international public health issues we are facing This research will play a key role in helping to solve it said Dr E Albert Reece vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland
