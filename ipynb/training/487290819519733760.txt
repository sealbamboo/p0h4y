Being in a cancer support group eventually means losing a friend On the first day of November Leslie informed the six of us that she would not attend our next meeting I am so tired and I think all the tricks and treats are done  A private person in her early s Leslie had contacted me a year and a half earlier when she saw a notice in the local paper about my memoir about dealing with ovarian cancer treatments She could not bear to read it but might we correspond  We did And despite her qualms about support groups when one started to coalesce she joined and relished the camaraderie of our twiceamonth lunches She named us The Ladies  Tiny and softspoken courteous and wry Leslie had coped with ovarian cancer for  years and so many abdominal surgeries that she used to say The doctors should have put in a zipper The last operation had set off a heart attack and therefore there would be no others Instead her oncologists placed her on maintenance drugs The medications enabled her to travel and from a trip to Sanibel Island she brought back delicate angelwing shells for us Considering her reticence I suspect it must have taken courage for Leslie to follow her email announcement with an invitation I would like to offer to have you come to our home this Monday at  bring your own lunch and drink for a happy visit I know this is uncomfortable for some and not others and take absolutely no offense if you are unable to visit  On Nov  Leslies husband greeted us under American and Hoosier flags flapping in the wind and then ushered us up a few steps of the splitlevel into a living room where she rested in the corner on a comfortable chair under an afghan What did the doctors tell you on your last visit one of us asked  I simply thanked them she responded I did not want them to have to say they had failed they kept me alive for so long She marveled over the handmade cards a reader of this blog had sent me to give to the group and talked about when she would phone hospice After we hugged her goodbye she did not stand to see us to the door I made my way back to Leslies house a couple of weeks later when her husband told me that they would be glad for the company She was ensconced in the same corner now with oxygen provided by hospice Before leaving the two of us together her husband showed me photos of them as kids and joked that he had not found an expiration date tagged to her toe when he dressed her  Except for the hissing of the oxygen it was quiet in that room Leslie was asleep with her hands in her lap That she was not in pain that she seemed at peace greatly relieved and heartened me  for her sake but also of course for mine Although she rarely put herself forward in the group it was impossible not to see her as the one who goes before a herald of sorts Since I had trained as a hospice volunteer before a cancer recurrence made it impossible for me to serve in that capacity I understood that people could feel the touch and hear the sound of visitors even when they werent fully  conscious So after sitting for a few minutes I knelt beside her stroked her hands and told her how much she meant to each person in our group how much we appreciated her welcoming us into the completion of her life Amid Thanksgiving festivities later that month it was a shock to receive a message from her husband saying that I should visit again sooner rather than later but at the new Hospice House in town The next day I drove there and asked to be shown to her room  Shes no longer with us a nurse said as I blinked back tears  At the familys celebration of Leslie each member of the support group expressed her sorrow The word irreplaceable hung in the bruised air While I was prepared for grief I had not expected to feel gratitude as well  A month later one of the support group members Dana wondered whether we should all visit Hospice House to learn about the programs it offers both in the patients home and at the new building While I am still able she said I want to lighten the load of caretaking my family will have to bear  As we nodded in agreement I recalled a famous epitaph When I imagined hearing these words in Leslies voice they sounded less like an ominous injunction and more like a cordial invitation to contemplate the inconceivable yet inevitable moment when I will cease to be That was her parting gift I thought until we made our reassuring visit to Hospice House
