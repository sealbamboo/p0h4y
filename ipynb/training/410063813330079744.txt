The virus became detectable in one patient in August   weeks after ceasing antiretroviral therapy In the other man HIV became detectable this month  weeks after antiretroviral therapy ceased Through this research we have discovered the HIV reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known and that our current standards of probing for HIV may not be sufficient to inform us if longterm HIV remission is possible if antiretroviral therapy is stopped Henrich said We have also learned that there may be an important longlived HIV reservoir outside the blood compartment  Dr Daniel K Kuritzkes another researcher at Brigham and Womens Hospital said the cases demonstrate that the virus may persist even when there is no evidence in the blood We need to develop better and more sensitive tools to detect the virus as we continue to pursue novel strategies for HIV eradication he said Our results also show that the immune system can play a major role in reducing the viral reservoir but may not be able to do the job alone It is likely that a combination of drugs and immune therapies that target the reservoir will be needed to establish longterm remission of HIV infection In July when the cases were first reported at the   Conference in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia experts stopped short of calling the two cured and said the treatment is not a viable option for the majority of HIV patients After the patients ceased antiretroviral therapy they were tested for HIV every seven to  days Both resumed antiretroviral therapy after the virus was detected They are in good health and the virus is suppressing as expected Brigham and Womens Hospital researchers will continue to monitor the patients and measure their HIV levels as part of a new study of the very early initiation of antiretroviral therapy after HIV rebound  The men whose identities were withheld had been on antiretroviral drug therapy for years before being diagnosed with lymphoma a cancer of the lymph nodes Both underwent intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to treat the cancer They remained on antiretroviral therapy   Approximately four months after the transplant doctors were still able to detect HIV in their blood but six to nine months later all traces of the virus were gone Some patients make it up to eight weeks before the virus returns but the virus returns eight to  weeks after therapy is stopped in the vast majority of patients   Not so for these two men however The two men were compared with   also known as the Berlin Patient Brown is thought to be the first person ever cured of HIVAIDS In  Brown had a stem cell transplant to treat his leukemia His doctor searched for a donor with a rare genetic mutation called CCR delta that makes stem cells naturally resistant to HIV infection   Today the virus is still undetectable in Browns blood and he is still considered to be functionally cured  A functional cure means the virus is controlled and will not be transmitted to others  The stem cell transplant procedure however is very dangerous because a patients immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the transplant  Using a stem cell transplant to treat HIV is not for most patients and only  of Caucasians  mostly Northern Europeans  and no AfricanAmericans or Asians have the CCR delta mutation researchers say The transplant is still not a practical strategy for the majority of HIV patients and the risk of mortality is up to  Henrich says  Dr Anthony Fauci director of the   at the National Institutes of Health agreed    This is not a practical approach for someone who does not need a stem cell transplant since the transplant and its preparation and its subsequent need for chronic immunosuppression is a risky procedure Fauci said   If you have an underlying neoplasm   like these patients had then the risk outweighs the benefit he said However if you are doing well on ARVs and you merely want to get off antiretroviral therapy then the risk seems greater than the benefit Even though the two patients showed a reduction of the virus in the blood it could still be in some tissue  the brain or gastrointestinal tract for instance Henrich said  Earlier this year researchers said an  was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within  hours of her birth with doctors hoping that would control the virus  Two years later there is no sign of HIV in the childs blood making her the first child to be functionally cured of HIV  The Foundation for AIDS Research or amfAR helped fund the study   These findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about HIV and gene therapy said amfAR CEO Kevin Robert Frost  While stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with HIV on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating and ultimately even eradicating HIV Dr Henrich is charting new territory in HIV eradication research said Dr Rowena Johnston amfAR vice president and director of research   Whatever the outcome we will have learned more about what it will take to cure HIV We believe amfARs continued investments in HIV curebased research are beginning to show real results and will ultimately lead us to a cure in our lifetime
