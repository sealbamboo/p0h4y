Every so often an especially insightful book prompts me to reflect on or change my behavior attitudes or both Years ago after reading Type A Behavior and Your Heart by two San Francisco cardiologists   and Dr Ray H Rosenman I   by cramming less into my days and allowing adequate time to accomplish whatever I had to do I just read another book newly published that could help many of us cope with lifes inevitable obstacles It is   by Dr Norman E Rosenthal  the psychiatrist who first described   and how to treat it with light The book is a kind of memoir with a twist a series of autobiographical stories with lifechanging lessons gleaned from nearly six decades of challenging events he and others experienced Instead of stumbling blocks the events became opportunities to step in more positive and productive directions Each of the  short chapters is followed by a life lesson or guide that can help people reorient their approaches to life The popular aphorism When life gives you lemons make lemonade could define Dr Rosenthals learned route to a welladjusted life Everyone knows the clich of course and people often rise above adversity to great heights But sometimes we need a push in the right direction The books titular message  that adversity can be a gift  is especially relevant now as millions of Americans who have lost jobs struggle to reinvent themselves After  productive years as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health Dr Rosenthal felt he was essentially forced out by new leadership This kind of thing happens to many people in all fields Dr Rosenthal wrote Sometimes you need to accept that its time to move on  and to do so And so he did becoming an independent clinical researcher private clinician and perhaps most important of all an author of sciencebased nonfiction written in an entertaining and accessible style In an interview he offered this message to people in midlife who have lost jobs Accept the situation and view it as part of a national trend not a reflection of your personal worth Reach within yourself to see what else you can do what you value then cultivate it There are lots of opportunities out there skills you can upgrade and new skills you can master He cautioned against comparing oneself to others more fortunate which can lead to depression He suggested that older job seekers emphasize their advantages over the young wisdom judgment interpersonal skills and experience all of which can foster creative thinking and effective teamwork The moral of his departure from the institute Look within to gauge your worth rather than depending on institutions or the opinions of others for institutions rise and fall and fashions come and go but a good sense of your own value will see you through lifes ups and downs It is a lesson I had to learn midcareer when my confidence was nearly shattered At the time I worked under an editor who disliked me or my work  or both He repeatedly ripped my copy to shreds leaving me in tears and wanting to quit But before I relinquished what to me was the best job in the world I figured out a strategy that worked writing articles edited by others Soon after the editor moved on and I returned to writing what I and my readers enjoyed The point often faith in oneself prevails over temporary obstacles True sometimes we have only ourselves to blame for these obstacles Yet mistakes if dwelled upon can easily erode a persons ego My late husband once told me he remembered every mistake hed ever made which may have contributed to his propensity for depression Mistakes are our best teachers so dont waste them Dr Rosenthal wrote Acknowledge them learn from them and become more competent because of them One of my most serious personality flaws is a tendency to speak critically before thinking about the potential impact on others Then I fret knowing that I have unwittingly hurt or insulted people I care about In addition to trying harder to stop myself and think before I speak I now apologize for my hurtful actions or illchosen words in a timely fashion and as Dr Rosenthal put it take responsibility for an injured relationship and mend it Sensitivity to the feelings and needs of others Dr Rosenthal pointed out involves skills that are best learned early  notably empathy responsibility and kindness He urges parents to teach their children the value of fairness reciprocity and generosity Dr Rosenthals approach to life changed at the age of  when in his native South Africa he was stabbed and nearly killed in a random act of violence I looked death in the face he said and when I survived and recovered I never felt more alive I savored every moment of every day His youthful brush with death he said shaped my entire thinking about whats important It also shaped his attitude toward death Most of us dread the prospect of dying including me he wrote in the new book But sometimes when the fear arises I say to myself Its a test that nobody fails So youll pass it too Accepting death lets you turn your attention to how you can defer the date and make best use of the time you have
