 the chancellor has come under fire after it emerged that a headlinegrabbing extra bn a year being allocated to the NHS includes m being reallocated from within the Department of Health The extra health funding announced before the chancellors autumn statement this week was widely welcomed by health experts   said it would match the extra funding and top it up with an extra bn a year for the NHS from its planned Time to Care fund Tories argued that the bn headline extra funding figure was justified because in addition to the increase in the overall health budget Osborne also announced that bn would be spent over four years modernising GP surgeries That bn is a oneoff sum that comes from the fines imposed on banks after the Libor raterigging scandal Speaking on the BBCs Andrew Marr Show the chancellor described the extra funding as a downpayment on the NHSs fiveyear plan The NHSs chief executive Simon Stevens launched the new fiveyear plan in October and said the health service would need an extra bn a year by  The health secretary Jeremy Hunt is due to make a statement in the Commons on Monday formally announcing that the government is accepting the target But Hunt will not say how the government will be able to find an extra bn for the   by the end of the next parliament and the controversy generated by Sundays bn announcement illustrates how difficult it will be for the next government to increase health spending in real terms so substantially Osborne will announce more details of future government spending plans in the autumn statement on Wednesday but he faces a particularly tough task because he is expected to admit that his deficit reduction programme has stalled On Monday Ed Miliband the Labour leader will argue that because income tax receipts and national insurance receipts have been lower than expected over this parliament and welfare spending has been higher Osbornes failure to tackle the costofliving crisis has cost the Treasury bn The party will say that the loss is the equivalent of almost  for every taxpayer Osbornes decision to make health a key feature of the autumn statement reflects his eagerness to neutralise the issue in the runup to the general election Labour which has a clear lead on health in opinion polls wants to put the NHS at the heart of the campaign but the   want the election to be fought over the economy Speaking on the Marr show Osborne confirmed Sunday newspaper reports that he would be putting an extra bn a year into the NHS starting from April next year Government sources subsequently confirmed that m of that was coming from internal health department savings  essentially moving money from the back office to the NHS front line  while the rest would come from underspends in other government departments Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said that this meant the bn figure was spin because Osborne was proposing to recycle funds already in the Department of   budget Labours plan is fully funded and will give the NHS bn a year over and above the plans left by this government he said The Tories argued the bn new money figure could be justified by the additional bn being spent on GP services with the money coming from the fines paid by banks involved in the Libor raterigging scandal Some bn will be going to England and the rest to other parts of the UK by using the Barnett formula In England the money will be used to improve GP community services with premises being modernised and technology improved so that facilities such as chemotherapy and dialysis can be provided in local centres This is in line with the strategy set out in the NHS fiveyear plan Stevens the NHS England chief executive said the extra money represents an extremely welcome vote of confidence in the NHSs own fiveyear plan Nigel Edwards chief executive of the Nuffield Trust the health thinktank also welcomed the investment saying it would help the NHS through what looked like being an impossible year in  But he warned that in future governments would not be able to rely on recycling money from the Department for Health budget Taking money from elsewhere in the health budget may not be an option in coming years as the vast majority already goes towards the NHS and underspends are running out Future increases will have to be almost entirely new money he said Paul Johnson the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said on Sunday that Osborne would have to admit on Wednesday that the public finances are in worse shape than the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting at the time of the last budget in March Things havent gone as well as hoped since March not in the sense that the economy has done less well than hoped but because earnings growth has been relatively poor other tax receipts have been relatively poor Well probably end up with the deficit a bit higher than the OBR was expecting back in March Johnson told BBCs Sunday Politics programme He said that even with Osbornes promised squeeze on welfare benefits there would have to be big cuts to other public services in the next parliament The consequence will be that by  we are looking at spending cuts of onethird in a whole slew of public services  local government police justice police environment  all of these things he said But in his interview Osborne argued that the IFS analysis was wrong because it did not make allowance for the fact that a future Conservative government could introduce even more welfare cuts The IFS and others assume there are no further savings in the welfare budget I dont think thats the right choice for this country he said We should be making savings in welfare Speaking on the same programme the shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Osborne had failed to meet his aim of eliminating the deficit and that his proposed tax cuts were unfunded He said that pretty much everything Osborne was saying falls apart under scrutiny Osborne refused to rule out increasing VAT after the election saying he had no plans to do so Balls said that no plans to raise VAT was exactly what Osborne said before the  general election after which he raised it from  to  Balls told the programme that Labour would put an extra bn a year into the NHS partly paid for by its mansion tax on homes worth more than bn Osborne said it was more accurate to describe this as a homes tax He said Of course they come on this show and say its for people with houses worth m or m but once Labour introduces a homes tax it will be people with homes with a fraction of that who will be clobbered with it On Monday at an event in Nottingham Miliband will argue that the governments failure to tackle the cost of living crisis is hampering deficit reduction because it has cost the Treasury so much in lost revenue and extra welfare spending According to House of Commons library research for Labour income tax receipts during this parliament have been bn lower than expected in  national insurance contributions bn lower and social security spending bn higher The governments failure to build a recovery that works for everyday people and tackle the costofliving crisis isnt just bad for every person affected it also hampers our ability to pay down the deficit Miliband will say Britains public finances have been weakened by a Toryled government overseeing stagnant wages which keep tax revenues low The result has been David Cameron and George Osborne missing every single target they set themselves on clearing the deficit and balancing the books by the end of this parliament
