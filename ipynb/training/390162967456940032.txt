Parents learn the hard way that late bedtimes make for cranky kids the next day But inconsistent bedtimes may have a greater effect on childrens behavior a study says Kids who didnt go to bed on a regular schedule had more behavior problems at home and at school When those children were put to bed at the same time each night their behavior improved That data came from an ongoing study of  British schoolchildren Mothers were asked if their child had a regular bedtime during the school week That information was collected when the children were ages   and  The mothers were also asked to complete a standardized test that measures behavior including conduct problems hyperactivity emotional symptoms problems with peers and positive behavior Children who went to bed after  pm were rated as having more behavior problems than children who went to bed earlier Thats no surprise theres abundant evidence on the effects of   on childrens school performance and behavior But irregular bedtimes actually caused worse behavior than short sleep Teachers were asked to rate some of the childrens behavior at age  They too reported more behavior problems in children with irregular bedtimes The good news is that the behavior problems improved when children were shifted to a more regular schedule The scientists call that a clear doseresponse pattern And behavior deteriorated in children who had regular bedtimes at age  and were on a more random plan by age  the parents said The sleep issues could affect behavior in two ways according to the researchers at University College London It could mess up childrens circadian rhythms which are slow to change And it could affect maturing brain regions involved in regulation of behavior Pediatricians should ask about irregular bedtimes the researchers say not just how many hours a kid is logging This study has shortcomings It doesnt report how much the children actually slept but rather how much their mothers said they slept And it could be that the families with random bedtimes had other problems that affected the childs behavior Lack of sleep causes  n children and adults including weight gain and insulin resistance And regular bedtimes are recommended for adults too because maintaining a regular   makes it easier to fall asleep and wake up on time No word if it makes grownups less cranky But it probably couldnt hurt
