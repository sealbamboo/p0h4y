Hello, everyone, and how are you today? A gloriously sunny sky is enveloping the Pharmalot campus this morning, where the shortest of short people has departed for another day of learning at the local school house and the official mascots have settled in for a snooze. We, however, are moving at a faster clip, thanks to our ritual cup of stimulation (our flavor today is Pumpkin Spice, for those who track this sort of thing). Please feel free to join us with whatever you find stimulating. And now, on with the show. The tidbits can be found below. Have a grand day and, remember, we accept interesting documents and other secrets…. If Actavis proceeds with plans to buy Allergan, which makes Botox, for $60 billion or more, the deal will represent the biggest bet yet by one of the traditional generic drug makers on expanding into branded medicines; Looking to build a biosimilar portfolio, Amgen says its version of the Humira treatment showed comparable safety and ability to generate immune response in patients with plaque psoriasis in a Phase III trial; and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals ceo Mark Murray says that being a biotech company with a treatment candidate in a developing crisis like Ebola is like being in “shark-infested water.”
