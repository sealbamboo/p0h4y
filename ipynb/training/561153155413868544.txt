We all have friends who despite hectic schedules never miss a day at the gym Who cant stop talking about the next K Who cant stop smiling after   class Sure theyre a little well obsessive about working out But we envy them The good news is we all have the potential to become fitnessobsessed says Tom Holland a Connecticutbased celebrity fitness trainer exercise physiologist and expert in sports psychology Here are  proven ways to make exercise a habit So you tried   and you hated it or you hurt yourself on your first day of   That doesnt mean that all forms of fitness arent for youso get back out there and try a different one Find something that makes you tune out and gives you a release from your daily grind says Wollwhether that means focusing on the ground ahead of you on a trail run or following the instructor in a Zumba class Youll know you found it when you look at the clock and an hour flashes by without you noticing Holland agrees I always tell my clients I dont exercise he says Ill go for a run or go to the gym but I dont think of it as exercise because that suddenly gives it a negative connotation Think about when where and how your workout can best and most easily fit into your daily routine says Woll You dont want to travel far to get to a gym for example she says or the likelihood of going will decrease immensely For some people a gym near the office will help them squeeze in a workout before work or during their lunch break for others working out at home or at a gym near their house is more convenient And dont forget about where youll work out on the weekends Plan ahead to make sure you can get everything you needlike clothes and shower suppliesto and from your workouts Or take a tip from Haupert who rented a locker at   so she could keep her things there all week long Being accountable with money is a good thing says Holland If you invest in a fitness regimen youre more likely to work harder to get your moneys worth Hes learned that when he gives away training sessions for free his clients arent nearly as motivated If you can afford it joining an upscale gym or splurging on boutique fitness classes could be just the thing you need to force yourself to actually go Or bribe yourself with smaller investmentstreat yourself to a   or a new GPS watch for example For some people the feelgood side effects of exercise are enough to keep them going Others need something a little more tangible to get themselves up and out of bed every morning If you thrive on statistics and numbers you may find that using apps computer programs or   and   can help you stay on track with a new routine Whether youre counting your daily steps or the number of calories youve burned technology can help you challenge yourself to new personal bests every day Plus many of these programs can be integrated with your social networks making it easy to let your Facebook feed know that you just ran  miles or checked in at the gym Once your friends start asking you about your new exercise habits it may be harder to let them fall by the wayside Combining vacations with exercise is a great reward and it helps people set goals that theyll actually want to accomplish says Holland Say you want to go to Italy so you sign up for a bike tour around the country while youre there well now youve got to get in shape for it so you can have the best possible experience while youre there Sign up for a destination racethe Paris Marathon for exampleor just book a trip that involves a lot of physical activity whether its hiking or skiing If youre going to start getting up earlier see tip No  its important to make sure youre still getting enough sleep most of us need seven to eight hours a night This probably means tucking yourself in at a decent hour rather than staying up late watching Netflix or scrolling through Instagram Luckily research has shown that working out during the day can help you fall asleep faster and   overall so your new exercise habit may actually make this easier To make a permanent change in your sleeping patterns begin shifting your bedtime up  minutes every night and   until youve reached your goal times say to bed at  pm and up at  am Fitness competitions may sound pretty boring to some people why pay money to wake up early and run around in circles again If a regular old K doesnt quite do it for you grab some friends and sign up for something with a bit more personality From   to militaryinspired obstacle courses to costumed and   which involve participants getting splattered with brightly colored paint and powder   are certainly having a moment And the best part Theyre all about finishing and having a good time many of them arent even timed and they welcome runners and walkers of all ages and fitness levels
