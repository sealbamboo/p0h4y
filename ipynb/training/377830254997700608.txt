A rare fungus found in soil and trees has sickened hundreds of people in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest in the last decade  and killed dozens  but scientists now say theyre seeing different strains of the potentially deadly bug in additional US states  As of June  cases of infection caused by Cryptococcus gatti a fungus once confined to tropical climates had been reported in the US That includes at least  cases in Oregon and Washington where officials have been tracking an outbreak since   But at least  cases have been detected in eight states outside of the Northwest since   and six of those patients died according to a new report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases  No ones calling it a public health crisis officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they just want to raise awareness It is really really rare very few people get infected by this said Dr Julie Harris a fungal disease expert with the CDC You can still go outside you can still do your daily activities Of the six patients in the new tally who died four succumbed to severe lung and brain infections before they were diagnosed A previously healthy yearold Georgia woman showed up at a community hospital with a headache and fever  and died within two weeks of getting sick  Of those who provided travel information none had been to the Pacific Northwest recently the study found Thirteen of the newest US cases were reported in California with five more in Georgia two in New Mexico and one each in Alabama Florida Hawaii Michigan and Montana  The original outbreak was caused by three specific strains of C gattii but the new cases including those in nearby California were caused by unrelated strains Harris said  People are typically infected when they inhale the airborne spores of the fungus that began causing disease and deaths in  in Canada Since then  cases have been tracked in British Columbia health officials told NBC News As of  about  people in the US and Canada had died from C gattii infections according to latest figures  The reason the new cases are interesting and worth documenting is because they provide evidence that C gattii isnt confined to the Northwest and could be an unrecognized source of pneumonia and meningitis across the US I think its something that has been going on and we havent found it because we havent looked for it said Harris  Most Cryptococcus infections in the US occur in people with weakened immune systems such those with HIV or those whove recently undergone organ transplants In many cases they get C neoformans a close cousin to C gattii and much more readily recognized Patients are typically treated with strong antifungal medications  In the newly documented cases doctors who encountered patients with puzzling fungal infections took their diagnoses a step further and insisted on testing for C gattii Because the infections arent required to be reported outside the Northwest such sporadic testing provides the only data that scientists have that the fungus is present in an area Harris said  Before  C gatti was mostly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world But that year it showed up on Vancouver Island British Columbia where it began infecting people and animals By  it was making people sick in Oregon and Washington and by  it had become a reportable disease in those states Scientists dont know why it took hold in the Northwest though they speculate that climate change may have contributed and that the fungus was then spread by commerce or travel  C gattii is alarming because it can strike healthy people and because it has a long incubation period  from a few days to several months in some cases Although many people are exposed to it doctors dont know why only some are sickened by it  Theres not really anything hikers and other outdoorlovers can do to reduce their risk of contracting a C gatti infection Harris said The new information is more of a warning for doctors and health workers to consider the bug when theyre stumped by a puzzling infection  We just want them to know that hey these infections are not limited to the Pacific Northwest or to people who travel there Harris said
