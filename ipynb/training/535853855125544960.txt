Are you missing the big family gathering for Thanksgiving this year Try dining by Skype That is what Northeastern University student Madeline Heising did when expensive flights and school obligations kept her away from Thanksgiving dinner with her family during her junior year in college The technologyassisted holiday meal has now become one of her most cherished Thanksgiving memories My mom suggested Why dont we just Skype you in said Ms Heising At the time I wasnt sure it would work but it was actually the perfect way to celebrate Thanksgiving away from home  As her entire extended family sat down to her moms homemade Thanksgiving dinner in Virginia Madeline set out her own Thanksgiving feast in her dorm room in Boston Madelines mother set the laptop on the table where her daughter normally sits when she is home A few adjustments of the computer screen gave Madeline a view of the entire table  Back in Boston Madeline dined on stuffed acorn squash mashed potatoes green beans and sweet potato casserole she had made in her dorms kitchen While she ate she made small talk with her brothers and watched her young cousins jump out of their seats and pop in front of the computer screen Even though she was  miles away she felt right at home   After the meal the family in Virginia sat down to coffee and pie Still watching via Skype Madeline plopped herself on her dorm room couch and nibbled on a vegan treat of homemade cinnamon and sugar coated almonds  a simple yet elegant twist of salty and sweet Watching her family through her computer screen and snacking on these tasty morsels allowed her to reflect on what she was really thankful for  Today Madeline is a busy college student majoring in communication studies with a concentration in health and food policy She blogs about food and has written an ecookbook that offers simple vegan dishes with five ingredients or less  The first time she tried to make the almond treats she coated the almonds in oil and her hands became an oily mess of cinnamonsugar Through much trial and error she found that it was better to cook them on the stove rather than in the oven which allowed her to see more easily when they were ready and to remove them before they started burning  Madeline plans to spend Thanksgiving with another family this year but will Skype with her family for dessert She also plans to make the sugary almonds  There was just something about that moment where I was able to just sit back and take everything in she said Cinnamon Sugar Almonds have become her new Thanksgiving tradition
