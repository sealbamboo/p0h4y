The NHS in England has missed its fourhour AE waiting time target with performance dropping to its lowest level for a decade figures show From October to December  of patients were seen in four hours  below the  target The performance is the worst quarterly result since the target was introduced at the end of  The rest of the UK is also missing the target and   recently This signifies they are facing exceptional pressures and triggers extra staff being called in and other steps including cancelling nonemergency care such as routine operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted meeting the AE standard was proving tough but pointed out that England has some of the toughest targets in the world Targets matter but not at any cost The priority is to treat people with dignity and respect But Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said patients were being exposed to an unacceptable levels of risk This crisis in AE has its roots in the governments cuts to social care and GP access and its disastrous decision to throw the NHS into the chaos of reorganisation  It is the second time the target  which measures the point from arrival to being discharged admitted to hospital or transferred elsewhere  has been missed under the coalition  In the first three months of   of patients were seen in four hours  Meeting the target has proved particularly tough since the end of the summer  The target has been missed on a weekly basis  England provides these figures along with the quarterly statistics  every week except one since the end of August If a hospital declares a major incident or internal incident it is a sign that things have got exceptionally busy and special measures are need to cope  This can happen in winter when demands are high but also at other times for example if there is a major road accident The declaration allows hospital bosses to call in extra staff to help them cope But it is also worth noting that some hospitals may not necessarily go public with their problems You can be sure that there are more sites under intense pressure than the numbers officially on alert  What is important is what steps they take in terms of restricting the flow of patients into the hospital One of the first measures is to start postponing routine activity such as knee and hip operations or outpatient appointments This is not uncommon  and is likely to be happening at a significant number of sites at the moment More unusual is diverting ambulances so no emergency patients arrive In effect that closes the hospital However this is only used as a last resort as it increases demands on nearby sites   However the performance in England is still better than elsewhere in the UK The data in the other nations lags a bit behind England In Wales the data from November shows just  of patients were seen in time Northern Ireland is performing even worse  just over  of patients were seen within four hours in November Scotland has a slightly tougher waiting time target   of patients should be seen in four hours  but in September  were Comparing the September figures for England and Scotland shows England was performing slightly better in that month It means according to latest data all parts of the UK are missing the AE waiting time target Labours Andy Burnham said This crisis in AE has its roots in the Governments cuts to social care and GP access and its disastrous decision to throw the NHS into the chaos of reorganisation Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine warned hospitals were reaching a tipping point  He said part of the reason was the NHS nonemergency line  advising an increasing proportion of people to seek emergency care Dr Mann said My concern is the daily intolerable pressure is starting to have an effect on staff  they are more likely to become sick become unable to work burn out and choose to go into other professions That means it is not a sustainable situation Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said These figures show what patients and staff already know  AE departments are constantly running at full capacity Patients and hardworking staff are being let down by a system which is in crisis Dr Mark Porter of the British Medical Association added hospitals were facing unprecedented levels of demand  Staff are working flat out but the system is struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door Growing pressure on services throughout the year means hospitals have no spare capacity to deal with the winter spike in demand
