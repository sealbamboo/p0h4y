At the Ebola treatment center in Foya Liberia theres one thought on every American volunteers mind  days of isolation The threat of quarantines for health care workers coming back from West Africa cropped up in nearly every conversation I had on Saturday with doctors and nurses at the clinic run by Doctors Without Borders Everyone was worried especially a nurse from New York City Some states like New York New Jersey and Illinois are already requiring day quarantines possibly in hospitals for all medical staff coming home Others might follow But most staff members werent worried about themselves They were thinking about Liberians Just about every foreigner at the clinic repeated the same concern Mandatory quarantines for volunteers returning from the Ebola front line would only hamper the fight to end the epidemic The strategy could backfire said Dr Cedric Yoshimoto of Volcano Hawaii If doctors and nurses are going to face quarantine and public disapproval when they come home then eventually a lot fewer of them will make this effort to help said Yoshimoto who had been treating Ebola patients at the center for three weeks That ripple effect is already happening Some health workers have decided to cut short their fourtosix week assignment in West Africa because of the threat of quarantining Doctors Without Borders said Monday in a   Forced quarantines of asymptomatic health workers  is not grounded in scientific evidence and could undermine efforts to curb the epidemic the aid group wrote Instead the agency supports diligently monitoring doctors and nurses when they return home Doctors and nurses in West Africa are already in short supply Without international health workers like Yoshimoto the Ebola epidemic will take longer to control More West Africans will die And the US will be no safer The country will remain susceptible to imported cases and to small clusters of cases as already happened in Dallas A few days after leaving   I flew back from Monrovia to Washington DC While boarding I met Michael Kerls a pilot from Corpus Christi Texas He has been flying supplies around Liberia for the Christian aid group   When he lands in Atlanta today hell face a day quarantine mandated by Samaritans Purse Ill be at a hotel by myself no contact no family Kerls said Samaritans Purse is trying to be responsible about anyone they bring back from the Ebola area so we dont have anyone who spreads the Ebola disease Kerls plans to return to Liberia in December He has a permanent job there Im hoping to bring my wife back with me he said proudly But most doctors and nurses going to West Africa are volunteers They have medical practices and jobs in the US Theyre using up vacation time to go abroad Theyre already taking off three to four weeks to come over Having to spend  days in isolation is really hard on them  and expensive he said It will be hard for Samaritans Purse to staff some positions Like several aid workers Ive talked to Kerls blames fear and panic in the US for the quarantine policies Dr Yoshimoto back in Foya had no doubt that was the problem The virus is certainly a big enemy were fighting he said But the second enemy were fighting is panic fear and ignorance The reaction in the US is often based on no science at all just on fear Ebola is bad Clearly it kills people But so did HIV  and leprosy he added With a reasonable scientific approach weve been able to overcome those diseases or learn to live with them I believe we can do the same with Ebola
