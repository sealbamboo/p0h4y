Rand Paul a physician said Even if the science doesnt say bunching them up is a problem I ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least In fact research shows that vaccines do not cause autism Rather vaccines prevent  million deaths worldwide every year   and spreading vaccines out over a period of time only leaves children more exposed and vulnerable to disease  Still myths around vaccines may keep parents from protecting their children from dangerous diseases when theres every reason to get them vaccinated Only one in a million children has a serious adverse reaction to vaccinations Those are great odds Youre  times more likely to get struck by lightning than have an allergic reaction to a vaccine Gupta says Taking aspirin for example is much more likely to cause brain bleeding Still five nailbiting notions continue to scare away people from the protection they need  This is the big one This was a prevalent myth that grew out of   published in The Lancet a British medical journal in which Dr Andrew Wakefield linked autism and childhood vaccines  The  study was embraced by parents of children with autism who pointed out that autism rates were going up as the occurrence of measles mumps and rubella drastically decreased The antivaccine movement gained traction when Jenny McCarthy and other celebrities joined the cause Researchers criticized Wakefield but the paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children in Britain getting the vaccine that prevents measles mumps and rubella and a smaller decrease in the United States Most of Wakefields coauthors withdrew their names from the study in  after learning he had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers  The same year the   and found no connection between vaccines and autism  Around    or altered the medical histories of all  of the patients whose cases formed the basis of his study  The Lancet retracted Wakefields paper in  He lost his medical license  The chief science officer at   an autism advocacy group urged parents to vaccinate their children Over the last two decades extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism   earlier this year The results of this research are clear vaccines do not cause autism  We urge that all children be fully vaccinated Vaccines are laced with mercury thats poisoning our children and causing autism  In the s some vaccinemakers used a preservative called   which contained a very low concentration of a mercury compound  Its there to prevent the growth of potentially dangerous bacteria and fungus First of all children are hardly getting Thimerosal in vaccines anymore In  the Food and Drug Administration stopped issuing licenses for childrens vaccines containing it On top of that the fact that most routine vaccines for children under  years of age dont have it  A trace amount is in still used some childrens flu vaccines  Since the preservative has been used for decades and still is in adult vaccines there have been many studies and none of them shows a correlation with autism or other serious side effects    As for autism since the time Thimerosal was removed from childrens vaccines the percentage of diagnosed autism cases happens to have shot up   If Thimerosal were the cause this wouldnt make sense Doctors and insurance companies are promoting vaccination to drive profits    Some insurers pay the cost of vaccinations to prevent having to pay more later if a patient gets sick A   actually lose money when giving vaccines Children are getting more vaccines than they used to and its pumping their bodies full of antigens  the bits of vaccine that cause the body to build resistance Taken together theyre too much for a child to handle  Though there are more vaccines patients are inoculated today with far fewer antigens than  years ago Gupta says In the s people received about  antigens total compared with  today   Spreading the vaccines out over a long period of time for fear a child may be getting too high a cumulative dose of antigens only leaves children more exposed and vulnerable to disease  And as far as autism As with Thimerosal autism diagnoses shot up around the time antigens were being reduced in vaccines Its better to avoid vaccines because children dont need them The diseases they help prevent are long gone and if a child gets one anyway it will just run its course That spate of   that broke out last winter Unvaccinated children got it at Disneyland and spread it to other kids who arent inoculated   And  was a big year for measles cases with  in the United States Its not harmless It can lead to pneumonia lifelong brain damage deafness and death  Globally its still a major killer of children   Between  and   of children younger than  years of age in the United States with measles had to be hospitalized   Before the measles vaccine was introduced in the s there were  million to  million cases a year resulting in  to  US deaths    Measles vaccination in this country has reduced the rate of infection in the population by  compared with times when no vaccine was available
