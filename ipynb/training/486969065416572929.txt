Brazils cataclysmic World Cup loss to Germany broke the heart of a nation But for some fans the emotional anguish may have felt all too real  resulting in heart attacks that not even the USs star goalie Tim Howard could stop A   published in the   found that cardiac events skyrocketed during World Cup matches Researchers looked at data from hospitals around Munich during the  games held in Germany They found that the number of cardiac emergencies more than doubled on days when Germany was playing in World Cup matches compared with days when the German team was idle and also a control period when no matches were played About  cardiac events were seen on German match days compared with  on the nonmatch days and  daily during the control period The emotional stress during matches the paper argues increases a fans risk of suffering a heart attack Soccer is engaging but if youre on the losing side you can feel helpless says   a psychiatrist from Stanford University who specializes in stress and wasnt involved in the  study That combination of a time limit and the difficulty of overcoming being behind makes it a stressful sport to watch Stress Spiegel tells Shots changes whats circulating in the bloodstream When someone watches a particularly exciting or emotional match such as the United States defense in the net against Belgiums onslaught the body releases adrenaline and other hormones into the bloodstream This surge can be dangerous for people who already have buildups of   Johns Hopkins cardiologist   says The plaques can rupture The body creates blood clots to patch the damaged arteries But the clots can block oxygenrich blood from reaching the heart causing a cardiac attack Its not like this could happen suddenly in anybody Martin tells Shots There has to be underlying disease such as high blood pressure and diabetes Unhealthful habits such as sitting in front of the TV or computer for too long could exacerbate the chances of suffering a cardiac attack during a game We dont know what day someone will have a heart attack Martin tells Shots But heart attacks are more likely to happen in people with risk factors for them Already in Brazil   suffered a heart attack in a bar while watching the nailbiting penalty kick duel between Brazil and Chile The man who had diabetes died two hours after being brought to the hospital Martin said he wasnt surprised that soccer matches could trigger cardiac events in fans He was surprised however by the magnitude of the trigger reported in the paper about the German World Cup experience Still some researchers are skeptical about any connection between soccer games and cardiac events Epidemiologist   says that any evidence of soccerinduced heart attacks disappears at the population level He authored a  metaanalysis titled  He analyzed  previous papers that looked at associations between heart attacks and World Cup games in people living in Belgium France and Australia In his analysis which had included the German study he found no link between World Cup matches and heart attacks The German study was an outlier and inconsistent with all those other studies he says Its telling a different story He also conducted his own study that looked at death certificates in Italians during the  World Cup and found no connection between watching soccer games and heart attacks If the results obtained by the German study are accurate then BaroneAdesi says that would mean that watching a football match is the strongest cardiac event trigger found so far he says adding thats just not plausible But cardiologist   of the University of Southern California says that the triggers that the German study found cant be totally ignored Look theres a signal here in this study Kloner tells Shots Youre not going to see it in all games It depends on the patient If he says I feel my heart racing then thats concerning In  Kloner published a paper titled   His study looked at Super Bowl games in Los Angeles in much the same way that previous studies looked at soccer games He found a small but statistically significant increase in heart attackrelated deaths following the games After reviewing the scientific literature Kloner says that watching sporting events such as soccer matches and Super Bowls may trigger heart attacks in people prone to them But he cautions These are correlations you cannot call them causative
