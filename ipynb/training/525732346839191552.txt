Dr Rick Sacra says that despite his battle to survive Ebola he would be willing to return to Liberia to help   recover Sacra who was infected with the virus there and flown to the United States   said in   on MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell Reports that New Yorkers should be reassured by the way the latest US case is being handled Dr Craig Spencer returned to New York on Oct  after treating Ebola patients in Guinea and had been checking his temperature each day On Thursday he called health officials to report being sick and was quickly taken to Bellevue Hospital Spencer was   on Friday His fiance and two friends are under quarantine but arent sick Sacra also described his own fear and physical suffering as he fought the disease and spoke about the   a Dallas nurse infected while caring for the   in the US But Sacra reiterated what health officials have been saying all along that Ebola is not easily transmitted particularly in its early stages Here are excerpts from his interview  Tell us first of all how you feel and what do you think Nina Pham is about to go through as she regains her strength  Well I feel good right now but   even after leaving the hospital before I started to have any sense of stamina or energy or strength So just about a week week and a half now Ive been feeling strong So shes going to have a recovery that takes time but she has bounced back remarkably quickly with the excellent care that she received  And she is younger than I am so she might have a little quicker recovery  Have you gone back to work  I have not yet though Ive started putting in some inquiries about when I can get some hours  Dr Spencer sort of isolated himself he didnt go to work but  after coming back from Guinea he was out and about  he went bowling he was on the subway That has led to some criticism Do you think its reasonable that people should stay home for a period  I think the main thing to emphasize to the public is that people who are not ill who dont have a fever who are not clinically ill cannot spread Ebola Thats really important for people to understand No  and No  is that its close contact with blood and body fluids Its not casual contact Its not sitting at a table together or eating a meal Its close contact with blood and bodily fluids So you know obviously the health department in each state will have to make up their minds about this The CDC is going to come out with guidelines Im not in a position to make decisions about that but people need to understand that people who are not sick do not transmit this virus  Do you have any concerns that doctors health professionals such as yourself will be reluctant to go if there such is an outcry after someone like Dr Spencer contracts the disease  Oh sure I think we all need to remember that the big thing thats going to help America be safe against Ebola is when we get the epidemic in West Africa under control And thats going to take volunteers and people like Dr Spencer who care about the situation over there to go And we need to find ways to encourage more people to go and not make the situation too burdensome for them on their return  At this point do you have antibodies in your blood and is your blood valuable as potential donor blood  I have expressed a willingness to donate if its necessary You know the science is still out on this issue of whether the donated samples make a difference or not but Im always willing to do that  And would you go back to Liberia or Guinea or another one of the countries  I would go back to Liberia You know its my second home Ive lived there for  years of my life The health system there has been crippled by this Ebola epidemic Its my desire to take a part in supporting and helping with the recovery of that health system  Could you describe for us what is it like to go through this first of all the fear and being put in isolation and also the pain the physical sides of this that none of us would understand  You know when I went to Liberia with  as an SIM missionary in early August we talked about it my family talked about it we  I was aware of the risk And obviously when you get that news that  I remember that was the longest day of my life probably Waiting  Sept   waiting for that test result There is some fear and anxiety there but for me I was also praying and trusting God and you know obviously concerned The illness itself I will say you know I was evacuated fairly quickly I was in the US within six days of getting sick And I had excellent excellent care And I never reached the level of illness that some people do I never had bleeding complications or other things But it was like a really really awful flu You know your whole body is weak and tired and achy I had fever nausea vomiting diarrhea those symptoms but I never got to the real  worst of it that some people suffer from  At this stage we have Dallas nurse Amber Vincent who is at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and Craig Spencer now at Bellevue And it does seem as though the lessons learned from Dallas have been learned well by New York  Yes it seems like there has been a real ramp up of preparedness and I was very excited to see the news yesterday in how things were handled Seems like things have really been done well  What can you say to New Yorkers who still are going to be worried about public transportation about other potential contact with Dr Spencer even though he wasnt showing a temperature and wasnt symptomatic at the time he was out and about  Well again of course there is fear  but I think we need to base our behavior and our actions on the facts This is not a virus thats easily spread through physical objects The virus doesnt get on a countertop and stay there for a day or two and get spread to somebody its direct contact I dont think people need to worry about riding the subway or being around the apartment where you know the building where he was living Those kinds of contact this is not how this virus is spread Its spread through close direct contact with the other individual while theyre sick  And I think people can rest easy in knowing that things have been done properly
