Many online journals are ready to publish bad research in exchange for a credit card number Thats the conclusion of an elaborate sting carried out by   a leading mainline journal The result should trouble doctors patients policymakers and anyone who has a stake in the integrity of science and who doesnt The business model of these predatory publishers is a scientific version of those phishes from Nigerians who want help transferring a few million dollars into your bank account To find out just how common predatory publishing is   contributor John Bohannon sent a deliberately faked research article  times to online journals More than half the journals that supposedly reviewed the fake paper accepted it   This sting operation Bohannon   reveals the contours of an emerging Wild West in academic publishing Online scientific journals are springing up at a great rate There are thousands out there Many such as   are totally respectable This open access model is making good science more accessible than ever before without making users pay the hefty subscription fees of traditional print journals It should be noted that   is among these legacy print journals charging subscription fees and putting much of its online content behind a pay wall But the Internet has also opened the door to clever imitators who collect fees from scientists eager to get published Its the equivalent of paying someone to publish your work on their blog Bohannon tells Shots These sleazy journals often look legitimate They bear titles like the  that closely resemble titles of respected journals Their mastheads often contain the names of respectablelooking experts But often its all but impossible to tell whos really behind them or even where in the world theyre located Bohannon says his experiment shows many of these online journals didnt notice fatal flaws in a paper that should be spotted by anyone with more than highschool knowledge of chemistry And in some cases even when one of their reviewers pointed out mistakes the journal accepted the paper anyway  and then asked for hundreds or thousands of dollars in publication fees from the author A journalist with an Oxford University PhD in molecular biology Bohannon fabricated a paper purporting to discover a chemical extracted from lichen that kills cancer cells Its authors were fake too  nonexistent researchers with Africansounding names based at the fictitious Wassee Institute of Medicine in Asmara a city in Eritrea With help from collaborators at Harvard Bohannon made the paper look as sciencey as possible  but larded it with fundamental errors in method data and conclusions For starters the purported new cancer drug was tested on cancer cells  but not healthy cells So theres no way to tell whether its effect was cancerspecific or if its simply toxic to all cells   A graph in the paper purports to show that the more lichen drug that was added to test tubes of cancer cells the more effective it was at killing But in fact the actual data show no such difference Bohannon says it wasnt easy to write a convincing fake Initially he made the data too crazy he says His Harvard collaborators worried it made the paper look too interesting So we rewrote it making boring rookie mistakes he says The final touch was to make the paper read as though it had been written by someone whose first language is not English To do that Bohannon used Google Translate to put it into French then translated that version back into English In the end the papers fictitious authors got  acceptance letters and  rejections  a score of  percent Thats way higher than I expected Bohannon says I was expecting  or  percent or worst case a quarter accepted For the privilege of being published the papers authors were asked to send along a publishing fee of up to  The highest density of acceptances was from journals based in India where academics are under intense pressure to publish in order to get promotions and bonusesTo learn the location of online journals that accepted or rejected Bohannons paper see this   Bohannon says the exercise is a damning indictment of the way   works or doesnt at many online journals Peer review is the timehonored system of having outside experts comb through submissions to identify flaws in method data or conclusions Its the way scientific journals do quality control Peer review is in a worse state than anyone guessed he says Bohannon says he doesnt mean to suggest that the whole business model of online openaccess journals is a failure You cant conclude that from my experiment because I didnt do the right control  submitting a paper to paidsubscription journals he says As he acknowledges its not as if peer review is always up to snuff at subscription journals  even the top subscription journals have been embarrassed by lapses in their peer review processes But he says online publishing makes poorquality journals easier to set up And the sheer volume of online publications these days makes it harder to distinguish between legitimate and shady journals  of the University of Colorado wasnt surprised in the least by the outcome of Bohannons sting He basically found what Ive been saying for years he tells Shots A growing number of online openaccess journals are accepting papers just to earn publishing fees and as a result science is being poisoned by a lot of bad articles Beall says Beall a research librarian is a selfappointed watchdog over openaccess publishing He maintains a  of what he calls predatory publishers  those who exploit the openaccess model of publishing for their own profit He points out that online publishers operate under an incentive thats just the opposite of traditional scientific journals Print journals have rigid constraints on how many articles they can publish so they have to screen out all but the best And they have subscribers to keep happy so they have to cultivate reputations as curators of highquality research But online journals dont have to worry about subscribers they make their money by charging contributors  who have a strong incentive to get published So the more papers they publish the more money they make Beall says Two big questions arise out of all this What damage is done by publishanything journals And what can be done about it The potential damage is both farreaching and difficult to quantify Bohannon points out that universities and government agencies particularly in developing countries may hire researchers based on resumes packed with sleazy citations Determining which of those CV entries is highquality and which arent is no easy task Beall notes that lawyers often use scientific citations in briefs and trials Government officials draw on published research to set policy Drug companies have a strong incentive to manipulate research to bolster their claims And researchers may be led down futile paths on the basis of poor research As to what can be done Beall says poorquality research can probably only be driven out by naming and shaming Bohannon thinks there might be a sort of  to survey the quality of online journals and call out those that fall short And he thinks maybe such an enterprise might regularly carry out stings like his to keep everyone in the field on their toes
