A herpes virus that infects humans originated in chimpanzees before it jumped into early human ancestors according to a new study Researchers found that herpes simplex virus  HSV infected hominids before their evolutionary split from chimpanzees  million years ago whereas herpes simplex  HSV was transferred from ancient chimpanzees to human ancestors such as Homo erectus about  million years ago long before the rise of early modern humans about  years ago Before we were human there was still crossspecies transmission into our evolutionary lineage study author Joel O Wertheim assistant research scientist at the University of California San Diego AntiViral Research Center told Live Science About twothirds of the human population is infected with at least one kind of herpes simplex virus according to the researchers HSV commonly manifests itself as cold sores on the mouth or lips whereas HSV can cause blisters on the genitals In the study the researchers compared human herpes viruses with those of other primates They used advanced models of molecular evolution to estimate when and how exactly the viruses had diverged from each other and how they were introduced into humans According to a previous hypothesis HSV was thought to have been introduced to humans potentially from another ape species like orangutans Wertheim said And the split between HSV and its chimpanzee counterpart was thought to have coincided with the split between humans and chimpanzees In contrast the new study suggests that HSV is the result of crossspecies transmission to humans from ancestors of modern chimpanzees and that HSV is the result of a split between the human and chimpanzee viruses he said Now humans and chimpanzees have their own version of the HSV virus Wertheim said He added Understanding how and when we acquired viruses that currently infect us can give us perspective on future potential crossspecies transmission events that would lead to the introduction of new human viruses
