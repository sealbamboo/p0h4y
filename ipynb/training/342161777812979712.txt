Barefootrunning enthusiasts long have believed that running without shoes or in minimalist footwear makes running easier speedier and less injurious But a surprisingly large number of new studies examining just how the body actually responds when we run in our birthday shoes or skimpy footwear suggest that for many people those expectations are not being met  Consider for instance the findings of the most definitive of the new studies   It looked into whether landing near the front of the foot when you run is more physiologically efficient than striking the ground first with the heel  This is a central issue in any discussion of barefootstyle running because one of the supposed hallmarks of running shoeless or in minimalist footwear is that doing so promotes a forefoot landing Without the heel cushioning provided by standard running shoes barefoot proponents say runners will gravitate naturally toward landing lightly near the balls of the feet  And they should most proponents add because landing near the front of the foot will require less oxygen and effort and allow you to push harder at any given speed and ultimately run faster or longer  But that idea while appealing has not been well scrutinized So researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst recruited  experienced runners  of whom were habitual heelstrikers and  of whom landed first near the front of the foot Heel striking is far more common than forefoot striking among modern runners by most estimates with at least  percent of us nowadays leading with our heels The researchers began by outfitting all of the volunteers with the same neutral running flats and then having each run on a treadmill as he or she normally would using his or her preferred foot strike The volunteers ran at three different speeds equivalent to an easy middling and fast pace Throughout the researchers measured oxygen uptake heart rates and through mathematical calculations the extent to which carbohydrates were providing energy  Then in a separate experiment they asked each runner to switch styles  the heelstrikers were to land near the balls of their feet and the forefoot strikers with their heels  while the researchers gathered the same data as before  In the end this data showed that heelstriking was the more physiologically economical running form by a considerable margin Heel strikers used less oxygen to run at the same pace as forefoot strikers and many of the forefoot strikers used less oxygen  meaning they were more economical  when they switched form to land first with their heels Most of the runners also burned fewer carbohydrates as a percentage of their energy expenditure when they struck first with their heels Their bodies turned to fats and other fuel sources sparing the more limited stores of carbohydrates says Allison Gruber a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who led the study Because depleting carbohydrates results in hitting the wall or abruptly sagging with fatigue these results tell us that people will hit the wall faster if they are running with a forefoot pattern versus a rearfoot pattern Dr Gruber says  These findings undermine some of the entrenched beliefs about minimalist shoes or barefoot running but they jibe closely with the conclusions of multiple studies presented last week at the   in Indianapolis Five separate studies there found no significant benefits in terms of economy from switching to minimalist barefootstyle footwear  The news on injury prevention and barefootstyle running is likewise sobering Although many barefootstyle runners believe that wearing lightweight shoes or none at all toughens foot muscles lessening the likelihood of footrelated running injuries researchers at Brigham Young University did not find evidence of that desirable change If foot muscles become tauter and firmer the scientists say peoples arches should consequently grow higher But in a study also presented at the sports medicine meeting they found no changes in arch height among a group of runners who donned minimalist shoes for  weeks  Other researchers who presented at the meeting had simply asked a group of  runners if they had tried barefootstyle shoes and if so whether they liked them Almost a third of the runners said they had experimented with the minimalist shoes but  percent of those said that they had suffered injuries that they attributed to the new footwear and many had switched back to their previous shoes  None of this new science of course proves that barefootstyle running is inadvisable or disadvantageous for all runners it proves only that the question of whether barefoot is best is not easily answered There are lots of individual instances where people report that change from one type of running shoes or running form to another was good for them says Rodger Kram a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado at Boulder whos long studied running form There are also lots of cases of people switching or trying to switch who got hurt  The primary lesson of the accumulating new science about barefootstyle running he says is that the biomechanics of running are not simple and generic proclamations  like claims that all runners will benefit from barefootstyle shoes and running form  are surely incorrect  Dr Gruber agrees I always recommend that runners run the way that is most natural and comfortable for them she says Each runner runs a certain way for a reason likely because of the way they were physically built Unless there is some indication that you should change things such as repeated injury do not mess with that plan
