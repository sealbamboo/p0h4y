How do you feed a vegetarian or vegan Thanksgiving guest who doesnt like sweet potatoes That was the dilemma for a reader Joe DiMaria of Somerville Mass whose best friend a vegan joins his family table every Thanksgiving His friend loves many vegetables but unfortunately she does not enjoy many traditional fall vegetables that are the typical side dishes on a Thanksgiving table  Being vegetarian or vegan around the holidays is incredibly difficult says Mr DiMaria Its even more difficult when you dont like squash root vegetables or sweet potatoes Mr DiMaria set out to create a dish that would be delicious for all of his guests but would also offer a satisfying vegan option for his friend It was a little bit of a challenge to come up with something that didnt have those fall vegetables in it but still felt like it was fall inspired  said Mr DiMaria  He came up with a hearty risotto flavored with a taste of fall by caramelized onions and fennel While the dish was created for a vegan diner using Earth Balance in place of butter and eliminating the Parmesan cheese it was a hit with everyone at the table His friend liked it so much she is the one who suggested he submit it to Wells Vegetarian Thanksgiving this year The dish is now a family tradition Were Italian so we eat a lot of risotto and pasta said Mr DiMaria This risotto felt very comfortable on my family Thanksgiving table
