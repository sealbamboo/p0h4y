Our internal body clock has such a dramatic impact on sporting ability that it could alter the chances of Olympic gold say researchers The team at the University of Birmingham showed performance times varied by  throughout the day Early risers reached their athletic peak around lunchtime while night owls were best in the evening  The researchers say it could even explain why Spanish teams have more success in European football  The body clock controls everything  from alertness to the risk of a heart attack  in a daily rhythm Some aspects of sporting ability were thought to peak in early afternoon   suggests each competitors sleeping habits have a powerful impact They took  female hockey players and asked them to perform a series of m runs in shorter and shorter times And they did it at six different times of day between  and   The results showed a peak performance in late afternoon but then the scientists looked separately at earlytype people latetype people and those in the middle  This time the gap between the best and worst times was  and a far more complicated picture emerged  Lead researcher Dr Roland Brandstaetter told the BBC News website Athletes and coaches would benefit greatly if they knew when optimal or suboptimal performance time was He said a  difference in performance would be the difference between fourth place and a medal in many Olympic events Body clocks can be adjusted Jet lag is when you feel rough before adjusting to a new time So if youre an early type in a competition in the evening then youre impaired so you could adjust sleeping times to the competition Dr Brandstaetter said He said such bodyclock problems absolutely contributed to Englands struggles in the pinnacle of European football  the Champions League You have players that do extraordinarily well in the English Premier League at  but they suddenly dont perform as well in the evening in the Champions League he said He argued Spanish society which runs a bit later in the day may be giving teams from that country an advantage Emily Defroand a yearold who has been capped  caps with Team GBs Hockey Us took part in the study and said the findings were scarily realistic She is an early riser that rare student happy to get up at  in the morning She said Our Saturday matches are at  and I think thats perfect for me Any later and I feel a bit tired and need a few more energy drinks to get me going It is in stark contrast to her teammate Olivia Chilton She said Id get up at  if I could get away with it I much prefer training late afternoon or evening In the morning I honestly feel halfasleep in the warmup I just dont feel alert for tracking and hitting the ball I dont feel on it Dr Brandstaetter said this provided an important lesson for talentspotting It takes place more or less in adolescents but we know half of them are owls yet almost all cases of talentspotting are during the school hours he said That is when they are in the range of  of peak performance so we are missing out on a huge number of high performers by testing at the wrong time of day Commenting on the findings Dr Thomas Kantermann from the University of Groningen and the scientific manager of the ChronoCity project in Germany told the BBC The study adds to our understanding about the importance of circadian biology body clocks and internal time in physical performance  Only by taking internal time into account can true and fair assessments of human performance become possible  The current paper supports our previous research and nicely paves the way for more fruitful circadian studies in the future
