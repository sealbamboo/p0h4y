If youve been   there are steps you can take to get your application reconsidered But first a warning Do not do what the VA denial letter suggests you do as that may only bring you years more of delays And second youll need to invoke the spirit of Winston Churchill in   Never give in  never never never never in nothing great or small large or petty never give in Patsy Jones the widow of a Vietnam veteran had to go back to the VA five times over the course of a year before she finally qualified for the benefit which reimburses veterans and their families for the costs of caregivers working in the home or can be used to pay for assisted living or nursing home care Mrs Jones  had so many ailments a stroke dialysis three times a week dementia diabetes and hypertension that she needed constant care in an assisted living facility which her family struggled to pay for  They had my gas turned off in my house said her daughter Tamara Jones I couldnt pay car insurance AA was our last hope When we were denied it felt like somebody had killed our last hope Now one year later the Joness family received their first AA pension benefit check for  in April  This week the VA acknowledged the criticism over long delays in handling disability claims and announced that claims processors in all  regional offices would have to work at least  hours of overtime per month until the end of  in an effort to eliminate the backlog Unfortunately this may not much help those awaiting decisions on AA who are often in their s and s and running out of time  So here are the steps you should take if you or a family member has been turned down If possible dont go it alone Although the VA does not allow you to pay someone to help you fill out the application right from the start the department does allow applicants to pay for a VAaccredited professional to handle an appeal  Tamara Jones turned to Patty Servaes an   for help getting her mothers benefits approved I dont understand how anyone gets through the process alone she said Getting denied through the VA was emotional and youre already emotionally messed up taking care of a sick person like my mom I would have thrown in the towel long ago without Patty  Be warned A lot of the organizations that claim to help get you the AA benefit turn out to be less than scrupulous Some specialize in selling annuities or moving assets into a trust to hide them for heirs and to help applicants qualify who are not genuinely in need  practices that skirt the edge of legality  And not everyone has the money to pay a consultant You can get free help from your local VA office or veteran service officers in various nongovernmental organizations for veterans But   as you might hope  I had one VSO from Polk County Tex come to my Web site asking some very basic questions about the financial qualifications because he said he had gotten only one or two days of training said Debbie Burak founder of VeteranAidorg a nonprofit that helps veterans wade through the AA application and appeals  It is easy to go off in the wrong direction if you follow the somewhat misleading language the VA uses in the standard letter denying a claim The letter says you can file a formal appeal but if you do that you could be waiting nearly three years in limbo The average time for disposition of a substantive appeal was  days in fiscal year  according to the     What the VA does not mention anywhere in those denial letters is that there are other steps you can take to get a speedier resolution of your claim For example you can file a   This is a mostly blank form in which you can submit new information that you forgot to include or resubmit information that you may not have presented clearly so that the claim will be reconsidered  You can call if you feel like being on hold for an hour but you also need a paper trail advised Ms Burak If that does not work the next step is to file a notice of disagreement which is simply a letter stating that you disagree with the VA decision and explaining why The VA will respond by assigning   Oddly only then will the VA tell you specifically why your application was denied so you know how to respond  If all else fails you can file the fullscale   which may require mounds of paperwork and inperson interviews But then of course youll have to brace for a slog lasting years It may go faster if you can afford to hire expert counsel  Even that can be perilous though In the next post we will tell you how to identify and avoid pension poachers and other perpetrators of fraud And if youve got suggestions that might help readers please share them in the comments section
