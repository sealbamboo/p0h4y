A group of doctors has written an open letter to the Scotch Whisky Association SWA asking it to drop its opposition to minimum price rules for alcohol The Scottish parliament passed legislation two years ago and it was scheduled to come into effect in  But the measure has been delayed by a legal challenge from the SWA It has argued that the legal requirement for alcoholic drinks to cost at least p per unit would be incompatible with European law A judge has ruled against the SWA which has appealed against the decision The letter backed by doctors and other supporters of the minimum price legislation argues that  lives would already have been saved if the law had come into force as planned They accuse the SWA of delaying the legislation because it knows it would be effective and would cut into its profits They write The SWA has mirrored the tactics of the tobacco industry in delaying lifesaving legislation They oppose any measure that might affect their sizeable profits no matter the obvious benefits to peoples health  By taking this legal action they are undermining the united view of the Scottish Parliament ignoring the democratic process and costing taxpayers thousands of pounds in legal bills The letter concludes This is an appeal to the Scotch Whisky Association to immediately drop their legal challenge and bow to the will of the Scottish Parliament Its the right thing to do The signatories include  senior doctors and campaigners including Dr Evelyn Gillan chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland Dr Brian Keighley chairman of  BMA Scotland Prof Sir Ian Gilmore chairman of Alcohol Health Alliance and former chief medical officer Dr Mac Armstrong Dr Richard Watson a GP in Glasgow who supports the pricing policy said he saw alcoholrelated harm every day Weve got a yearold girl who has advanced alcoholic liver disease and is almost certain to die shortly he said When I was a medical student  years ago nobody had alcoholic liver disease until they were in their s But shes been drinking five or six litres of strong white cider daily since her early teens This is the cheapest way of buying alcohol  it can cost as little as p per unit Strong white cider is the sort of alcohol that will be seriously affected by minimum pricing The SWA has argued that the legislation which was due to come into force on  April   would have little effect on the heaviest drinkers Rosemary Gallagher of the SWA said Minimum unit pricing is an unfair and untargeted policy that penalises responsible drinkers especially those on lower incomes  It impacts poorer people in society and will have little effect on the highest earners who make up the majority of hazardous and harmful drinkers David Frost chief executive of the SWA said the case for minimum pricing was based on modelling not concrete evidence He added The SWA has consistently called for the legal case to be fasttracked to the European Court of Justice so that we can speed up the process but the Scottish government refused to agree to this move  I regret that the debate on alcohol policy has become so polarised
