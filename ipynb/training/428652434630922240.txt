A lot of parents like to think their kids will simply outgrow baby fat But the risk of becoming a severely overweight adult can actually start as early as kindergarten research suggests As parents as a society as clinicians we need to think about a healthy weight really early on says   who led the study But that doesnt mean putting young children on calorierestricted diets In hopes of figuring out when in life the warning signs of obesity emerge Cunningham and her colleagues studied more than  children from the time they started kindergarten through middle school Kids who started off kindergarten overweight actually had about four times the risk of becoming obese by eighth grade compared with normalweight kindergartners says Cunningham an assistant professor in the department of global health at Emory University And nearly half of the obese eighthgraders  she says had been overweight kindergartners The findings published Wednesday in     suggest the risks for obesity are in part set fairly early in life  maybe as early as during the mothers pregnancy Cunningham says A third of the children who ended up being obese by eighth grade were also on the large side at birth Pregnancy and the first few years of a childs life are clearly influential according to   a specialist in childhood obesity at Boston Childrens Hospital Maternal diet maternal weight gain and the infants diet during the first few years may have an outsized influence on longterm risk for obesity and related diseases That means that women need to be careful not to gain too much weight while theyre pregnant Ludwig says as well as try to make sure their young children dont sit around too much watching TV and playing video games Helping kids get exercise is important he says as is helping them develop healthful eating habits Teach children to go easy on the refined carbohydrates from the start Ludwig advises  the sugary beverages too much fruit juice and all of the processed packaged snack foods Still some experts worry that studies like this could lead parents to overreact at any sign that their babies or toddlers are getting a little chubby Putting young children on a calorierestricted diet can stunt their growth in height says   a nutritionist at the University of California Berkeley Thats definitely not the answer she and pediatricians agree What you want to do Ikeda says is help them have healthier lifestyle habits and they will grow into their weight Children are already suffering from a kind of societal hysteria about childhood weight according to   a physiologist who studies weight regulation and nutrition at the University of California Davis What this is going to do to kids is  cause more bullying and teasing of the larger kids she says Its going to cause them to feel bad about their bodies Its going to make the thinner kids really scared of getting fatter There is so much public and media hysteria about the epidemic of childhood obesity already The researchers behind this study dont advocate putting young children on diets or making them feel bad about their weight They say they just hope their work will help discourage the bad habits that are in large part driving the childhood obesity epidemic
