As Allison Aubrey   on The Salt a brouhaha has erupted in Cambridge Ma over a study published yesterday in the  The study by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital found some correlation between aspartame the most widely used artificial sweetener in diet soda and an increased risk of leukemia and NonHodgkins lymphoma and other rare bloodrelated cancers And early in the week the public relations department at Brigham and Womens Hospital sent a press release to reporters exaggerating that correlation But just before the study was published Wednesday afternoon the hospital admitted its own staff had been premature in the promotion of this work And it also called the studys data weak  chair of the department of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health and a coauthor of the paper told Aubrey today that the hospitals original press release was scary And when one senior media person asked him if the story should be on the evening news hed said no The hospital did admit it had overstated the significance of the findings But Willett says it failed to distinguish between findings that were murky and ones that were truly weak Scientific findings often fall into a gray area  between a clear relationship between diet soda consumption and cancers and no relationship at all Willett calls them part of the natural process of science In this case even the researchers say the possible link between soda consumption and cancer could be due to chance Findings in this gray area are hard for the media to communicate to a public seeking clarity because theres no clear takehome message But as the case of Brigham and Womens shows institutions can succumb to hunger for publicity Despite the studys limitations Willett and several other researchers not involved with the study say the findings were significant enough to warrant further research Brigham and Womens Hospital has declined to respond today to Willets comments
