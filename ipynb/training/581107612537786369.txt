For the second time in five years we are on the cusp of having a new health secretary with a compelling vision for the NHS In  Andrew Lansleys vision was to push managers aside and put family doctors in charge In  Labours   is offering the equally beguiling vision of whole person care Both men have firm views about who should supply   care For Lansley competition and choice would bring market rigour to the statist health service driving out poor clinical quality as GP commissioners reshaped care pathways around the needs of patients Burnham is equally certain that NHS care should be provided overwhelmingly by the state and wants to rig the rules against private companies making the NHS the preferred provider and only offering private firms short contracts  Both have built support by dressing their enemies up as pantomime villains While Lansley was at the Department of   the only good manager was a sacked one Bonfires of managerial posts were taken as proof of progress without any evidence it was improving care It is now clear that stripping out management capacity from the NHS  always a modest cost by international standards  has severely reduced the services ability to drive through reforms that would improve care and manage costs better Burnhams pantomime villain is Tory privatisation The public is fed a diet of scare stories about the onward march of the private sector despite the data demonstrating that   and no mention being made that it is clinicians rather than Conservative politicians that have been awarding local contracts Like Lansley and his managers no evidence is provided that booting out the private sector will improve patient outcomes But five years apart and on opposite sides they speak with a single voice on one critical issue read my lips  my plan does not mean topdown reorganisation At present Labour seems set on unleashing another restructuring of NHS commissioning by changing the way clinical commissioning groups and health and wellbeing boards are organised But a more fundamental change may come from Burnhams commitment to exempt the NHS from EU procurement and competition law A   of what this would involve concludes not only that exemption from the EU rules is undeliverable but that extracting the NHS from overly prescriptive use of UK competition law would require reversing  years of policy by bringing foundation trusts firmly back under the direct control of government  So Burnham has a choice  either renege on commitments to reform competition law around the NHS fundamentally or abolish the foundation trust model announced by Labour health secretary Alan Milburn in  Abolishing foundation trusts may well appeal to Burnham His instincts are for central control as demonstrated by his opposition to giving Greater Manchester its own devolution deal for the NHS the Labour leadership is furious with its Manchester party for signing up to the deal with chancellor George Osborne With many foundation trusts now in financial difficulty    reveals that  foundation trusts have a combined gross deficit of m  many FTs are already sliding back towards central control  Nonetheless reasserting central control in this way would have profound consequences for the NHS The best foundation trusts are among the finest hospitals in the world and many others are using their independence to invest in outstanding services and drive clinical improvement A massive reassertion of state authority would crush innovation in the NHS just as the Five Year Forward View offers the promise of greater space for local leadership and patientcentred change Lansley did not set out to dynamite the NHS structure at around the time of the  election his reform programme seemed more of an   Only once in power did the internal logic of his reforms send the health service tumbling into wholesale change Labour is in danger of making the same mistake
