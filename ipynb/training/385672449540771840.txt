Walk down the carpeted hallways of   in Burbank Calif and its common to hear the odd explosion the hum of traffic or a burst of gunfire Its here in these edit bays that small feature films and TV dramas like the ABC hits   and   and CBSs   get primped and polished for primetime viewing While about  employees work here to make Hollywood magic happen general manager Sunder Ramani is focused on the less exotic work of paying the bills and figuring out how to provide health insurance to about  workers who dont have unionprovided health coverage Up until about two years ago we had probably the Cadillac of plans for our employees he says We picked up  percent of that plan which was I think a huge tool in our arsenal in terms of getting good people to come work for us Doubledigit premium increases in recent years have forced Ramani to downgrade his employee coverage which his insurance broker has warned may soon soar another  to  percent above last years increase Which is a significant hit Ramani says but they cant tell me enough yet until we get closer to that time So Im here in a limbo world trying to decide what it is Im going to do One new option hell soon have is to buy insurance through Covered Californias   SHOP stands for Small Business Health Options Program Its Californias version of a smallbusiness insurance program that is part of the federal Affordable Care Act The state has  small businesses All states are offering similar smallbusiness exchanges These are marketplaces for employers with  or fewer fulltime workers and are designed to offer more affordable insurance to momandpop businesses that have long paid more than large companies for the same level of coverage Small businesses are horribly disadvantaged in terms of being able to purchase insurance says Peter Harbage president of the Sacramentobased health policy firm   If theyre even able to purchase it they have to pay more and they get less Harbage says that not only will SHOP plans offer competitive prices but they will also offer tax benefits that for some smaller companies might cut premium prices in half But   is not so optimistic He is the California executive director for the National Federation of Independent Business and represents more than  small businesses in California There are a lot of uncertainties as it relates to the law he says We are hopeful that they will find affordable coverage within the exchange We are hopeful they will have the ability to pick and choose in the marketplace Business owners will need to closely inspect the policies offered Kabateck says as some participating insurance companies have announced theyre keeping premiums lower by offering a smaller network of doctors and hospitals And that means fewer choices for employees And whether or not a small business opts to provide workers health coverage theres really no way for them to avoid the extra time and cost it will take to navigate the new laws reporting requirements And thats a concern shared by Westwinds Ramani Small business doesnt have scale Ramani says We dont have a legal department We dont have an HR department We navigate through mountains of regulations not just about health care but about everything we do here Were just getting bombarded on all levels For now Ramani says hell sit tight and watch before deciding whether the SHOP marketplace will provide him a better way to buy affordable quality health insurance for his employees Under the Affordable Care Act small businesses are not required to provide insurance to their workers Only those with more than  employees must do so beginning in
