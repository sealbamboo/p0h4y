Comedian Howie Mandel has been open about his mental illness but what many dont know is how he uses exercise to calm his mind and control compulsive thoughts I wasnt an active kid My mind was but my body Not too much I had a great imagination but I was preoccupied with compulsive thoughts and ADD and I acted out I was never really athletic In high school I was trying to get the interest of girls but I couldnt get on any teams I was  foot  and maybe  pounds and I figured sports would be an inroad into meeting women The only team I could get on was the wrestling team but I didnt think of the ramifications when I joined For a guy who doesnt like to shake hands I was rolling around on a mat with strange guys It wasnt fun and I didnt meet any girls I started running in the last  years I run seven days a week six to  miles each time I began doing it for my head more than anything I just enjoyed the meditative state it puts me in focusing on my footsteps and my breath It is a comfortable place for me to have solace I prefer outside versus inside I like hills and trees but its not really to explore its to escape I dont focus outwardly that much I focus more inwardly I realized that mentally I would feel real calm when I was doing it and I would spend such a small part of my day feeling calm Thats what running does for me I was running in Central Park in New York City and it was raining and I slipped in a puddle and fell I was totally covered in mud my knees were bleeding and my hands were scraped but other than that no injuries I did a situp about  months ago Im a runner and thats it I dont like public gyms I dont want to touch anything If I lift things its to move them out of the way If I use a public treadmill I have my own way of controlling it where I wont touch it with my hands If you see me on a public treadmill its like a scene from Cirque du Soleil I can do so many things without using my hands I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation five years ago A doctor stuck his stethoscope to my chest and said Uh oh which is never good He said Youre in Afib and I had no idea what that was I didnt know anything was wrong with me I figured a guy who was running six to  miles a day wouldnt have anything to worry about I learned that I was five times more likely to have a stroke than someone without Afib The scary part is that people dont know about this so we came up with our website FibsOrFactscom because a lot of people have this and dont know and this helps them learn and understand There are remedies to monitor and take care of it I feel better now than I ever have in my life
