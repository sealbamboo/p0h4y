In August about  boys in western Kenya were rounded up brought into the forest and ritually circumcised Theyre members of the Bukusu tribe and they were marking the transition from boyhood to manhood in the traditional way The elders who performed the procedure used homemade knives and no anesthesia as they have done for centuries But this time something went horribly wrong On Aug  Kenyas   newspaper   Boy  loses penis in Bukusu circumcision rite gone bad Local officials say the circumciser wasnt properly trained and botched the surgery An estimated  boys from various tribes in Kenyas Bungoma County are circumcised every year says Florence Lukoosi the countys cultural director About half of them mostly Bukusu tribe members go through the procedure in the oldfashioned way which relies on traditional knives instead of surgical tools Other families opt for a hospital procedure To minimize injuries and disfigurement Bungoma County conducts two training sessions a year for traditional circumcisers The oneday voluntary program teaches them to make the cut safely how to practice proper hygiene how to dress the cut after the surgery and how to administer antibiotics if necessary Lukoosi said the elders who perform the ritual prefer to use their own knives in order to be true to tradition About  elders have taken circumcision training so far this year Lukoosi says but she admits that some still make mistakes In the August case of the yearold Bukusu boy she specified that the county had not trained the elder conducting the rite and that he had attempted the procedure at  am For an additional perspective she put me on the phone with Murmbi Njibwakale a yearold Bukusu elder Njibwakale was circumcised when he was  years old and remembers it like it was yesterday I asked what he thought of the boy whose penis was cut off Accidents are accidents he said emphasizing that they seldom happen It is not dangerous We have done this since time immemorial And why continue It is a test for endurance of how courageous a man can be in his life he said Other circumcised men arent so sure about the value of the traditional ways They took me and a group of other boys into the forest says Joash Akwiry  remembering his circumcision  years ago For two weeks elders from his Kisa tribe mentored him preparing him for the experience On Dday they smear you with clay which signifies you are ready for circumcision After the cut he says they rubbed ash from burned berries into the wound to stop the bleeding His most vivid memory is of the pain Akwiry says his ethnic group no longer practices ritual circumcision He says people in his tribe have slowly moved away from the practice over the years adding that families worry that the traditional method can spread diseases such as HIV Its a breakdown of traditions says Elizabeth Meyerhoff an American anthropologist who has lived in Kenya since the s Circumcision was an initiation ceremony but a lot of the initiation has gone by the wayside But not in the Bukusu tribe whose elders even force circumcisions on men from other tribes who want to marry Bukusu women Men from the Turkana tribe fled their homes last month to avoid this forced circumcision seeking refuge in nearby police stations Njibwakale the Bukusu elder defends the practice of circumcising adult men from other tribes who choose to live among the Bukusu Because they will be a part of us they should adhere culturally he says But any elder who botches a surgery should be banned from future circumcisions he adds The circumciser who mutilated the yearold Bukusu boy has been blacklisted says Florence Lukoosi The transition away from ritual circumcision reflects a changing Africa But even some of those who would not subject a son to traditional cutting still respect the cultural significance of ritual circumcision as an initiation into manhood Among the Bukusu an uncircumcised man is given less respect and stature than a circumcised man Most Africans still believe in their culture says Akwiry Among the Bukusu circumcision is a rite of passage into manhood For most Kenyans by contrast its just the cultural norm Akwiry will have his sons circumcised  but in a hospital and at a younger age than his own when he was led into the forest at
