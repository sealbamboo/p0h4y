Why would anyone put her family of four through a radical food experiment that would deprive her children of Halloween candy and chocolatechip cookies A cynic who happens upon Eve Schaubs recently published book   might say that banning sugar from your home for a year to document the effects on your family is no more than a gimmick veiled in a health halo and a harsh one at that This experiment was pretty much guaranteed to wreak all kinds of unpredictable havoc with our lives Schaub admits early on in the memoir I loved it But Schaubs year without sugar wasnt quite as miserable as it might sound  though it had its frustrations for sure And a commitment to avoid something so ubiquitous in our food supply  and so deeply embedded into how we celebrate is actually a pretty revelatory endeavor The Schaubs became experts in the complex world of sweeteners and with that expertise come worthy questions that few people on Earth have asked about the nuances of so much hidden sugar on our health The family also claimed surprising health perks  fewer colds and coughs better gastrointestinal functioning and fewer energy crashes  from a sugarfree life the likes of which we all might enjoy But lets back up for a second Back in January I   as a sugar addict While I dont tend to binge on pints of ice cream or entire packages of cookies Ive become increasingly wary of sugars power over my mind and my body So I was naturally curious about this Vermont familys food stunt if wary of it as just that  a stunt  is modeled on Barbara Kingsolvers   in which the novelist worked on a farm and lived on local or homegrown food for a year and Alisa Smith and James MacKinnons  in which the couple spent a year eating only food produced within  miles of their Vancouver apartment And all these stunt men and women can thank Henry David Thoreau for the original ecostunt   As Elizabeth Kolbert   in   in  in her critique of ecostunt books there is something a little disingenuous about writers professing concern about a massive problem  climate change or obesity and metabolic syndrome in the case of Schaub  and then tackling it in a highly personal bookselling way that is not likely to affect the underlying policies that perpetuate the problem But Schaub a freelance writer is earnestly modest about her intention which is just trying to begin the conversation about sugar The conversation began for her in  when she and her husband watched Dr Robert Lustigs video   Something about the University of California San Francisco pediatric endocrinologists insistence that fructose is a poison clicked for Schaub Some  million people have clicked  and viewed  the video too since it came out in  She describes it as something like an awakening albeit a nightmarish one She was totally freaked out she writes The video had convinced her that sugar is everywhere its making us all fat and sick and almost no one realizes it She admits she bought into his argument that sugar is the biggest demon in the food supply with zero skepticism hook line and sinker Not everyone in the nutrition community has and Lustig   The most lifechanging implication for Schaub was that the body cant tell the difference between the high fructose corn syrup in processed foods like ketchup and grandmas lovingly baked molasses cookies meaning all sugar had to go Dessert to me was and is an ultimate expression of love  I made the connection at an early age that sugar   the food equivalent of love she writes  so this was huge But suddenly and a little suspiciously sugar went from love to narcotic Could it be that we were really all just addicts sucking away at our sodastraw hookahs never making the obvious connection between our drug of choice and our rapidly declining health Schaubs life before the experiment seemed pretty typical for a middleaged mother She loved chocolate she loved to bake She and her husband dabbled in vegetarianism and various diets And they also ate pretty healthfully Schaub didnt allow her daughters to eat Doritos or go to fastfood chains They werent overweight and despite eating sugar every day they werent sick Yet Schaub still wanted to take on the obesity epidemic by embarking on a year of obsessive labelreading weird baking and recurring bouts of anxiety  which flared even during a family vacation in Italy  about the sugar that might be sneaking into her body Noble Maybe The Schaubs did make exceptions Each month as a family theyd pick one dessert that could contain sugar The two girls ages  and  during the experiment had autonomy outside the house to decide what to eat And the family made some wonderful discoveries about how to keep sweet treats in the mix Whipped frozen bananas make a delightful softserve banana ice cream Mashed banana can be substituted for white sugar and chopped dates for brown sugar in many recipes And dextrose an obscure cornbased sugar you can buy on the Internet is fair game in a fructosefree house Schaub shares some poignant moments too of the social strain of opting out of sweets at events like a community fundraiser and a potluck memorial service with a long and huge table filled entirely with sweets In these settings surrounded by friends and neighbors she noticed that by forgoing sugar her family existed apart Removed they were but healthier they also might have been Schaub notes that her daughters school absences went from a combined total of over  to just five per year and she concludes they were healthier during the year of no sugar than the previous three years Her own energy levels were higher and steadier and everyones bowel movements were far more regular At the end of the year of course the Schaubs do return to sugar but with far greater moderation Over the course of the year without it they became much more sensitive to sweet flavors and craved them less When I spoke to her by phone this week she said I certainly feel that theres a place for sugar but its gotten totally out of control In our family we eat it now in small amounts for special occasions Thats what sugar is designed to be small and special Her experiment has also prompted her to reflect on how serious a challenge minimizing your sugar intake really is in the US You cant have an occasion without food and in our culture you cant have food without sugar she says Youre going to find sugar added everywhere but we dont have a sense of how pervasive it is how it could be hiding in three to four different places under different names in one food product  writer Kolbert who questioned the real impacts of the ecostunters in  might say that if Schaub really wanted to do something about sugar she could lobby her kids school  which she complains inundates the children with sugar  to regulate the sugary treats She could push for a soda tax in the state of Vermont But she is a writer and shes moving on to another topic close to her heart clutter Still according to her publicist  people   to join her on Wednesday for the Day Of No Sugar
