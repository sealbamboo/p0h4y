What is love Maybe it means slowing down to walk at your beloveds pace  New research finds that men adjust their walking speed to match their romantic partners pace  a phenomenon not seen when guys walk with female friends The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of human groups given that early  had to travel together despite their diverse range of shapes and sizes   Every individual has an optimal walking speed researchers from Seattle Pacific University report Wednesday in the openaccess journal   Much of what determines that speed is height the longer your legs are the faster youre likely to walk  a fact that means men on average have a higher optimal speed than women do   And speed matters because this optimal point is the one at which a person moves the most efficiently without wasting energy When people walk together someone has to pay the cost of adjusting his or her pace away from this optimum speedÂ   To find out who pays the researchers recruited  heterosexual couples  a total of  men and women  and asked them to walk solo around a track These initial walks set a baseline for each persons preferred pace which averaged  mph for men and  mph for women   Next each person walked multiple laps around the track alternating between walking alone and walking alongside another person At various points the person was joined by his or her romantic partner by a samesex friend and by an oppositesex friend For part of the walk with their romantic partner the couples were instructed to hold hands   The researchers timed the walks and discovered that when a  walked together the man slowed his pace to match his female partners optimal speed This occurred whether or not the two were holding hands   When men and women in platonic friendships walked together in contrast both parties altered their speed Men slowed slightly and women sped up to meet in the middle at about  mph   When walking with someone of the same sex men sped up so that both guys were chugging along at about  percent faster than their preferred pace Women on the other hand slowed so that both walked about  percent slower than usual   Many huntergatherer groups split into samesex teams for longdistance travel likely to prevent either men or women from having to pay an energy penalty to match each others pace the researchers wrote In romantic relationships however men may have evolved to care for their partners taking the energy hit so that the woman can save her effort for reproduction they wrote
