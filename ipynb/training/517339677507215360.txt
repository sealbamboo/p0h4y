Ive been giving some thought to dairyfree nottoosweet smoothies I usually use yogurt or buttermilk in my smoothies but this week I wanted to make some drinks using almond milk and coconut milk I looked around for some brands that tasted good to me and I did need to look around and found some great almond milk made with just about only almonds and water it has less than  percent added ingredients but no sweeteners For the others I wanted to use coconut milk not coconut water which I think tastes pretty bad no matter how good for you its supposed to be I used light coconut milk in conjunction with almond milk in a few of this weeks smoothies  Though I recently devoted a week of Recipes for Health to   these smoothies are pure fruit they are not lowcarb Most of them make filling breakfasts or snacks and will appeal to you if you are vegan and enjoy fruit I have bulked them up with soaked nuts chia seeds and oatmeal and added very little in the way of sweeteners I liked the green smoothies but I still prefer to eat my vegetables in solid form  You dont need a special highpowered blender for this weeks drinks Im still using the cup speed Waring blender my mother gave me years ago and it works just fine
