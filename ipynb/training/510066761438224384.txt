The golf course is in pristine condition theres nary a breeze and youre about to sink a birdie on the th green But just as the putter is about to meet the ball your wrist jerks involuntarily  sending your round white nemesis  inches too far to the left Known as the yips this infuriating twitch has caused many a golfer to increase what would otherwise have been a perfectly respectable handicap To the untrained eye it looks like a clearcut case of nerves kicking in at a crucial moment But the way Mayo Clinic neurologist Charles H Adler sees it the yips might not be psychological at all in fact they may have their roots in the nervous system Among the afflicted are golf legends Ben Hogan and Sam Snead as well as Tom Watson and Bernhard Langer who are competing this week in the  Masters Tournament at Augusta National Adler who works at MayosParkinsons Disease and Movement Disorders Center in Scottsdale Ariz explained why he thinks researchers are getting closer to finding a cure The yips is a term used by golfers to describe an involuntary movement  a twist a jerk or a shake  that usually happens when putting although some people will describe it when doing other activities like chipping There are a number of people who have a neurological illness called dystonia which can cause cramps or pulling in the fingers or wrist while doing a specific task Its known to occur in writers and musicians  in many cases the only time that they have a problem is when they are trying to perform a task related to their writing or music In between they are completely normal Were trying to determine if there are some golfers who have a golfers cramp that would be equitable to writers or musicians cramps With dystonia there is no diagnostic test so what were doing is pattern recognition We found that there are some individuals who complain of the yips and have a twitch or a movement at the time of making the putt Were trying to narrow down the pool of golfers that may have a neurological disorder so we can do further studies Stress and anxiety make all movement disorders worse so when somebody with a tremor of the hand for instance gets stressed or anxious the tremor gets worse A lot of people say the yips come out during tournaments but that doesnt mean its all psychological it means that with stress the movement disorder gets worse If someone has a psychological cause to their yip different treatments may be beneficial versus if someone has a neurological disorder There are a number of interventions we could look at One would be just changing how a golfer holds the golf club Changing the type of club may change how movement occurs too There is a potential that some sort of pill might be beneficial since this might be neurological or for botulinum injections to be helpful  in writers or musicians cramp it weakens the muscles that are cramping Alcohol is a relaxant and its very clear that some people with movement disorders can get some relief that way The problem with alcohol is that over the years tremor can get worse if people use alcohol to treat it Because of its ill effects it certainly would not be a recommended treatment
