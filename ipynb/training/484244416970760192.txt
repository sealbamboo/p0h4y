Employers say obesity is a top health concern for their workers But health is a sensitive and personal issue Some employees say these wellness initiatives can go too far For several years  in Dallas has offered a wellness program to its person staff The program includes health fairs free screenings cooking demos and health club memberships Nearly  percent of employees participate and thats helped curb health care costs according to the company Still says Delta Emerson executive vice president  percent of the employees that tested are overweight which was a little shocking to me because we have a very young population The average age is in the high s Obesity can lead to medical complications like diabetes and heart disease and can increase absenteeism and the risk of injury on the job Helping overweight employees nudge the scale in the other direction might be good for their health and for the companys bottom line But firms have to walk a fine line Emerson says in what they say to workers We have to be very sensitive she says about the fact that there are some people that are not going to want anyone to have a conversation with them about that even indirectly  a software firm in Cedar Rapids Iowa that has  employees has also controlled insurance costs in recent years with an officewide wellness program that tries to help employees build fitness into the day Health considerations went into choosing the companys new office building for example says   who handles the firms operations Our company will be on the third floor so people have to go two flights of stairs to go down to the cafe and eat It will encourage them to get away from their desks And she notes We have inch plates and tall narrow drinking glasses in the cafe  to help people manage their portions We try not to absolutely target one thing Ohrt adds Because we dont want anyone to feel like were singling them out Its difficult to address obesity because wellness programs must be voluntary says   the executive director of   a nonprofit focused on reducing health care costs Employers can offer incentives but they cant directly talk to an employee about a weight problem Preserving medical privacy is also a concern And   prohibit employer discrimination based on a persons genetic makeup Some employees including   a professor of public policy at Penn State University think some wellness programs go too far We commonly refer to it as the great wellness rebellion Woessner says He led the rebellion last summer when his university asked employees to participate in a medical screening survey or pay  more a month for their health insurance The survey asked workers without asking them to submit their names whether they were depressed whether they were having marital problems Woessner says It got into such intimate details of our lives that we thought it was inappropriate for the university to require such a survey and not give us a way to opt out It seemed invasive he says even though it was anonymous And though hes sympathetic to the universitys need to control health costs he thinks a survey cant achieve that  it wont make people healthier So Woessner circulated a petition to change the program Eventually his side prevailed Now those who participate in the survey receive a cash benefit But there is no penalty for those opting out I recognize that my health care rates are driven up by persons who dont live right and dont eat healthy Woessner says But Im willing to pay a higher rate because I in the end believe that liberty is more important than lower health care bills The Northeast Business Group on Health estimates that US businesses lose  billion a year in productivity because of obesity Half of teenagers are overweight and that means employer health care costs for everything from insurance to injury and illness are likely to balloon says   the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration If you dont address these issues the cost is going to be so great that its going to affect the viability of the company Foulke says And that he says is the biggest challenge  one that few businesses are openly talking about
