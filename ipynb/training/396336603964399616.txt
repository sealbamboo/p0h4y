When Mike Napoli got up to bat in Game  of the World Series my first thought was Oh my goodness that beard is awful But after the Red Soxs first baseman laid off a few bad pitches I started liking the hair on his chin All that got me thinking about beards Sometime during evolution women lost their facial hair This strong difference between the sexes implies that facial furriness or the lack thereof has played a role in how we picked our partners at least at one point in human history But tastes and preferences are complicated issues They vary over time cultures and geography And they change much faster than evolution So what does science say about a modern mans beard Does facial hair actually make men more attractive Perhaps but it appears to depend on the length and density The scientific evidence on the topic is scant and mixed Researchers in the s and s resorted to fake beards or painted beardlike patterns on peoples faces But a study   in May started to clear up the confusion Psychologists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney found that women slightly preferred a heavy day stubble  something like   look during the  years  compared to a full beard or a cleanshaven face The team showed  men and women pictures of  men each with four variations of facial hair cleanshaven light stubble like Don Johnson   in   heavy stubble and a full beard something better groomed than Napolis overgrown chops but still complete coverage Selfidentified homosexual and asexual participants were excluded as were female participants that were pregnant the researchers wrote The effect was subtle On average women found the thick day stubble to be most attractive The smooth shave came in a close second and the light fiveday stubble was at the bottom of the list In contrast men equally preferred a full beard heavy stubble and a cleanshaven face the researchers wrote in the   Beards are signals of several things says   a psychologist at the University of Michigan who wasnt involved in the study Beards develop reliably as men enter adulthood So they signal sexual maturity  that you can maintain a high level of testosterone A fuzzy  oclock shadow on the other hand could be perceived in some cultures as patchy and unhealthy Kruger tells Shots People with really poor nutrition or who are addicted to drugs their hair often falls out he says You often see a relationship between the appearance of your hair and your health Nevertheless Kruger cautions that the recent study on beards was limited All the hair models were of European descent and the effect was small Not every human population has really heavy facial hair Kruger says So the study needs to be repeated with a wider selection of men and across cultures
