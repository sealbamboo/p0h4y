Exercise science is a fine and intellectually fascinating thing But sometimes you just want someone to lay out guidelines for how to put the newest fitness research into practice  An   does just that In  exercises deploying only body weight a chair and a wall it fulfills the latest mandates for highintensity effort which essentially combines a long run and a visit to the weight room into about seven minutes of steady discomfort  all of it based on science  Theres very good evidence that highintensity interval training provides many of the fitness benefits of prolonged endurance training but in much less time says Chris Jordan the director of exercise physiology at the Human Performance Institute in Orlando Fla and coauthor of the new article  Work by scientists at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario and other institutions shows for instance that even a few minutes of training at an intensity approaching your maximum capacity produces molecular changes within muscles comparable to those of several hours of running or bike riding  Interval training though requires intervals the extremely intense activity must be intermingled with brief periods of recovery In the program outlined by Mr Jordan and his colleagues this recovery is provided in part by a second rest between exercises But even more he says its accomplished by alternating an exercise that emphasizes the large muscles in the upper body with those in the lower body During the intermezzo the unexercised muscles have a moment to metaphorically catch their breath which makes the order of the exercises important  The exercises should be performed in rapid succession allowing  seconds for each while throughout the intensity hovers at about an  on a discomfort scale of  to  Mr Jordan says Those seven minutes should be in a word unpleasant The upside is after seven minutes youre done
