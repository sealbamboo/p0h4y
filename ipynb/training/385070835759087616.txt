Well todays the day health insurance marketplaces open for business And despite a partial shutdown of the federal government and some   theyre available for insurance shoppers While Oct  is a milestone in the implementation of the health law other dates are likely more critical for consumers planning to shop for health insurance on their state marketplace Few consumers are expected to enroll in a plan right away and that may be wise Its a good idea to start looking at the options early and to give yourself plenty of time for the application process Expect glitches has   for officials working on implementation of the marketplaces In the first week first month first three months I would suspect that there will be glitches President Obama   This is  states a lot of people signing up for something And there are going to be problems And I guarantee you there will be problems because weve got precedent When Massachusetts just one state   it took quite a long time It took several months before everything was smoothed out Thats not all Health insurance is complicated Understanding how the plans work and picking one that fits will take time perhaps several visits to the marketplace website or conversations with people trained to help with enrollment I think its going to be a pretty thoughtful process for most people to make a decision says Mila Kofman executive director of the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority The open enrollment period for  marketplace coverage runs through March The uninsured and people who usually buy their own policies on the individual market will make up the bulk of the  million people expected to buy coverage on the marketplaces also called exchanges Dec  looms large on the insurance calendar The health laws mandate that most people have coverage goes into effect Jan  But consumers cant wait until New Years Eve to meet that deadline In general consumers who want insurance to begin on the first day of any month have to enroll by the th day of the previous month So someone who wants coverage to start on Jan  should buy a plan by Dec  If someone signed up from Dec  to  coverage would begin Feb  at the earliest That could lead to a rush of activity around Dec  before the Jan  coverage requirements kick in and again in midMarch before the open enrollment period ends Second thoughts are OK If people sign up for a plan but then decide during the annual enrollment period that they want to switch they can do so as long as their policy hasnt yet become effective according to the Department of Health and Human Services If someone signs up in November for a plan that starts Jan  for example she could switch to another plan until Dec  If she waited until after Dec  to make a change however the new coverage wouldnt begin until Feb  and she would be without coverage in January Once a consumers plan actually becomes effective in general no changes may be made until the following open enrollment period Next year that will be between Oct  and Dec  There are   if someone experiences a significant change in life circumstances such as a birth divorce job loss or permanent relocation
