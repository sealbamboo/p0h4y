Poor countries are starting to realize something that richer ones sometimes forget Basic inexpensive measures can have dramatic impacts on the health of a country And they can save thousands of lives Take for instance the situation in Ethiopia The country used to have one of the highest rates of child mortality in the world If you were a kid born in  in Ethiopia you had a  in  chance of not surviving to your fifth birthday says   who directs UNICEFs efforts in Ethiopia Since then the country has   that survival rate by about  percent So Ethiopia has made a tremendous achievement in the space of two decades Salama says This progress isnt a result of expensive international aid or the recruitment of foreign doctors into Ethiopia Instead the country has invested in simple barebones clinics that are run by minimally educated community health workers Foos Muhumed Gudaal is one of  rural health extension workers in Ethiopia She practices at a post in the village of Walgo Yar in the eastern part of the country The clinic is a simple cement building with only two rooms one for Gudaal to live in and one that serves as a consultation room There is no electricity There are no lights Gudaals role at the post is a bit like the old image of a smalltown pediatrician But she isnt even a nurse Instead Gudaal along with all of the other health extension workers has gone through a special oneyear training program  Her salary isnt anywhere near that of a pediatrician either She earns roughly  each month But Gudaal can still treat the diseases that often cut a childs life short in Ethiopia And she can make sure kids in the village are up to date on their vaccines One of the main conditions Gudaal deals with is malaria The parasite kills about   people worldwide each year and the vast majority of those deaths occur in children younger than  Gudaal can diagnose and treat most malaria cases at her health post She can also easily treat diarrhea and respiratory infections two other   of children in the developing world Because there is no electricity at the clinic Gudaal has to rely on a kerosenefired refrigerator to keep her vaccines cold The aging fridge sits in a small shed next to the consultation room Gudaal lifts several vaccine vials out of the fridge She not only administers immunizations but also keeps records for who in the village needs shots and boosters Since being launched a decade ago this health extension program in Ethiopia has had a huge effect in the country Salama says Quite simply it has saved lives Children are now treated right across the country on a scale that was previously unheard of around the world he says Take acute severe malnutrition for which Ethiopia was famous in the s and s Salama says Today successfully these same lady health workers treat  children each year for severe malnutrition Previously these children would have most invariably died he says Despite these improvements Ethiopia still has a long way to go when it comes to   Malnutrition is still the leading cause of death for children younger than  in the country Nearly   of Ethiopian babies are born underweight weighing less than   pounds And about  percent of kids dont reach a normal height because of malnutrition But Salama says the beauty of Ethiopias health extension program is that its sustainable Its run by the government not a foreign foundation or agency So as long as theres the political will its able to reach kids across the country
