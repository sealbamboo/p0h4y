Its a conclusion that barks up a controversial tree The study goes against the idea wolves were domesticated when they wandered over to human agricultural settlements lured by food The study also contradicts previous research suggesting that dog domestication may have first happened in the Middle East or East Asia  There were many aspects in this study that we didnt expect said Olaf Thalmann researcher at Finlands University of Turku who led the study Chief among the surprises the European origin of dog domestication  Seeking to sniff out when and where domesticated dogs emerged scientists turned to genetics  Researchers extracted and sequenced mitochondrial DNA Mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms When working with these ancient samples scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA because it is more prevalent in cells than DNA within a cells nucleus  Scientists recovered DNA fragments from the genomes of  prehistoric dog and wolflike carnivores and  modern wolves with origins in Eurasia and America Researchers compared these mitochondrial genome sequences with those of  wolves  modern dogs  Chinese indigenous dogs and  coyotes  By highlighting similarities in DNA sequences among all of these specimens researchers put together trees of close relationships called clades The more similar two creatures sequences are the closer together they will be in the clade Researchers organized the specimens in the study into four clades with three of these groups having sister species represented by ancient fossils from Europe and the fourth relating to modern wolves as well  It appears based on these groupings that the oldest domesticated dogs were in Europe The carcasses that ancient hunters left behind may have attracted wolves which could have led to a relationship between dogs and humans study authors said   A group called Clade A includes examples of the modern dog breeds Basenji and Dingo as well as some preColombian New World dogs as old as  years The ancient dogs of the Americas seem to have already been domesticated when they got there having arrived with humans Thalmann said   What we propose is actually the process that led to dog domestication in Europe also gave rise  to dogs in the New World  Clade A demographically shows a connection with humans Between  and  years ago dog population declined but then began to rise sharply starting about   years ago said Thalmann Human population size also went up at that time indicating that dogs were dependent demographically on the human societies he said Meanwhile wolves became more scarce as agrarian cultures emerged and wolves lost their habitats and wild game  Surprisingly researchers did not find a population of modern wolves that might have given rise to modern dogs In fact modern dogs have more genetically in common with ancient wolves than the ones we see today  Its quite likely that the population of wolves that gave rise to modern dogs does not exist anymore Thalmann said  Another big surprise from the study is based on mitochondrial DNA the two most ancient samples of doglike creatures included in this study didnt seem to be dogs at all  One of the oldest samples was previously described in a   led by Nikolai Ovodov a coauthor on the new Science study Ovodov and colleagues described remains of a doglike creature from Razboinichya Cave in Siberia about  years old and found similarities between it and domesticated dogs from Greenland that lived about  years ago  But the new studys genetic analysis suggests that this particular sample is an ancient sister lineage to modern dogs and wolves not a direct ancestor A yearold doglike carnivore found in Belgium does not seem to represent a direct ancestor either We did not expect that these two particular dogs  the putative earliest dogs  that theyre not directly related to modern dogs  Thats not something the study authors expected Thalmann said  So whats going on There are two theories about what happened to these creatures Thalmann said  Its possible that both of these fossils represent early attempts of humans to domesticate doglike animals These creatures did not appear to leave any descendents so they may signify a failure of domestication  Alternatively these creatures may not have been domesticated at all but rather unusual wolves that died out before the last Ice Age  More recent specimens  such as a yearold fossil from the Oberkassel site in Bonn Germany and the yearold fossil from Germanys Karstein cave  seem to be more directly related to modern dogs Scientists previously had evidence based on their physical features but the new mitochondrial genome analysis adds more support Thalmann said  By  years ago dogs had become a consistent component of human settlements and were subject to deliberate burial themselves and were included in human graves the PLOS One study said This new study doesnt present the whole story however It did not include ancient samples from the Middle East or China which are alternative proposals for the origins of dog domestication Thalmann anticipates that this will be a criticism of the study Also regarding wolves the study included fewer wolf samples from the Middle East and East Asia than other areas potentially skewing that part of the analysis as well   But notes the studys senior author Robert Wayne a biologist at the University of California Los Angeles the oldest dog fossils from East Asia are no more than  years old making them much younger than the European samples and dating from well after the domestication of dogs The oldest Middle Eastern dog remains are between  and  years old and so still more recent than the European fossils  Mitochondrial DNA from ancient canines from these areas would make for a more complete picture of canine evolution but it was not available in this study  If a yearold dog fossil were available from these areas scientists would also need to find other fossils to arrange them in a tree of relationships Thalmann said  If those were genetically more closely related to modern dogs than the European samples that would argue for a different origin of domestication  but such samples have not been recovered This result seems unlikely given the close associations found between modern dogs and ancient European wolves and dogs Wayne said   Many questions remain about the first domesticated canines They may be doggone but science is making sure theyre not forgotten
