The state Department of Public Health is adopting the nations firstever drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium a carcinogen found in water supplies across the state The department announced Tuesday that it has submitted a final regulation setting a limit of  parts per billion in public drinking water supplies a level that will require more than  water systems to treat for the contaminant If approved as expected by the Office of Administrative Law the standard would take effect July  Public health Director Ron Chapman said the limit will protect public health while taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility as required by law Known as chromium  the toxic heavy metal makes its way into groundwater naturally from geological formations It also is an industrial pollutant made famous for tainting water supplies in the desert town of Hinkley Calif inspiring the movie Erin Brockovich Current state and federal standards are for total chromium  which includes trivalent chromium an essential nutrient found naturally in foods The  parts per billion hexavalent standard was proposed last year It is  times greater than a nonenforceable public health goal set earlier by the state Environmental Protection Agency sparking criticism from environmentalists that the new limit isnt stringent enough The longdelayed action today simply does not provide enough protection for peoples health said Avinash Kar an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council which sued the department to force it to issue a standard The department both inflated water treatment costs and underestimated the benefits of a stronger standard A number of water districts on the other hand complained that the new limit  the equivalent of  drops of water in an Olympicsized swimming pool  isnt scientifically justified and would be prohibitively expensive to meet Rich Atwater executive director of the Southern California Water Committee said communities in the Coachella Valley and others across the state with naturally occurring chromium  in their aquifers will be spending an extraordinary amount of local customers water bills on stateoftheart new treatment systems Los Angeles and other cities already have been treating industrially contaminated groundwater supplies in the San Fernando Valley to a level of  parts per billion of chromium  so they will not have to use new treatments to comply with the standard
