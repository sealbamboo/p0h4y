New weight loss guidelines for the NHS in England will advise people to lose a little and keep it off for life The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE wants overweight people sent to slimming classes with the aim of a  weight loss NICE said even such a small loss  probably of just a few pounds  would cut blood pressure and reduce the risk of type diabetes and some cancers Two in three adults in England are overweight  with a BMI higher than  Someone weighing st lb would need to lose just over six pounds to cut their weight by  If they were ft in their BMI would drop from  to  Anyone with a BMI of more than  is classed as obese  Prof Mike Kelly the director of the centre for public health at NICE said the guidelines were about lifelong change rather than yoyo dieting when the weight is piled back on after initial success He said that required achievable goals We would like to offer an instant solution and a quick win a much greater ambition if you like but realistically its important to bear in mind this is difficult It is not just a question of for goodness sake pull yourself together and lose a stone  it doesnt work like that People find it difficult to do  its not something you can just wake up one morning and decide Im going to lose  pounds it takes resolve it takes encouragement Gill Fine a public health nutritionist who led the team devising the guidelines said a sustained  drop in weight would alter the trajectory of everexpanding waistlines  She commented If people think theyve got to lose over a stone they dont lose a stone and they get disheartened and they go back up  that isnt going to help them But if they can just lose a little bit keep that weight off then that is going to give them a health benefit   The guidance for the NHS in England said weightmanagement programmes should This would include some established NHS programmes as well as private businesses including Rosemary Conley Slimming World and Weight Watchers Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum told the BBC the guidelines did not go far enough and looked like a brave attempt to close the stable door whilst the horse is still bolting He commented A  reduction may well have some health benefit  every little helps  but if the patient is obese at the beginning of the course he or she will probably still be obese by its end   At least a  weight loss and preferably one of  have been weight reduction targets in past years and they still should be today NICE should be going for the clinical excellence that its proud of and not the compromise it has suggested Prof John Ashton the president of the Faculty of Public Health said obesity was a major health issue He added These are just the first steps If tackling obesity were as simple as telling people they should eat less and move more we would not have a problem now  Individuals need to play their part but this guidance acts as a reminder that we also need bold action now from government to reduce the huge costs of treating obesity  Stronger more effective policy interventions are also needed which is why we support piloting a sugar duty to see how successful it will be Sir Richard Thompson the president of the Royal College of Physicians said The majority of Britain is expected to be obese by   NICEs new guidance will help encourage greater coordination of services and provide the support that medical professionals need to deliver highquality prevention and obesity management services
