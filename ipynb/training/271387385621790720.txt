The endless debate over routine mammograms is getting another kick from   that sharply questions whether the test really does what its supposed to Dr   coauthor of the analysis of mammographys impact which was just published in   tell Shots that the aim was to get down to a very basic question That is do annual mammograms among women over  discover earlystage breast cancers that can be treated so that they never become deadlier latestage tumors Welch of Dartmouth Medical School and coauthor Dr   of the Oregon Health and Science University analyzed  years of data on breast cancer incidence And what we see is a dramatic increase  a doubling  in the amount of earlystage cancer Welch says But we dont see a corresponding decrease in the amount of latestage cancer They say this means mammography isnt catching many advanced breast cancers  even though its very good at catching early tumors Too good perhaps The duo says many of the early tumors revealed by mammography dont need to be treated at all Doctors call that overdiagnosis Welch says more than  million women have been overdiagnosed with breast cancer over the past  years And the problem continues Seventy thousand women a year are overdiagnosed and treated unnecessarily for breast cancer Welch says This all may come as a shock to many women  and their doctors No other diagnostic test has been more aggressively promoted than mammography  or lately been so controversial with the possible exception of  Whenever I see a paper like this I say Oh boy here we go again  says Dr   a breastimaging specialist at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York City Lee is on the communications committee of the   whose members often do mammograms In a   the group says the new analysis is simply wrong The ACRs main criticism is that Welch and Bleyer dont account for what the radiologists say was a steady increase in the incidence of invasive breast cancer They say that can explain why mammography didnt lower the incidence of advanced breast cancer more Welch rejects that claim Why was breast cancer incidence so stable in the late s only to shoot up in the s  the very time mammography was introduced he writes in an email Why didnt incidence rise dramatically in women under   those not exposed to screening Welch is no newcomer to debates over the benefits and harms of diagnostic screening tests In fact hes a wellknown iconoclast who last year published the popular    He has a preexisting bias just as those of us in the breastimaging community have a preexisting bias Lee says The truth probably lies somewhere in between Still Lee finds it hard to believe that  women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer that would not have progressed And she says the debate isnt very helpful to most women What my friends in Connecticut want to know is Should I have a screening mammogram And  this kind of study sometimes raises more questions than it answers Lee says San Francisco breast surgeon   agrees that women are tortured by these endless debates But she sees a way out of the dilemma Our concept of cancer has got to change she tells Shots We now recognize that there isnt just one pathway  its not cancer yes or no And doctors know now that cancer doesnt always lead to death Esserman thinks mammography screening should be done more selectively Women at lower risk of breast cancer  because they dont have close relatives whove had it or have a genetic predisposition for it  may not need to be screened so often Second she says women and their doctors have to get out of the mindset that any breast cancer should be treated maximally For instance doctors now routinely deploy surgery hormones and radiation to treat a condition called   We can watch a lot of those things and most of them turn out to be just fine she says But this is a long way from how either mammography or breast cancer treatment is practiced right now
