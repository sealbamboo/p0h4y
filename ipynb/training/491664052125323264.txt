A lady had a snake in a bag When somebody opened the bag that made the lady die Thats the beginning of a story that Temba Morris often hears about the origins of Ebola Morris runs a government health clinic in a remote village near Sierra Leones border with Guinea According to the story somebody else then looked inside the bag And the one who opened the bag also died is what Morris hears next The snake escaped into the Sierra Leone bush So there you have it Ebola is an evil snake that will kill you if you look at it The striking thing about this story which is told and retold is that Ebola really did come here from Guinea and it currently is out of the bag But narratives like this are a dangerous distraction when health officials are dealing with a virus that spreads by humantohuman contact  and a lack of knowledge about how to stay safe In the remote northeastern corner of Sierra Leone dozens of new Ebola cases are being reported each week As the virus spreads so do rumors about the terrifying disease The first is that Ebola doesnt exist Some say its a ploy to extract money from the international aid agencies Others say the people arent dying from Ebola theyre dying from a curse Then there are people who accept that it exists but have unorthodox ideas about how it got there In the initial days some people said it could spread through drinking water and mosquitoes Given that it kills the majority of the people who get infected Ebola is scary enough If you believe its water or mosquitoborne it becomes almost overwhelmingly frightening The other central theme that pops up in many of the rumors about Ebola is that the white people brought it A plague hits and then a bunch of foreigners in spacesuits come and whisk away the corpses in shiny white body bags There have been stories that this is all a scheme to harvest organs from the locals So when some people got sick they fled to the forest or hid with relatives making it more likely theyd infect others Some towns in Guinea have refused to allow any foreign health workers to enter at all Dr Tim Jagatic of Doctors Without Borders says the misperceptions are understandable We created a hospital and a lot of people started to get sick and die Its very difficult for them to make a connection that we are here to help Winning the communications battle is critical he says The most effective way for us to be able to end this epidemic is to focus on public health measures It is learning about how this disease is transmitted increasing the level of hygiene amongst the people in the villages demystifying and destigmatizing this disease Five months after this outbreak started efforts are underway to try to do that Posters from the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health listing the symptoms are plastered in markets and on public buildings Community elders are being recruited and trained to hold Ebola information sessions in their villages And a group of teens from the local Red Cross has written several songs explaining the basics of Ebola One starts with a basic assertion Ebola is real
