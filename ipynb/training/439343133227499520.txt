When someone on the Academy Awards broadcast on Sunday announces the nominees for best documentary short subject a lot of viewers will head to the kitchen to refill the Cheetos bowl But Ill be quietly pulling for   not only because its moving and important but also because you have to give the filmmaker Edgar Barens credit for rare audacity He has taken on what are probably Americas two least favorite subjects prisons and death In  working alone Mr Barens spent six months shooting  hours of footage at the Iowa State Penitentiary where inmates and the director of nursing had established a hospice the year before He spent the next six years trying to get funding to make and distribute his film  It really was a battle he told me  and largely failing until HBO rode to the rescue Now audiences can see Prison Terminal at the IFC Center in New York and at theaters around the country as part of the  Oscar Nominated Documentary Shorts Program It will appear on HBO on March  And on Sunday Mr Barens  and his date  his mother  will proudly walk the red carpet Our countrys   but however old and sick inmates become they are rarely paroled or given commuted sentences Prisoners wont be freed just because theyre terminally ill Mr Barens said Nor are most prisons equipped for endoflife care Most prisoners die alone in their cells or alone in an infirmary if there is one Mr Barens said Or they die shackled to a bed in a hospital with a security guard outside the room At the Iowa prison though we meet Jack Hall an yearold World War II veteran who was convicted of murder decades ago and now has heart disease and pneumonia He is cared for by fellow inmates trained as orderlies and hospice volunteers We hold their hands one volunteer Bertrum Burkett aka Herky says in the documentary We bathe them We feed them Hes shown tenderly massaging Mr Halls back Thank you buddy Mr Hall tells him at one point Youre welcome I love you Mr Burkett replies Mr Hall was once such a segregationist his son points out in the documentaryÂ Yet nearly all the volunteers tending to him in his final weeks are black Of the  or so hospices operating in prisons Mr Barens said about  follow a model in which inmates care for inmates It not only helps the guy whos dying but also these guys who have an opportunity for redemption he said As Mr Burkett puts it in the film For once Im somebody that nobody thought I could be Like other hospices these programs also help keep medical costs down especially since an inmate who goes to an emergency room or enters a hospital requires a security escort Such programs are vulnerable a new administrator could close a hospice without a second thought But administrators can also establish and support more prison hospices and thats Mr Barenss hope Iowas volunteers hope so too Theyre almost all lifers Mr Barens said Theyre going to die in prison too So they want to keep the hospice going
