Electromagnetism can detect AIDS The Complete Cure Device can wipe out the virus The Egyptian military made those claims earlier this year but now they have backtracked after the announcement was widely denounced by scientists including Egypts own science adviser Nonetheless people are still eager to believe the unbelievable Egypts announcement prompted  people to send emails asking to try the new treatment The Complete Cure Device is just one more false promise in the ongoing fight against AIDS It is a reminder too that for  years beginning in the early s AIDS was a slaughter shrouded in mystery of people in the prime of their lives Then came a breakthrough in  A combination of drugs could control the virus allowing infected people to live long and productive lives Today antiretroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS is widely available An outright cure still eludes scientists but the once deadly disease has become manageable So any claim for an unproven cure offering hope that could deter patients from effective treatment is cruel But myths false claims and outright fraud have persisted in the AIDS epidemic The bogus theories of Peter Duesberg a professor of biochemistry at the University of California Berkeley were responsible for a global setback to HIV treatment Duesberg argued that combinations of drug use and promiscuous behavior caused the virus and passed his advice on to South African health officials in  The biggest disaster imposed on us was Duesberg with his statements that HIV did not cause AIDS says Max Essex chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health AIDS Initiative Essex has been conducting research on AIDS since  including field research in Botswana and Southern Africa Between  and  as neighboring African countries were ramping up HIV prevention programs South Africa stubbornly stuck to the notion that HIV was not the cause of AIDS I think Duesberg played the biggest role in giving former South African President Thabo Mbeki a convenient excuse to avoid supplying drugs says Essex Researchers including Essex examined the human toll of those lost years of treatment Their   published in  in the   estimated that  South African adults died because of lack of treatment and  infants were born with HIV If that was the biggest disaster no doubt the cruelest of the AIDS false cure claims was the virgin cleansing myth that took hold in subSaharan Africa as well as parts of India and Thailand Some men believed they could be cured of AIDS by having sex with a virgin That reportedly led to the rape of younger and younger girls  even babies by some accounts Other unproven AIDS cures have kept people from seeking lifesaving treatments herbal remedies potions to rub into the skin chemicals like Virodene derived from an industrial solvent oxygen therapy and electronic zappers There is still much work to be done to prevent HIV infection to develop a vaccine to further improve drug treatment and to prevent other chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease in people with AIDS who are living longer And despite the spectacular scams there have also been spectacular successes in hardhit areas For example in the s Botswana had the highest rate of HIV infection in the world Today almost all of the countrys patients seek treatment by contrast only half of Americans infected with HIV get treatment according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Today the number of people in Botswana on successful therapy who will live almost normal lives is  percent of HIVinfected people says Essex In that respect Botswana is No  in the world
