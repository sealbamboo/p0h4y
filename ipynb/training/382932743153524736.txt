In one of the largest studies ever done on the subject researchers have found that taking statins the widely used cholesterollowering drugs is associated with an increased risk for cataracts Previous studies had mixed results In the latest observational study   scientists retrospectively examined  statin users and  nonusers ages  to  who were part of a military health care system The average length of statin use was about two years After adjusting for more than three dozen other health and behavioral variables the scientists found that compared with nonusers those who took statins had a  to  percent increased risk for cataracts  Cataract development may be influenced by statins effects on the oxidation process the researchers say The cholesterolinhibiting properties of statins may also interfere with cell regeneration in the eyes lens which requires cholesterol to maintain transparency If a patient takes this medication because he is at high risk for heart disease or already has heart disease the proven benefit of statins is much greater than the suspected risk of cataracts said the senior author Dr Ishak Mansi a professor of medicine at the University of Texas But they have side effects and doctors should not prescribe this medication lightly
