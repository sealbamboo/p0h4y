In shorthand often used to describe the brain fear is controlled by a small almondshaped structure called the amygdala But its not quite that simple as a   published Sunday in   demonstrates One of the best ways to figure out how parts of the brain work is to study people who have damage in those specific areas Take a patient known as SM a middleaged woman with a rare condition called   that has damaged the amygdala on both sides of her brain A few years ago SM told Justin Feinstein then a graduate student at the University of Iowa in Iowa City that shed never felt fear even when shed been confronted by a knifewielding assailant Feinstein put her claim to the   His group had SM handle a snake took her on a tour of a haunted house and showed her scenes from scary movies like   SM was unfazed But another University of Iowa researcher neuroscientist   had a different test for SM breathing carbon dioxide In people without brain damage exposure to high levels of carbon dioxide evokes fear and a hunger for air In some it can even set off a panic attack The body is not so good at detecting low levels of oxygen but is really good at detecting high levels of carbon dioxide Wemmie says And so Feinstein Wemmie and their colleagues administered a new test to SM along with a pair of twin sisters with similar brain lesions from the same rare disease All three volunteers were exposed to high concentrations of the gas The researchers thought that the patients would be insensitive to the test We were pretty shocked when exactly the opposite happened Wemmie says A few seconds after inhaling the gas SM started to wave her hand towards the mask covering her face crying help me to a nearby experimenter After the mask was removed SMs skin was flushed her nostrils flared and her eyes were wide open When asked about the emotions the experience caused SM replied Panic mostly cause I didnt know what the hell was going on The other two patients had similar panic attacks saying they felt like they were suffocating One even named her feeling as fear All the patients found the experience highly aversive and none of them found it pleasurable in a way that theyd want to do it again says Feinstein now a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology This is interesting because it shows that the loss of the amygdala does not prevent these patients from experiencing fear altogether says Caltech neurobiologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator   who wasnt involved in the study However he notes   have found that some patients with a damaged amygdala are capable of being afraid There is more to fear than just the amygdala he says Feinstein thinks that the fear induced internally by carbon dioxide may be processed differently in the brain than the fear caused by an outside source like a scary movie It may be that learned fears and innate ones are handled differently Were still learning a lot about how the brain processes fear he says and what this finding suggests is we still have a long way to go
