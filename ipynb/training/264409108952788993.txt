If you need an MRI of your knee in Colorado the price varies  a lot You can pay anywhere from  to  Its a huge range but the truly remarkable thing about the prices is that we know them at all Prices for health care arent public in most places making shopping for the best deal nearly impossible And patients pay different amounts for the same procedure based on their insurance coverage too But   have now established price databases to help people shop for health care Colorado   launching its version on the same day a consortium of big purchasers of health care including WalMart GE and the AFLCIO issued  Health care providers insurers and the government in Colorado agreed to build the new database   For now the database isnt naming specific hospitals or providers along with the prices though Phil Kalin president of the nonprofit   which runs the database says thats because they want to give providers a chance to vet and analyze the data The period of anonymity also gives them a chance to adjust their prices before next fall when an update will link prices to specific providers No gotchas Kalin says well name names later But the preliminary data are already shedding light on how much prices vary The eightfold difference in MRI prices stands out as does a fourfold difference in spending per health plan member between nearby counties It ranges from a low of  per year in Hinsdale County to a high of just over  in Pitkin County Itll be about a year before consumers in Colorado can easily plug in a given medical procedure and get a price quote The Center also doesnt want to name names until the database is more complete Right now it only has information on what Medicaid and the states eight largest insurers are paying which covers about half of Colorados insured population Over the next year it will add data from Medicare and other private payers encompassing  of all Coloradans with insurance coverage
