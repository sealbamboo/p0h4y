New numbers and demographic information   by the White House Thursday reveal some telling details about the   who selected new health insurance through HealthCaregov and state marketplaces Almost half   million  of all of the people who signed up did so in the last six weeks according to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other HHS officials who spoke to reporters in a conference call And nearly a million got coverage after the original March  deadline Though the Affordable Care Acts first open enrollment period technically ended March  it was ultimately   by a few weeks There was a similar surge of people buying coverage outside the government marketplaces   CEO of the large online broker eHealth says the surge was greater than he expected  with  percent of total applications coming in the last two weeks Lauer also announced eHealths totals Thursday He says that during this first enrollment period  people bought ACAcompliant plans through eHealths website And he says the companys overall business was  percent higher than during the first quarter of last year The total number of people buying plans   is estimated at somewhere between  million and  million people Medicaid also saw a surge in enrollment during the last six months as  states expanded the program as the ACA encourages About  million people signed up for benefits via Medicaid or the   About  percent of all those who signed up via the exchanges received federal subsidies of their monthly premiums Total enrollments came to at least  million once you add together numbers from Medicaid marketplace enrollments and the lowest estimates of how many people bought new ACAcompliant policies outside the exchanges Its unclear how many of those people were previously uninsured but     Corp and the   all say the number of uninsured has declined Were hopeful that states that havent yet expanded Medicaid will decide to come on board so we can cover millions more people Sebelius said One disappointment for those hoping to extend health coverage the relatively few Latinos who signed up for the new health policies Latinos rank among the most underinsured in America but the numbers released Thursday suggest that only  used HealthCaregov out of an estimated  million who are eligible That number is just an estimate though This is the first time HHS has broken down statistics about enrollees by race and it only did so for signups that came via HealthCaregov the marketplace  states use Any information about race in those signups is selfreported and supplying it is optional  about a third of enrollees declined to identify their race Thursdays HHS data do not include the demographic information from California or New York  two states that are among the  operating their own marketplaces instead of using HealthCaregov Both states have large Latino populations HHSs numbers also suggest that African and AsianAmericans may be overrepresented among enrollees relative to their numbers in the general population Among the  states that set up their own health insurance exchanges California topped the rest in highest percentage of enrollments among those eligible  except for Vermont which is setting up a singlepayer system The Golden State enrolled  percent of the Californians   to use its marketplace Thats compared to a  percent rate of enrollment for states overall The  states that enrolled the highest percentage of eligible residents all signed up at least  percent or more of those eligible Most relied on their own staterun exchange At the bottom of the list  states enrolled fewer than  percent of eligible residents and most of those states relied on HealthCaregov Texas the state with the highest number of uninsured was in the bottom half of states for enrollment And Florida surprised many by signing up  percent of those eligible  fourth among all states despite substantial political opposition to the health care law States with their own exchanges were given widely varying amounts of money by the federal government to establish and market their exchanges its too early analysts say to determine which spent taxpayer money most effectively I dont see how you can possibly do it says MIT economist   Its like a company invested a bunch of money in a big new machine Gruber says You wouldnt want to look at what the machine produces the first year The exchanges are built to serve people for years he adds so you want to look at what it produces over time Economist   agrees that its too soon to evaluate the countrys investment in state exchanges Theres no pattern he says Kentuckys been very successful with a pretty barebones setup Weve seen very expensive efforts in Oregon now being turned over to the federal government The White House considers the  million mark a triumph exceeding its initial goal of  million for the Affordable Care Acts first sixmonth enrollment period And of all those who signed up  percent are in the  age range  a group coveted by insurers because young adults tend to be healthy The total number of people with health coverage nationwide is expected to continue to grow despite open enrollment being closed now for almost all states until November Several states extended their enrollment periods Nevadas is open yearround and Medicaid has no limits to its enrollment period  people can continue to sign up
