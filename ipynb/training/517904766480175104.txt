The government has launched four pilot schemes to help unemployed people with mental health problems find work   The voluntary scheme will see some people on Employment and Support Allowance being offered employment support and psychiatric help The m pilots all in England will run for six months Ministers say they are not a precursor to forcing unemployed people with mental health problems to seek help in order to keep their benefits   Last month the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said that mental health problems are costing the economy up to bn per annum  Nearly half of ESA claimants  have mental health problems The pilots are running in  Sam Ripley is an employment advisor based in Lewes Sussex who is helping yearold chef Andrew Simmons prepare for a job interview They have been working together for months Andrew suffers from anxiety and has found it difficult to hold onto previous jobs   In some of the more pressurised kitchens Ive struggled a little bit he says   But Im thinking this school job its bulk food you know what youve got to cook you know its got to go out at a certain time theres no menu changes so hopefully its going to be OK   Sam talks him through what his potential employers are likely to ask him preparing and calming him in equal measure   Shes arranged mock interviews for other clients and has helped Andrew with his job search as well as updating his CV   She specialises in helping people with psychiatric problems into work and occasionally talking to employers about how they can help someone with mental health issues stay in work    A lot of the adjustments have been really minor low cost  flexible working working from home having a buddy or mentor she says   All these things are very minimal so going in and explaining that can be really beneficial for employers   The cost of losing a valuable member of staff and then recruiting someone new is really high in comparison to providing a little bit of support to keep someone in work The government has rewarded Sams employer Southdown Housing Association for its approach They have been chosen for a pilot project aimed at getting unemployed people with mental health problems into work  The Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions have each put m into the six month programmes in four pilot areas combining employment support with directing people where appropriate towards psychological therapies   Lorraine who suffers from depression hasnt had paid work for years and has been on the pilot programme for a month having been referred to Southdown by the job centre Shes already applied for  jobs  The support is amazing she says enthusiastically In a sense theyre there  hours a day because I can email umpteen times and always get a reply never told we dont have time for you now   This is now a big step towards reclaiming a part of my life that Ive lost Lorraine will have her assessment for psychological therapy next week    Shes fortunate While the pilots can get someone onto the waiting list for help they cant push them to the front of the queue   As waiting times for the therapies are lengthy in many areas some people could come to the end of the pilots without having received any psychiatric help   Nonetheless the care and support minister Norman Lamb says the pilots are worth investing in   As soon as the individual is referred from job centre plus the individual can get help with their employment search straightaway building their selfconfidence says Mr Lamb   Then the psychological therapies can come in  Its crazy that someone is languishing on benefit at a cost to the state whilst they could be getting back into work getting their life back together again with appropriate funding But he denies there is any move to make it mandatory for unemployed people with anxiety and depression to seek help in order to keep their benefits   The minister says that no matter how successful these pilots are they wont lead to sick people being compelled to seek help   It wouldnt work he says dismissively  In order to make psychological therapies work the individual has to want to sign up to it   The idea of forcing frogmarching someone into therapy is a nonsense so Ive no interest in compulsion  I want to help people get back into work but it has to be on a voluntary basis Since I met him Andrew Simmons has had his interview  He starts a job trial on Monday  all being well the job is his
