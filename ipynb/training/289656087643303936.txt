An apparent feud between two black market pharmacies has shed light on a shady global industry RxPromotion and SpamIt probably are responsible for upward of  or  percent of spam that you and I got in our inboxes over the last five years said Brian Krebs a cybersecurity reporter who chronicled the alleged feud on his   Its just a ridiculous amount of problems that these two guys cause for everybody As part of a dispute between the pharmacies owners the digital files of both companies  once two of the largest black market pharmacies in the world  were hacked and ended up in Krebs hands Were talking about the contact information the bank account information the email addresses phone numbers sometimes passport information for many of the biggest spammers in the planet said Krebs Not only that but all the personal information of all the people who ever bought pills through these spam sites over four years This information offered a unique look at an industry thats typically shrouded in secrecy Overwhelmed by the amount of information Krebs shared the data with academic researchers including   a professor of computer science and engineering and University of California San Diego Savage used this data to analyze the industrys business model and cowrote a   this summer with his findings At the center of these operations are these international pharmacies often in countries like Russia Because these sites operate in the black market selling prescription drugs without prescriptions theyve historically turned to spam and other shady advertising practices to get the word out about their medications We wouldnt call what theyre doing legitimate its illegal in this country said Savage But the fundamental practice is they are trying to advertise this product The spammers are typically independent contractors paid on commission by the pharmacy for the sales they generate  something like  or  percent of the purchase price But once a customer goes to the pharmacy site and chooses his or her drug of choice the pharmacy takes over It finds someone to process the credit card payment which is difficult given the nature of the transaction Then it has to get the drugs to the customer They dont actually typically warehouse any drugs themselves Savage said So theyll contract with third parties who have access usually to generic drug manufacturing in India and China In the course of Savages research he and his team placed over  test orders and typically received their chosen medications in a timely fashion Weve maybe only had one time where we didnt get anything said Savage They tested some of the drugs they received and all had the proper amount of the active ingredient Savage says the vast majority of customers are ordering erectile dysfunction drugs Others order painkillers or stimulants for recreational use But up to  percent of orders come from people seeking medications to treat chronic health conditions likely because they cant afford to purchase them through legal avenues Dave Keck turned to an online pharmacy when he was dropped from his parents insurance and decided his acne needed prescriptionstrength help from a medication called Accutane He researched different international pharmacies and chose one in Latvia that didnt require a prescription I called Walgreens and they said it was going to be about  for a months supply of what I researched is what I should take said Keck And on this online pharmacy I think it was like  for the same amount so that was a nobrainer Keck knew the risks both of taking a very strong antiacne drug without a doctors supervision and of ordering drugs from abroad Its technically illegal in the US and he worried it might be a scam But he decided to place an order He watched his credit card for extra charges and then three weeks later he received a padded yellow envelope from Turkey What I got from this pharmacy was in kind of a binder said Keck And they included one box of the actual medicine but the rest was taped down to the inside of this binder It looked pretty suspicious But the pills were all in sealed blister packs with branding that looked more legitimate though the writing was in Turkish Keck decided to try taking the medication He figured it was either real Accutane or a sugar pill After Id taken it for about a week I was  percent sure it was the real deal just based on the side effects said Keck His skin dried up his lips got really chapped and his acne went away Not all online pharmacies operate in the black market the Food and Drug Administration says Americans should only order from sites that are licensed and located in the US Otherwise there may not be proper oversight or quality control on these medications And if these drugs wind up making customers sicker in the long run its actually not such a bargain
