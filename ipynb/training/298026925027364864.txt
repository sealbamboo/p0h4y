Sometimes being on a   just seems overwhelming You might feel as though you dont have the heart to stay in the weightloss fight Well its not always your heart that keeps you from diet success  sometimes its all in your head One of the main reasons that diets fail is because people approach weight loss the wrong way Targeting that diet mentality is really the key says   assistant professor at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham NC If I had to pick one thing I could fix to stop diets from failing it would be allornothing thinking and allornothing acting Binks works to get individuals to set small realistic goals instead of big sweeping ones If you went into every situation without thinking its all or nothing youre much more likely to moderate what you eat he explains Start thinking about the hundreds and hundreds of minidecisions we make in a day   like eating only half of a cookie instead of a whole one or adding a few short quick walks to your overall    are what ultimate lead to weight loss If I could get people to think a little differently day to day it would make a huge difference he says Another mental obstacle dieters face is giving up on themselves says Anne Wolf RD a registered dietitian and researcher at the University of Virginia School of Medicine They dont believe they really can do it says Wolf But once they see that other people have lost weight they realize I can do that too She also sees individuals begin a weightloss plan out of anger or take a no pain no gain mentality when it comes to weight loss Anger is not the same as a commitment notes Wolf If you can stay on a program that causes no pain and you gradually lose weight over the year thats great I tried to lose weight twice before I made the permanent lifestyle changes necessary to accomplish my goals says John from Fairfax Va When he made the decision to get serious about weight loss it was because he realized that not only was his weight unhealthy but so was the way he   about his weight and his health I remember going shopping for bigger pants   and sitting in the store and looking at the W rack thinking I could probably save money if I just got the W and grew into them  talk about surreal says John That moment made him realize that his thought process had to change and led to a pound weight loss Luckily I had a moment of clarity and realized how selfdestructive my logic was says John The trigger that makes you realize you dont lose   through a diet but through a lifestyle change is different for everyone Drastic dieting can be a vicious cycle that leaves people angry   frustrated and finally just giving up But if you learn a healthy way to approach weight loss both mentally and physically you can ultimately find success
