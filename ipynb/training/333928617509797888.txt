We all get lost or disoriented once in a while but for Sharon Roseman being lost is a way of life A little quirk in her brain makes it impossible to recognize landmarks and find her way around neighborhoods that should have become familiar long ago  I can literally see my house out the car window but I have no clue that its my house Roseman told NBCs Kristen Dahlgren Roseman  suffers from developmental topographical disorientation or DTD a disorder that had flown under brain researchers radar until very recently DTD was first described as a single case study in a paper published online in  in the journal Neuropsychologia  At the time it was thought to be extremely rare says the studys lead author Giuseppe Iaria professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Calgary But since then Iaria has discovered nearly  other people with DTD and he thinks there may be a lot more He currently estimates that about  percent of the population may be constantly coping with orientation and navigation problems caused by the disorder DTD is a profound and disabling deficit Nothing not even the layout of a house youve lived in for decades ever becomes familiar And for Roseman that has made life very trying  When her kids would cry in the night she would struggle to find her way to them Where I thought I was going out the doorway of my bedroom there was now a wall  and I would bang right into it she says Scientists have long known that injuries to certain parts of the brain could compromise patients abilities to orient themselves and navigate around the world but what was novel about DTD was its appearance very early in the life of a child who had no injuries Even more perplexing was the absence of any other deficiencies in memory or intellectual ability Roseman remembers when it first became clear that she wasnt like all the other kids One day when she was  years old and standing in front of their home Roseman asked her mom where they were When her mom pointed out that they were in front of their home in the Chicago suburb of Maywood Ill Roseman said This doesnt look like our house She remembers her mothers stunned response Thats when she pointed a finger in my face and she said Dont tell anybody because theyll say youre a witch and theyll burn you  That was enough for the little girl She didnt speak about her problems for years or even as a grown up She never even told her exhusband  No one knows exactly what is going wrong in the brains of people with DTD Brain scans have shown that everything seems to be in working order No brain region is shriveled or atrophied Iaria says  Scientists do know something about how the brain collects mapping information when everything is working correctly  Jeffery Taube who has been studying how rats navigate has discovered that the rodents appear to have an internal compass  I do mostly recordings of single neurons says Taube a professor in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College  So we watch as the neurons fire based on direction The rats  and probably peoples  brain cells fire like a compass There is a neuron that fires any time the rat heads north and another that fires when the rat heads southsoutheast Theres a full population of neurons that are responsive to all directions and they are always updating But construction of a map isnt just about keeping track of location Taube says Our internal cartographer also keeps track of landmarks  like a school or a big building or an oddly painted house  and correlates those with the location data When everything works right our brains cartographer constructs a map that allows us to find our way around places weve been without having to constantly check a paper map or ask for directions Map construction involves several areas of the brain Taube explains Theres a system thats important for perceiving where you are another for keeping track of where you are heading and another for keeping track of the distance youve moved Any one of these without the others wont do you any good Iaria believes that all those systems are in working order in people with DTD but they just arent communicating properly with one another Hes currently studying families in which some members have DTD and others dont trying to discover whether there is a genetic cause for the disorder Hes also looking into ways to teach brains disabled by DTD to make maps  While Roseman hopes that scientists do one day find a cure shed be happy if people just had a better understanding of what she and others with DTD go through each day  I want to someday have a child in kindergarten or first grade to be able to say to the teacher This isnt the room were always in is it and I want the teacher to know about it
