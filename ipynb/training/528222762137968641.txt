The lump first surfaced in my breast in  when I was  years old To many young women a small lump like that wouldnt be cause for alarm because most breast lumps are benign But theres a long history of breast cancer in my family so I immediately consulted a renowned breast surgeon Its nothing to worry about she said My mammogram was completely normal She thought the lump was merely normal breast tissue But four years later I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer My treatment was among the most aggressive available surgery a double mastectomy chemotherapy and five years of hormonal therapy to keep my hormonesensitive breast cancer quiescent Since there was no further sign of my cancer after my surgery I hoped that my hardhitting trio of treatment had succeeded in blasting every last cancer cell And whenever I made my annual visit to my oncologist I was comforted by his reassuring words Theres no sign of your disease In  I developed a chronic dry cough which my oncologist dismissed and which other physicians believed was caused either by a kind of chronic heartburn called   postnasal drip or asthma Four years later I lost my voice and an observant doctor noticed that my vocal cord was paralyzed After further testing a thoracic surgeon discovered with a biopsy that I had extensive metastatic breast cancer in my lungs a full  years after my early stage breast cancer diagnosis Between my initial breast cancer occurrence and my subsequent relapse my breast cancer had been misdiagnosed for a total of eight years Unbeknownst to me then up to  percent of those diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will eventually develop   which carries a   No doctor ever mentioned symptoms to watch out for such as bone pain or a chronic cough  tipoffs that my cancer might have returned When I consulted my longtime oncologist for treatment he burst into tears I stayed calm and reviewed my options with him He recommended a chemotherapy clinical trial but I felt uneasy about it I got a second opinion that led to hormonal therapy which Ive gratefully been on ever since Theres no doubt that so far Im one of the lucky ones no chemo painfree and able to do everything I did prior to my recurrence I also realize that eventually its likely that my luck will run out While Ive tried to be patient and thankful I sometimes feel outraged about how little has changed since my first diagnosis Despite decades of awareness months survival has remained depressingly flat The fact is each year over  women and  men   and the median survival is   In my view the public has often been misled by pink ribbon messages that exaggerate prevention and cures for breast cancer With all the money flowing to breast cancer research which is admittedly one of the betterfunded cancers I would have hoped for more dramatic reductions in the number of people diagnosed with and dying from the disease No one dies of early stage breast cancer Only when it becomes metastatic does it become lethal Yet regrettably   is allocated for metastatic breast cancer If you see things the way I do youd want at least  percent of monies to be allocated toward it since about  percent of people diagnosed with breast cancer will ultimately die of metastatic breast cancer Another point that makes me see red especially in October is that the results of so many large clinical trials   I and many others with metastatic breast cancer would support a requirement that all breast cancer trials be published Finally Im saddened by the limitations and toxicity of drugs for people like me Id like to see better use of the Food and Drug Administrations programs for speeding up drug approvals as well as expanded access to experimental drugs for compassionate use Yet I believe there is hope for change Just this month the newly formed Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance a consortium of  organizations dedicated to improving the lives of those with MBC published a detailed analysis laying out the needs of those living with the disease The group will next look for ways to fill those gaps a momentous task that I believe theyre in the right position to fulfill I hope to live long enough to witness a drop in breast cancer mortality For that to happen fundamental shifts are required in how we assess address and ultimately prevent metastatic breast cancer so that fewer people will follow me on my unwanted journey
