Zachary Diamond and Angie Nunes look at their wonderfully healthy monthold son Solomon knowing they might have terminated the pregnancy  all because of a popular prenatal test that was wrong The Portland Oregon couple was encouraged to use a new noninvasive blood test that their doctor said was  percent accurate in predicting chromosomal abnormalities The test revealed the fetus had   a painful genetic condition that is nearly always fatal and their doctor told them to prepare for the worst If you google Trisomy  your heart will just shatter with the prognosis Diamond  told NBC News The prognosis is godless just awful Angie was crying on the sofa for hours on end Nunes  has muscular dystrophy and worried about how they could care for a child with such severe disabilities Only after a week ultrasound and a second screening test did doctors realize she was probably carrying a normal baby Hundreds of thousands of pregnant women have used these noninvasive prenatal tests since they appeared on the market in  with little reason to doubt their effectiveness And indeed studies have found the tests to be  But positive results can be wrong  percent or more of the time And   published in the   found that likely hundreds of women are aborting fetuses based on this new generation of testing One company reported a  percent abortion rate based on screening results alone  and without further testing there is no way to know how many of those may have been due to a false positive The investigation says companies are aggressively marketing these screening tests to women of all ages without fully informing patients or doctors about their limitations The competition is rabid and these companies are aggressively going to doctors offices and medical practices to push the test said Beth Daley who led the threemonth investigation Noninvasive prenatal tests or the cell free DNA test are merely screening tests of placental DNA found in the mothers blood which companies truthfully disclose in their materials Women are eager to learn if their fetus is healthy but many doctors dont understand how to interpret the true odds In order to be sure of a diagnosis a woman would need to undergo more invasive screening such as amniocentesis or chronic villus sampling but those tests are not available until later in the pregnancy  in the case of amniocentesis generally not until the second trimester The companies might be technically right  told NBC News But in the least they are misleading and at most fairly deceptive Companies are charging  or more for each prenatal test creating a competitive industry that is projected to be  billion by  according to Daleys research The four major tests include brands like MaterniT offered by Sequenom Inc Verifi by Illumina Inc Panorama by Natera Inc and Harmony by Ariosa Diagnostics Inc They do not require approval from the Food and Drug Administration FDA because of a regulatory loophole All the companies recommend screening should be followed up with diagnostic testing but often only in fine print NBC reached out to the four manufacturers of these prenatal screening tests but only received a response from two Illumina spokeswoman Jennifer Viera declined to comment Sequenom stood by company claims that MaterniT  PLUS was highly accurate but added that false positive and false negative results may occur although in far fewer numbers than with conventional screen tests The company said it recomends that doctors counsel patients that it is not a replacement for more invasive tests such as amniocentesis Patients with a positive result should seek genetic counseling and a negative test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy In July the FDA announced it would begin to regulate hundreds of   from Lyme disease to cancer but Daley said its going to be a big fight and could take years to take effect For decades amniocentesis has been the gold standard of prenatal testing performed on  to  women a year But it is usually offered at  weeks gestation when termination can be traumatic and carries a risk of miscarriage Chorionic villus sampling  testing the placental tissue  is also invasive and can be done as early as  weeks but it carries a one in  risk of miscarriage higher than that for amniocentesis The noninvasive test however can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy detecting placental DNA in the mothers blood Many women say they take the test just to find out the babys gender early in the pregnancy  of Tiverton Rhode Island was encouraged to take the test by her doctor because of her advanced age I had never heard of it and thought it was just for checking for Down syndrome Chapman now  told NBC News Her test falsely revealed the fetus had   so she scheduled an abortion But a day later her doctor called back and urged further diagnostic testing which much later at  weeks showed the fetus was normal The rest of the pregnancy was traumatic and it didnt have to be this way Chapman said I tried not to bond with the baby and didnt want to talk to anyone about it or tell people at work I didnt even want to have a baby shower Her son Lincoln Samuel was born on Nov   Sam is perfect said Chapman But these NIPTs are not perfect according to   a geneticist and codirector of the Down Syndrome Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston In medicine we have no one number that reports accuracy he told NBC News The  percent women are hearing refers to the sensitivity of the test Sensitivity is the detection rate  the probability a test result will be positive when an abnormality is present But this test also inadvertently detects abnormality in a healthy fetus Relying on sensitivity alone can give misleading results according to Skotko In a competitive market its much more alluring to post a statistic that says a test is  percent accurate rather than a statistic that is more meaningful to women with a lower percentage he said The true likelihood that a positive test is positive depends on another calculation  the positive predictive value or PPV which factors in other variables such as a womans age and the prevalence of the disease in that population He said expectant mothers should always consult a welltrained doctor or geneticist to determine the PPV so they can make an informed decision It seems like math mumbo jumbo when you put the numbers together said Skotko A test could be  percent sensitive and still have a  percent positive predictive value In Chapmans case  a woman over  where genetic disorders are more common  the likelihood of Trisomy  given a positive screening result is about  percent For a younger woman the PPV would be under  percent according to the investigation While false positives are the main problem there also have been false negatives popping up in doctors offices according to reporter Daley Belinda Boydston  of Chandler Arizona was urged by her doctor to take a test after a week ultrasound showed her fetus had heart defects ones later determined to be treatable The screening showed no chromosomal abnormalities but when her son Hunter was born in January  he had Trisomy  and died within four days It was a roller coaster ride Boydston a graphic designer told NBC News We went from the greatest high to the greatest low of our lives  We wouldnt have terminated and we got four days with him but I wish we had known She said they never had any genetic counseling and when they tried to call the testing company they refused to talk directly to patients We never found out why it was wrong Like Chapman Boydston said all she heard was  percent accurate I dont know if diagnostic or screening means anything to a normal person she said They are so new my obgyn didnt even know about it I would say skip any prenatal testing and go do an amniocentesis if you are concerned she said They cause too much worry  Unless they are  percent accurate they are worthless
