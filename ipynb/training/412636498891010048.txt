Chinese doctors have saved a mans severed hand by grafting it to his ankle it is reported  Xiao Wei lost his right hand in an accident at work but could not have it reattached to his arm right away Instead the hand was kept alive by stitching it to Mr Weis left ankle and borrowing a blood supply from arteries in the leg  A month later surgeons were able to remove the hand and replant it back on his arm according to Rex Features  According to the report Mr Weis doctors from the Changsha region say he will need to undergo several other operations but they are hopeful that he will regain full function of his hand His injury was severe Besides ripping injuries his arm was also flattened  We had to clear and treat his injuries before taking on the hand reattachment surgery Mr Cairian Healy of the Royal College of Surgeons in England said although procedures such as these were rare they were not inconceivable  The Chinese are pretty experienced in microsurgery he said And the concept of saving a severed part of the body by attaching it to another part of the body to give it a blood supply is well recognised  The ankle is a hard place to graft though Usually surgeons would go for the armpit because the blood supply is better He said there were many reasons why a surgeon might not want or be able to reattach a hand to its rightful home straightaway  The patient might not be fit enough for the surgery It can take a skilled surgeon between eight and  hours to reattach a hand The vital factor is keeping the hand alive  On ice it may survive slightly longer but Mr Healy said few surgeons would contemplate replanting a hand that had been detached for more than a few hours because the muscle inside it would be dead  He said that sadly not all replantations are a success Some patients do not like the end result and may later opt for amputation because of sideeffects such as pain and stiffness
