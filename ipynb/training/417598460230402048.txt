If I say cinnamon you say  sugar Its a popular combination of course But if youre interested in the healthpromoting effects of cinnamon you may want to think anew about the spice For instance says   executive chef at Bourbon Steak Restaurant in Washington DC why not add it to savory dishes He uses cinnamon to create a spice and herb rub for lamb loin He also whips up a great spinach salad with raisins pine nuts and cinnamon Critchley is a fan of the intense aromatics in cinnamon especially in Saigon  a cousin of the cassia varieties of cinnamon most commonly used in the US and Europe And he says adding cinnamon to spice blends is a great way to layer flavors when youre cooking And when you start to look at the potential healthpromoting effects of the spice theres even more incentive to experiment with it in the kitchen Cinnamon comes from the bark of trees It has long been considered a medicinal plant There are several varieties harvested from southern China to Southeast Asia For years there have been hints that adding cinnamon to your diet can help control blood sugar And a recent spate of studies adds to the evidence that the effect is real Yes it does work says   a research nutritionist with the University of California Davis He authored a recent   published in the   that concluded that cinnamon lowers fasting blood glucose According to our results its a modest effect of about  to  percent Davis says This is about the level of reduction found in the older generation of diabetes drugs he says That makes the findings of interest not just to the  million Americans who already have diabetes but also to the  million other people    of us  who have elevated fasting bloodglucose levels Doctors refer to this as prediabetes meaning blood sugar that doesnt meet the cutoff for a diagnosis of diabetes but that does indicate a high risk of developing the disease Theres also a recent   concluding that cinnamon can help lower lipid levels including LDL cholesterol the unhealthy type and triglycerides Whats not well understood is exactly how much cinnamon is optimal and whether the effect is transient Its hard to tell from the studies whether it leads to a significant longterm reduction in blood sugar For people who already have diabetes cinnamon is not an alternative to medication But for people with prediabetes who are interested in using diet to manage their blood sugar its one of many strategies worth considering says diabetes educator   of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston The evidence is still inconclusive Suhl notes but cinnamon is inexpensive and it tastes good So is there an ideal variety of cinnamon to be sprinkling into your oatmeal or blending into your spice rubs and salads Well as we   in The Salt cassia cinnamon is the variety you are most likely to encounter in a grocery store But cassia can contain high levels of coumarin a naturally occurring ingredient that when eaten in large enough amounts can cause reversible liver toxicity in a small group of individuals sensitive to it So the warning is for cinnamon lovers is to beware of excessive intake of cassia says diabetes educator Angela Ginn And   a researcher at the University of Mississippis School of Pharmacy who recently looked at the amounts of coumarin in cinnamonflavored foods in the US recently told The Salt that people who do want to use cinnamon for medicinal purposes should consult their doctor before taking large amounts Some experts suggest investing instead in Ceylon cinnamon a milder  and pricier  variety of the spice that comes from a tree distinct from but related to cassia How much cassia is too much For an adult who is sensitive to coumarin the limit is about a teaspoon a day according to the   set by the European Food Safety Authority So if youre a cinnamon lover and your goal is to increase your daily intake using Ceylon cinnamon can reduce the risk of consuming too much coumarin Another option cinnamon capsules In many of the studies evaluating the benefits of cinnamon researchers have used cinnamon supplements And as word has spread about the potential health benefits sales of supplements have grown  about  percent over the past few years totaling  million in  according to the   Yield  portions  pounds lamb loin  pound baby spinach  cup golden raisins  tablespoons preserved lemons chopped  tablespoon plus  teaspoon Saigon cinnamon  tablespoon ras el hanout  tablespoon sumac  cup olive oil  lemon juiced Method
