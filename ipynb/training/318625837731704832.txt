Weve heard many claims in the past decade  and much    about the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of conditions as varied as brittle bones heart disease cancer diabetes and dementia Now researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston have what they think may be another   Their study suggests moderate doses of vitamin D supplements might help reduce high blood pressure It was a small study in a particular group  roughly  AfricanAmerican adults AfricanAmericans have a much higher likelihood of being vitamin D deficient compared to other races and also a higher likelihood of having high blood pressure says nephrologist   who led the study   The   of high blood pressure are longestablished Among other complications hypertension in some people is thought to double the risk of having a heart attack or stroke Earlier studies in animals and people have hinted that vitamin D supplements might mitigate that cardiovascular risk for some Forman and his colleagues randomly divided their studys participants into four groups One group took  international units of vitamin D a day another group took  IU and another  The fourth group got a placebo no one at the time knew which dose theyd been given After three months of daily treatment Forman checked everyone for changes in blood pressure We found that vitamin D supplementation modestly but effectively lowered blood pressure he says And people who were taking a placebo had a slight increase in their blood pressure Specifically those taking the maximum dose   IU per day  saw a fourpoint drop in their   Thats the important top number in a blood pressure reading and represents the force of the blood pushing against the arteries as the heart beats Those taking lower doses of the vitamin experienced a smaller drop in blood pressure and those who got the placebo saw a point increase in systolic pressure Now a fourpoint drop in blood pressure isnt huge But   the effect holds up in bigger studies Forman says it might be important If vitamin D does lower blood pressure in AfricanAmericans it can have a significant public health impact Forman says adding that the finding may apply to other racial groups too The Brigham and Womens study wasnt designed to look into the physiology behind the effect though Forman says vitamin D might ease constriction of blood vessels or boost the kidneys ability to rid the body of salt  another known risk factor for hypertension We have been looking for reasons why vitamin D replacement seems to have a positive benefit in the cardiovascular arena says   a cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association And now here we have some clear evidence it actually lowers blood pressure Does that mean everyone should rush to the pharmacy to buy vitamin D supplements Not exactly says Bufalino Moderate doses in supplement form are benign he says and may be helpful for people whose blood levels of the vitamin are low But first check with your doctor who may give you a blood test to see if youre truly deficient While were waiting to see if the findings pan out in bigger studies Bufalino says there are already wellestablished steps that can ease wear and tear on arteries through changes in lifestyle Lowering salt intake caffeine weight getting more exercise  all are positive ways to impact blood pressure he says
