Recently I moved from Washington DC to San Francisco I drove the Southern route and decided to conduct an informal survey I asked folks I met along the way a question relevant to the health care reporting Ive been doing for the past five years What bugs you most about your medical care Few people I talked with  at gas stations coffee shops grocery stores parking lots bars and everywhere in between  even mentioned the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare by name But I heard again and again how health policy issues Ive been reporting on in Washington are affecting their lives What did I find out From coast to coast people told me that their health coverage and care are too expensive I wish it would be cheaper mainly  more affordable Ruben Irigoyen of Springerville Ariz told me Thats mainly my concern Everything is just very expensive especially in these small communities A few people were able to buy more affordable insurance on the new marketplaces created by the health law Im not really happy with how much things cost But I did get a plan through HealthCaregov and that helped a lot said Christa Sadler of Flagstaff Ariz But the United States continues to spend more on health care than any other country in the world And Angie Wilson of Nashville Tenn had experienced that firsthand Of course the cost is the big problem she told me The cost Its expensive Thats the main thing Hospitals across the country are seeking to improve medical care by getting primary care doctors specialists nurses and everyone in between to work together to coordinate the care of their patients Under the health law the government is penalizing hospitals if too many of their patients return quickly after being discharged Those readmissions are an expensive symptom of uncoordinated care But care coordination is still a work in progress I am very upset because my wife had major surgery last Thursday and they made her leave the hospital on Friday at  oclock at night and now shes back in the hospital because she shouldnt have left so early said Glenn Ferreri in Brandon Miss So Im unhappy about the health care regulations going on thats pushing people out so that we have to take care of them at home where the care should be at the hospitals Right now theres a big push to get computers and electronic health records in hospitals and doctors offices across the country Karen Greig of Menlo Park Calif says there are drawbacks for patients The way the computer in the examining room has come between me and the doctor Half the time they dont even look you in the eye because theyre busy typing away looking at the computer and youre wondering are they even hearing what Im saying Greig told me in a Flagstaff Ariz coffee shop People I talked with were worried about who would take care of them Will there be enough primary care doctors to meet demand from patients especially as more Americans get insurance coverage under the health law Hart Fortenbery in Lafayette La was particularly concerned about having to see a nurse practitioner instead of a doctor as more midlevel providers are taking on a bigger role in primary care What bugs me most about my medical care is the state of the doctors he said You cant see a doctor and if you do they got to see  goddamn people a day Theyre stressed overworked underpaid and you end up with a nurse practitioner whos able to write prescriptions At a gas station in Fenner Calif just miles from the Arizona border I met Dudley Pratt of Huntington Beach Calif He was riding his dirt bike across the Mojave Preserve Hes said hes a free spirit and its all the paperwork about health insurance that drives him nuts I can remember back in the s you would have like Blue Cross Blue Shield you go in and you hand them a card There was no paperwork or copays he said You just went to the ER or whatever Now it seems a lot more complicated And then were even a few people who  lo and behold  were actually happy with their medical care I met Don Chalmers of San Diego Calif at the same gas station in Fenner I will tell you I have always had good luck with my medical care he said Every time I went to the hospital I came out better than when I went in
