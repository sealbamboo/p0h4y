When Sally ONeills doctor told her she had an early form of cancer in one of her breasts she didnt agonize about what she wanted to The yearold mother of two young girls wanted a double mastectomy I decided at that moment that I wanted them both taken off says ONeill who lives in a suburb of Boston There wasnt a real lot of thought process to it I always thought If this happens to me this is what Im going to do Because Im not taking any chances I want the best possible outcome I dont want to do a waitandsee Today  years later ONeill has no regrets about what most people would consider a radical decision And as it turns out she was at the leading edge of a   ONeill had   The number of women who get double mastectomies because of DCIS is small  around one in  women see   But the rate has doubled in the past  years DCIS is an abnormality that most specialists call stage zero breast cancer  on a scale of  to  In many cases it doesnt ever progress to invasive cancer the type that can be lifethreatening These women are in a very different position than actress Angelina Joliewho recently chose to have a double mastectomy She has a gene mutation that gives her a very high risk of breast cancer   many of the women choosing double mastectomy have the same diagnosis as ONeill not Jolie The debate over appropriate treatment for DCIS is part of an even bigger debate about what many specialists call the over diagnosis of cancer especially cancers of the breast prostate and thyroid This means the discovery of growths that look like cancer but are not destined to cause the patient a problem if they go untreated The National Cancer Institute recently convened a group to look at overdiagnosis and overtreatment of cancer   a journal of the American Medical Association last week   of its conclusions Overdiagnosis is a product of widespread screening programs that look for cancers before they cause symptoms on the assumption that early treatment will invariably reduce the chance that a cancer will kill Theres growing evidence thats not necessarily true Routine mammography and PSA screening for prostate cancer are thought to reveal many malignancies that wouldnt show up otherwise And many doctors worry that a federal task forces new recommendation to increase   will also lead to overdiagnosis Stepping back further the issues of cancer over diagnosis and overtreatment are part of an even bigger concern about unnecessary medical care Its a problem NPR intends to explore in coming months as part of a series were calling Less Is More The series will focus on situations when less treatment may actually be better for patients DCIS is a touch point of the over diagnosis debate Nearly  women are diagnosed with it each year Before mammography screening only about  percent of breast cancers were DCIS Now the condition accounts for   of all breast cancers The reason for those quote marks is that while most cancer doctors view DCIS as a very early stage of breast cancer a growing number say it really shouldnt be called cancer at all DCIS is an overgrowth of cells within the lining of a womans milk ducts Such growths are not dangerous unless and until they break through and invade other breast tissue and ultimately spread to lymph nodes and other organs Many of these precancerous lesions are not going to go on to become cancer says   a breast cancer surgeon at the University of California San Francisco I dont think we should label it as cancer I think we should call it a ductal lesion I think people would be much more willing to be calm about it Well come back to Essermans ideas about how woman and their doctors should address DCIS But first lets go back to Sally ONeill her case capsulizes the dilemma Her decision to have a double mastectomy even though she had DCIS in only one breast was so radical that the first surgeon she consulted refused to do it without a letter from a psychiatrist His exact words were Youre cancerphobic she says So she found a different surgeon   at Massachusetts General Hospital When it comes to treating DCIS Hughes errs on the side of caution We dont know what percent are not deadly and we have no idea which patients do or do not have a deadly form of cancer Hughes says So as a surgeon I need to treat every cancer as if it might be deadly because I dont know which ones are and which ones arent Hughes does not advocate removing a healthy breast that doesnt have any DCIS But hell do it if he thinks a woman wants it for the right reasons If they want to take the opposite breast off to never experience breast cancer again that  is a good reason to do it Hughes says If they are taking their opposite breast off so they will live longer thats not a good reason to take the opposite breast off This is a critical point Many women  perhaps assuming all breast cancers are dangerous  may believe that removing the healthy breast after a diagnosis of DCIS improves their chances of survival But DCIS is nearly  percent curable Typically the treatment is a small operation called   often but not always followed by radiation to the area About a quarter of women with DCIS have a single mastectomy usually because the abnormal growth occupies too great a percentage of the breast to make lumpectomy feasible The chance of DCIS later appearing in the opposite breast is not precisely known but is thought to be well under  percent per year And Hughes points out that if DCIS does appear in the second breast  or even if invasive cancer turns up it would likely be highly curable too We normally find it at a very early very curable stage Hughes says We very seldom have patients die from cancer in the opposite breast Some say concern about survival is not the only thing thats driving some women to seek a double mastectomy Patients may be distressed about the experience of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment and have a very strong aversion to going through it again Seema Khan of Northwestern University writes in a   in the   Whatever their reasons some patients and some doctors are pushing back against what they consider too much treatment for DCIS Peggy MacDonald of Portland Ore is one of those patients She was stunned after she recently got a diagnosis of DCIS and discovered that all the doctors she saw thought she should have surgery to remove it  right away Quite honestly she says I just didnt like the options being presented to me It didnt  make sense to me None of the surgeons recommended that MacDonald should remove her healthy breast but all agreed she should have surgery She was almost ready to give in when one of her sisters sent her an article quoting Esserman the San Francisco breast surgeon MacDonald made an appointment to see Esserman and discovered a different approach She said OK Ive looked at your MRI Ive looked at your mammograms Ive looked at your blood tests Heres what I will tell you  this is not an emergency and you have options MacDonald says Esserman stresses theres no need for women to rush into surgery after a DCIS diagnosis I think we all need to take a step back and not be so hysterical Esserman says When I see people whove been told theyve got to make a decision within two weeks thats just crazy No one has shown a progression from DCIS to invasive cancer in a twoweek period of time  ever After seeing Esserman MacDonald decided not to have surgery at least for now Instead the doctor put her on   McDonald now takes a drug that blocks estrogen Because her DCIS cells are fueled by estrogen the hope is that once they are starved of the hormone the cells will shrink and perhaps even disappear MacDonald says she realizes she may end up needing surgery anyway but if so shell be clearer about the decision Shes hoping her case will turn out like another of Essermans patients Barbara Mann Mann took an estrogenblocking medication as well for six months Today an MRI scan and biopsy show no trace of DCIS in her breast Its amazing Mann says Its not even a case of lessismore This is a case of lessisbest I am just hugely relieved absolutely thrilled And what I would really like is for every other woman in my position to know this is an option But its an option that will require lifelong vigilance Anyone who chooses not to have surgery will have to be watched carefully and have routine mammograms and maybe even MRI scans and biopsies And women who choose this alternate route must be willing to live with the risk however tiny that DCIS might return and might turn into invasive cancer
