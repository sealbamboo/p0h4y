Theres a new phase of Ebola in Liberia Epidemiologists call it pingponging Back in March the disease was found in the rural areas Then as people came to the capital to seek care it started growing exponentially there Now some sick people are going back to their villages and the disease has pingponged to the rural areas again So thats where were headed  into the hot thick jungle of Liberia to investigate a new Ebola hotspot Our day with the team of Ebola investigators starts at  am The team has been told theres a woman with   out there who hasnt been treated She could be spreading the disease We drive five hours from Liberias capital   and stop at a small rural clinic that looks something more like a house with a few rooms and no electricity The team has people from the World Health Organization the African Union Doctors Without Borders and the Liberian Ministry of Health At the clinic the head nurse says she has also heard the rumors of a sick woman But the nurse hasnt seen her The nurse shows us a handdrawn map on the wall of where we need to go to find the woman Our destination she says is a village called Fermaneeta Its the last village at the end of a thin black line on the map A thin black line means the only way to get there is to walk down a long footpath into the jungle Fours hours each way As we walk Mutaawe Lubogo from the African Union says there are several options for the woman if she has symptoms If shes very sick they can help set up a community quarantine in the village and try to come back the next day with supplies If the woman is still in the early stages of Ebola she can walk back to the clinic where an ambulance can pick her up Lubogo is from Uganda and worked on the  Ebola outbreak there Youre talking to someone who has seen it before Lubogo says But in Uganda Ebola was confined to the rural areas and thats where it ended In Liberia theres pingponging If I fall sick I have to come to the rural area where I have my parents to my family to give me care Lubogo says This is how pingponging works he says People go back and forth between the city where theres commerce and the village where theres family And a few of them take Ebola with them Out where were walking a village is basically a clearing in the jungle with  or  huts The walls of the huts are made of mud the roofs are made of branches and leaves Each village has a well a fire pit for cooking and small fields nearby to grow food Each village is about an hour from the next one At the fourth one we find a clue The team meets a man who people say is a traditional healer  he rubs herbs on sick people He supposedly cared for the woman whos rumored to have Ebola The team lists off the names of people who have tested positive for Ebola The man says he knows a lot of them But he denies that hes a healer He wont even admit that he has touched or treated any of them This is called   If youre doing it in   Texas you get addresses and phone numbers Out here its different We leave the man and keep on walking We finally make it to the village where the woman is supposed to be At first the village is pretty quiet Theres laundry drying in the sun People start to gather around the team They put their hands in the air as if theyre being accused of something Then they all start talking at once The group is standing in front of a wooden door to a hut where the woman whos thought to have Ebola stays The door is closed No one is opening the door The people in the village say the woman is gone Many members of the Ebola team think the villagers are hiding something Maybe the sick woman is behind that door Maybe she has already died If she has or had Ebola in any case she is very contagious Emmanuel Dweh one of the team leaders warns people not to hide a sick person If they do he says they will get sick themselves But the people are adamant that the woman isnt there After that theres not much more for the team to do So we start back out into the jungle Its four more hours back to the clinic On the way we pick up the man thought to be the traditional healer because he treated and touched people with Ebola He has agreed to come with us We have to make the monkey bridge by dark Dweh keeps telling us Thats the last bridge the biggest bridge Its two bamboo poles over a dark muddy river Once we get to the clinic the plan is to have an ambulance take the alleged traditional healer to a stadium where health workers monitor people who might have Ebola If he doesnt show signs of Ebola after  days hell be let go But that night the road to the clinic goes out and the ambulance cant reach the traditional healer The man who might have Ebola goes back to his village This is why its so difficult to stop Ebola These places are very hard to reach The roads are bad Theres no electricity no phone coverage And once you finally get to where youre going you have no idea what youre going to find
