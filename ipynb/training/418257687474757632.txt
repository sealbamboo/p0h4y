WASHINGTONâ€”Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor late Tuesday ordered a temporary halt to the Obama administration's enforcement of the federal health-care law's contraception requirements in a case brought by nonprofit Roman Catholic homes for the aged.. The move brings the high court into another dispute involving the 2010 Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers include free contraception in health plans offered to employees.
