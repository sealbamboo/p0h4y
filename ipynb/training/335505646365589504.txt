When the American Psychiatric Association releases its new     this weekend lots of journalists and commentators will refer to it as psychiatrys bible   Thats a term that makes the manuals authors and other mental experts cringe   Bible implies that its been handed down by some deity as the absolute truth says   a psychiatrist at Columbia University whos had a hand in the past two revisions of the   We dont consider this to be a bible Its a guidebook   Dr   director of the National Institute of Mental Health also wants people to know the   isnt some sacred text Its a dictionary not a bible he says   The   has taken on biblical proportions over the years because its list of several hundred disorders is often used to decide whether a particular behavior is abnormal and insurance will cover a problem   for example has provoked lots of debate about new diagnoses like Binge Eating Disorder or Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder in children   But insurance coverage and defining whats normal are not why the   was created It was created to solve a communication problem   Before   came along in  It was really chaotic Insel says We had no common language for describing mental disorders The new manual provided clear definitions for the first time he says so that when one person says major depressive disorder another person will know what that is   Revisions since then have updated those definitions and added or eliminated diagnoses based on the latest research First says The   is a synthesis of the best knowledge at this moment in time he says So   is the culmination of research in the past  years   That makes the   a tool used by clinicians to take care of patients not a bible First says   Insel adds that the   only becomes a problem when mental health professionals forget that and start looking at the manual instead of listening to their patients Thats never a good outcome
