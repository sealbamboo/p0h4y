So your body mass index says youre obese but you dont have prediabetes  a mix of factors such as hypertension high cholesterol and high glucose levels that indicates youre on the road to metabolic illness And youre thinking youve beaten the odds right Wait  years a new study says Odds are youll be proven wrong New research finds that even when a person is metabolically healthy being obese raises his or her risk for cardiovascular disease and premature death It just takes a study that tracks subjects for  years or more to pick it up says the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine The metaanalysis  a study that aggregates the findings of many welldesigned studies in an effort to distill larger truths  appears to dash hopes that for some obesity can be a perfectly healthy state In recent years a welter of research has suggested that the ills long linked to obesity  cardiovascular disease Type  diabetes and certain cancers  might stem not from obesity itself but from metabolic dysfunction a condition more common in the obese but by no means universal among those with a BMI over  Those findings had fueled resistance to the nationwide assault on obesity from those who argued they were fat but fit The latest study does less damage to the growing suspicion that its OK to be overweight  with a body mass index between  and   if youre metabolically healthy On average cardiovascular disease and death from any cause was not higher among the overweightbutmetabolicallyhealthy than it was for those of normal weight who were metabolically healthy But even those findings left the question open There was a trend in that direction But it was not so robust that the researchers could be confident it wasnt a statistical fluke In the end that trend may be the most significant finding of all When researchers used BMI to line up all of the  subjects who participated in the eight studies they pooled they found that as BMI rose so rose blood pressure waist circumference and insulin resistance As BMI increased levels of HDL cholesterol thought to protect against heart attack and stroke decreased Though overweight and obese subjects may not yet have reached the points that define metabolic illness they appeared to be on that road as their weight rose Increased BMI is not a benign condition even in the absence of metabolic abnormalities the authors said Take note however The newest study does not give normal weight people a pass if they are metabolically unhealthy In this aggregation of subjects from many different studies the authors found that this group is just as likely as those who are obese and metabolically unhealthy to have a stroke or heart attack or die of any cause  a surprise since it has long been assumed that the combination of obesity and metabolic dysfunction confers the greatest risk
