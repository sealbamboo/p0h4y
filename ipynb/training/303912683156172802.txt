 A protective effect in females may help explain one of the biggest mysteries of   A new preliminary study suggests that developing females are much better able than males to fight off genetic pressure to develop symptoms of autism The findings arent definitive and dont point to a treatment or cure Still first steps like this are important and could lead to greater understanding of autism said study lead author Elise Robinson an instructor in the department of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston An estimated  in  children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder The condition which can range from mild to severe is characterized by impaired communication and social interaction Prevalence of autism is increasing in the United States although its not clear if thats largely because theres more awareness of the disorder According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention boys are almost five times more likely than girls to have a form of the disorder   in  boys compared to  in  girls There are many theories about why this autism gender gap exists One idea is that males are threatened in the womb by exposure to testosterone the male hormone Another theory holds that females might be somehow inherently better protected against the threat of the condition This may fit in with the idea that males are weaker in the womb than females Boys are generally more prone to develop neurological disorders than girls noted Dr Andrew Zimmerman director of clinical trials at the Lurie Center for Autism at Massachusetts General Hospital We poor males are vulnerable he said Girls have two X chromosomes so if theres a problem on one they have a spare On the other hand males have one X chromosome and a Y chromosome that has very few genes added Zimmerman who was not involved in the study In the new study published online Feb  in   researchers aimed to figure out how   The study authors looked at more than  pairs of nonidentical twins from Great Britain and more than  pairs of nonidentical twins from Sweden They then tried to figure out how a   not diagnosed autism itself affected the twins They found evidence that it takes greater family risk  meaning a higher genetic load  for a girl to develop autism symptoms In other words girls appeared to be more resilient against the threat of autism symptoms compared to boys Theres more pressure on them to get it and once they get it its more obvious than in their relatives said Zimmerman Genetics researchers should spend more time studying families with autistic girls in order to better understand the disorder the research team concluded This genderspecific research might also help identify ways to prevent autism they said
