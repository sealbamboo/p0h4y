Call me nuts but I want to talk more about sleeping pill use Hold your fire for a few paragraphs please Just a week after I posted here about medical efforts to    causing a flurry of comments many taking exception to the whole idea as condescending or dismissive of the miseries of insomnia  researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Johns Hopkins published findings that reinforce concerns about these drugs I say reinforce because geriatricians and other physicians have   about the use of sedativehypnotic medications including  benzodiazepines like Ativan Klonopin Xanax and Valium and the related Zdrugs like Ambien for treating insomnia Im not comfortable writing a prescription for these medications said Dr Cara Tannenbaum the geriatrician at the University of Montreal who led   I havent prescribed a sedativehypnotic in  years In  the American Geriatrics Society put sedativehypnotics on its first   of Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question citing heightened fall and fracture risks and automobile accidents in older patients who took them Now the CDC has reported that   in general and zolpidem  Ambien  in particular Theyre implicated in  adult ER visits annually because of adverse reactions the study found more than  percent of those visits result in hospital admissions Among those taking sedatives and anxietyreducing drugs a lot of visits were because people were too sleepy or hard to arouse or confused said the lead author Dr Lee Hampton a medical officer at the CDC And there were also a lot of falls The data also answer questions readers here raised about whether older adults were being singled out Did doctors or did I consider them unable to make rational drug decisions Is it that older people are less important full stop reader L from New York City demanded The CDC looked at visits by drug and by age Older patients it turns out did not show up more often in emergency rooms because of adverse reactions to sedatives and antianxiety drugs People ages  to  have the highest number of visits in proportion to prescriptions for those medicines But the consequences were worse for older people About a third of those older than   percent who went to ERs with adverse responses to sedatives were hospitalized compared with about  percent of those   to  and  percent of those   to  The data also showed that Ambien the use of which has soared in recent years accounted for one in five ER visits among those older than  more than any other medication  I didnt expect a single drug to stand out that much Dr Hampton said That may be because Medicare didnt cover benzodiazepines  but did cover zolpidem  from the inception of Part D in  until last year when the policy changed The Food and Drug Administration concerned about   last year halved the recommended dose for women to  milligrams from  milligrams and to  milligrams from  milligrams for extendedrelease versions like Ambien CR The other particular concern for older people is falls a leading cause of death and disability A   says  percent of community dwelling Medicare beneficiaries older than  excluding nursing home residents fell in a year The CDC estimates that   Twenty to  percent of those falls result in injuries that require medical attention Theres a constellation of risks that contribute to falls and medications are clearly part of it said Dr Jerry H Gurwitz a geriatrician at the University of Massachusetts Medical School  who has studied drug safety in older people And high on the list of those medications related to falls and fallrelated injuries are sedativehypnotics On to some other questions readers raised First for those who objected to collectively referring to benzo and nonbenzo sedatives and not honoring the differences between them as Kathy from Hawaii said The Zdrugs are approved only as sleep aids Benzodiazepines have other uses like treating panic disorders or seizures some people may be taking them throughout the day not only at bedtime But as sleeping pills I wouldnt consider them distinct at all Dr Gurwitz said of the benzos and Zdrugs When youre talking about falls and fractures its the same effectThe risks are the same Dr Tannenbaum concurred Can patients gradually wean themselves from sedatives using a chart like the one in the   Dr Tannenbaum and colleagues sent patients In their study which looked only at benzodiazepine use the brochure urged recipients to consult health care professionals before embarking on detoxification Of the group that attempted to gradually stop the drug more than half succeeded and another  percent reduced their dosage Among those who didnt make the attempt the greatest reason  get this  was discouragement from their physicians or pharmacists Often in medicine the quickest and easiest thing doctors can do is write a prescription Dr Hampton said Things that take longer and require more conversation are used less Yet those remedies  changing sleep habits seeking cognitive behavioral therapy  have been found   The physicians I consulted urged patients to seek a comprehensive evaluation possibly including sleep studies and then try   first turning to sleeping pills only after exhausting the alternatives JAMA published   last year A final caveat Yes older people are different A yearold speedwalker has a different risk profile from an yearold with poor vision or osteoporosis But the physicians I consulted couldnt countenance extended sedative use even for the former
