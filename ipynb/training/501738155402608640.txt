Good morning. Ed Silverman is on vacation this week, but we’re still reading. Our beverage of choice this a.m — English Breakfast tea with lemon. (Sorry, Ed). Here’s a look at the latest news:.  The feds started their investigations after receiving a complaint from a medical professor who claimed that data from a key clinical trial, called PLATO, may have been manipulated. The professor in particular questioned the high number of deaths in the study’s control group, whose patients took an older clot-busting drug, Plavix. AstraZeneca said the Justice Department confirmed that its probe has ended, and that it isn’t planning any further action.
