 Taking steps to beat cancer could mean literally taking steps according to a new study published in the   Researchers at the Thomas Jefferson University School of Nursing in Philadelphia report that patients who participate in a regular walking regimen after surgery for   may experience fewer symptoms of fatigue and pain than their lessactive peers  is a common and very serious problem for people with cancer affecting up to  percent of survivors says the National Cancer Institute Sometimes its overlooked as normal and people tend to write it off study author Theresa Yeo PhD said in a press release about the research But this is not the normal Istayeduptoolate fatigue Its really being exhausted and it doesnt go away with sleep It hits patients in their daily activities  simple things like doing your personal hygiene in the morning getting up and getting dressed going from the bedroom to wherever you eat breakfast Its debilitating sometimes to the extent that the person affected develops depression or anxiety which can in turn hinder his or her   Conventional thinking says that if youre tired you should rest but experts say the opposite may be true even  or perhaps especially  for people being treated for cancer To test this theory Dr Yeo and colleagues recruited more than  survivors of pancreatic or periampullary cancer cancer that forms near the ducts connecting the liver pancreas and small intestine After controlling for other factors  such as age race chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes and stage at diagnosis  the team randomly assigned each participant to one of two groups The first group was discharged from the hospital with standard care instructions that did not include recommendations for exercise The second group was put on a program that involved walking for increasingly long intervals each week for three months beginning with minute walks and then eventually working up to  to  minutes of walking time a week Anyone experiencing discomfort or shortness of breath was told to slow down or stop The beauty of this program is that were not asking for highintensity aerobics or a target heart rate Dr Yeo said Its low to moderate intensity and people can sit if they need to They dont have to push through it if they are not feeling well that day Researchers checked in with patients each month to gauge their adherence to the program their levels of fatigue and pain and whether they had any other symptoms such as diarrhea insomnia or depression They also asked individuals to keep logs of their walks When the study started  percent of patients had moderate to severe fatigue Three months later however those in the walking group had experienced a  percent improvement in their condition compared with  percent improvement among the control group The walkers also reported feeling less pain than the nonwalkers The message in   has typically been that these patients are just too sick to do this but thats not true anymore Yeo explained adding that walking is something almost everyone can do regardless of their fitness level or resources With increased surgical expertise and the use of postoperative critical care pathways also called care maps more patients are feeling better sooner and going home earlier after their operations There is no reason that patients cant become active even if they did not exercise before
