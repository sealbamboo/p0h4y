 A noninvasive device that electrically stimulates the trigeminal nerve prevented migraines for patients whose episodes were not well controlled by medication alone a trial showed The number of days with a migraine dropped significantly by about two per month in the supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation group without a change in the sham control group Jean Schoenen MD PhD of Belgiums Lige University and colleagues found While the difference between the two didnt reach statistical significance the coprimary endpoint showed three times more responders with at least a  percent drop in migraine days with neurostimulation the group reported in the Feb  issue of   The therapeutic gain  percent is within the range of those reported for other preventive drug and nondrug antimigraine treatments they wrote An accompanying editorial called for further study due to some issues with the trial particularly whether blinding was good enough The  mA electrical pulses delivered by the device at  Hz intervals would be easy to feel if patients touched the electrodes whereas the  mA  Hzsham stimuli would be barely noticeable noted Eishi Asano MD PhD of Wayne State University in Detroit and Peter J Goadsby MD PhD of the University of California San Francisco Taken together this study has provided Class III evidence that neurostimulation with this device is effective and safe as a preventive therapy for migraine they concluded The PREMICE trial Prevention of Migraine using the STS Cefaly randomized  adults with at least two migraine attacks per month regardless of aura at five Belgian tertiary headache clinics to wear the sham or real device for  minutes daily for  months The Cefaly device consists of an eye glassesstyle band with a selfadhesive electrode above the bridge of the nose covering the supratrochlear and supraorbital branches of the trigeminal nerve In an attempt to minimize unblinding patients werent asked what the stimulation with their device felt like werent enrolled if they were acquainted with another participant and were kept from contact with each other during office visits so they wouldnt have a chance to compare The sham group had a  percent drop in migraine days in the first month of treatment similar to the active treatment group but that effect disappeared thereafter By month  the mean number of migraine days in the neurostimulation group had fallen  percent to an average of  versus  per month during the runin phase That the reduction in migraine days after effective supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation treatment just failed to reach the level of significance compared to sham stimulation may be due to the fact that the study was powered for responder rates not for reduction in migraine days the researchers suggested Results didnt differ by migraine aura status By comparison the migraine prevention drug topiramate Topamax reduced monthly migraine days by  percent and monthly migraine attacks by  percent with a  percent responder rate of  percent across its clinical trials Responder rates for other anticonvulsants propranolol Inderal and behavioral therapy are in the same range as for the neurostimulation device Since supraorbital transcutaneous stimulation therapy seems to be effective and well tolerated it can be combined with drug treatments without risking cumulative adverse effects Schoenens group pointed out No adverse events or side effects occurred in either group The researchers acknowledged partial unblinding as a potential limitation of the study as well as the younger age and shorter duration of migraine in the treatment group Source
