It may seem counterintuitive but theres a body of evidence to suggest that the millions of Americans with a diet soda habit may not be doing their waistlines  or their blood sugar  any favors As the consumption of diet drinks made with artificial sweeteners   researchers are beginning to make some uncomfortable associations with weight gain and other diseases For instance as researcher   writes in a new opinion piece published in the journal   accumulating evidence suggests that frequent consumers of these sugar substitutes such as aspartame sucralose and saccharin may also be at increased risk of  metabolic syndrome type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease If you listen to my conversation on   youll hear that there are two schools of thought here Not everyone is convinced that diet soda is so bad For instance a   I reported on last year by researchers at Boston Childrens Hospital found that overweight teens did well when they switched from sugarladen drinks to zerocalorie options such as diet soda But its also hard to ignore the gathering body of evidence that points to potentially bad outcomes associated with a diet soda habit One example the findings of the   which pointed to a strong link between diet soda consumption and weight gain over time On average for each diet soft drink our participants drank per day they were  percent more likely to become overweight during the next seven to eight years said Sharon Fowler in a release announcing the findings several years back Another bit of evidence A multiethnic   which included some  men and women found that diet soda consumption was linked to a significantly increased risk of both type diabetes and metabolic syndrome   So what gives How could consuming less sugar set the stage for more weight gain and an increased risk of disease Well since being overweight is a major contributor to the development of type  diabetes its possible that some dietsoda drinkers suffer from a mindset problem They justify eating lots of highcalorie foods because their drinks are caloriefree Its the hey Ill go ahead and have those fries and a cheeseburger since Im having a Diet Coke mentality Its also possible that something much more complicated and nuanced is happening in the bodies and brains of diet soda drinkers As Swithers points out Frequent consumption of highintensity artificial sweeteners may have the counterintuitive effect of inducing metabolic derangements Say what Metabolic derangements One theory is that diet soda may throw off the metabolism by blunting the bodys responses to sugar You see from the moment sugar touches our lips our bodies start to release hormones to begin processing the sugar Its part of a feedback loop that helps the body predict whats coming But if we develop a habit of consuming artificial sugar our bodies may get confused And it might not respond the same when we consume real sugar We may no longer release the hormones needed to process sugar  or at least not as much of them as before Swithers told me during an interview And researchers think this change in hormone levels could contribute to increases in how much we eat says Swithers as well as to bigger spikes in our blood sugar which may be related to things like diabetes Now Swithers says much more research is needed to nail down whats happening when people consume artificial sweeteners What is clear is that diet soda consumption continues to rise Women tend to lead the way and increasingly   are popping open the caloriefree sodas that mom and dad are drinking After we published our post we received this statement from the American Beverage Association
