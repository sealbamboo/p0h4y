Plenty of us got our fill of greencolored food on St Patricks Day   anyone But for some people associating taste with color is more than just a onceayear experience These people have    a neurological condition in which stimulation of one sense eg taste produces experiences in a totally different sense eg sight According to researcher   approximately one in  people has some form of synesthesia Weve   this phenomenon in the past And Im a synesthete myself  I see letters and numbers in color and associate sounds with shapes and textures But only a very few people  maybe only  percent of synesthetes  have sensory crossovers that affect their relationship with food and drink Jaime Smith is one of those people Hes a sommelier by trade and he has a rare gift He smells in colors and shapes For Smith who lives in Las Vegas a white wine like Nosiola has a beautiful aquamarine flowy kind of wavy color to it Other smells also elicit threedimensional textures and colors on what he describes as a projector in his minds eye This added dimension Smith says enhances his ability to appraise and analyze wines I feel that I have an advantage over a lot of people particularly in a field where youre judged on how good of a smeller you are he says Atlantabased pastry chef Taria Camerino also has synesthesia But for her synesthesia is more than just an advantage  its a necessity Camerino experiences the world through taste She tastes music colors shapes and even peoples emotions She says she has a hard time remembering what things look or sound like but she can immediately identify objects based on their synesthetic flavors I dont know what a box looks like unless its in front of me I dont know what the color green looks like But I know what green tastes like she says In addition to working as a pastry chef Camerino is often asked by clients to make dishes that mimic her synesthetic experiences She creates flavor profiles of things like   and   She takes inspiration from music to put together ninecourse tastings featuring dishes like mossflavored cotton candy and oyster ceviche I move through the world this way all the time she explains If I want someone to understand it I have to create a dish out of it I have to make it palatable A synesthete himself Sean Day is president of the   and has been tracking research on this condition for more than three decades He runs a popular international   on the topic Summarizing the state of   Day says the brains of synesthetes do appear to be   although he cautions that scientists have only studied a few types of synesthesia so far In particular it seems that the neural connections between different sensory parts of the brain are more   in people with synesthesia Myelin is a fatty sheath that surrounds neurons and enables neural signals to travel more quickly Because the myelination is different the interaction between certain parts of the brain is different explains Day This allows parts of the brain that are responsible for different senses to communicate when they normally wouldnt Hypermyelination could explain why synesthetic experiences seem so real for people like British IT consultant   who is also the president of the   Wannerton has a particularly intrusive form of synesthesia in which sounds words and colors all have taste and texture Its like having an eyedropper of taste sort of dripped on your tongue constantly just one after another after another he explains Its a full mouth feel Its exactly like Im eating something Even Wannertons brain gets fooled I wouldnt know what a hunger pang is because I dont get hungry he says My brain is constantly pumping acid into my stomach to dissolve food that isnt there Synesthesia affects his social life too Eating out for example is a nightmare Different voices the ambient atmosphere in the restaurant it all makes a difference to my experience says Wannerton You serve me food on a blue plate  it just totally messes up the eating sensation And some peoples names arent very pleasant either If I dont like somebodys name  I wont like them very much he explains unabashedly My name Audrey for example tastes strongly of tinned tomatoes If I actually had to speak with you every day Id try and shorten your name somehow Wannerton tells me But even though his synesthesia can be quite disruptive at times its absolutely ludicrous he admits at the end of the day Wannerton still enjoys it And most synesthetes would agree including sommelier Jaime Smith My synthie thing is the added bonus for me he says Its the joy and sometimes the fun of it all
