These hearty vegetarian meals in a bowl or on a plate are inspired by the Korean dish bibimbap I call them Big Bowls because they are also inspired by a popular food truck Ive eaten at in Portland Ore whose only offering is called Whole Bowl and is a comforting bowl of brown rice with black beans salsa avocado and queso blanco The long line of people I observed at this truck confirmed for me the fact that a simple satisfying meal with grain protein and terrific vegetables can be worth standing in line for  Each dish this week consists of a combination of a whole grain and vegetable preparation with protein in the form of tofu beans or cheese Sometimes the vegetables are as simple as cabbage kimchi which I buy at Korean markets or at Trader Joes accompanied by roasted red peppers and a delicious marinated misoglazed ovenbaked tofu Id be happy to accompany any vegetable with that tofu if the dish has Asian overtones I used bean and vegetable combos to accommodate Mediterranean grains farro bulgur in one of my Mediterranean bowls And I made a delicious millet polenta which I also accompanied with Mediterraneanstyle vegetables eggplant tomatoes and chick peas in one dish mushrooms in another Feel free to mix and match add a poached egg if you wish or a salsa or even some meat But keep the focus on the grains and vegetables
