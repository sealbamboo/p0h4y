A trial has begun to see whether a drug used to treat diabetes can slow the progression of Alzheimers disease   The study will involve  patients with memory problems due to early Alzheimers Laboratory research suggests that the drug liraglutide reduces brain inflammation improving the growth of brain cells and the connections between them Patients will be recruited in London  at Imperial College and Kings College   and sites in Oxford Southampton and Swindon One of those on the trial is yearold Geoff Payne  He became concerned about shortterm memory loss three years ago and was eventually diagnosed with Alzheimers    My older brother died of Alzheimers at the age of  he said His disease was spotted quite late and I remember him being almost entirely silent and withdrawn at family gatherings    I wish Id tried to talk more to him about it  When I finally got my diagnosis it confirmed my own suspicions  I have had the disease for three years but fortunately I have not yet declined substantially   My wife and I know what to expect in the years ahead so we take one day at a time  Hopefully this drug may help  Those on the trial will receive a daily injection of liraglutide or a placebo for  months  They will have scans and memory tests before and after the treatment Its a decade since the last new treatment for Alzheimers was introduced and some major drug trials have failed in recent years New drugs can take decades to filter through and cost billions said Dr Paul Edison Imperial College London whos leading the trial  Liraglutide is a tried and tested diabetes treatment so we know it is safe  This trial will show within three years whether it can slow the progression of Alzheimers  Alzheimers Society is providing more than  towards the project  Dr Doug Brown Director of Research and Development said This exciting study suggests that one of these drugs can reverse the biological causes of Alzheimers even in the late stages and demonstrates were on the right track  We are now funding a major new trial to bring it closer to a position where it can be improving the lives of people with dementia The need for more research and new treatments will be the key focus of the in London on Wednesday   The Department of Health says health ministers will discuss how they can coordinate and accelerate efforts and try to break down barriers between companies researchers and clinicians Dementia is already a significant global issue and cases are predicted to rise from  million to  million by   a reflection of the growing and ageing global population   It is thought to cost the global economy bn bn each year and there are concerns that future demands could overwhelm some health services
