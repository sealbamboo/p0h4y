Where you work can be an excellent predictor of your health happiness and stress levels A recent Gallup poll demonstrates the extent to which workers in different professions tend to have similar levels of overall wellbeing According to the  results of the GallupHealthways WellBeing Index physicians had the highest level of wellbeing of any major profession while transportation workers including drivers pilots flight attendants and air traffic controllers had the lowest GallupHealthways asked more than  workers a series of  questions covering physical and emotional health life evaluation and workplace environment Gallup assigned a score between  to  to each of  major professional categories with  representing ideal wellbeing Based on Gallups score these are the most and least satisfied professions While each of the  questions had some impact on the professions final wellbeing score certain measures highly contribute to workers health These include such factors as getting regular exercise not smoking learning something new every day and being treated well by their employers to name a few In an interview with  Wall St Dan Witters research director for the GallupHealthways WellBeing Index explained that the professions with high levels of obesity and related conditions like heart attacks and chronic physical pain were more likely to have much lower overall wellbeing Just  percent of physicians were considered obese compared to the more than  percent of transportation workers The majority of health insurance coverage in the United States is provided by employers resulting in some dramatic differences between professions Virtually all physicians surveyed  percent reported having health insurance while just  percent of transportation workers could say the same Witters explained that health insurance besides making people more likely to receive treatment they need has a lot of influence on the proactive nature of which people tend to their health Conventional wisdom suggests that working long hours has longterm negative mental and physical health effects In fact Witters explained the data do not support this While working long hours can lead to stress many of the jobs with the longest hours including doctors professionals such as lawyers and engineers and business owners have among the highest levels of wellbeing One reason for this Witters noted is that long hours translate to higher income in these positions Higher income he explained has a very high correlation with wellbeing as it gives people access to basic needs One group that may surprise some with its high level of wellbeing is teachers which ranked only behind physicians for wellbeing Teachers are a lot higher than a lot of people would guess They are good eaters their obesity while too high is well below the national average and they have good workplace wellbeing They get to use their strengths a lot  Wall St reviewed the  professional categories surveyed by the GallupHealthways WellBeing Index in  On top of calculating an overall national level of wellbeing the index also calculates the wellbeing for each profession assigning scores from  to
