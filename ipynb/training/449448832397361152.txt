With this years deadline to register for individual health insurance just a weekend away much attention is being lavished on two numbers  the   who have signed up so far and the percentage of those folks who are or arent young But experts say the  numbers actually dont mean very much These are really statebased markets says Caroline Pearson vice president at   a consulting firm based in Washington DC Because each insurance market is run within each individual state big numbers in some states cant make up for shortfalls in others Still much of the debate has centered around  million  the nationwide number the   estimated would sign up for insurance through the federal and state health exchanges Thats indeed about how many have   the Obama administration confirmed Thursday Insurers hope that at least   of those enrollees will be between the ages of  and  The theory is that those younger people will also be healthier and offset the costs of people who are older and sicker  Six million and the percent of young adults are easy numbers for politics and politics sometimes struggles with the more nuanced issues that really matter for the underlying policy says Pearson explaining at least some of the fixation on national numbers Meanwhile Seth Chandler who teaches insurance law at the   says some states are doing quite well at signing people up such as California New York Connecticut Vermont California alone has enrolled more than   in private health plans New York has   But at the same time Chandler says other states are lagging seriously behind including the big state of Texas and states such as Louisiana Arizona Mississippi and Oklahoma The fact that New York doesnt experience problems in its health insurance market and insurers arent being squeezed there he says does nothing whatsoever to help insurers and people in Texas Louisiana and elsewhere where  it looks like at least  too few people are enrolling to enable us to have confidence in the success of the marketplace And its not just an issue of the total number of people signing up in each state or whether theyre young or old Karen Ignagni who leads the insurance trade group   says the real issue is the balance of healthy to sick individuals She said in a   last week that health plans are already seeing an influx of sicker people thanks to new rules that bar health plans from discriminating against people who have preexisting health conditions We see a number of people who have gotten into the program in January in particular who are using a number of health care services she said Thats to be expected No one in our industry thought it would be any different We thought the people who needed services immediately would be the first to be motivated to sign up The big question says Ignagni is whether the lastminute   that appears to be taking place now will be big enough and full of the right kind of people We thought the people who were healthier who didnt feel like they needed services immediately would be signing up at the end of the process she said And were hoping that hypothesis is going to be true But theres yet another factor the overall numbers dont take into account the expectations of insurance companies when they set their premiums for this first year Was the pricing any good to begin with asks Chandler the Houston law professor Were they too conservative in their estimates of the population Were they too liberal There are all these factors that we do not know yet that are going to determine as much as the raw enrollment numbers how insurers react for  In other words the bottom line on what happens to individual insurance markets in each state after this first open enrollment season is going to depend on a lot more than just one or two numbers
