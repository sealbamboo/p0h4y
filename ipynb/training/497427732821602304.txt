Tampose Mapotheng has a cold His lymph nodes are swollen and its a bit uncomfortable for him to talk in the airconditioned hotel in Washington DC where he is attending a conference But when I ask him to tell me about himself Mapothengs voice grows strong with a composure that belies his  years Im from Lesotho Mapotheng says assuredly Im a human rights defender Im a transsexual man These three facts sum up the life and goals of the slight young man who was born female and who traveled to America for the first time in July Hes part of the Young African Leaders Initiative YALI which invited community organizers to learn leadership and organization skills at American universities While most participants in the program are interested in economic development Mapothengs passion is human rights specifically for the lesbiangaybisexualtransintersex LGBTI community Ever since he was a child Mapotheng had nagging doubts about being a girl Its only been for four years that Mapotheng has both publicly and personally identified as a man and he acknowledges he has much to learn about who he really is A key reason for this relatively late awakening he says is a lack of education I didnt know how to identify myself and also did not want the community to misinterpret me Mapothengs coming out was a prolonged process The catalyst was a  trip to South Africa for an LGBTI conference It was there he realized that wanting to be male wasnt strange but rather a sign that he was a transsexual In Lesotho in previous years we didnt know about gender identity Mapotheng explains We only knew about sexual orientation I struggled to define myself It wasnt easy for me It was very confusing When you come out its  hard Mapotheng continues You think What is this going to say about me Am I strong enough to protect myself  He means protection from both discrimination and physical abuse aimed at those who openly embrace their LGBTI identity Victims of violence often do not inform the police lest they be ostracized Nonetheless Mapotheng believes that more of his LGBTI countrymen and countrywomen are now unafraid to speak out Mapothengs activism began in his teen years He didnt know if he was gay or straight at the time but he was definitely concerned about the backlash against people who identified as gay   then the biggest LGBTI advocacy group in Lesotho hoping to not only find himself but to help the movement gain traction Mapothengs coming out was isolating His parents didnt allow him to stay in their home and he lost friends he thought he could count on many in the community were hostile Theres a lot of discrimination a lot of pressure from religious groups says Mapotheng Its not really physical its more emotional They call you names or talk about you Health and housing departments tell you they dont have services for transgender people Its Mapothengs first time in America and he is enjoying his time here learning about leadership strategies at the University of Delaware He hopes to use this knowledge to create community organizations for LGBTI youth  and to be a more effective leader Back home it is difficult to meet politicians and bureaucrats Mapotheng says He wants to reach out directly to bureaucrats to accomplish his goals a move he hadnt thought of before He also wants to help others who face discrimination whether they are disabled or sex workers or female But hes not that good on the details of his grand plan When pressed he laughingly comments You ask tough questions Indeed he best sums up his vision when describing his efforts as an amateur photographer I enjoy being behind the camera Mapotheng says I love taking beautiful photos of landscapes and people I just like capturing people when they are happy and whole
