he wonder of the NHS is its remarkable resilience Its no surprise that waiting times are higher than for years AE targets missed by miles and cancer treatment times falling This   the respected independent institute that does for health what the Institute for Fiscal Studies does for tax and spend Warnings came after George Osbornes first budget when the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee the former health secretary   that the NHS could not sustain  cuts year after year in efficiency savings without imploding No health service anywhere in the world had done that Technically Cameron kept his promise to increase funding  but only by   Per capita funds fell as the population grew as did numbers of people aged over  and over  Now add in  cuts in council budgets that saw  fewer frail people receive any social care old people arriving in AE were stuck in hospital beds for lack of services at home Add in the ruinous disarray of the bn NHS and Social Care Act like smashing a mirror into fragments In what was once unguardedly called creative destruction for public services by backroom Conservative ideologues  people changed jobs senior staff departed The perfect financial storm came with the   rightly commanding that there should be more nurses But the government had cut nurse training places so hospitals competed in a dash to hire them from abroad and agencyuse skyrocketed This lucky government has had mild winters and no great flu or norovirus outbreaks Last minute bungs to AE have just about kept the wheels on despite the ambulances stacking up outside The public remains relatively satisfied at  Pollsters suggest people now tend to say they are satisfied with the NHS as a gesture of support not an evaluation of quality But those saying that the NHS improved on Camerons watch fell from  in  to  now Only  support charging new fees  the fees rightwing thinktanks imagine would solve the crisis  though the US Commonwealth Fund year after year finds the   Now the bucks have run out Neither Labour nor Tories pledge anything like enough NHS trusts are bn in debt and its rising with no chance of recovery without shutting vital services Only out of fear of the impending election has the Treasury let debts rise Whoever wins must find what   England says is a bare minimum of bn extra a year admitting that the real sum is closer to bn But the parties are locked in a   which the Institute for Fiscal Studies castigates as irresponsible and improbable Todays attitudes survey shows a small attitude shift towards paying more tax for public services  but still only  would though  know the NHS has a funding problem As ever the public demands the impossible Swedish services on US tax rates  and no party dare say theres no free lunch But the NHS is the one service for which an earmarked tax might be acceptable Can both parties scrape through the election pretending the NHS is safe in their hands without at least pledging that bn My guess is that both manifestos will have to but what folly to cut off their main tax routes to achieving it
