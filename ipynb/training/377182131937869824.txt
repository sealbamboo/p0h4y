Billie Iverson may be getting up there but for an yearold shes still plenty active I take trips and I go do my own shopping and I take myself to the doctor Iverson says I do everything I dont let anything stop me But one day she got hit with something shed never experienced  the worst case of the runs ever For days at a time off and on for weeks the problem kept coming back Iverson eventually got so weak she ended up in a nursing home I just thought maybe I wasnt going to make it she says I thought I was going to die Finally Iversons daughter took her to see   a doctor at Brown University and the   Kelly knew right away what was going on Its very classic this pattern Kelly says Weve seen hundreds of cases over the last couple of years at our program Kellys program specializes in the microbes that live in our digestive systems  trillions of bacteria viruses fungi and other mostly helpful microbes whose genes scientists collectively call the   The problem she told Iverson started when antibiotics prescribed for another health problem disrupted the community of benign organisms in her intestines leaving her vulnerable to a really bad bug  a bacterium called   You can almost look at   as  the prototypical example Kelly says of how a disruption in the human microbiome can result in disease Kelly is among a growing number of doctors who are starting to use what scientists are learning about our microbiomes to help prevent diagnose and treat many illnesses For Iverson she proposed something that may sound pretty radical  what doctors call a   Its really almost like an organ transplant Kelly says Youre taking this whole community of microorganisms from one person and transplanting them into another person Then these things  take root colonize and kind of restore that balance Iverson says she initially found the idea repulsive But she felt so desperate that she agreed to try it I was scared to death honey Iverson says Im an old lady Ive got one foot in the grave and the other on the banana peel The procedure turned out to be really easy And it worked  virtually overnight It stopped Iverson says Right away Im feeling good now Im feeling great What happened to Iverson is the most dramatic example of how doctors are manipulating the microbiome in lots of ways to help lots of different kinds of patients For one thing Kelly says doctors are testing the use of the transplants in other illnesses such as colitis Crohns disease and diabetes And theres even talk of trying the treatment for obesity Were at a really interesting point in medicine where weve come to appreciate the microbiome and that these organisms have really integral roles in  energy metabolism and immune function and all of these other things Kelly says At the same time researchers are looking for more subtle ways to fix our microbiomes For starters theyre trying to remove the yuk factor from microbiome transplants by figuring out exactly which microorganisms patients really need and giving them just those And theres tons of research involving socalled probiotics  live cultures of supposedly beneficial microbes typically included in yogurt or other foods or supplements   are meant to be swallowed in hopes that theyll outcompete pathogenic bacteria and restore a healthy balance The evidence is really mounting to the point where I think its undeniable that the ingestion of live bacteria  safe bacteria in high numbers  has an overall beneficial effect on human health says   of the University College Cork in Ireland Scientists are testing a long list of probiotics for a variety of health problems including vaginal infections colic in babies and weakened immune systems in the elderly Theyre also studying socalled    nondigestible carbohydrates meant as food for the good microbes Now anyone who walks into a grocery store these days knows that hundreds of prebiotic and probiotic products are already on the market You cant watch TV or go on the Internet without hearing the kinds of claims the manufacturers of these products make The companies point to studies supporting their claims But many experts say there are still   about how safe such products are how pure they are and whether they really do what their makers say they do All of those things together open up the opportunity for  the equivalent of snake oil salesmen related to probiotics or microbial treatments or fecal transplants or whatever says   of the University of California Davis And Eisen is not alone in his criticism The Food and Drug Administration has big concerns Those concerns include whether microbiome transplants might spread infections or are being promoted for unproven uses or whether they might actually increase the risk for some health problems The gut microbiome can affect obesity diabetes and a number of other disorders says Jay Slater director of the FDAs Division of Bacterial Parasitic and Allergenic Products These are the kinds of concerns that would indicate that good longterm studies really should be done So the FDA requires that doctors who want to do microbiome transplants for anything other than   treatment get FDA approval first And physicians must warn patients that even for   the treatment is still experimental Scientists studying probiotics have to put them through the same careful testing that regular drugs go through All this is really frustrating for many scientists They argue that these regulatory roadblocks are holding up research and making it too hard for patients to get microbiome transplants People are dying of   says Kelly And people are living in this really terrible state I see people whove lost their jobs people whove become depressed because of just the feeling of utter hopelessness And I think its really unethical to withhold the treatment from patients who need it As for Iverson she agrees that anyone who needs such a transplant should be able to get one I think its terrific she says I think its the best thing that ever happened This is like a step to heaven having this done
