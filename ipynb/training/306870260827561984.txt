Deborah Richards from Oakland Calif thinks she has a handle on her son Dontas eating habits Hes fussy but he eats healthy she says He eats healthier than me But Donta doesnt think so I know for a fact I dont he says My breakfast I can say on the daily is a pack of Skittles I make sure I get one every morning Skittles gasps Richards I try to teach him better Richards isnt alone According to the poll  percent of parents report their children are eating healthfully But do parents really know what their kids  especially older kids  are eating Not according to high school senior Felix Pieske from Portland Maine Middle school might have been the last time that I really talked to my parents about like Oh what did you eat today  he says I still talk to my mom Oya Autry She thinks I have a good diet  lots of juices water fruits and salads and not a lot of chips or fried foods And that sounds about right Although to be honest I dont make it a point to keep track of what I eat However some people like my friend yearold Jorisha Mayo know that they indulge and do so starting right after school ends I do occasionally eat unhealthy I eat a lot of sugary foods and snacks admits Mayo from Concord Calif I think I snack probably around the  to  pm zone Then when it gets later  or so thats when I snack on my cookies and ice cream and crackers or chips and stuff Thats pretty normal According to the poll nearly half of children snacked on sweets and a quarter ate chips the day before  an expert on pediatric weight management at Oakland Childrens Hospital says some kids sneak their snacks Some of the kids I work with that are overweight they feel bad that theyre eating things maybe they shouldnt she says And so they sort of try and hide it because at times they feel bad and theyre a little embarrassed by it I dont intentionally hide food from my mom But at the same time I dont tell her every single thing I eat in a day and she doesnt ask But for this assignment I decided to keep a food diary which I reviewed together with my mom I made some unhealthy choices during the week including a bowl of crab fried rice and four Dorito chips for breakfast one day But I also snacked on things like apples and granola bars Overall my mom was pretty happy Even those horrible snacks and weird breakfasts that I heard on the list I think even those are still fairly healthy  four Doritos versus four bags of Doritos she says However Im not convinced Ive always thought of myself as a healthy eater but when I look at my food diary Im less sure Which got me wondering where do we teenagers get our ideas about what healthy even means Thats a good question What does healthy mean says Tinajero With pediatrics healthy is about being balanced I always tell kids  are you putting the best thing into your body Tinajero says that if youre in tune with your body  if you notice when youve had your fill of junk food for the week and decide to start eating better  then youre body will begin to tell you what it needs Which means my mom doesnt have to
