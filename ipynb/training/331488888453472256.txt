New Yorks top prosecutor plans to sue two mortgage titans   and   over claims that they breached the terms of a multibilliondollar settlement intended to end foreclosure abuses On Monday Eric T Schneiderman New Yorks attorney general and top prosecutor said that the lenders violated the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement a sweeping  billion pact brokered last year between five of the nations biggest banks and  state attorneys general The agreement came during a national outcry over potentially widespread foreclosure abuses like shoddy paperwork erroneous fees and wrongful evictions Mr Schneiderman says that Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not follow guidelines dictating how the banks field and process requests from homeowners trying to modify their mortgages Under the terms of the settlement banks have to abide by  servicing standards like notifying homeowners of missing documents within five days of receiving a loan modification and providing borrowers with a single point of contact Wells Fargo and Bank of America have flagrantly violated those obligations putting hundreds of homeowners across New York at greater risk of foreclosure Mr Schneiderman said Since October  Mr Schneidermans office has documented  separate violations involving Wells Fargo and  involving Bank of America The move by Mr Schneiderman is the first time that an attorney general has readied a lawsuit against one of the five participating banks on charges related to the settlement which was aimed at halting the housing markets downward slump and doling out relief to homeowners in foreclosure More attorneys general could follow Mr Schneidermans lead Last week   the Massachusetts attorney general also sent a letter to Joseph A Smith the settlement monitor outlining recurring issues with mortgage servicers according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times Among the problems she cited were erroneous communications and servicing requirements that were often ignored Ms Coakley could pursue a lawsuit but hopes that the monitor will intervene to correct the problems according to her office The settlement emerged from an investigation into mortgage servicing by all  state attorneys general that began in  after revelations emerged that banks had churned through foreclosures using robosigned documents legal paperwork that was seldom reviewed for accuracy After the deal was reached in February  Mr Schneidermans office began receiving a deluge of complaints from housing counselors across the state The counselors Mr Schneidermans office said reported that homeowners were still wading through a bureaucratic quagmire Mr Schneiderman set the potential penalty in motion on Friday when he sent a letter to the settlement monitoring committee outlining his plans to penalize the banks I am writing to inform you about a persistent pattern of noncompliance Mr Schneiderman wrote according to the letter The committee has  days to decide whether to initiate a lawsuit or whether Mr Schneiderman will pursue the action alone Bank of America and Wells Fargo said on Monday that they would take steps to handle the issues raised Through March we have provided relief for more than  New York homeowners through the National Mortgage Settlement totaling more than  billion said Richard G Simon a spokesman for Bank of America He noted that Attorney General Schneiderman has referenced  customer servicing problems which we take seriously and will work quickly to address Wells Fargo which has helped  homeowners through the settlement is committed to full compliance with the National Mortgage Settlement and its associated standards according to Vickee J Adams a Wells Fargo spokeswoman She added that it is unfortunate that the New York attorney general has chosen this route rather than engage in a constructive dialogue through the established dispute resolution process Michael Farnsworth who fell behind on his mortgage after a spinal injury prevented him from working is among the New York residents claiming that their mortgage paperwork was not handled properly After submitting a loan modification application to Wells Fargo on Feb  Mr Farnsworth said he returned home on March  to find a note affixed to his farmhouse in Corfu NY The note was ominous he said Mr Farnsworth had  hours to resubmit many documents including tax returns or his loan modification would be scuttled Under the mortgage settlement though Wells Fargo was required to notify Mr Farnsworth about missing documents five days after he submitted a loan application and to then give him  days to submit any missing documentation Wells Fargo declined to comment on Mr Farnsworths case citing customer privacy but said that the bank is doing everything we can to assist customers so that they can stay in their homes if possible The servicing standards were intended in part to address delays that can torpedo efforts to save a home Before the settlement housing counselors said that homeowners were ensnared in a bureaucratic maze when seeking foreclosure relief Some borrowers were asked for the same document multiple times while others were shuttled from one representative to another As their applications for relief languished housing counselors said borrowers accrued fresh costs like late fees and property taxes that aggravated their distress The price of this paperwork delay can be thousands of dollars for homeowners Vera Cedano a foreclosure defense lawyer with Western New York Law Center It can mean the difference between saving a losing a home Deonarine Nareen a yearold restaurant employee in Queens had fallen behind on his mortgage as he petitioned Wells Fargo for a loan modification according to court records Since Wells Fargo began foreclosure proceedings against him in  Mr Nareen said he had tried to win a reduced monthly mortgage payment but had been asked for documents numerous times In the latest chapter Mr Nareen said he applied for a loan modification on Feb  so he was surprised when he received a brand new application for a loan modification from Wells Fargo in March
