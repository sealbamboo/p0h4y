Most of us do everything possible to avoid mosquitoes But one Italian researcher literally sacrifices her right arm to keep the lowly insects alive Chiara Adolina is studying a new malaria drug and she needs the little suckers for her experiments So she feeds them each day with her own blood She extends her arm into a mosquito cage to give the insects breakfast Several dozen mosquitoes spread across her forearm and jam their proboscises into her skin Can you see how fat they become she says Look at that tummy Adolina affectionately refers to her mosquitoes as my girls Only female mosquitoes transmit malaria so shes far more interested in the girls in her mosquito colony than the guys The female mosquitoes bite because they need the proteins of blood to make the shell of their eggs she says So theyre pregnant ladies Adolina raises the insects at the   a remote laboratory on the ThaiMyanmar border A drugresistant form of malaria is   in the region and   are a problem Shes working with a drug that tries to kill the parasite inside people during an early stage of the infection  at a time when the person hasnt yet shown signs of being sick The goal is to stop the parasite from moving back and forth between humans and mosquitoes Here in the US biologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also farm mosquitoes for   including some nasty bugs that are resistant to insecticides What happens if Adolina doesnt feed her girls Theyll die probably she says Thats why when you see mosquitoes and they really want to bite you its not because theyre hungry They really need to lay the eggs so they need that blood meal While working in Britain a few years ago Adolina fed her mosquitoes reheated rabbits blood from a blood bank Here in Thailand though she has a type of mosquito that will only dine on live human blood Mosquitoes in Asia are really really difficult to rear she says Really delicate Very spoiled If you put them in a cage they wont mate This means Adolina has to artificially inseminate each tiny female in the colony Its very difficult It takes lots of time she says Most of the mosquitoes on her arm now have dark swollen bellies but they are still trying to probe into her skin some more They feed maybe five minutes she says But some of them they are just trying to find the capillary They just go around and it takes longer A few minutes after the mosquitoes have filled themselves with Adolinas blood most of the bite marks on her skin have disappeared She says her body has gotten used to the bites  they hardly itch anymore All this so that she can study these mosquitoes and the potentially deadly parasites inside them
