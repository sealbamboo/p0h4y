New figures suggest Scotlands accident and emergency departments treated  of patients within four hours between October and December    This compares to  in the previous quarter and is slightly worse than Englands performance of  Scottish Government targets are for at least  of AE patients to be seen admitted transferred or discharged within four hours NHS Lanarkshire had the worst average figure over the period  at  The figure for NHS Lanarkshire in November was just  The Scottish figure for October and November was  but that fell to  in December The numbers are below the overall performance in England but above that in what are described as core sites in major cities south of the border In December  of patients were seen within four hours in Scotland compared to  in England and  in Wales At core sites in the same month the performance was  in Scotland  in England and  in Wales Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said this winter had seen unprecedented pressures in hospitals In December NHS Forth Valley  and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde  were the worst performers NHS Tayside was the best health board for waiting times with  seen within four hours There was a slight increase in attendances compared to previous years The number of attendances at AE services across Scotland over the past three years were During the final quarter of   patients spent more than eight hours in AE and  spent more than  hours The statistics said  of attendances at AE led to an admission to hospital  The health secretary said Staff in Scotlands NHS have done a terrific job over what has been a very challenging time and Id like to thank them for all their work as they cope with an increase in the number of patients and an increase in those being admitted These factors have clearly impacted on performance and todays figures do not meet the demanding world leading targets we have set and the standards that patients rightly demand We are determined to improve performance which is why we have been taking substantial action to ease pressure on the front door of the hospital as well as concentrating on the timely discharge of patients Last month the Scottish government announced m to help health boards and local authorities tackle bed blocking which it is hoped would help people move out of AE and through the system Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy said the waiting time figures expose the crisis in our NHS under the SNP  He said Patients across Scotland are told regularly by SNP ministers that they should be grateful things arent as bad as in England Now we know that under the SNP things are even worse in Scotland Thats just not good enough and Scotland deserves better He said Scottish Labour planned to fund an extra  nurses in Scotlands NHS using the money raised from a Mansion Tax on homes worth more than m if it was to get into power in Scotland Scottish Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said Scottish Conservatives have long argued for  additional nurses to be the priority and a GP attached national health visiting services to be reestablished along with a substantial investment and refocusing of GP practices There is no justification for the SNP sneering at health services elsewhere in the UK when its own performance is rapidly failing before patients eyes Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Jim Hume called on the Scottish government to take action to alleviate pressure cooker conditions at AE units Theresa Fyffe Scotland director of the Royal College of Nursing said The longer waiting times at AE are a symptom of a system that is struggling to cope with the everincreasing demand it is under so Im glad the Scottish government is taking steps to address this Dr Peter Bennie chairman of BMA Scotland said For individual patients waiting for treatment can be a particularly difficult and stressful time and it is important that those with the greatest clinical need receive appropriate care within a reasonable timescale   NHS staff are working incredibly hard to ensure that patients receive high quality timely care but they are struggling to cope  Pressure on NHS services is at a critical point and cracks are beginning to appear  From next month the NHS in Scotland will be moving to monthly reporting of AE waiting times Scots have been getting less information about the performance of their local emergency department than their counterparts in the rest of the UK meaning the new figures are the first waiting time figures since September In England hospitals publish AE performance statistics weekly and by hospital allowing more scrutiny of the performance of individual hospitals   In Northern Ireland the public is given monthly performance figures by hospital   Wales publishes monthly statistics by health board rather than hospital   In Scotland the public has been only told how the NHS has performed every three months and at health board level   Because waiting times are combined over a threemonth period the poor performance of particular hospitals on particular days is sometimes not apparent and figures relating to the busy New Year period are not included in Tuesdays release
