Twice a day Michele Forth drives  miles to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to visit her monthold baby she affectionately calls Miss Madilyn She is a pound fighter in pink pajamas  but to her family and the nurses who care for her day and night she is so much more Hi pumpkin You just waking up Forth coos Nurse Adrianna Adri Zimmerman wearing purple scrubs and a warm smile hands Madilyn to her father who is quickly surrounded by his wife and two young sons She fights harder than any adult that I know let alone a pound baby says father Shane Forth softly stroking Madilyns delicate left foot in his hand It was in that spirit that the nurses chose to see Madilyn one of nearly  babies cared for in the  at Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta every day We always talk about how feisty this one is or how sweet this one is Zimmerman says That bedside chatting took on a whole new life with a photo series called From the NICU to the Moon that imagines what the babies dream about as they wiggle and smile in their sleep and what they might become someday It also aims to educate parents about   The nurses and hospital communications team imagined Madilyn as a physician surrounded by stethoscopes and BandAids The photo series also features Brentley the future astronaut Arianna the future chef Sofia the ballerina and Carolina as an Olympian Madilyn was born two months early and has what is called vacterl association a collection of birth defects resulting in multiple surgeries and months in the NICU Zimmerman remembers Madilyns arrival in the NICU like it was her own child I think shes strong and shes definitely got the will to see whatever it is through to the end so if that happens to be med school in a few years I would not be surprised says Zimmerman Its funny how much personality these babies have And Mom is happy with the depiction Even though Miss Madilyn does have a whole bunch of obstacles ahead of her right now she says she can do amazing things and she can aspire to be anything that she wants to be Carolina the tiny Olympian is a strongwilled patient who has a lot of heart and she is letting nothing hold her back says Jessica Wright a NICU Nurse with  years of experience Just because they were born early doesnt mean they cannot do whatever they want when they grow up in life True to her athletic depiction Carolina is hardly ever still in her crib Gazing up at the green alligator and orange lion of her soother Carolina playfully kicks her feet back and forth her bright eyes fixed on Nurse Wright What are you thinking about Wright asks her hand on Carolinas blue and pink ensemble You tell em about it wiggle worm Sofia the ballerina in the photo series is also on the move Since she was photographed Sofia was able to leave the NICU and go home with her parents Fred and Dawnyale Dawny Hill In the pale orange light of an Atlanta sunset Fred and Dawny cradle their daughter in their arms on the familys front porch Its Sofias first time outside on the porch and her longest stint outside in the evening since she went home What do you think What do you think Hill asks his daughter holding her hand Interesting huh Sofia spent  days  hours and  total minutes in NICUs Respiratory and reflux issues keep this  monthold on an oxygen tank and feeding tube She has some accessories as we like to refer to them as says Mr Hill about the oxygen tank and tubes They kind of travel with her But in the NICU to the Moon photos Sofia left all the tubes behind for the stage and curtains It made her seem normal The way the pictures kind of erased all of the cords All of the tubes says Hill of his daughter I saw the innocence of Sofia as opposed to my child in the NICU Shes got a family full of dancers on both sides so we definitely are excited to see Miss Sofia the ballerina come about Dawny says with a laugh Shell be dancing around But for now the Hills cherish moments with Sofia at home like their evening bedtime routine Mr Hill carries Sofia on his chest while Dawny wheels the oxygen tank and other cords towards the bedroom Good holding your head Sofia Look at you applauds Mrs Hill As they gently place her on her back in her crib Sofia rubs her eyes Hey you had a good day You had a good day right Are you sleepy asks her father the machine beeping and sighing next to the crib Ready Time to pray Mr Hill says kneeling over the crib next to his wife They pray for every organ in their daughters body and give thanks to the doctors who helped bring her home We will be keeping up our bedtime routine Mrs Hill says looking at her husband Until she can start saying her prayers he answers Any child that has to go through that much opposition from day one theres got to be something great for them to accomplish out of life so my hope is that she accomplishes exactly what she was sent here to do Mr Hill says And with that the bedroom light switches off and one more former NICU baby gets to dream of her future in her own crib
