For more than a century neurons have been the superstars of the brain Their less glamorous partners glial cells cant send electric signals and so theyve been mostly ignored Now scientists have injected some human   into the brains of newborn mice When the mice grew up they were faster learners The study   in   not only introduces a new tool to study the mechanisms of the human brain it supports the hypothesis that glial cells  and not just neurons  play an important role in learning The scientific obsession with neurons really began at the end of the th century Spanish anatomy professor Santiago Ramon y Cajal used a special dye to stain brain tissue Under the microscope neurons were revealed in exquisite detail A dense forest Ramn y Cajal called it  a field of little branching cells that would soon be named neurons With beautiful ink drawings Ramn y Cajal painstakingly mapped neural networks and slowly developed the theory that neurons are the telegraph lines of thought an idea     Every idea and memory  every aspect of learning  could be traced back to the electric signals sent between neurons Ramn y Cajal   for his work and scientists focused on neurons for the next century But neurons arent the only cells in the brain Weve overlooked half the brain says   a neuroscientist at the National Institutes of Health Weve only been studying one kind of cell in the brain The other kind of cell  glial cells  are at least as abundant as neurons But early scientists thought they were so boring they didnt even merit a singular noun Glia is plural  there is no singular Fields says We have neuron but we dont have glion  Glial cells lacked the ability to send electric signals and most scientists thought they were housekeeping cells helping provide nutrients and insulation It was only in the last decade or so that scientists realized glial cells were more than that Special types of glial cells called astrocytes which are named for the starlike patterns of their cellular structure have their own form of chemical signaling They have the potential to coordinate whole groups of neurons Glia are in a position to regulate the flow of information through the brain Fields says This is all missing from our models And theres something else This type of glial cell these astrocytes have changed a lot as humans have evolved while neurons have pretty much stayed the same A mouse neuron and a human neuron look so much alike even experienced neuroscientists cant tell them apart I cant tell the differences between a neuron from a bird or a mouse or a primate or a human says   a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester who has studied brain cells for decades But Goldman says glial cells are easy to tell apart Human glial cells  human astrocytes  are much larger than those of lower species he says They have more fibers and they send those fibers out over greater distances The thought is maybe these glial cells have played a role in making humans smarter So Goldman teamed up with this wife   to test this idea They injected some human glial cells into the brains of newborn mice The mice grew up and so did the human glial cells The cells spread through the mouse brain integrating perfectly with mouse neurons and in some areas outnumbering their mouse counterparts All the while Goldman says the glial cells maintained their human characteristics They very much thought that they were in the human brain in terms of how they developed and integrated he says So what are these mice like the ones with brains full of functioning human cells Their neural circuitry is still just the same so they act completely normal They still socialize with other mice and still seem interested in mousey things But the researchers say these mice are measurably smarter In classic maze tests they learn faster They make many fewer errors and it takes them less time to come to the appropriate answer Goldman says It might take a normal mouse four or five attempts to learn the correct route for example But a mouse with human brain cells could get it on the second try Glial cells  those boring glial cells  somehow enhance learning In fact they could be changing what it means to be a mouse and that raises ethical questions for this kind of research Maybe bioethicists have been a little bit too cavalier assuming that a mouse with some human brain cells in it is just your normal old mouse says   a bioethicist from the University of WisconsinMadison Well its not going to be human but that doesnt mean its a normal old mouse either Streiffer says its not just that these mice can get through a maze more quickly  theyre better at recognizing things that scare them And perception of fear is one of the things bioethicists must weigh when they decide the types of experiments you can do on an animal So you have to sort of step back and do some hardcore philosophy he says Like will these types of humananimal hybrids eventually get close enough to humanity that we would feel uncomfortable performing experiments on them The researchers in this study say were really really far from that point And if you want to investigate the role of glial cells these hybrid mice are the best tools available
