A government health panel on Monday chose not to endorse widespread screening for vitamin D levels in healthy adults despite research suggesting that a majority of Americans may be deficient in the vitamin The United States Preventive Services Task Force an independent group of health experts decided not to recommend routine testing for vitamin D levels in part because it was not clear whether otherwise healthy adults with low levels would actually benefit from taking supplements of the vitamin The panel members concluded that there was not enough evidence to either endorse or advise against regular vitamin D screening in most adults and they suggested that testing is something that should be considered case by case  This is not a recommendation for or against it said Dr Douglas K Owens a panel member and director of the Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research at Stanford medical school In our view when people have concerns or questions about vitamin D they should discuss them with their clinicians Dr Owens said that the task force decided to look at the harms and benefits of screening since vitamin D testing is on the rise Sales of vitamin D supplements have soared in recent years fueled by a body of research suggesting that the vitamin may help protect against a range of chronic disease Some studies estimate that more than twothirds of Americans are deficient in it Earlier this year   in the journal BMJ found that people with low vitamin D levels were more likely to die from cancer heart disease and to suffer from other illnesses One of the studies found that middleaged and older adults who took vitamin D  which is found in fish and dairy products and produced in the body in response to sunlight  had reductions in mortality from all causes But a second study did not find persuasive evidence that vitamin D pills can protect against chronic disease   There is some debate over whether low levels of the vitamin are a direct cause of disease or simply an indicator of behaviors that contribute to poor health like smoking poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle  The federal task force issued a draft recommendation based on a review of evidence from more than a dozen studies that evaluated the effects of vitamin D treatment in generally healthy adults The studies used vitamin D doses ranging from  to  international units daily and they lasted anywhere from two months to seven years  The panel concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to determine the net balance of benefits and harms of screening and early treatment of vitamin D deficiency in generally healthy adults Dr Owens said the committee found a number of potential problems with screening  For one it is not clear exactly what constitutes a vitamin D deficiency in the first place Some experts believe that deficiencies should be defined as a blood level of the vitamin that is under  nanograms per milliliter Others say the cutoff should be lower There are also numerous ways to test for vitamin D and it is not clear whether some tests are better or more accurate than others  Another complicating factor is that vitamin D screening can yield unreliable results depending on things like the ethnicity of the person being tested Studies have found for example that the prevalence of low vitamin D is many times greater in African Americans compared to nonHispanic whites yet they do not have the higher risk of bone fractures typically associated with low vitamin D One study last year found that even though African Americans tend to have lower circulating levels of vitamin D the vitamin is in a more readily accessible form so their low levels can be misleading  That suggests that problems may lie with the method of testing not necessarily the patients People who are obese may also have paradoxically low levels of circulating vitamin D despite having forms of the vitamin that the body can use  Because the accuracy of the test is uncertain you can misclassify people Dr Owens said You could tell someone who is not vitamin D deficient that they are There are those kinds of problems with broader screening Dr Roxanne Sukol a preventive medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinics Wellness Institute said that she often tests her patients for vitamin D but for varying reasons In some cases she may have concerns about the quality of a patients diet In others the concern may be that a patient is at risk of low bone density or that he or she is not getting enough sun exposure to produce sufficient vitamin D  Dr Sukol said the draft recommendation would not change her approach to screening and that she suspects many people may misinterpret the panels conclusions It doesnt mean you shouldnt test she said Theyre saying that if doctors decide to do it that we should tell the patient that were not positive whether it will make a difference and were not sure if more good will come from it or more harm
