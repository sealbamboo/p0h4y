Prison guards and inmates could face prosecution for flouting smoking ban laws in communal prison areas after a High Court ruling The ruling was made after one inmate brought a case complaining about the health impact of secondhand smoke The government had argued that as Crown premises state prisons were exempt from smokefree legislation However Mr Justice Singh ruled that communal areas in prisons are subject to the laws which should be enforced  Exemptions to the Health Act  mean that smoking will still be allowed in cells with the door shut where the smoker is  or over   Paul Black an inmate at HMP Wymott argued that he was frequently exposed to secondhand smoke on landings in laundry rooms and healthcare waiting rooms Black also argued that prisoners are legally entitled to anonymous and confidential access to the NHS smokefree compliance phone line to report infringements of the rules Lawyers for the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling maintained that prison rules and regulations especially the sanction of withdrawal of privileges were sufficient to deal with incidents of unauthorised smoking But Mr Justice Singh sitting in London said it was clear that Parliament had intended the act to apply to all public places and workplaces which fell within its scope including those for which the Crown is responsible The ruling does not take effect until the justice secretary has been given time to lodge an appeal The health act already applies to private prisons Sean Humber head of the prison law team at Leigh Day solicitors said the judgment was important because it confirmed that prisoners were entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by secondhand smoke as everyone else He added The judgment requires the government to reconsider its current refusal to allow prisoners access to a confidential NHS phone line Prisons have remained a bit of an anomaly ever since the ban on smoking in public places was introduced in England and Wales in  It is not allowed in communal spaces but has been allowed in cells and exercise yards Antismoking campaigners and the Prison Officers Association have long argued this is wrong An estimated  of inmates smoke  despite efforts to encourage them to quit If this ban does end up being introduced it should in theory stop that in one swoop But implementing it would require greater provision of stopsmoking aids such as nicotine patches and careful policing to stop cigarettes being smuggled in But its perfectly possible Other countries such as parts of the US Canada and New Zealand have already introduced bans The Ministry of Justice said it was undertaking measures to lessen the impact of smoking in prisons  This includes tightening our current smoking controls undertaking air quality monitoring in prison accommodation and maximising the provision of smoking cessation support to those prisoners who want to stop smoking a spokeswoman said Prisoners cant smoke in communal areas  only in their cells and outside in exercise yards She added The court has granted permission to appeal the judgement handed down by the High Court that Part  of the Health Act binds the Crown As this is an ongoing legal matter it would not be appropriate to comment further The judge acknowledged concerns in the prison service over the impact of his decision that prisoners who feel the need to smoke may be resistant to the criminalising of that conduct in places where in my view the health act does apply BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said that although Mr Grayling had been given the opportunity to appeal the government had previously said it would like a ban to be introduced Its simply the practical difficulties of putting it in place which have to be sorted out he said But Ben Gunn an exprisoner and prison campaigner said a ban would be difficult to implement and could have a destabilising effect Prison is one of the last bastions of smokers Its a great stress reliever and prison is a stressful place On paper this might look like a good idea but the ramifications will pop up in all sorts of places he said An estimated  of the  inmates at prisons in England and Wales are thought to be smokers Last year a pilot scheme was launched which saw   in three prisons
