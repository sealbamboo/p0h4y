Aspirin is a popular drug for people whove never had a heart attack or stroke and would like to keep it that way But for more than one in  people who do so aspirin could do more harm than good a new study suggests Among  patients being treated by cardiologists around the US  of them were taking aspirin despite having a very low risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next  years In other words  of patients were taking the drug inappropriately according to a   published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology Aspirin  also known as acetylsalicylic acid  averts heart attacks and strokes by   Clots are made up of blood cells called platelets which stick together with the help of an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase or COX But aspirin prevents COX from doing its job While thats useful in the fight against cardivascular disease it can be   in other ways When blood cant clot easily people run the risk of excessive bleeding In the brain that can lead to a   A stroke caused by a clot is called an ischemic stroke Other kinds of internal bleeding can be lifethreatening as well Thats why experts recommend aspirin therapy only for people with a significant risk of a clotrelated problem That includes pretty much everyone who has already suffered an ischemic stroke or heart attack It also includes people who have never had a heart attack or stroke but face at least a  to  risk of suffering one in the next  years according to recent guidelines from the American Heart Assn the American Stroke Assn and the US Preventive Services Task Force Researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine and their colleagues examined the medical records of Â patients who were being tracked as part of the American College of Cardiologys   They focused on patients who were taking aspirin to prevent their first heart attack or stroke The researchers used the   to calculate the year risk of the patients for whom data was available Their analysis revealed that  of the patients had a risk below   too low to justify the potential side effects of the therapy Who were these people In general they were much younger  years old on average than people taking aspirin with good reason average age  years And  of them were women In fact  of the women analyzed were taking aspirin inappropriately compared with only  of the men In some cardiology practices as many as  of patients were taking aspirin even though their risk factors didnt warrant it But in other practices that figure was  Geography didnt have much to do with this variation  the rate of inappropriate asprin use was  in the Northeast  in the Midwest  in the South and  in the West Its not clear whether all of the people taking aspirin inappropriately were doing so at the direction of their cardiologists Aspirin doesnt require a prescription and some patients may be buying it of their own accord Either way the study results make clear that doctors should do a better job of making sure patients are taking aspirin only when the cardiovascular benefits outweigh the risks the study authors concluded
