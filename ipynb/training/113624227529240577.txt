For most cooks tasting is automatic but when its not the price can be high Recipes dont always call for the right amount of seasoning cooking times are estimates and results vary depending on your ingredients your stove altitudeand a million other factors Your palate is the control factor Think that experienced cooks dont forget this most basic rule   Associate Food Editor Tim Cebula was sous chef in a notable restaurant when he served up caramelized pineapple that somehow refused to brown Turns out Tim had coated the fruit in salt not sugar Thats why it wouldnt caramelize  
                       Even the bestwritten recipes may not include all the headline information at the top A wise cook approaches each recipe with a critical eye and reads the recipe well before its time to cook Follow the pros habit of gathering your  that is having all the ingredients gathered prepped and ready to go before you turn on the heat Trust me says former   Test Kitchen tester Mary Drennen Ankar you dont want to be an hour away from dinner guests arriving when you get to the part of the recipe that says to marinate the brisket overnight or simmer for two hours
                        You wreck the underlying chemistry of the dish Substitutions are a particular temptation and challenge with healthy cooking At   its our job to substitute lowerfat ingredientsto change the cooking chemistry a bit while capturing the soul of a dish When it comes to baking this is as much science as art Ill get calls from readers about cakes turning out too dense or too gummy says Test Kitchen Director Vanessa Pruett After a little interrogation Ill get to the truththat the reader used ALL applesauce instead of a mix of applesauce and oil or butter or went with sugar substitute in place of sugar Best practice Follow the recipe period  A hurriedup dish thats cloudy tough or dry This is one of the most common kitchen errors First lets clarify what we mean by simmering A bubble breaks the surface of the liquid every second or two More vigorous bubbling than that means youve got a boil going And the difference between the two can ruin a dish I had a friend serve me a beef stew once that gave me a real jaw workout says Nutrition Editor Kathy Kitchens Downie She boiled the meat for  minutes instead of simmering it for a couple of hours She says she just wanted it to get done more quickly Well it was done but meat cooked too quickly in liquid ironically turns out very dry And tough really tough  Instead of having a smooth creamy luxurious consistency your chocolate is grainy separated or scorched The best way to melt chocolate is to go slowly heat gently remove from the heat before its fully melted and stir until smooth If using the microwave proceed cautiously stopping every  to  seconds to stir If using a double boiler make sure the water is simmering not boiling Its very easy to ruin chocolate and there is no road back Associate Food Editor Julianna Grimes recently made a cake but didnt pay close enough attention while microwaving the chocolate It curdled It was all the chocolate I had on hand so I had to dump it and change my plans Weve done it forgotten to soften the butter and zapped it in the microwave to do the job quickly Better to let it stand at room temperature for  to  minutes to get the right consistency You can speed the process significantly by cutting butter into tablespoonsized portions and letting it stand at room temperature Properly softened butter should yield slightly to gentle pressure Toosoft butter means your cookie dough will be more like batter and it will spread too much as it bakes and lose shape Butter thats too soft also wont cream properly with sugar and creaming is essential to creating fluffy tender cakes with a delicate crumb
                       If youre new to lighter cooking you may not know that even though you can boil cream just fine the same is not true for other milk products which will curdle The solution is to cook lowerfat dairy products to a temperature of only  or less Use a clipon thermometer hover over the pan and heat over mediumlow or low heat to prevent curdling And if it curdles toss and start again One alternative Stabilize milk with starch like cornstarch or flour if you want to bring it to a boil the starch will prevent curdling and itll thicken the milk too
                       Ideally every oven set to  would heat to  But many ovens dont including expensive ones and some change their behavior as they age Always use an oven thermometer Next be aware of hot spots If youve produced cake layers with wavy rather than flat tops hot spots are the problem SaBrina Bone who tests in our kitchen advises the bread test Arrange bread slices to cover the middle oven rack Bake at  for a few minutes and see which slices get singedtheir location marks your ovens hot spots If you know you have a hot spot in say the back left corner avoid putting pans in that location or rotate accordingly
                       In lighter baking youre using less of the butter and oil that can hide a host of measurement sins One cooks cup of flour may be another cooks  cups Why the discrepancy Some people scoop their flour out of the canister essentially packing it down into the measuring cup or tap the cup on the counter and then top off with more flour Both practices yield too much flour Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups then level with a knife advises Test Kitchen Director Vanessa Pruett A dry measuring cup is one without a spouta spout makes it difficult to level off the excess flour with the flat side of a knife Lightly spoon means dont pack it in
                        Soggy food that doesnt brown Food releases moisture as its cooked so leave room for the steam to escape Its easy to overcrowd a pan when youre in a hurry particularly if you have to brown a large amount of meat for a beef stew But the brown crusty bits are critical for flavor particularly with lowerfat cooking A soggy batch of beef going into a Dutch oven will not be a beautiful rich deeply flavored stew when it comes out even if it does get properly tender This browning principle applies equally to quickcook foods like crab cakes and chicken breasts Leave breathing room in the pan and youll get much better results If you need to speed things up use two pans at once Properly beaten egg whites are voluminous creamy and glossy but they require care First separate whites from yolks carefully by letting the whites slip through your fingers A speck of yolk can prevent the whites from whipping up fully Let the whites stand for a few minutesat room temperature they whip up better than when cold Whip with clean dry beaters at high speed just until stiff peaks formthat is until the peak created when you lift the beater out of the bowl stands upright If you overbeat the whites will turn grainy dry or may separate
                        You interfere with the sear food sticks or you lose the breading Learning to leave food alone is one of the hardest lessons in cooking its so tempting to turn poke flip But your breaded chicken or steak wont develop a nice crust unless you allow it to cook undisturbed for the specified time One sign that its too early to turn You cant slide a spatula cleanly under the crust Itll release from the pan when its ready says Assistant Test Kitchen Director Tiffany Vickers Davis Dont try to pry it upthe crust will stick to the pan not the chicken  Food that sticks scallops with no sear pale meats The inexperienced or hurried cook will barely heat the pan before adding oil and tossing in onions for a saut Next comesnothing No sizzle A hot pan is essential for sauting veggies or creating a great crust on meat fish and poultry It also helps prevent food from sticking Associate Food Editor Tim Cebula was once advised If you think your pan is hot enough step back and heat it a couple more minutes When youre about ready to call the fire department then add oil and proceed to cook the food  Chewy meat that could have been tender For tender slices look at the meat to determine the direction of the grain the muscle fibers and cut across the grain not with it This is particularly important with tougher cuts such as flank steak or skirt steak in which the grain is also quite obvious But its also a good practice with more tender cuts like standing rib roast or even poultry Overcooked baked goods disappoint but weve found that less experienced bakers are more likely to undercook them You wont get that irresistible browning unless you have the confidence to fully cook the food says Associate Food Editor Julianna Grimes Really look at the food Even if the wooden pick comes out clean if the cake is pale its not finished Let it go another couple of minutes until it has an even golden brownness Its better to err on the side of slightly overcooking than producing gummy wet unappealing food Once youve done this a few times and know exactly what youre looking for itll become second nature
                       Small and inexpensive the meat thermometer is one of the most valuable kitchen tools you can own Using one is the surefire way to achieve a perfect roast chicken or beautiful mediumrare lamb roast because temperatures dont lie and appearances can deceive We love digital probe thermometers which allow you to set the device to the desired temperature A heatproof wire leads to an external digital unit that sits outside the oven and beeps when the meat is ready This eliminates the frequent opening and closing of the oven door to check the tempduring which you lose valuable heatand that speeds the cooking
                       Plan your meals so that meat you roast grill sear or saut has time to rest at room temperature after its pulled from the heat That coolingoff time helps the juices which migrate to the center of the meat to be distributed more evenly throughout The resting rule applies equally to an inexpensive skirt steak or a premium dryaged grassfed steak as well as poultry With small cuts like a steak or boneless skinless chicken breast five minutes is adequate A whole bird or standing rib roast requires  to  minutes Tent the meat loosely with foil to keep it warm
                       If you want real true sweet creamy caramelized onions to top your burger or pizza cook them over mediumlow to low heat for a long time maybe up to an hour If you crank the heat and try to speed up the process youll get a different productonions that may be crisptender and nicely browned but lacking that characteristic translucence and meltingly tender quality you want Bottom line Know that caramelized onions take time and plan to cook them when you can give them the time they need
                        Cookies scones piecrusts and biscuits turn out tough Recipes with lots of butter are more likely to stay moist and tender because of the fat even if the dough is overkneaded But without all that fat you absolutely must use a light hand Thats why many of our biscuit and scone recipes instruct the cook to knead the dough gently or pat it out instead of rolling and our cookie or piecrust recipes say to mix just until flour is incorporated Whenever I make any of our cookies I stop the mixer before the flour is completely incorporated says the Test Kitchens Deb Wise I do that last bit of mixing by hand and it makes a difference Toasting intensifies the flavor of nuts But the nut is a mighty delicate thingin an oven it can go from perfectly toasty to charred in seconds This has happened to every one of our Test Kitchen cooks Arrange nuts in a single layer on a heavy baking sheet and bake at  for as little as two minutes for flaked coconut to five or more minutes for dense nuts like almonds shake the pan or stir frequently so the nuts toast evenlythey tend to brown on the bottom more quickly Theyre done when theyve darkened slightly or turned golden brown for pale nuts like pine nuts or slivered almonds and smell fragrant and toasty
                        Mush Toss green beans broccoli or asparagus into boiling water for three to seven minutes and theyll turn vibrant green with a crisptender texture But if you dont shock those vegetables at that point by spooning them out of the boiling water and plunging them into ice water or at least rinsing under cold running water to stop the cooking process the carryover heat will continue to cook them to the point that they turn armygreen and flabby This is not a concern if you intend to serve the vegetables immediately Healthy cooks try to keep sodium levels in check and only allocate a small amount of salt to a recipeso they need to maximize the salts impact For example chicken marinating in citrus juice and salt will only absorb a tiny amount of the marinade When you toss out the marinade you also toss out most of the salt and its seasoning effect Its better to use a little salt in the marinade then directly sprinkle the majority of the salt on the chicken after it comes out of the marinade The same goes for breaded items Sprinkle salt directly on the food and then coat it with the breading
                       Meats will cook much more evenly if you allow them to stand at room temperature for  to  minutes depending on the size of the cut to take the chill off A roast that goes into the oven refrigeratorcold will likely yield a piece of meat that is overcooked on the outside and undercooked at the center As you slice the roast youll see a bullseye effect The middle is rare or even raw while the outside is well done This is less of a problem with smaller cuts like chicken breaststhough even those benefit from resting at room temperature for five or  minutes before cooking
                       Theres no shame in making a mistake we all do And while it may feel a bit wasteful to throw food in the trash tossing out burned garlic charred nuts or smoking oil is the right thing to do Start again fresh if you have extras of the ingredients Of course there is a noturningback point too If youve overcooked a chicken because you didnt use a meat thermometer youre bound to serve an overcooked chicken At that point the best practice is to fess up apologize pass the wine and move on
                       This is an important point because its the linchpin of great cooking Good food begins and ends with the ingredients The dishes you cook will only be as mediocre good or superb as the ingredients you put in them As a rule we recommend using highquality ingredients whenever available and affordable Always shop for the best ingredients Theyre the foundation of good cooking and why we strive not to make the mistakes described here Choose topnotch produce meats and cheeses and protect them as you would anything else precioushandle with love respect and care so you can be a steward of the joys of great food Your cooking will invariably turn out better
                       First fill a wide saucepan or saut pan with water to about two inches Bring it to a gentle simmernot a rolling boil which toughens and twists the whites Add a few teaspoons of vinegar which does help eggs keep their shape Crack eggs fresher ones wont spread as much into small ramekins or custard cups The cups let you gently pour the eggs into the pan so the whites stay in a tight circle and ensure that you wont crack a brokenyolk dud into the water Cook three minutes the whites should be set and the yolks still creamy then remove carefully with a slotted spoon Drain them for a few seconds or blot with a paper towel Voil no more poor poaching You can now perch your perfectly poached gems atop a dish like  
                       One cause is the direct dumping of dry flour cornstarch or other thickener into the hot stock or broth Another adding broth too quickly into a rouxthe flourfat mixture that some gravy recipes start withwhich can cause clumping or a gluey layer on the bottom of the pan Hot spots in a large pan can complicate things as well In any starchbased sauce the thickener needs to be gradually introduced to the hot liquid its supposed to thicken The easiest way as with our recipe for the   involves whisking a flour slurry into the broth mixture then stirring until the gravy comes together If lumps happen pass gravy through a sieve or strainer or puree it with an immersion blender or very carefully in a regular blender If the gravy originally contained sauted mushroom slices well the guests neednt know that and it will still be delicious
                       Gluey mashed potatoes are more than just unfortunatetheyre usually a lost cause Overcooked or insufficiently drained potatoes can become sticky as can the wrong kind of potato But the main problem is overworked spuds The science is simple Boiled potatoes develop swollen starch cells When ruptured during mashing the cells release starch The more cells are ruptured the gummier the mashed potatoes So if you use an electric mixer or food processor to mash your potatoes youll probably beat them mercilessly and end up with wallpaper paste Instead use a potato masher or even better pass the potatoes through a ricer or food mill before mixing them with butter and hot milkthese devices are gentler on the starch cells and theyll also prevent lumps Lowstarch or waxy red potatoes hold their shape well after boiling so they require more effort to mash Hence youre likely to overwork them Try mashing them just partway as in our   By contrast highstarch mealy or floury baking potatoes also called russets break down more readily yielding light and fluffy mashed potatoes or with a little more milk and butter smooth and creamy
                       Browning butter is a sure way to suffuse a dish with a great deal of nutty buttery flavor without using a lot of fat Example   But the process is a little tricky because once the butter begins to brown it can race right into burnt Then nutty becomes bitter Success depends on visual cues so use a stainless steel panyou can see the butter change color better Use no more than medium heat so that the browning proceeds gradually First the butter will foam in the pan The milk solids are separating from the butterfat and the water is evaporating Then the foam subsides and the milk solids begin to brown Now the butter gives off its characteristic nutty aroma the French call brown butter   or hazelnut butter Some recipes call for adding lemon juice at this point the tartness complements the sweet butter while the juice cools it and slows the browning Either way when the butter turns amberbrown take the pan off the heat If youre not using it immediately say drizzling it over steamed vegetables get it out of the hot pan and into a bowl so the residual heat doesnt continue to push the butter from brown to burnt
                       Panfrying is the standard way to cook bacon but it has drawbacks Only a few strips fit flat in most skilletsany more than that will slope up the sides cooking unevenly And bacon strips can shrink more than they need to in a hot pan Starting them in a cold pan helps but youll still need to flip often Take a cue from chefsbake your bacon Heat hits from all sides cooking more evenly The result consistently flat strips Line a jellyroll pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper to make cleanup easier Set a wire rack on the pans so the bacon doesnt sit in fat Place bacon slices in a single layer on the rack and bake at  for about  minutes depending on bacon thickness and how crispy you like it Unless your oven has major hot spots you dont have to flip the bacon or turn the pans You can even put the bacon in while the oven preheatsthe gradual temperature increase will render the fat more slowly and wont shrink the meat as much
                        Drab veggies Next time baby them and they will stay vibrant When vegetables take a sad turn from bright green to khaki drab it conjures memories of gradeschool cafeteria food and the ruined texture of canned asparagus The most common culprits overcooking and acidic dressings A cook has to know how to care for the delicate source of the green chlorophyll Vegetables such as green beans broccoli and asparagus lose their bright colorand crisp texture for that matterafter six or seven minutes of cooking If you know youll be eating them immediately just remove drain and serve But if youll be busy assembling other dishes consider blanching and shocking Cook for two minutes in salted boiling water then remove vegetables immediately and plunge into ice water The ice bath halts the cooking process and helps set the color Later the chilled vegetables can be quickly reheatedby sauting in a bit of olive oil for instancewithout losing their green But blanching wont keep veggies vibrant if you dress them too soon with an acid such as vinegar or lemon juice Wait until just before serving as we do with our   A soggy pile of wilted greens makes for a sorry salad indeed Tender greens like Boston lettuce mche and arugula are delicate little things that perish at the mere rumor of mistreatment tearing or roughly handling lettuce bruises it but even crisp hearty lettuces like romaine need to be treated with care To keep them at their best you need to consider three factors time volume and temperature Only dress your greens just before serving particularly when using vinaigrette Oil quickly permeates the waxy surface of leafy greens turning them dark green and droopy If youve washed your greens use a salad spinner or blot them delicately with paper towels to dry them Water clinging to leaves will repel oilbased vinaigrettes and thin out creamy dressings leading to bland salad Put dry greens in a salad bowl Add less dressing than you think youll need to avoid overdressing and pour it down the sides of the bowl not onto the greensyoull dress them more evenly this way Gently toss adding dressing as needed until the greens are lightly coated If you do overdress them a quick whirl in the salad spinner will shake off any excess Finally follow the lead of professional chefs and serve your salad on chilled plates to help keep the greens crisp as you enjoy them
                       Grilling bonein skinon chicken breasts feels like it should be simple enough Even experienced grillers often try to cook them entirely over direct heat figuring its just a matter of timing At which point dripping fat causes flareups that engulf the breasts charring the skin while the meat remains rare deep within Yet perfectly grilled chickenwith crisp browned skin and juicy succulent meatis relatively simple if you learn to manipulate the heat First establish two temperature zones Set one side of a gas grill to mediumhigh and the other to low or build a fire on one side of a charcoal grill Make sure your grate is clean and oiled to prevent sticking Start the chicken skinside up on the low or noheat side and cover the grill After a few minutes when the chicken fat starts to render flip the meat skinside down Point the breasts thicker ends toward the hot side to help them cook evenly Cover and grill for about  minutes When the meat is done  at the thickest part of the breast crisp the skin on the hot side for a minute or two moving it as needed to avoid flareups Wait until the last few minutes to brush on barbecue sauce The sugars in the sauce will char quickly
                       Weve all puzzled after following someones cantfail advice over lessthanperfect hardcooked eggsthe eggs with rubbery whites chalky yolks and that telltale greengray film between yolk and white The cause Temperature differential The white of an egg dropped into boiling water cooks much faster than the yolk at the center and thats trouble By the time the yolk sets the white is tough And if the egg stays over high heat too long or isnt cooled quickly after cooking sulfur in the white will react with iron in the yolk creating that nasty offcolored ring Heres the fix To keep the temperature of the egg white and yolk close heat the eggs gradually Place them in a saucepan cover them by an inch or two with cold water and set the pan over high heat When the water reaches a full boil remove from heat cover the pan and let the eggs stand for  minutes This cooks them gently and keeps the whites from toughening Peel the eggs immediately under cold running water or if youre not using them right away set them in an ice water bath This lowers the eggs temperature and minimizes the pressure that causes sulfur rings to form

                       Rice is the great staple grain of much of the world but it can strike fear in the hearts of some American cooks who have learned that the famous  watertorice ratio is not reliable in many cases or for many varieties And stovetop prep can be tricky rice cookers are reliable so if you love rice consider buying one Slightly undercooked rice can sometimes be fixed with more water and time but the dreaded gummy rice is a dead loss When rice is cooked in the traditional waysimmering in a lidded potthe closepacked grains rub together and release starch often leading to stickiness The solution is blessedly ratiofree though it may seem counterintuitive Use more water Lots more so you cook the rice like pasta until it reaches the proper consistency then drain The pasta method keeps rice from rubbing together too much as it cooks draining ensures it wont suck up more water than it needs Check brown rice for doneness at around  minutes You can also saut brown rice in olive oil after its drained to evaporate excess moisture For white rice which absorbs water more readily try sauting the grains before boiling for about two minutes in a tablespoon of oil Then add roughly four times as much cold water as rice to the pan and boil Check for doneness at around  minutes timing starts when water boils The oil forms a protective layer around the white grains during boilingand sauting lends the rice deliciously toasty flavor
                       Caramel is a oneingredient recipe for experts two for more cautious cooks who add water to the sugarbut either way it can quickly turn into a chemistry experiment gone wrong The problem is a rapid acceleration of browning which can quickly move your sugar sauce into bitter burnt territory Sugar behaves differently from other foods when its cooked While most ingredients absorb heat from the pan sugar actually generates its own heat as it breaks down This causes the temperature to rise fastabout one degree per second When you remove the pan from the heat as the caramel reaches the perfect lightamber hue it can   burn because residual heat from the pan keeps the action going The key is watchful handsoff cooking as slow and even as possible Adding  cup of water per cup of sugar dissolves the sugar uniformly and slows boiling providing more control as you look for that honeygold color Use a lightcolored stainless steel or enamel saucepan and a candy thermometer To make the caramel cook the sugar and water without stirring or absolutely minimal stirring if you must over mediumlow heat until golden and fragrant about  With experience youll learn to trust color more than temperature The handsoff approach works best because stirring can cause hot caramel to crystallize when it hits the cool sides of the pan and that can set off a chain reaction that ruins the sauce Set the pan in an ice bath for two to three seconds to stop the cooking any longer and the caramel will seize then use immediately
                       On turkey day its your wellearned right to parade that magnificent roasted bird around the dining room But carving is best done where theres elbow room and a large stable cutting surface Youll need a wellhoned knife have it professionally sharpened before the big day Now as the pros say break the bird down in the right order this is where many cooks go wrongtrying to slice meat directly off a big hot bird Leg quarters come off first then breast meat with the tuckedunder wings serving to stabilize as you cut Set the big pieces onto a cutting board where you can deal with them properly Take the breast meat off the bone in one piece then slice crosswise which ensures uniformity and allows for slightly thicker slices that are juicier and less fibrous than thin portions Cut the thigh meat into large chunks Reserve room on the platter for legs if you have a Henry VIII in the family Oh and rememberin the days leading up to Thanksgiving you can always practice your technique on a nice roasted chicken same configuration of bird parts no gameday pressure

                       Guacamole is a surefire and healthy party pleaser at least for those who arrive at the party early Stragglers know theyre late by the muddy brown shade the dip has assumed in the bowl Obviously oxygen is the enemy of guac as it is for sliced potatoes and apples The question is can you delay the oxidation process Leaving the pit in the dip an old myth doesnt help  A twopart strategy involves using acid to delay oxidation then doling out the dip as needed from an airtight container The antioxidant property of ascorbic acid plentiful in lemon or lime juice is your first line of defense Toss cubed avocado in citrus juice about  tablespoons per avocado then drain before mashing reserving the juice After youve mashed all your ingredients add some juice back to taste Still your dip will brown eventually if you serve all at once so serve in small batches with the rest stored in the fridge like so Rub a little olive oil onto a sheet of plastic wrap then press the wrap oil side down onto the surface of the dipthe thin film of oil creates an impermeable barrier with plastic as a reliable backup And the dip stays green
                       Nothing brightens a bite of a summertime muffin quite like the burst of a freshbaked blueberry unless you discover the poor things have sunk to the bottom where they have congregated into a mush The cause of sinkage is in a sense the season itself In the heart of the summer fat ripe berries may be more dense than batter causing them to drop  A dash of flour will help blueberries defy gravity for the very simple reason that the flour makes them stick to the batter and stay put Just toss blueberries with a tablespoon of flour before folding in But use flour from the recipedont add extra that will keep your ingredient ratios even As always be gentle when mixing the muffin batter As batters are overbeaten they can thin out exacerbating the problem and producing a poor crumb as well If your batter does seem a bit thin try sprinkling some of the berries on top just before baking
                        Stickage prevention is a process and it starts at the store Skip delicate flaky fish like tilapia cod or flounder and go with firmerfleshed fish such as salmon tuna or swordfish Pat the fillets dry with paper towels before grill time Now prep the grill Set the rack over a hot fire for five minutes to burn away lingering debris then scrub thoroughly with a grill brush Carefully lift the rack and coat with cooking spray Dont spray into the fire if you cant remove the rack swab it with oil using wadded paper towels held with tongs But dont use the tongs for the fish A spatula is less likely to tear the fillets Let the fillets cook undisturbed for a few minutes When theyre ready to flip theyll release cleanly
                        The longer it takes food to freeze the larger the ice crystals will be These big ice chunks destroy cell walls inside the food so when it thaws it loses structural integrity and turns mushy Big frozenfood companies use special equipment to flashfreeze berries individually This makes for small crystals so the thawed product better retains fresh taste and texture To approximate an industrial quickfreeze at home spread berries in a single layer not touching on a baking sheet and place the sheet in the back of your freezer The extra space allows more exposure to the cold freezing the fruit faster and preventing it from clumping Then transfer frozen berries to large ziptop bags
                        Slowly whisk a thin stream of the hot milk mixture into beaten raw eggs in a bowl Tempering will heat the eggs gradually without cooking them completely The milkegg mixture can then be returned to the pan and cooked as the recipe requires Be patient cooking though If you crank up the heat after tempering you can still wreck things even with the inclusion of flour or cornstarch helping to stabilize A small jump in the puddings temperature can lead to coagulation
                        Skim smarter Move the soup pot halfway off the burner every  minutes or so and skim from the edge thats tilted off the heat Impurities and fat gather at the coolest spotin this case the side of the pan off the burner Tilt the pan slightly as you skim to avoid taking off too much broth Simmer the soup gently and never boil That just churns fat into the broth making an oily unappetizing emulsion If time allows chill the soup overnight Fat will solidify on top simply spoon it off before you reheat
                        The examples above show that thinly sliced apples rather than wedged or cubed fruit deliver a trimmer pie profile Because sliced apples cook quickly steam is allowed to escape without lifting the crust Arrange slices tightly in the pie shell layering by hand as you would when making a tart to minimize air pockets than can also produce an uneven pie With nicely packed fruit you dont need to overfill a good ratio is about  pounds of apples per pie Remember to vent the crust Three large slits across the top will expel steam during baking leaving the filling even and juicy throughout
                        Cut veggies about  inch thick Items that stay whole like baby carrots can be your benchmark there Preheat the oven to between  and  with a heavy roasting pan inside the hot pan will jumpstart the browning process Spread oilcoated veggies in the hot pan in a single layer dont crowd them because that leads to steaming Stir after  minutes to promote even browning and prevent sticking Check after another  minutes and then pull when gorgeously browned and forktender If theyre well browned but still tough sprinkle with a couple of tablespoons of water reduce heat to  and cook until tender
                        Take the time to spread sauce and filling evenly and   especially on the top and bottom Putting plenty of sauce at least  cup in the pan first will prevent sticking and if youre using noboil noodles help soften the pasta If you seem to be running low on sauce stretch it with about  cup unsalted chicken stock or wine red for red sauce white for bchamel Spread another  cup sauce on top to keep the lasagna moist when you brown under the broiler later Be aware that noboil noodles absorb more sauce so if you use them keep the pan covered with foil during baking to retain moisture Even with conventional noodles if the assembled lasagna looks like it might get dry as it bakes minimize evaporation by covering it with foil for about twothirds of the baking time
                        Insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the tenderloin after the minimum cook time recommended by the recipe Even better insert a remoteprobe thermometer at the beginning of cooking Watch for  to  and then remove pork from oven If it reaches the desired temperature in the oven it will overcook as it rests Check once more before cutting and then carve
                        Sear the crust first to firm it up Put your pan or pizza stone in the oven as it preheats and arrange the dough on the hot pan before you top this sets the crust For veggie pizzas saut toppings to keep ingredients like zucchini and mushrooms from watering out as they bake and use restraint with those toppings Spread a scant layer of sauce about  cup so the dough is still visible underneath and finely chop or thinly slice vegetables big chunks cook unevenly If you have very fresh mozzarella drain off any excess milk before adding    
                        Flour first and keep your pan nice and hot Breading works best as a threestep process Dredge in flour dip in liquid usually egg or buttermilk and coat with breadcrumbs Flour helps the liquid cling which in turn holds the breading in place Shake off excess at every stage to keep coating uniform Heat oil over mediumhigh heat a drop of water should sizzle when it hits the pan and cook a few minutes without touching handsoff cooking helps form a crust that adheres Turn the food gently with a spatula tongs will pinch and tear the breading Cook until done    
                        Make the raw ounce patties a bit larger in circumference than the hamburger buns Press the mixture together gently overworking it increases contraction and makes the cooked meat dense and dry Use your thumb to make a nickelsized indentation a little more than  inch deep in the center of each patty This prevents the burger from doming into a ball keeping it flat and even as it cooks Voil no meatballs in sight
                       Also overworking the basil in the processor heats the mixture breaking down the chlorophyll which is the source of the green Some chopping is necessary for the herbs essential oils to release their flavor But a prolonged puree turns things muddy  Pulse dont puree Place whole basil leaves garlic cheese nuts and about  tablespoons oil in the bowl of a food processor and pulse  to  times or until a rough paste forms Repeat with more oil pulsing after each addition just until smooth You can also add a couple of tablespoons of parsley or spinach to help preserve that bright green color When its time to serve top hot foods with pesto in the serving bowl at the last minute rather than in the skillet To store place in an airtight container and place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pesto You can also drizzle on a top layer of oil to help prevent oxidation
                        Use plenty of water about  quarts per pound of dry pasta Give the pot a stir as soon as you add the pasta to help keep the noodles separated when they plunge in Boil vigorously until al dente Drain the pasta never rinse and do as chefs do Finish the last bit of cooking in the pan in which youve made your sauce The noodles absorb more flavor this way and everything just marries together nicely Add a little reserved pasta cooking water if the sauce becomes dry
                        Cook low and slow moving the eggs constantly in the pan this maintains the creamy texture Heat butter in a pan over mediumlow heat just until foaming then add beaten eggs You dont need to add water to your eggsit needlessly prolongs the process Use a wooden spoon to drag uncooked eggs to the center of the pan Dragging the spoon rather than stirring vigorously creates mediumsized curdsperfect for light fluffy eggs If you like smaller curds gently break the mixture more Make sure to remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are still glossy or slightly undercooked residual heat will finish cooking them
                        Relax your dough Its tempting to work homemade dough into a cohesive ball but this overdevelops gluten The dough should just hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand with bits of fat visible throughout Form the dough into a disk wrap and chill at least  minutesthis lets the gluten unwind To form the pie shell gently roll the dough into a circle larger than the pan at least  inches and then trim and flute Stretching a toosmall circle to fit the pan will stretch the gluten Chill the pie shell before filling If you feel youve stretched purchased dough chill it too this will relax the gluten and help prevent shrinkage The fat still solid from the fridge will melt and steam in the oven creating delicious flaky layers
