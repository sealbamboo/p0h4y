Many NHS trusts in England had to shut their maternity units in the past year with the most common reason being a lack of staff or beds Data obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act showed  trusts out of  respondents  or   temporarily closed units in  In  Conservative Party research found   shut their maternity units at least once Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said units closed on limited occasions He said the government had increased choice in maternity care saying the number of midwiferyled units had almost doubled since  There will always be very limited occasions when a maternity unit cannot safely accept more women into their care and may need to close temporarily  Any decisions to redirect women are made by clinicians as part of a carefully managed process he said Dr Poulter said the NHS which has  trusts in England remains one of the safest places in the world to give birth The latest figures come after the Conservative research in  found that one in  trusts had been forced to close their unit  times or more The  trusts identified this time represented  of those that responded to the BBC Freedom of Information request Some  had closed their units  times or more Many were for just for a few hours but there were examples of wards closing their doors to new patients for more than  hours until pressures had eased Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust closed the most times with  closures across two hospitals  the Queens Medical Centre  times and Nottingham City Hospital on  occasions This was followed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust with  closures across its two hospitals   Leeds General Infirmary  times and St Jamess University Hospital  times In Wales six out of seven health boards responded Four had experienced closures Scotland and Northern Ireland did not report any closures The findings come after a poll last year by the Care Quality Commission showed the maternity system in England was under strain A quarter of women reported being left alone during labour and birth at a time that worried them There are currently nearly  midwives in the NHS in England  a rise of more than  in four years But the Royal College of Midwives RCM believes there is a shortage of  because the birth rate is at its highest since the early s However the demands being placed on the service are also related to the larger number of complex births being seen because of factors such as obesity and multiple births linked to fertility treatment RCM chief executive Cathy Warwick said Birth is unpredictable and sometimes units get a rush of births that is unavoidable and cannot be planned for  However if units are regularly and persistently having to close their doors to women it suggests there is a serious underlying problem Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said This failure of maternity services can mean women get passed from pillar to post when having a baby This is hugely disruptive to labour
