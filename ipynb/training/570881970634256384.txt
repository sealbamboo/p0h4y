Jimmy Savile abused  people connected to Stoke Mandeville Hospital but the one formal complaint made was ignored an independent report has found It found Saviles reputation as a sex pest was an open secret among some staff  but allegations probably did not reach managers The formal complaint  made in  by an yearold girls father  should have been reported to police it added A separate report said elements of the Savile story could happen again The   said the victims abused from  were aged eight to  Sexual abuse by Savile ranged from inappropriate touching to rape  including the rape of children under the age of  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said people were too dazzled or too intimidated to confront the evil predator we now know he was  The report found  Dr Androulla Johnstone the reports lead investigator said the victims were patients staff visitors volunteers and charity fundraisers  with almost half aged under  and  under the age of  Around one third of his attacks were against patients just over  of the victims were female she said Savile was an opportunistic predator who could also on occasions show a high degree of premeditation when planning attacks on his victims However in a statement the victim of the  formal complaint said she felt let down and betrayed by the report She told the inquiry how Savile sexually assaulted her following an operation at Stoke Mandeville to treat skin cancer when she was aged  But she said parts of her evidence had been omitted from the report and criticised authors for concluding that senior management would not have known about her fathers complaint How they can say that those in authority did not know is inconceivable I feel that I am being blamed for not taking it further but I was just a child suffering from cancer The report is nothing but a whitewash she added Savile met Margaret Thatcher then prime minister to discuss the funding of Stoke Mandevilles spinal injuries unit in   and in the same year was appointed to oversee fundraising and rebuilding of the unit Lead investigator Dr Johnstone said supervision of Savile at this time was absent and  with statutory functions in the hands of a celebrity fundraiser  government and NHS lost control of the project The Stoke Mandeville report said the hospital trust had tackled Saviles power and influence there head on from  and managed to diminish his authority  but it took until  to resolve the situation This says a great deal about the power of the man and the legacy of the historical permissions that had been given to him it said In another report also newly published former barrister and NHS executive   While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional a unique result of the perfect storm of circumstances the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in future the Lampard report said There is always a risk of the abuse including sexual abuse of people in hospitals The report said society had a weakness for celebrities and hospitals must be aware of the risks  highlighted allegations of abuse and rape against Saviles older brother Johnny who worked at Springfield Hospital as a recreation officer in south London in the s It revealed allegations by five women against Johnny Savile who died in  dating back to between  and  The allegations were uncovered by Operation Yewtree officers It is easy to say Jimmy Saviles abuse of patients staff and visitors on NHS premises would not happen in todays health service But the report published by Kate Lampard on the lessons learned from the  NHS investigations shows this would be dangerously complacent While the majority of the crimes took place decades ago Ms Lampard still warns there are many elements that could be repeated She goes on to cite a host of weaknesses  from how the NHS deals with celebrities to policies on internet use and social media There is she says always a risk of abuse  including sexual abuse  in the NHS  But the difficulty is this how do you make what is essentially a public space safe when its so large The floor space of the NHS stretches across  million sq m  million sq ft  that is enough to cover the City of London nearly  times over  Responding to the reports Mr Hunt said no system can ever be totally secure from a manipulative and deceitful predator like Savile We learned last year that there were clear failings in the security culture and processes of many NHS organisations allowing terrible abuse to continue unchecked over many years What happened was horrific caused immeasurable and often permanent damage and betrayed vulnerable people who trusted us to keep them safe We let them down He told the Commons he would be accepting  recommendations made in Ms Lampards report But he would not be accepting one more recommendation that all NHS volunteers should be subject to enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service DBS checks he said Mr Hunt said  million will be made available from Saviles estate and charities for compensation claims Labours shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said The question that will be growing in the minds of people hearing this news today is this Where is the accountability That is what victims are crying out for and that is what must follow Hattie LlewelynDavies chairwoman of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust apologies to all of Jimmy Saviles victims I know how difficult it must have been for you to come forward and tell your stories after such a long time She said Stoke Mandeville was now a very different place but no sense of complacency would be allowed Liz Dux of law firm Slater and Gordon which represents  of Saviles victims said It beggars belief that a report which has revealed Savile was widely known as a sex pest at Stoke Mandeville can find no evidence of management responsibility She said victims deserved more accountability Simultaneously the Department for Education has published a string of reports by local authorities into   In a written statement Childrens Minister Edward Timpson said that although the investigations were complete they had been unable to substantiate any of the allegations He said None of the investigations have been able to reach firm conclusions about whether the alleged abuse took place or not  Although many of them say the informant was credible the lack of corroborating evidence has prevented them from reaching a definitive conclusion
