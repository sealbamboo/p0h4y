The next time youre tempted to make a phone call while youre behind the wheel remember this Dialing while driving increases the risk of a crash or nearcrash more than any other sort of distraction Thats one of the findings of a special report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine Other dangers identified in the report include reaching for a cellphone or other object texting or using the Internet looking at an object on the side of the road and eating These conclusions were reached by researchers who put GPS systems radar four cameras accelerometers and other equipment into the vehicles of  drivers with freshly minted licenses and  others who had been driving for an average of  years Study volunteers drove around in their gearladen cars for  to  months The data on the experienced drivers was collected in  and  before texting became prevalent and the novice drivers were tracked between  and  During the months studied the drivers got into a total of  crashes  among the novices and  involving the larger group of experienced drivers The researchers recorded another  nearcrashes which were defined as any circumstance requiring a lastmoment physical maneuver that challenged the physical limitations of the vehicle to avoid a crash for which the driver was at fault or partially at fault Crashes and nearcrashes involving drowsy drivers or drivers who were under the influence of drugs or alcohol were not included in the analysis Not surprisingly the novice drivers got into more trouble than their more seasoned counterparts when they tried to do something other than focus on the road ahead the researchers found Compared to periods when they werent distracted the odds of of a novice driver getting into a crash or nearcrash were  higher when they were dialing a cellphone  times higher when reaching for something besides their cellphone  times higher when trying to grab the phone  times higher when looking at something on the side of the road including cars involved in other crashes and  times higher when eating For the experienced drivers the only activity that increased the risk of a crash or nearcrash risk was dialing a cellphone That made drivers  times more likely to get into trouble behind the wheel according to the study results The researchers also discovered that the more experience the novice drivers logged the more likely they were to do something other than focus on the road ahead when they were behind the wheel This might because they become more confident in their driving abilities the researchers speculated Anything that takes a drivers eyes off the road can be dangerous study author Bruce SimonsMorton of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development said in a statement Our study shows that distracted driving practices are especially risky for novice drivers who havent developed sound safety judgment behind the wheel Parents can help their teen drivers by setting a good example and making sure they dont dial or text when theyre driving themselves SimonsMorton said They should also let their children know that they should wait until the vehicle is stopped before taking a call  even when its from mom or dad he added Â   and like   on Facebook
