Americans who ate a diet rich in animal protein during middle age were significantly more likely to die from cancer and other causes compared with people who reported going easy on foods such as red meat and cheese fresh research suggests The   published Tuesday in the journal   was based on an analysis of data from   an ongoing federally funded study that surveys Americans about their eating habits and behaviors In this particular study researchers tracked about  older adults included in the survey to find connections between dietary patterns death and disease The research shows that a lowprotein diet in middle age is useful for preventing cancer and overall mortality wrote coauthor   the AARP Chair in Gerontology at the University of Southern California in a release about the paper But heres the catch The researchers also found that for older people ages  and up there may be a benefit to eating more protein In this age group higher levels of protein seemed to be protective against cancer and premature death So how might these agedependent effects be explained Well   the director of the Longevity Institute at USC who led the research points to changes in the growth hormone known as IGFI When were young IGF help promotes growth which is good But as we age too much protein in our diets may lead to overly high levels of IGF which may contribute to aging and DNA damage Longo explains Then after  when IGFI levels trail off our bodies may benefit from more protein in the diet to help fend of frailty and decline Weve suspected that this is the case Longo tells The Salt In his view most middleaged Americans are eating too much protein The findings he says build on previous research hes done on IGFI including   that looked at a group of Ecuadorians who had low levels of cancer and diabetes due to a genetic mutation that lowered levels of IGFI In the new study Longo and his colleagues found that highprotein foods derived from plants such as beans and nuts did not have the same effect on mortality as did highprotein foods from animals Singling out the effects of protein in the diet is hard to do For starters our diets are complex and sussing out the independent effect of any one component is tough Whats more surveying people on what they have eaten as NHANES does and then trying to figure out how that influences their health years later is a tricky business So there are still lots of questions about how to interpret these findings In an age when advocates of the Paleo Diet and other lowcarb eating plans such as Atkins talk up the virtues of protein because of its satiating effects expect plenty of people to be skeptical of the new findings That said as weve previously reported several other studies have found a link between a high intake of red    especially   like bacon and salami  and other animal proteins and an increased risk of mortality But could eating meat and cheese really be as bad for you as smoking as the university news release describing the new   paper suggested Well that may be an exaggeration according to Dr   a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies the links between health diet and lifestyle The harmful effects of smoking on cancer and mortality are wellestablished to be substantial while the harmful effects of red meat consumption are modest in comparison Hu wrote to us in an email For instance in a study Hu authored people who ate a serving of red meat   day had a  percent increased risk of mortality compared with those who ate little meat By comparison people who swapped out red meat for alternative sources of protein cut their risk of premature death Choosing chicken and other poultry decreased the risk by  percent fish decreased the risk by  percent and legumes decreased the risk by  percent So the debate about how much protein is ideal  and from which sources  will go on In the meantime if youre feeling confused consider the one strategy that almost all experts agree on moderation The simplest way to maintain a healthy body weight and cut the risk of so many weightrelated diseases is to limit calories So eat what you enjoy Upsize servings of greens and other vegetables And downsize servings of meat cheese and other highcalorie foods
