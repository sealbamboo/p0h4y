Americas young people as a group are becoming more out of shape with every passing year regardless of their familys economic situation a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports The finding raises troubling questions about the future health and longevity of our children and suggests that parents and other authority figures need to find better ways to get our youth moving For the past few decades accumulating data and anecdotal evidence have shown that children in the United States are becoming more sedentary Less than a third of young people ages  to  are said to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity for their age group which would be about an hour a day of exercise  Instead epidemiological studies suggest physical activity among American youngsters peaks before age  and perhaps as early as  and begins a steady and accelerating decline after that By some reports children typically spend eight to  hours a day   with their screen time rising in summer when school doesnt interfere  But those statistics and past epidemiological studies though worrisome dont provide direct physical evidence about how aerobically fit  or not  young people  might be So for the new study which was   researchers with the CDC turned to the huge database about American health habits known as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or Nhanes Intermittently in past years CDC scientists have expanded on the usual annual Nhanes telephone questioning by inviting some respondents to visit a mobile physiology lab for more extensive physical testing And they did so again in  winding up with a group of about  boys and girls ages  to  representing a variety of ethnic groups  and socioeconomic circumstances  The researchers had  their subjects jog on a treadmill to determine cardiorespiratory fitness Similar treadmill testing had been completed with smaller groups of young people in past years  Then the researchers compared their volunteers fitness to what it should be based on agespecific benchmarks developed recently by the CDC and other institutions that researchers called the healthy fitness zone  Few of the young people qualified to be in that zone Over all only  percent were as fit as they should have been given their age  and that percentage fell precipitously among girls Less than  percent of the female participants had fitness levels that would set them within the healthy fitness zone the testing showed compared with about  percent of boys  Ethnicity and family income played no discernible role in the volunteers  fitness according to the data Those from affluent families were as likely to be out of shape as those from families below the poverty line  The findings grew bleaker when researchers compared the fitness of the group in  to that of similarly aged volunteers from  to  The average fitness of the boys and girls they found had declined by about  percent since   Really this is not good news said Janet Fulton a lead epidemiologist with the CDCs Physical Activity and Health Branch who oversaw the new study Were talking about a better than  percent per year drop in cardiorespiratory fitness among a group for whom  she said physical activity should come naturally The potential longterm health implications for the countrys young people are disquieting she continued Theres strong evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the best indicators of lifelong health reduced disease risk and greater longevity she said So kids who are less fit when theyre young are likely to be less healthy when theyre adults  That message is hardly new but is worth repeating said Gordon Blackburn the director of cardiac rehabilitation at the Cleveland Clinic who was not part of the new study but says he witnesses its implications  every day Thirty years ago we would not have expected to see yearolds with symptoms of cardiac disease he said Now weve had to start a pediatric preventive cardiology clinic The solution to the falling levels of fitness and heart health among young people is theoretically simple he and Dr Fulton agree Get kids moving Dr Fulton said  But in practice this recommendation probably requires the active participation of parents or other authority figures Inactivity is a family issue Dr Blackburn said If parents arent active kids wont be  So in the coming weeks he said try instituting afterwork family bike rides or swim outings Or counter the hours that your family is spending watching the World Cup with some rousing backyard games of dribblepastMomasifshewerestandingstill  If its fun Dr Blackburn said kids will keep doing it
