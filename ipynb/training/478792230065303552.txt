More diseased meat could end up in sausages and pies because of changes to safety checks in slaughterhouses hygiene inspectors have warned  Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease But under new European regulations supported by Britains Food Standards Agency FSA they will have to rely on visual checks alone  The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK   Ron Spellman a British meat inspector with  years experience says   which took effect from  June risk diseased parts of animals going undetected  Mr Spellman who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection EWFC which represents meat inspectors across the EU said Last year we know that there were at least  pigs heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head They wont be cut now Theres no way to see those little abscesses little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes Meat from pigs heads is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies sausages and other processed foods The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority an agency funded by the EU but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA  The FSAs chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a handsoff system using visual checks to reduce crosscontamination because bugs like E coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern He said The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and thats what we must control We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten we have to do this properly But the FSAs support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff the  meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britains  slaughterhouses and in meatcutting plants which process carcasses  Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes Kevin Burrows of C and K Meats owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork  He sees the new handsoff approach as a backward step and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do But he says Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product Well end up with a twotier system  Shadow food and farming minister Huw IrrancaDavies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA  He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britains exports which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards Mr IrrancaDavies said We want to see absolute categoric assurances that this is not jeopardising consumer protection and were not reassured yet because despite the work that the FSA has been doing over a few years now to look at this issue what they have presented to us is not a compelling case for a change in the way that this works A Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Defra spokesman said The changes to the meat inspections will mean less cutting and handling of carcasses and offal reducing the potential risk of harmful bacteria spreading onto the meat Pigs will continue to be inspected for lesions by a vet and again after slaughter by a meat inspector All pigs for export will be inspected using the methods agreed with the markets we export to
