When Kerri Sparling was  years old she was diagnosed with Type  diabetes Her family didnt know anyone with the disease so they sent her to diabetes camp  where every single camper had Type  diabetes she says That was my first sense of not only other people who had diabetes but a true community says Sparling Things are very different today About   Americans have diabetes  mostly Type   and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that as many as onethird of adults could have diabetes by   People living with diabetes have created a vibrant online community Big drug companies are certainly taking notice  and some advocacy groups feel that the Food and Drug Administration should as well Sparling   her own journey with the disease on a blog she started in  Other people in the DOC  thats the diabetes online community  share on YouTube There are videos with advice on everything from   an insulin pump to telling your date you have diabetes There are also reviews of products to treat diabetes A few years ago drug companies started paying attention to these video testimonials and to bloggers talking about their products The companies even created their own social media sites Our primary platform is our blog Discuss Diabetes explains Dennis Urbaniak the head of diabetes at drug giant   They also have a   a Facebook   and a   and theyre looking into Pinterest and Instagram Getting involved in social media is a critical component of serving the diabetes community says Urbaniak And its not just serving the community its serving companies bottom lines Treating diabetes is extremely profitable Every year Americans spend more than  billion on diabetes care So in addition to tweeting about new products pharmaceuticals are sponsoring bloggers like Sparling If were talking about what we want from our devices it is in their best interest to be hearing that and making the changes were requesting so they can improve their sales Sparling says Sparling has a disclosure on her website stating she receives free products from two drug companies and that one pays her to speak at events and contribute at her site But critics say thats not enough People do not read disclosures The FDA and Federal Trade Commission need to create a whole new system for disclosing when a blogger or group gets paid by pharmaceutical companies says   of the Center for Digital Democracy He says pharmaceutical companies are using social media to promote their gadgets and drugs in a deceptive way Because you might find on a pharmaceutical website a series of videos that have been tested by the way to make sure that they really deliver the message and these messages testimonials appear to be people like you Although sometimes they are in fact paid or allied with a drug company says Chester Chester says pharmaceutical companies need to be very clear about their intentions and presence online An FDA spokesperson says the agency is currently working on guidelines for drug companies and social media but declined to make someone available for an interview Urbaniak of Sanofi hopes new guidelines wont interfere with his companys online dialogue He says tweets and Facebook comments help Sanofi connect with people in the diabetes community  and come up with ideas for ads In the past the ads would always show the perfect blood sugar number and the community says You know thats a bit insulting because it implies it is always easy to get this Show a number thats high or show a number thats low Make it real And so this is the kind of feedback thats been really helpful he explains But what are patients getting out of social media Its unclear whether connecting online is helpful for adults treating diabetes Theres no proof in diabetes that social networking is helpful says   a doctor at the University of California San Diego Medical Center Hes leading a study that will help determine whether social networking can actually help patients manage diabetes We know a lot of patients are on the Internet Patients are more likely to get information from the Internet than they are from the doctor says Bronner That isnt necessarily a bad thing Bronner refers patients to trusted websites and asks them what theyre reading online As a doctor basically what you want is to make sure the patient is relying on an accurate source of information and if you dont know that theyre on these websites youre not going to know they have a chance of getting misinformation says Bronner Blogger Kerri Sparling isnt worried She says the diabetes online community can tell when somethings fishy If we see someone swooping in with their chocolate shake that cures Type  diabetes theres going to be a voice raised saying Wait wait wait thats not true Or Dont come in and spam our community We protect ourselves in that way she says She says most people in the diabetes community want big pharma to pay attention to them Now that they are the challenge is making sure the relationship benefits people with diabetes and not just the drug companies
