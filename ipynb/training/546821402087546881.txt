A new genetics project could help unlock a series of secrets about devastating diseases the NHS says Under the scheme  Genomics Medicine Centres are being set up in English hospitals to gather DNA samples to help devise targeted treatments for a wide range of diseases  It is focusing on cancer and rare genetic diseases  The aim is to sequence  genomes within three years in order to develop new tests and drugs Doctors will offer suitable patients the opportunity to take part in the scheme   They will have to agree to have their genetic code and medical records  stripped of anything that could identify them  made available to drugs companies and researchers  Up to  cancer patients will have the genetic code of their healthy tissue compared to the genetic code of their tumour A giant game of spotthedifference will then take place to identify the precise mutations in DNA that are causing a patients tumour This would allow targeted medicines to be developed   Previous genetics research has shown how different cancers can be  for example that    each with a different cause and life expectancy and each needing a different treatment  And the development of targeted drugs such as Herceptin  given only if a patients breast tumour has a certain mutation  has been possible because of genetics research Meanwhile  patients with rare diseases will have their genome compared with those of their parents and grandparents Thousands of genetic diseases  which are individually rare but combined affect large numbers of people  could be identified by finding mistakes in the three billion pairs of letters that make up our genetic code  The resulting knowledge could give patients an explanation for a disease that has plagued their entire life Prof Graeme Black who will lead the project in Manchester told the BBC Its possible to sequence an individuals entire genetic makeup their genome in merely a few days where five years ago that was completely unimaginable Therefore its possible for conditions where theres a possibility that its genetic that we can identify genetic causes much quicker than had been imagined previously  Edward SherleyPrice has firsthand experience of just how little is known about some conditions  His yearold daughter Alysia has regular seizures  She was diagnosed with a developmental delay before her second birthday but the cause was unknown  It took until  for genetic testing to discover what was wrong  a rare genetic mutation in a gene known as STXBP The family say getting a diagnosis has given them a renewed sense of optimism The  Genomes Project could help people like Alysia by identifying a specific mutation which lead to taking part in future drug trials The NHS said it was aiming to be the most scientifically advanced healthcare system in the world The  Genomics Medicines Centres will open across England in February at The  centres are just the first wave of the project which will eventually cover the whole of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland are not taking part The pilots have been under way this year and  genomes will have been sequenced by January All the data produced in the  Genomes project will be stripped of anything that could identify the patient and then be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations  The projects leaders say it will be the partnership between the health service industry and academics that will deliver a new era of geneticsbased medicine NHS England medical director Prof Bruce Keogh said the impact of genomic medicine will be on the same scale as other British successes including the smallpox vaccine and IVF He said Our NHS is better equipped for the emerging science that will determine the future practice of medicine than any other Western healthcare system It puts us in a position to unlock a series of secrets about devastating diseases that have remained hidden for centuries for the whole of human kind  Life sciences minister George Freeman said We want to make the UK the best place in the world to design and discover st century medicines Angela Douglas chairwoman of the British Society of Genetic Medicine said The challenge of the project will be to embed its outcomes into routine health practice  The genetics community looks forward to working with researchers scientists associated medical specialists and Genomics England to meet that challenge
