For decades states have set rules for health coverage through mandates These laws require insurers to cover specific types of medical care or services The Affordable Care Act aims to curb this piecemeal approach to coverage by establishing minimum standards for insurance coverage in individual and small group plans nationwide and requiring states to pay for mandates that go beyond them States however continue to pass new mandates but with a twist Now theyre adding language to sidestep the health law making it tougher than ever for consumers to know whether theyre covered or not State mandates vary widely Some require coverage of broad categories of benefits such as emergency services or maternity care or of very specific benefits such as   infertility treatment or cleft palate care Others require that certain types of providers be covered such as chiropractors The requirements may apply to all individual and group plans regulated by the state or they may be more limited While patient advocates view state mandates as a crucial tool in their efforts to address coverage shortcomings the insurance industry generally opposes mandates saying they drive up the cost of insurance Since the health law established a comprehensive set of essential health benefits that individual and small group plans must cover unless they existed prior to passage of the law in  it was hoped that mandates would no longer be much in demand says   project director at Georgetown Universitys Center On Health Insurance Reforms Mandates are not the most rational way to build a benefit package says Corlette To discourage states from passing mandates that go beyond essential health benefits requirements the law requires states not insurers to cover the cost of mandates passed after  that apply to individual and small group plans sold on or off the state health insurance marketplaces If a mandate increases a plans premium states will be on the hook for the additional premium cost thats attributable to the mandate The payment requirement is waived until  says Kelly Brantley a senior manager at Avalere Health Rather than forgoing mandates altogether some states are simply excluding from the mandates plans that the states would have to pay for The result Consumers who buy individual or small group plans may not get the mandated benefits that are required in large group plans Selffunded plans used by many large employers to pay employee claims directly rather than buying insurance for that purpose arent bound by state mandates Thats whats happening with state mandates related to autism coverage says Lorri Unumb vice president of state government affairs at Autism Speaks an advocacy group By the groups count  states and the District of Columbia have mandates   In  states autism coverage is part of the essential health benefits typically because coverage was mandated before  and so was included in that states benchmark plan that sets the standard for coverage there New mandates are different For the most part the states that have passed autism mandates post Dec   have excluded ACAcompliant plans from the mandate Unumb says States have taken different approaches to structuring new mandates so they dont have to pay for them says Justin Giovannelli a research associate at Georgetowns Center on Health Insurance Reforms The law may say that the mandate only applies to large group plans for example or that it doesnt apply to any plans that are required to provide the essential health benefits A state may say that if the mandate increases premiums by a certain percentage the provision doesnt apply Confused Policy experts fear consumers will be too Your state has passed a law but everything is so market specific its hard to know what coverage youre getting says Katie Keith research director at the Trimpa Group a consultant for autism and other advocacy groups
