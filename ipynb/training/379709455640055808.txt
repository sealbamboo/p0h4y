A deadly brain amoeba thats killed two boys this year has been found in a US drinking water supply system for the first time officials said Monday  in a New Orleansarea system  The Naegleria fowleri parasite killed a yearold Mississippi boy who likely got it playing on a back yard Slip N Slide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say Tests show its present throughout the water supply system in St Bernard Parish directly southeast of New Orleans We have never seen Naegleria colonizing   before said Dr Michael Beach head of water safety for the CDC From a US perspective this is a unique situation N fowleri is a   thats usually harmless unless it gets up someones nose Its not entirely clear how or why but in rare instances it can attach to one of the nerves that takes smell signals to the brain There the amoeba reproduces and the brain swelling and infection that follows is almost always deadly It killed a Miamiarea boy last month  yearold Zachary Reyna  and a yearold Arkansas girl Kali Hardig is   after an unusual experimental treatment N fowleri is usually found in warm fresh waters all over the world Its been seen in hot springs and swimming holes freshwater lakes and even  used to clean out sinuses Incomplete disinfection probably allowed it to thrive in St Bernard which has its own independent water system Beach says The key to this is understanding that this amoeba is kind of a heatloving bug Beach said in a telephone interview If water temperatures start going up you really need to be extremely careful about maintaining the disinfectant The farther you go from a plant the more likely you are for the disinfectant levels to get low Thats what apparently happened in St Bernard which takes water from the Mississippi River and cleans it up for people to use We want all communities  checking the peripheries of their water distribution system Beach says N fowleri has only been reported in about  people in the US since  making it extremely rare Kali Hardig is only the third person known to have survived infection It was formally identified in  in Australia where it did contaminate drinking water systems for a while says Beach  In Australia it was basically water being pumped from rivers and overland he says The water got warm over long distances across the desert and the amoeba thrived Three children died after being immersed in baths and wading pools Better disinfection has meant no cases since  Australian health officials say  Lousiana health department spokesman Ken Pastorick says officials are flushing out and decontaminating the St Bernard Parish system a process that may take several weeks They have shocked the water so to speak Pastorick said What has caused the problem here is low chlorination Pastorick says other Louisiana water systems are safe Beach says its not necessary to test water systems for the amoeba Proper chlorination should always take care of it he says And he stresses that water is safe to drink and bathe in even if its contaminated Stomach acid appears to kill the amoeba and people can protect themselves by not snorting water up their noses or not allowing it to be forced up the nose St Bernard water customers are being cautioned not to fill kiddie pools with tap water or to use other water toys such as the sliding game that the yearold boy who died was playing on Topping up swimming pools with hoses is a bad idea too unless the water first goes through the disinfection system The critical piece is kids in the water Pastorick says
