 Looking for an   edge a way to stay faithful to regular workouts Try chilling out  literally Cooling the palms of the hands while working out helped   reports researcher Stacy Sims a research scientist and exercise physiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine She was to present her findings Tuesday at the American Heart Associations Epidemiology and PreventionNutrition Physical Activity and Metabolism scientific sessions in San Diego If you think about adipose fat tissue its a great insulator Sims said For people who are obese that means they often get too hot while exercising It would be like Lance Armstrong wearing a wet suit for the entire Tour de France she said Were trying to address those barriers Sims wanted to see if cooling off the hands of the women she studied might help them overcome fatigue and overheating while exercising The device she used is already in use by some professional athletes according to Sims She decided to test it in obese women who she finds often abandon working out due to overheating and fatigue The research was not funded by the company that makes the device In the study Sims evaluated  healthy women aged  to  None had exercised longterm in the past They were obese with a   BMI of between  and nearly  BMI is a measure of body weight in proportion to height and obesity begins at a BMI of  She assigned the women to one of two groups both held the cooling device in their palms but only one group had cool water  degrees Fahrenheit running through the device the other had water that was body temperature  degress Fahrenheit running through the device Both groups participated in three exercise sessions a week for  weeks Each session included  minutes of body weight exercises  minutes to  minutes   with the cooling device and  minutes of corestrengthening exercise They worked up to the time they could handle on the treadmill On the first day and last day of the study the women did a mile walk that was timed The cooling group shaved more than five minutes off their time for the  mile treadmill test They averaged  minutes at the start and  minutes at the end Their exercising heart rate went up too  beats per minute to  beats per minute  a good thing The cooling group also took more than two inches off their waist by end of the week study That improves not only appearance but health since big waists are linked with heart disease Their blood pressure also went down from  to  Below  is the goal In contrast the comparison group didnt show any substantial differences in any of the measures Sims found The cooling group also stuck with it more Sims said The controls dropped out early and skipped a lot of sessions Sims noted The cooling group seemed to get into the regimen she said At the end some women were running on the treadmill she said If you reduce the heat stress you reduce fatigue sweating and discomfort she explained You reduce a lot of the physiological barriers that make people say I dont want to continue The finding that the comparison group had no substantial effects is a bit strange said Duckchul Lee a physical activity epidemiologist at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina in Columbia He said he would have expected some effects after  weeks He added that the results may not apply to people exercising in a cold condition for example outside in winter Sims wants to do a study of the device with more people Meanwhile she says it wont hurt to try it this way at home Take a water bottle freeze it and take that with you in your bare palm as you work out As it melts you drink the cool water Its worth a try
