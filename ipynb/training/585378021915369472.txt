The NHS is facing such a chronic shortage of British nurses that one in four had to be recruited from abroad last year new figures from the   and Midwifery Council reveal The shortfall follows cuts in the numbers of training places in each year under the coalition government As a result fewer homegrown nurses are coming through the system The revelation comes when hospitals are under pressure to hire more nurses than ever before to care for the growing number of elderly patients and overall growth in the UK population During the   claiming that there were more nurses more doctors more people being treated He was accurate in claiming that more nurses are being recruited but it will be embarrassing for the Conservatives that so many have had to be recruited from abroad The Royal College of Nursing RCN has praised the skills of foreign nurses who come to the UK but warns that continually recruiting from abroad is expensive  and unfair on thousands of young Britons who would be keen on a career in the health service but are not given the opportunities A recent RCN survey estimated that there are  homegrown applicants a year seeking training places However in  there were only  nurse training commissions in the UK In each of the next four years under the coalition there were fewer places a reduction of  British nurses coming into the system The new figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council which was set up in  to maintain professional standards show that whereas in   of nurses were recruited from abroad in  that proportion rose to  Around  of those were recruited from the EU   with  from further afield including the Philippines and other countries in the far east In a recent interview Pat Read chief nurse at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital Foundation Trust said it costs around  to actively recruit a nurse from the EU before wages were taken into account Examples of recruitment trips by hospital trusts include those by  Aintree University Hospital Foundation Trust which spent  on a trip to Madrid to recruit  nurses only  of whom were still in the job after one year  United Lincolnshire   Trust which spent  on a trip to Athens where it recruited  Greek nurses  Colchester Hospital University Foundation Trust which   but failed to recruit a single nurse At the same time government figures show that spending on agency staff by foundation trusts alone has risen by m since   from m to bn in  Dr Peter Carter chief executive and general secretary of the RCN said nurses from overseas had made an important contribution to the NHS However the overreliance on nurses from overseas demonstrates a complete lack of longterm planning Instead of training the nurses we need to care for our sick and our old we go from famine to feast every few years by trying to plug staffing gaps from abroad when care becomes unsafe Then once things are under control the   cuts back again and the cycle repeats Proper workforce planning is the only way of meeting the extraordinary demands faced by care services in the coming years Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said Because there are not enough nurses coming out of training hospitals are having to tour Europe looking for recruits Labour will immediately increase the number of training places and is committed to  more nurses paid for with an extra bn each year
