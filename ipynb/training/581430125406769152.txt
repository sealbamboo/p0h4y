Labour would cap the amount of profit private firms can make from the NHS in England Ed Miliband has said as he launched the partys election campaign He pledged to halt the the tide of privatisation he claims has taken place in the health service since  and ensure a proper level of funding Private firms will have to reimburse the NHS if they exceed a  profit cap on contracts he told activists The Conservatives said the move was an illthought through gimmick Speaking at the site of the  London Olympics in east London Mr Miliband placed the NHS front and centre of Labours campaign and claimed the election is neck and neck and may come down to the wire The Labour leader said his party are the optimists and the UK can do better than another five years of a Conservativeled government whose extreme spending cuts would led to the disintegration of public services Although the election campaign is not officially due to start until Monday when Parliament is dissolved Labour is seeking to get out of the blocks early and to emphasise the choice facing the electorate on  May In other developments on Friday Labour is saving the majority of its new policy announcements for its manifesto launch but Mr Miliband  used Fridays speech to set out clear dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives on the NHS NHS treatment is free at the point of delivery for patients but external contractors are paid for providing a range of services to the health service  Under a Labour government profits on all private sector contracts worth more than  will be capped Mr Miliband said suggesting that private sector involvement was draining money away from the NHS  The cap will be set at a default level of  although this could raised or lower to reflect the specific terms of different contracts Any returns that firms make above this level would have to be ploughed back in full into the NHS to support patient care  while NHS commissioners will have the power to terminate private contracts early in the event of unacceptable performance Amidst Ed Milibands rhetoric on the drive to privatisation of the NHS which he claims is happening under David Cameron is a new policy  imposing a cap on profits made by private providers   Currently around  of health service provision in England comes from companies in the private sector    Labour wants to limit profit margins to  on all contracts above    But what we havent been told is how widely the net would be cast   Would the cap for example include dentistry and the private finance initiative Margins on some contracts like catering and cleaning are probably below   But the private sector argues that companies need a return if they invest up front to provide clinical services and that some might be deterred from bidding if there was a profit cap     What Labour if elected will have to decide is whether a shrinking pool of private contractors would make it harder for the NHS to keep up with rising demand for care Mr Miliband also committed to new controls to stop private firms cherry picking the most straightforward cases and to stop the forced tendering of services making clear the NHS must be the preferred provider for the majority of services Privatisation cannot meet the needs of a st Century health service he said The money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care and not for the excess profits of private firms The restrictions in combination with the bn in extra funding already promised by Labour will provide a double lock to protect the NHS he added The Conservatives responded by saying outsourcing to the private sector rose twice as fast under the previous Labour government than it had done since   This is no more than a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that isnt happening said Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt  It risks higher infection rates higher waiting times and chaos for our NHS With little to split the Conservatives and Labour in the opinion polls Mr Miliband stressed the contest is too close to call  Like so many races here during the Olympics it will go down to the wire Neck and neck he said But there is one thing that is clear There are only two possible outcomes in this election  a Conservative government or a Labour government He argued the UK cannot afford another five years of a Conservativeled government claiming David Cameron has raised taxes  times since  delivered the worst record on living standards since the s and is planning deeper cuts after  May They say thats as good as it gets We say Britain can do better than this he said At Fridays event Labour also unveiled its campaign battle bus which will travel round the country rallying support in key marginal seats Ten senior Labour figures will be on the bus as it makes its first visit to a seat in east London
