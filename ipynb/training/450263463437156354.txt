Charlie is like a lot of my patients Hes in his late s weighs a little too much and his cholesterol and blood pressure are both too high To lower his risk of a heart attack or stroke he takes daily pills to control his blood pressure and lower his cholesterol A couple of times a year Charlie visits me to make sure the drugs are working and arent causing problems Caring for patients like Charlie has become easier in the last few years because of something that you might take for granted in  electronic prescribing When Charlie needs a new medicine or a refill of an old one I send the prescriptions to his pharmacy right from my computer  the same one that has replaced the paper medical records we used to use My ability to prescribe his medicines electronically is a bright spot in what has been a   to computerization in health care Eprescribing is no small feat It requires that nearly every pharmacy in the country be networked And the drugstores computers have to be able to talk the language of scores of different electronic medical record systems in use none of which look or work exactly the same way For prescriptions computers make a world of sense Doctors and other prescribers can choose medications from a menu rather than having to remember the names and proper dosages With patents insurance information we can figure out right on the spot which medicines are the best deal for them  no more drugstore sticker shock The computer also alerts us to risky complications from combinations of drugs And some other problems with paper prescriptions are eliminated too Errors caused by lousy handwriting Plus you dont have to worry about losing a prescription or never getting around to taking it to the pharmacy About  in    prescriptions go AWOL All of this has come to pass in a little over a decade A Virginiabased   called Surescripts and its   made it happen Surescripts is run by a consortium of pharmacies think big chains like Walgreens and CVS as well as small independents and companies like Express Scripts that manage drug benefits Besides building a secure national electronic prescribing network Surescripts made sure that it would work with more than  different styles of electronic medical records so that virtually every doctors office whether large or small could participate With the massive   of electronic medical records in the last few years eprescribing has reached a critical mass In  half of all prescriptions filed were transmitted electronically over the Surescripts data network Its a huge health IT success story for a small but crucial part of the medical universe says   executive vice president of Surescripts who also serves as general manager of the companys prescribing network Yakimischak says that in addition to improvements in convenience safety and reliability eprescribing has an additional benefit that doctors love the rate of unfilled prescriptions drops by  percent But does all this convenience add to our national health bill Quite the contrary In the case of Surescripts neither the consumers patients nor the main users doctors are charged for transactions All costs are borne by the consortium that created and runs Surescripts in relative proportion to their share of traffic on the network The efficiencies gained in time saved alone pay for the networks costs Yakimischak said For all the success Surescripts has seen there are critics Data journalist   author of the book  describes Surescripts as a monopoly in all the worst senses of the word They ensure a continuous drag on innovation Mostly they are really slow Slow to approve changes and slow to respond Surescripts sees itself more as a utility thats operating for the good of the health system We dont use our size for economic leverage Yakimischak says We are always open to making things better We welcome people coming forward with possible solutions or improvements I know that my patient Charlie and I benefit from Surescripts For me his prescriptions go seamlessly into his electronic medical record and I can see how good a job hes doing at taking what I prescribe For him his refills are quicker and easier to get and theyre safer too
