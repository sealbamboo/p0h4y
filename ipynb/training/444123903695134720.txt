JuJu Harris didnt set out to write a cookbook but then again she didnt set out to accept public assistance to feed her son either Harris always wanted to work with nature My dream job was I was going to grow up and be a national park ranger she says It didnt quite work out that way She drifted from job to job in Oakland Calif where she was born At  she joined the Peace Corps traveling to Paraguay to help local farmers improve their crops While she was supposed to be helping the men  the ones who held the farming jobs and the money  she found herself drawn to the women and children She encouraged the families to put their money into both their agricultural businesses   their children I learned the importance of nutrition for women and how it impacts her family Harris says When the women improved their diets they had more mental energy to deal with their children too she says Years later back in the states Harris found herself in a similar situation  with small children postpartum depression and little money She knew she needed to take better care of herself so she began experimenting with a garden baking bread doing whatever she could to supplement the Women Infants and Children WIC food program staples she was receiving She taught herself to cook with kale collards cabbage and other inexpensive and nutritionally dense produce Neighbors came over She taught them how to cook too Although she has not yet reached her dream of becoming a park ranger Harris gets to spend plenty of time outdoors these days Shes now teaching lowincome families how to choose and cook healthy produce Shes a culinary educator and SNAP outreach coordinator with the   a nonprofit group dedicated to creating a more equitable local food system in the Washington DC area She drives the centers Mobile Market bus  a kind of farmers market on wheels  into some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city Working at the Mobile Market I talk to a lot of moms and many of them tell me I dont know how to cook A lot of them are teen mothers They pick up vegetables and say I dont know what this is Is it good Is it hard to cook  Harris says So she talks up the squash and the Swiss chard offering tips on how to store and cook them You can bring the food to peoples doorstep and make it affordable But if they dont know how to cook whats available in the end you havent changed anything she says Cooking skills are just one barrier to healthy eating A recent   by the nonprofit   shows that  percent of lowincome families say eating healthy is important but only  percent say they cook healthy dinners most weeknights A majority of the  respondents said cost and time to plan shop and cook are the biggest barriers to improving their nutrition After having dozens of these kinds of conversations a day Harris decided to put together a shopping guide and recipe book she could hand out to these moms Nothing fancy she says just a little something on some nice cardstock She told a couple of her Arcadia colleagues about the idea and they helped her take it a step further With the help of Arcadia volunteers and some major grant money Harris published a coffee tableworthy cookbook It features saturated color photographs and simple recipes combining   like milk eggs and beans with seasonal produce  dishes like GarlicCilantro Fish Marinade and Beet Greens With White Beans And Bacon It also includes tips for setting up a pantry and a seasonal guide to everything from apples to turnips Shoppers on food assistance who frequent the Mobile Market can now get free copies of the cookbook     is also available to the general public for  a copy   Harris wants to get the word out before June when the WIC program begins handing out farmers markets checks which recipients can use to purchase items from the Arcadia bus and other farmers markets Thats when young moms and others on limited budgets who want to improve their health really come out Harris says But many are afraid to try new foods for fear of wasting money she says so she gives them guidance suggesting small changes like one new meal a week Harris has an easy manner with these moms because she gets it Shes been where many of the people who come to the Mobile Market are now says Pamela Hess Arcadias executive director and the editor  as well as allaroundwrangler  of the cookbook JuJu is one part fairy godmother one part good witch Her garden is incredible  great tangles of flowers and honeybees and roses and vegetables climbing trellises and always another bed being laid Her food bears the same stamp of wild and whimsy and fundamental integrity Hess says I think some of these programs  people are wellmeaning but theyve never lived the life I was on WIC till my kid was  and one year my husband broke his leg Ive worked at a food bank Ive been on food stamps Harris says She also helped raise four stepchildren and a nephew and later had another child She says shes just doing her part The problem of food insecurity is so big I just do what I can do And I can cook She hopes the Arcadia cookbook will show that its possible to eat healthy on a budget Not easy but possible  cloves
