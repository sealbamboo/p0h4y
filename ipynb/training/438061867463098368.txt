The safest drug for relieving aches and pains lowering fever and treating headaches in pregnancy may not be so safe after all according to a new report  it may raise the risk of ADHD and similar disorders in their children Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen sold under the brand name Tylenol were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and similar issues They say it doesnt mean that pregnant women must never ever take the drug but they said women may want to avoid using it frequently until more studies have been done We arent saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity said Dr Beate Ritz an epidemiologist at the University of California Los Angeles who worked on the study You should just avoid chronic or longterm use Infections such as influenza in pregnancy are known to affect the brain development of babies  theyre   for instance Its one of the many reasons pregnant women are urged to get flu shots So the researchers in this study were careful to ask women if they were taking the acetaminophen pills to reduce a fever to treat flu symptoms Even when taking this into account women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD The team used an ongoing Danish study of  children and their mothers who were called up regularly during pregnancy and asked whether they had taken any painkillers at all All these women were asked had they taken any pain medications and fever medications any medications Ritz said About half had taken acetaminophen also known as paracetamol Ritzs team reports Monday in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics They also reported what kind of disorders they had But there are viral infections that the woman doesnt even recognize She just feels a little malaise That is why it is possible that it may not be the drug itself to blame but some infection the women had Ritz and other experts point out Its also possible that women who feel pain more acutely and take painkillers more often may also have some sort of genetic predisposition that raises the risk of ADHD The researchers were not able to make a clear estimate of risk based on dose But women who reported ever taking the drug had a  percent higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a  percent higher risk of a rarer diagnosis called hyperkinetic syndrome Still the findings dont show a clear causeandeffect I dont think one study alone is enough to say nobody should use acetaminophen in pregnancy said Dr Jeff Chapa of Cleveland Clinic Childrens Hospital who was not involved in the study However there are suspicions about acetaminophen UCLAs Dr Jorn Olsen who designed and led the study had set it up because of lab studies suggesting that acetaminophen might have a hormonelike effect on the developing fetus And its not the first study to show something may happen in people too A study late last year showed that women who took acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy raised the  in their children by  percent Pregnancy is just a very sensitive period of time where the hormones are very important to development Ritz said And although acetaminophen is considered a very gentle drug it is not harmless Large doses can damage the liver and even kill The Food and Drug Administration has   to limit how much they put into products It wasnt possible to compare acetaminophen to other painkillers and fever reducers such as ibuprofen because pregnant women so rarely took them Ritz said Chapa raises another possibility Maybe moms who favor acetaminophen for themselves also gave it to their children when they were very young and their brains were still developing Are those moms also more likely to give acetaminophen to their children after birth he asked Kate Langley a neuroscientist at Britains Cardiff University notes that its likely that more than one thing is going on with kids who develop ADHD ADHD is a complex disorder so it means that there are lots of different risk factors and we know a bit about some of them but we dont know a great deal said Langley who helped write a commentary on the findings We know that there are genetic and environmental and possibly prenatal factors but we know that none of them on their own cause ADHD ADHD diagnoses are   More than  in  children has been diagnosed with ADHD according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention although much of this is due to awareness and not a real increase in incidence experts say Nonetheless pregnant women need to weigh the risks Ritz says We make these tradeoffs all the time We would not take a woman off antibiotics when she has a severe infection during pregnancy Ritz said Its the riskbenefit ratio As much as we want to avoid every type of risk it is not possible In this case she advised it might be worth toughing out a headache The immediate takehome message is that if you are taking a lot maybe you shouldnt and really question whether you need to take it Chapa added And if you do thats fine but take a small quantity for a small duration If you have chronic pain maybe dont take acetaminophen for it McNeil Consumer Healthcare which makes Tylenol said pregnant and breastfeeding women whould consult their doctors before taking any medication We are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study however there are no prospective randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development the company said in a statement
