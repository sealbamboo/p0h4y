RIVERSIDE, Calif.—Deborah Clark said a voice named Dora told her to burn books in a hall closet. She lighted them while her elderly, ailing parents slept and then walked to the store to buy dog food.. Smoke from the fire in April 2012 killed both of them, the local coroner ruled. Prosecutors charged Ms. Clark with arson and murder. The 49-year-old woman is in protective custody in a Riverside County jail, awaiting a court hearing Thursday on whether she is competent to go on trial.
