Prioritising medical students with lots of friends for flu jabs could help increase the number of healthcare workers protected against the virus say Lancaster University researchers In a study in   they calculated that vaccination rates would rise if people with large social networks influenced their peers The government wants  of healthcare workers to be vaccinated At present only about half of them are vaccinated    More than  medical students at Lancaster University  who are soon to become healthcare workers  gave researchers information on how friendly they were with other students and how much time they spent with them The Lancaster research team then ran a computer simulation of an influenza outbreak  times to find out what effect vaccinating some wellconnected individuals had on the spread of the flu It is clear that some individuals have a disproportional effect on disease dynamics researcher Rhiannon Edge said  This study suggests that vaccination strategies that target highly connected individuals within a network might limit the spread of infectious disease  They said this was because people who are connected within a social network can influence each others behaviour even when not connected directly And sometimes this can work both ways If an individuals vaccination decision is affected by their immediate social circle clusters of unvaccinated individuals can develop  and these clusters may then facilitate outbreaks of infection PHE encourages healthcare workers and carers to get vaccinated because they could pass the infection on to vulnerable people with whom they come into contact Latest flu vaccine uptake figures from Public Health England show that more than  of people aged  and over have been vaccinated  However fewer than  of those aged under  with a health condition have been vaccinated and only  of pregnant women  In addition  of all twoyearolds  of all threeyearolds and  of all fouryearolds have been vaccinated with the nasal spray vaccine as part of the childhood flu immunisation programme
