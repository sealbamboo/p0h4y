On Feb  Alexandra Wolff ate steak mashed potatoes and broccoli for dinner Later that night sitting in her room she spent  minutes scanning pictures in   magazine She remembers those things just as she remembers that on Aug  she stopped at Target and bought Raisin Bran and on April  she wore a white buttondown shirt and on Oct  she went to TGI Fridays and spoke to the hostess who was wearing black leather flats with small bows on them Alexandra Wolff has whats known as   She is one of only  people in the US who have been identified with this ability All of these people can remember details about their lives that the rest of us couldnt hope to remember the strangers they pass on the street the first thing they saw when they woke up seven months ago And though its not clear why the brains of people with HSAM can do what they do what is clear is that this ability gives them an access to the past thats profoundly different from you and me If you think of  probably only a handful of memories stand out The daybyday is a blur We forget most of our lives But Alexandra says that remembering even an inconsequential trip to Target is an almost physical experience for her She says she sees what she saw that day hears what she heard and emotionally feels what she felt at the time Right down to getting sick to my stomach or getting a headache she says Its almost like time travel But being unable to forget can affect your relationship to the present people with this form of memory say Alexandra is  and lives with her mother in a long brick ranch house in southern Maryland She has dark hair and beautifully balanced features but hasnt really dated and seems to have few of the preoccupations of most yearolds She blames her memory for this saying it separates her from other people her age because they cant understand why shes so focused on things that have already happened Alexandra often feels frustrated with her preoccupation with the past It seems like you hold onto everything and it seems like youre just stuck in the past all the time she says It really bothers her For one Alexandra says in her life there are no fresh days no clean slates without association Every morning when she wakes up details of that date from years before are scrolling through her mind details that can profoundly affect the new day shes in For example the day before we spoke was a day when years ago in middle school a boy bullied her in one of her classes I didnt mention it to anyone she says but I mean still in the back of my mind I kept thinking and thinking about it It knocked some of my confidence down Because the past is so viscerally right there so available she finds that when the present gets overwhelming its hard not to retreat to the past Even though shes only  she says she spends huge amounts of time in her room with her eyes closed reliving the past in her mind particularly this one day a decade ago It was July   She spent that day in a bathing suit by a pool laughing and playing with her yearold cousin They ate macaroni and cheese and swam It was an easy innocent time She says she probably takes herself through that day in her mind four times a week Over the past couple of years she estimates shes probably spent close to  hours reliving that one day I mean I definitely say its a huge temptation I could if I didnt have stuff to do all day I could probably live in the past  Scientists think theres a reason why we forget It has long been believed by research scientists that forgetting is adaptive says   the University of California Irvine neurobiologist who first documented highly superior autobiographical memory McGaugh discovered HSAM by accident He got an email out of the blue from a woman named Jill Price who said she had a serious memory problem She couldnt seem to forget anything and like Alexandra this bothered her The emotions evoked by remembering bad things troubled her McGaugh says And so McGaugh started studying first Price and then other people with this kind of memory He found ultimately that there are differences in the brains of people with HSAM though its not clear whether the differences are the cause or the consequence of this ability But it is clear that its specifically this issue of forgetting thats different If you were asked to recall what happened to you earlier this morning youd remember roughly the same amount as someone like Alexandra But if asked about this morning three months from now for you it would probably be gone while for her its as fresh as it is for you today So its not that theyre superior learners McGaugh says its that they are very poor at forgetting The emotional effects of not being able to forget arent clear says McGaugh No one including McGaugh has studied it His sense is that there is variation in the group of  The effects of having this ability depends on the kind of experiences people have had in the past as well as their present circumstances he says But Bill Brown another person with HSAM says that hes been in touch with most of the people in the group and that everyone he has spoken to has struggled with depression He says that very few of them have been able to maintain a longterm marriage  the rumor is only  out of the  Brown himself though a pretty jolly guy recently separated from his wife And talking to him you do get the sense that the difference in his memory has led to misunderstandings in his relationships Just because I remember something that you did wrong doesnt mean that I still hold it against you he says But its taken me a long while to realize that folks without my ability probably dont understand that distinction Because after all if youre bringing it up the logic from the other side would be You must still hold it against me This is not in fact the case he says It has more to do with wanting you to be honest in your dealings What he eventually realized was that most of the people he talks to are being as honest as they know how to be They just dont necessarily remember Brown says its easier for him now because over time hes learned how to manage the memories not to focus on the bad stuff and instead use his memory to entertain himself But you know he says lifes rough and theres so much bad thats kinda there Sometimes he says he thinks it might be nice to forget
