You wake up feeling gross  stuffy and full of aches A quick Google search of your symptoms confirms that yes you probably have a cold and not the plague But what if you were directed to a site that had a legitimate sounding name but wasnt really accurate at all It sounds like a problem from the ancient days of the Internet Since then people have learned that gov leads to bona fide government sites but com could be anyone selling you anything How do you feel about health A new slew of web domains is coming down the pike like health doctor and clinic Theyre not required to have any medical credentials Thats deeply worrying to some public health advocates When consumers see edu they consider it an educational institution says   director of the Global Health Policy Institute at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine He worries that a consumer reading diethealth for example will follow its dietary recommendations without knowing their validity He gives the example of   a teenager who died in  from an overdose of prescription drugs illegally purchased from an online pharmacy and of the sites selling bogus cures that popped up during the HN flu epidemic Theres an Ebola outbreak going on Mackey says If I wanted to take advantage of this option I may sign up for ebolahealth That he says would look more legit than ebolacurescom Until the legitimacy of healths can be addressed Mackey wants a moratorium on the health domain While we might pay a few hundred bucks to buy a personal domain name the people who own domains like health pay millions of dollars to an international nonprofit corporation the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN for domain rights Since  this has been bidding and auctioning process with the highest bidder walking away with the ability to dole out thousands even millions of new sites tagged with a domain In  ICANN announced it was selling a list of new healthrelated domain names health doctor and med among others A number of leading health groups including the World Health Organization the World Medical Association and Save the Children started calling foul The problem they say is that theres no system in place for vetting ownership of the health domains A company called   was awarded the domain just weeks ago after other bidders bowed out It could sell   to the American Lung Association or to a tobacco company Mackey says but the two sites would be very different Buying a health domain absolutely falls into the tobacco industrys decadeslong history  of associating its products with health John Stewart Director of the Challenge Big Tobacco Campaign tells Shots He says companies like McDonalds are likely to grab sites like wwwmcdonaldshealth to associate its unhealthy food with healthy things Mackey authored a   in the journal  warning of these potential dangers He says companies like Phillip Morris who can pay big money to companies like DotHealthLLC for the names whether its wwwvaccineshealth or wwwmiraclecurehealth are going to win out The DotHealth LLC  says the firm wont allow illicit online pharmacies on their domain but Mackey thinks thats not enough He wants something closer to the guidelines for edu which require accreditation by a third party Other sites like aero use an aeronautical trade association to manage use of aero urls to ensure that people arent using aero sites to sell fraudulent airplane parts Thats proof that ICANN has the ability to do this says Mackey but they havent for this round of domains Hed like to see a panel of prominent members of the online health community discuss how to govern healthrelated domains ICANN officials say they are leaving it up to the winners of the domain to make the decisions ICANN doesnt go about regulating content or dictating the registries themselves says   Global Media Coordinator at ICANN We need more time to figure this out says Mackey because the impact on peoples health could continue for years
