We dont know too much about a Nepalese man whos in medical isolation in Texas while being treated for extensively drugresistant tuberculosis or   the most difficulttotreat kind Health authorities are keen to protect his privacy But we do know that he traveled through  countries  from South Asia to somewhere in the Persian Gulf to Latin America  before he entered the US illegally from Mexico in late November He traveled by plane bus boat car and on foot And all the way he may have unwittingly put hundreds of other people at risk of getting the highly drugresistant TB strain That possibility has triggered a farreaching investigation by the US and other health authorities to track down potentially exposed people around the world Its a huge effort thats ongoing   who heads the division of global management and quarantine at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells Shots The case   by Betsy McKay at the   provides a window on a problem that health officials say is sure to arise more and more often XDRTB is a more dangerous part of a bigger problem with multidrugresistant tuberculosis or   We estimate at any one time in the world there are about  cases of MDRTB Dr   of the World Health Organization tells Shots referring to multidrugresistant TB MDRTB isnt vanquished by the two mainstay drugs isoniazid and rifampin and requires more complicated drug regimens In  a young lawyer named   became the bestknown case of MDRTB when he flew to Europe potentially exposing other passengers XDRTB is resistant not only to   and   but also a class of drugs called   and one or more potent injectable antibiotics TB germs become drugresistant when patients fail to complete a course of treatment When a partlyresistant strain is treated with the wrong drugs it can become extensively resistant There are about  people with XDRTB strains like the Nepalese man whos in isolation Falzon says That means there are other people with XDRTB traveling the world at any given time Like the Nepalese man until he got to the US Falzon says many of these XDR cases arent even diagnosed To give some idea of the public health challenge such cases present Dr   of the CDCs division of TB elimination tells Shots that over  people were thought to be exposed to the Nepalese man while he was in the custody of the US Border Patrol Out of those  percent or so are back in their country of citizenship which then leaves many others that are being sorted through to determine if their exposure was real or not Castro says But at least those potential contacts were known Falzon says its almost impossible to trace people who may have had close contact with the man during his complicated itinerary We cannot trace down a bus tour which happened within lets say the space of a few weeks Falzon says And its very difficult to get details The person in detention doesnt speak English The longhaul flight he took from a country on the Persian Gulf to Brazil which exposed fellow travelers sitting within a couple of rows of his seat occurred months ago Were trying to track down the exact details of that flight and the persons who were exposed the WHO official says TB is spread through droplets in the air released by coughing or sneezing It requires close and prolonged exposure so a shorter flight for instance is not thought to pose a danger Castro says theres no reason to think XDRTB is more contagious than lessresistant or drugsusceptible strains The alarm bells have to do with the consequences of the disease he says  that is the twoyear toxic costly drug regimen necessary to cure the infection One big advantage these days Castro says is a lab test that can tell within two days whether a patients sputum contains TB bacilli with mutations that confer resistance to seven different drugs This is a gamechanger Castro says The TB organism is notoriously slowgrowing so it used to take six weeks to culture it in laboratory dishes and test its susceptibility to different drugs The result is that some folks died before results of drug susceptibility tests came back he says The CDC has recorded  cases of XDRTB from  through  the most recent data available more than half of them among foreignborn people When illegal immigrants with drugresistant TB are isolated in ICE detention facilities things get complicated They cannot be deported until theyre no longer contagious which can require months of complex treatment Otherwise theyd pose a risk to fellow travelers But Dr Edward Zuroweste of the nonprofit group   says just because such patients are no longer contagious doesnt mean theyre cured This requires at least two more years of treatment  often back in a home country without specialists in treating drugresistant TB or access to the proper drugs Zurowestes group has a contract with ICE to make sure deportees have appropriate treatment It checks up on them regularly to see if theyre sticking with it He says  percent complete treatment and the rest either disappear or refuse further treatment He says the US and other nations should expect to see growing numbers of these difficult cases Theres no way to ever isolate the US from an airborne disease Zuroweste tells Shots The world is becoming much smaller and people travel a lot So what we have to do is attack the disease not the individual unfortunate enough to contract the disease
