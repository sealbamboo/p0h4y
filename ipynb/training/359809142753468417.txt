Darren Taylor aka   professionally jumps from high ledges landing bellydown in a small pool of water Even reality shows have caught on to the entertainment value of a wellexecuted bellyflop ABCs Splash features celebrities executing dives poorly For those of us who may not be the best divers there is good news Bellyflops rarely cause serious injuries That said lets talk about what can happen other than a bruised ego The higher you jump or dive from the faster you will hit the water Some experts believe that you can reach speeds of up to  mph diving from a meter board almost  feet And as nice as the water feels when you are in it it does not act that way when you enter it at a high speed  The most common injuries seen with bellyflops are contusions or bruising of the skin Rarely do these bruises go deeper and affect your internal organs but they can  Deeper abdominal injury from belly flops is known as blunt abdominal trauma It is similar to being hit on the belly really hard It can affect organs such as the liver kidney pancreas and the bowels Not only is the abdomen taking the brunt of the landing into the water at a high velocity there is also sudden deceleration both of which can cause trauma to the organs Children are more vulnerable than adults because they have less abdominal fat and a relatively larger abdominal cavity After a bellyflop it is normal for the skin to sting for a while If the pain is persistent or if you see blood in your urine or stool you should see a doctor right away Helpful hint If you find yourself turning from swan to hippo in midair try to lessen the blow by breaking the water with your fingers or feet When you fall flat the larger surface area causes a bigger impact The biggest danger for daredevils comes when they leap from high ledges without knowing how deep the water is below Hitting the bottom of the pool lake or river headfirst could cause a spinal injury which could lead to paralysis or death  Always make sure the pool is deep enough before you dive or intentionally bellyflop When in doubt always jump feet first A pool with a meter springboard must be a minimum of  feet deep at the point directly under the edge of the diving board For a meter board the water must be  feet deep For a meter platform the water should be  feet deep  Also be sure to dive off the tip of the diving board  Never dive from the side as there is a risk of hitting the side of the pool or landing painfully on a sloped bottom near the wall Bottom line Swimming is a great activity and kids are unlikely to injure themselves by just being kids Follow these simple safety rules and provide supervision  even for good swimmers   to have a fun injuryfree summer
