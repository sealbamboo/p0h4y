A new kind of genetic test that analyzes all of a persons genes can provide a diagnosis about a quarter of the time for patients whose conditions have baffled doctors scientists reported Saturday And for young children with mysterious developmental delays the test gives a diagnosis more than  percent of the time The test is called wholeexome sequencing and it looks at all  or so genes in the human body Its not a whole genome sequence because it leaves out DNA thats not classified as a gene But such tests provide a good map of the socalled protein coding sequences It was a relief for Audrey Lapidus of Los Angeles whose baby son Calvin seemed just fine at first But at  months an osteopath suggested genetic testing She said he had some very interesting facial features Lapidus told NBC News Other pediatricians rejected the notion But then he just wasnt hitting the milestones she said He wasnt sitting up or rolling over Still pediatricians and friends alike reassured her A basic genetic panel came back clear Everyone wants to tell you about their nephew who didnt walk until he was  and he graduated from Harvard Lapidus said I was holding on to those stories At the same time she continued to visit geneticists and neurologists Deep down I knew something was wrong she said Calvin became the first child at UCLA to get a wholeexome genetic test at UCLA in  When it came back it showed Calvin had PittHopkins Syndrome a rare genetic disorder affecting only  children worldwide Its caused by a single mutation on one gene found on chromosome  It causes developmental delays seizures and as Calvins osteopath suspected distinctive facial features such as thin eyebrows and sunken eyes Children often never learn to speak or walk without help It wasnt the answer I wanted Lapidus admits She wanted to hear that Calvin was perfectly normal if a little delayed But at least it was an answer A diagnosis makes a huge difference she said At least now I know what to expect And she found other parents I talk to these women in North Carolina and Iowa We write practically every single day They compare notes on daytoday challenges Little things like what meds are you using for seizures how are you handling school she said And the former journalist hit the Internet and found a group of parents seeking answers Now called the   its managed to raise  million says Lapidus Theres no specific treatment yet for the condition But the group is funding research and Lapidus has invested in speech therapy and physical therapy for Calvin whos now  Our study is the first to show that sequencing a childs genome together with his or her parents dramatically improves geneticists ability to reach a firm diagnosis in rare disorders said Dr Stan Nelson vice chair of human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA who helped lead the study Nelson Hane Lee and colleagues tested  patients with undiagnosed genetic conditions between January  and August  and found wholeexome sequencing gave a cause in  percent of them overall In  kids under  with developmental delays the diagnosis rate was  percent they report in the Journal of the American Medical Association They say their findings also released at a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics support broader use of the test which costs about  Lapidus said in Calvins case health insurance paid  percent of the cost A second study in JAMA found similar results Yaping Yang and Christine Eng of the Baylor College of Medicine and colleagues tested  patients and found a genetic cause in  percent of them including previously unidentified diseasecausing mutations All families deserve a clear diagnosis of their childs condition said Dr Wayne Grody director of the UCLA Clinical Genomics Center This is immediately useful to families and physicians in understanding how the disease occurred preventing unnecessary testing and developing the best strategies to treat it
