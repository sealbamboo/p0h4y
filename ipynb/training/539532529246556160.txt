In the United States  out of  kids diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia will live In Jordan the survival rate is  percent And while cervical cancer patients have a fiveyear survival rate of over  percent in countries like Mauritius and Norway the rate in Libya is under  percent Thats the sobering news from the largest   ever published It surveyed more than  million patients and reveals a huge gulf in cancer survival worldwide But theres good news as well In most countries survival from some of the commonest cancers has been improving says   from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine one of the studys authors More people are surviving breast cancer colon cancer and stomach cancer than ever before especially in the US and Europe The survival rate for breast cancer in France and Finland for example is  percent The data from other regions are also encouraging Brazils breast cancer survival rate has gone up from  percent in  to  percent in  The reason that some countries lag behind is not surprising its a matter of how much is invested in cancer care   head of global oncology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle met a doctor in Uganda a few years ago who was then seeing  patients a year in a facility that had  no roof inconsistent electricity and no meds Whats more says Casper he was the only cancer doctor in Uganda and four surrounding countries Cultural barriers can also interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer Uganda has  tribes each with a different language Many tribes dont even have a word for cancer Casper says So people may go a very long time before they realize they have a problem When they do seek care its usually too late More than  percent of the patients who come to the cancer institute in Uganda come with stage  or stage  cancer Casper says But its not all doom and gloom Uganda is opening a   next month in the capital Kampala with help from USAID and the Fred Hutchinson center Smaller centers have sprung up elsewhere in Africa in Latin America and in southeast Asia Yet as the study makes clear there is still much work to be done  and the scope isnt fully known There are countries where we have no idea how many people die from a certain cancer because there just arent good data
