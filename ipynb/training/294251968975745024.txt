 Scientists say theyve identified the first gene directly linked to the most common form of   known as plaque psoriasis We have searched for almost two decades to find a single gene linked to plaque psoriasis study senior author Anne Bowcock professor of genetics at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said in a university news release Individually the rare mutations we have found likely confer a high risk for the disease and we think they will be important in the search to find new more effective   In conducting the study researchers used cuttingedge DNA technology to uncover a rare mutation in the CARD gene in a large family of European descent with a high prevalence of plaque psoriasis and   They also found the mutation among multiple members of an extended family from Taiwan who had the condition which is characterized by dry raised red patches covered with silvery scales The genetic mutation was also identified in a yearold girl with a severe and rare form of psoriasis but in this case the condition was not inherited She developed the condition after being treated for a   This is significant because it tells us that CARD alone plus an environmental trigger is enough to cause psoriasis Bowcock explained You dont need anything else This really highlights the importance of finding rare mutations for common diseases like psoriasis The findings suggest that immune cells are only a secondary cause of psoriasis Skin defects the researchers stated are the main culprit behind the condition Noting that the family members studied who had psoriatic arthritis also had the CARD mutation the study authors suggested the rare mutation may also be involved in at least one other form of psoriasis as well as a debilitating form of arthritis Now we have a much clearer picture of what is happening in psoriasis Bowcock concluded And now with all kinds of new therapeutic targets that lie within the CARD pathway the field is wide open The research was released online in advance of print publication in two separate papers in the May  issue of the   About  million Americans have psoriasis the study authors noted
