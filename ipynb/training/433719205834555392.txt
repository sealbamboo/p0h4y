Let me tell you something that happened to me here two months ago Its going to be a little hard to talk about this because Im ashamed of myself in plain English One day they came and asked me if Id like to move to another room And when I was taken to the other room I saw Ada a black lady sitting there in her wheelchair with her oxygen tank beside her And we had a nice little chat and I left But first thing I noticed was that she wasnt white like I am which is the thing that stopped me from moving into the room with her And when I got back to my own room I sat there and I said What did I just do Rosa youre not a nice person at all I felt very bad about that so every time I went by her room I would go in and sit and talk with her  I felt kind of warm every time I went in to talk to her And we got to be friends When it comes right down to it she is not one bit different from me She believes in the same God I do She has children grandchildren  Even as old as I am you think youre not prejudiced but all of a sudden you really find out you are How stupid I was Cause before you know it its all over Thank God I had a chance to really get to know this wonderful woman I always felt that I could work forever Made me feel like I was a worthwhile person I liked the companionship of people around me and were all working I really feel like a dope I should never have stopped That was the sorriest day of my life Here I am at the end of my life in a nursing home  As nice as this place is theres an undercurrent  its sad also I get up now in the morning and Ill say to myself What am I gonna do all day now I think about my life the way it used to be Then I say Oh dont be so crazy It cant stay the same forever and you cant live forever Just think how crowded wed be if no one ever died So some days I feel very blue Other days I get up and say Well the sun is shining its gonna set pretty shortly I hope I try not to be sad about it because Ill be kind of glad to go Wherever Im going Im glad Im gonna go
