Who could condemn someone for staying far away from a parent even an ailing or dying parent who mistreated him or her as a child The last time I   most readers understood that response Many who had suffered through similar experiences said they had taken the same stance  He was a terrible father and mean so I didnt feel bad about moving out of state a few years before he died wrote Murre from Alaska  I was glad not to see him anymore and relieved when he died Adam from Phoenix spent his childhood traumatized by his parents abuse They remain unapologetic and Id gladly let them rot if they one day could not fend for themselves he wrote Yet we also heard from people who had agreed to become caregivers even if their parents had been or remained abusive I live by a moral code said Minerva from New York City who cared for her alcoholic and bipolar mother It was my responsibility and I stepped up to the plate Helen S from Connecticut supervised her angry meddlesome mothers care and had lunch with her nearly every Sunday until she died I felt I had done the decent thing and it helped me to put the remaining anger and resentment to rest Helen wrote    We know relatively little about how many adults become caregivers for abusive or neglectful parents or about why they choose to  or not to But thanks to a recent study we can see that those who report having endured childhood maltreatment    This finding emerged from a study by two Boston College researchers using  to  data from a continuing survey in Wisconsin  The researchers located  adults over age  who were caring for one parent generally a mother or both Almost  percent reported physical verbal or sexual abuse as children and  percent reported neglect That is a substantial percentage  perhaps because the definition of abuse included frequent swearing and insults or perhaps because corporal punishment was more common  years ago said Sara M Moorman a sociologist and coauthor of the study But it is in line with what other studies have found when participants are asked to recall their experiences The researchers divided their sample into three categories those with no history of childhood abuse or neglect those who had been abused and were caring for their nonabusive parent and those who had been abused and were to borrow the studys memorable title caring for my abuser They also compared caregivers neglected as children with those who were not neglected Those who had been abused or neglected were more likely to have symptoms of depression  like lack of appetite insomnia trouble concentrating sadness and lethargy  than those who had not been No surprise there perhaps But the link was strongest for the third category The key was caring for the abusive parent said the lead author Jooyoung Kong a doctoral candidate in social work Years later they are still affected Theyre more depressed Like many studies this one raises questions as well as answers them Its definition of caregiving  having ever provided personal care to a parent for a month or longer  could have included all kinds of arrangements It doesnt measure how long ago they provided care or whether they lived with a parent or not Ms Kong said She plans to include details from other surveys as her research continues But the study does indicate that caregivers with a history of maltreatment    and if the strain of caregiving becomes overwhelming the increased risk that they will abuse their charges perpetuating a sorrowful cycle   Its such an untenable position to be placed in Dr Moorman said My guess is people only do it if theyre forced to if theres no one else to do it People in that situation should be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression she said and seek therapy or find a support group  The rest of us are hardly in a position to judge those who walk away But our societys overreliance on unpaid family caregiving can make that difficult to do As Dr Moorman pointed out Not only nice people get old
