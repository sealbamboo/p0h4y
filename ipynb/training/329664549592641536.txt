 Dr Fishman noted that aging brings impairments of range motion strength and balance that can require modifications even among veteran yogis like using the support of a chair or the wall for many poses In addition students may begin to feel the effects of arthritis injuries and other ailments that may require students skip certain poses altogether Someone with osteoporosis for example may want to avoid headstands and poses requiring extreme spinal flexion or extension while someone with glaucoma may want to avoid taking the head below the heart in poses like headstand handstand shoulder stand and standing forward bends When in doubt about the safety of practicing with any specific medical condition Dr Fishman recommended working with a doctor Generally speaking a warmup sequence is important for the veteran yogi Ms Owerko said Our bodies may need more time to warm up properly especially if we are experiencing stiffness or arthritic changes in the joints or in areas that may be more vulnerable to previous injuries she said It is also important to include various onelegged standing poses  Tree Pose or Eagle Pose are examples  that challenge ones ability to balance even if you need the support of the wall Ms Owerko said Weightbearing poses like Plank Pose and Forearm Plank and standing poses like Warrior pose variations are also important to help counteract the decline in muscle mass and strength as we age she said To help maintain flexibility poses like standing or seated forward bends and hip openers like Bound Angle Pose or Pigeon Pose are also important said   a longtime Iyengar yoga teacher and research psychobiologist in San Diego Mr Cole emphasized that a regular yoga practice can help the body maintain a high level of flexibility into midlife and beyond If a student continues the same practice as much as possible without interruption through the s and beyond he or she will see a gradual decline in certain abilities but not necessarily a decline in flexibility he said I think the average person probably does get stiffer as they age he said but I believe that its mainly because they stop doing the things that keep them flexible The passage of more and more baby boomer yogis teachers as well as students into and past middle age has sparked interest in creating a new kind of peer yoga community as well  a longtime yoga teacher who passed the year mark a few years ago started a class in Del Mar Calif aimed at yoga veterans  and over Called   it was intended to offer veteran yogis the chance to keep learning in an environment that is comfortable and encouraging  People want to be pushed but not in the same way they did in their s she said They want a little slower pace  Slower pace or not Ms Rumbaugh includes a full range of poses in her classes including backbends and inversions A recent Wisdom Warriors workshop presented by Ms Rumbaugh and   at the Yoga Journal Conference in New York in April would have been a vigorous day of yoga for students of any age  Debra Hodgen  of Vista Calif is a student in Ms Rumbaughs class A former dancer she said that she began a consistent yoga practice when she was  She said she has become stronger and more fearless as a result of the class despite having osteoarthritis no cartilage in her right knee and joint pain throughout her body  I may have trouble just sitting in simple crosslegged pose but I did full Monkey Pose recently she said The most important way a seasoned student will be able to continue to practice safely many teachers say is to listen to signals their body sends them in class and know when to back off In my experience older students often bring a mature wisdom to the practice said Ms Owerko who turned  this week and has for many years attended an advanced yoga retreated for women over  They have lived long enough to have a sense of humor about themselves And they are often more compassionate toward themselves and other students
