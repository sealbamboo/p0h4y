The Obama administration is still taking a political beating for its  of one major part of health reform  the requirement that all employers with more than  fulltime workers provide health insurance for them That provision was going to go into effect in January But its not the biggest provision and the White House says the most important reforms are still on track The biggest by far is the opening of the health insurance exchanges  the online marketplaces where people can buy insurance if they dont already get it from an employer or from a public plan such as Medicare Medicaid or the military  Other changes yet to come the requirement that most Americans get health insurance somewhere or pay a fine and new rules that prevent insurers from turning patients away just because theyve been sick before and from putting lifetime caps on how much patients can run up in medical expenses Also still to come are limits on the minimum coverage that can be provided wider eligibility for Medicaid in some states the formation of socalled accountable care organizations rules meant to force hospitals to provide better care and in  a tax on Cadillac health insurance plans  The exchanges are on track to start enrolling people on Oct  the administration says and to start paying for peoples health care on Jan   The Kaiser Family Foundation says about  percent of Americans under the age of  dont have health insurance The exchanges are one way that the  Affordable Care Act aims to fix this The  that  million people will buy health insurance on the exchanges by   Expect a big advertising campaign this summer We have a very long way to go on public awareness and education on what is going to be available says Caroline Pearson a vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health in Washington DC We are going to see a big push from state and federal governments and private groups to educate people According to Kaiser  percent of the general public and  percent of people who dont have health insurance know little or nothing about the exchanges Groups like Enroll America are planning to send volunteers door to door while the Obama administration is looking to celebrities local government officials nonprofit organizations and even public libraries to help spread the message Jay Angoff who helped construct health reform at the Health and Human Services department before returning to private law firm Mehri  Skalet says the health insurance companies are almost certain to start weighing in too After all it will be private companies that will be providing the insurance  the socalled public option never got off the ground They have been able to persuade people to buy lousy insurance at high rates Angoff told NBC News I am confident in the insurance companies ability to market to people The main targets will be the healthy young adults who can pay premiums without filing too many claims Theyll be needed to help provide a pool of cash to pay for the sick people who will sign up  and theyll be the hardest sell because they know they dont need the insurance as badly as others This is a provision the insurance companies demanded so they can be certain to have a big pool of paying customers Just about everyone will be required to have health insurance starting Jan  Most Americans already do  through an employer or via Medicare Medicaid or Tricare for military families People without will have to pay a small fine  as low as  the first year  if they dont go either to Medicaid or the exchanges for insurance or if they choose to skip whatever their employers offer The penalties the first year are very low and may not be enough to sway people Pearson says The federal government will help pay the premiums for anyone making up to about  for an individual as much as  for a family of four Some people may fall through the cracks About half of the states have declined to expand Medicaid to make more people eligible and the federal government had counted on that Medicaid expansion So in those states people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for the exchanges may have the uncomfortable choice of paying the full premium on an exchange or breaking the law and perhaps paying a fine People who make too little to file for income tax are off the hook  tax returns are where people will be reporting their coverage or lack thereof  The original  Affordable Care Act required all states to make Medicaid  the statefederal health insurance plan for the poor  more widely available The federal government was going to pick up the full cost for several years But the Supreme Court ruled that was unconstitutional in  Now just  states say theyll expand Medicaid according to the So people who live in a state expanding Medicaid will start qualifying in January while those in one of the states that is not will be left with the status quo The CBO projects that  million people will become newly eligible for Medicaid in the states that choose to expand their offerings by  There may be a woodwork effect as well says Pearson All the publicity surrounding the Medicaid expansion may make people who were already eligible aware of the program and they may sign up for the first time This is just a jargony way of saying health insurance companies cannot turn you away any more because you have had a preexisting condition This is one of the provisions that has worried insurance companies because they fear an influx of new customers who have not been insured and who have expensive conditions  and a pentup demand for medical care That starts with new insurance plans issued Jan  Companies can no longer stop covering people once they reach a lifetime limit either This provision removes one of the things people hated most about health insurance  theyd get cut off just as they were the sickest and needed it most Another piece of jargon meaning the insurance companies can only charge a certain amount more for older people and they cannot charge women higher premiums than men any more They can charge smokers more however This provision also starts with new policies issued after Jan   This kicks in on Jan  also Its a list of conditions that health insurance must cover from birth control to mental health care and dental care for children Any insurance company offering a product on the exchanges has to cover this list  Insurers and other experts say this list of provisions is what will make health insurance more expensive on the exchanges I think there definitely will be sticker shock Person says The premiums will be significant and for people who currently buy individual insurance they are going to be higher than what they are today It may take a while for people to appreciate that they are getting value for their money Pearson says  Starting in  employers can expand their wellness programs offering discounts on premiums cash rewards gym memberships and other incentives for those who lose weight take part in diabetes control programs or similar plans to improve their health  Starting in  the administration hopes to encourage hospitals to drop some bad habits by lowering what it pays them for treating Medicare patients Hospitals will get paid less when patients who get some infections bedsores and other conditions while they are in the hospital This starts with a  percent cut in  and grows over the years You dont have to worry about this until  Its a tax on some of the most generous health insurance plans and is meant to discourage unnecessary and expensive tests and doctor visits that are helping drive up health spending That one is certainly a big deal for unionized workers Pearson says  Its a time bomb in the law says Adam Solander with Epstein Becker Green a Washington DC legal and consulting firm Employers who offer health insurance plans worth more than  a year will have to pay a  percent federal tax on that Employers will have to figure out ways to make their coverage cheaper Solander says Hopefully it will lower the cost of coverage The bottom line  expect some confusion and some bumps in the road over the next few years Insurance companies dont yet know if the exchanges are worth the effort so companies may hop in and out of the market and they may change the premiums they charge in different states Big group insurers that mostly offer companypaid health insurance may not dip their toes into the exchanges immediately The hope is the large insurers will see this is a profitable market and jump in over the next year or two says Timothy Jost a health law expert at Washington  Lee University in Virginia In smaller states without many choices insurers may continue to hang back I think it is fair to say in many states there are not going to be that many insurers in the exchanges Jost says
