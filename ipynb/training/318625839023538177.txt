Most people including a lot of doctors think of a stroke as something that happens to old people But the rate is   among those in their s s and even younger In one recent year period the rate of strokes in Americans younger than  went up  percent among whites and  percent among blacks One in  strokes now occurs in adults  to  years old  up from  in  in the mids These are people like Melissa McCann a nurse in Maine who spends most days on a helicopter accompanying sick and injured patients to a distant hospital McCann had a stroke at age  It began with a weird sensation I had a very euphoric feeling she tells Shots Its hard to explain but everything felt very cartoonish to me It felt very bizarre Then she found she couldnt dial the number to respond to a page Light began to hurt her eyes She couldnt speak Because shes a nurse she realized she was having a stroke It was very scary really McCann says because I know what could possibly happen She could die as her fatherinlaw did or be permanently disabled  show that younger stroke survivors are at great risk of premature death Within two decades  in  stroke survivors will die according to a study in the March  issue of the   The death rate is even higher among those with the most common kind of stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain Dr FrankErik de Leeuw of Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands who led the study says the results surprised the research team We had the impression that younger stroke survivors were doing quite well de Leeuw tells Shots But now that we have followed all of them  and also the patients who didnt show up in our outpatient clinic anymore  it turns out that their prognosis was poor To me it was a true surprise He says it means doctors should pay a lot more attention to these patients They should make sure their blood pressure and cholesterol are under control and work harder to get them to lose weight and stop smoking Increases in obesity and diabetes are thought to be factors in the rising incidence of youngadult stroke  though not the only ones The risk is increased for decades after their stroke de Leeuw says So we cant just send them back to their homes and say Well weve seen you now for one or two times after your stroke  take care I think thats not possible anymore His warning applies to this side of the Atlantic as well Its extremely alarming says   a stroke specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital These data suggest to me that we still have a sort of cavalier attitude toward secondary prevention  particularly among younger patients Secondary prevention means preventing another stroke heart attack or other catastrophe in someone who has survived a first one Schwamm says laypeople and doctors alike need to realize that young adults can suffer strokes The new study shows that even a minor stroke called a transient ischemic attack or TIA can increase later odds of an early death to  in  Many of the young patients who end up in my office either dismiss those symptoms themselves or when they sought emergency medical care they were told that it was likely not a stroke Schwamm tells Shots Often they had only a CAT scan which didnt show any injury and were sent home So stroke is still underdiagnosed in young patients By    in  strokes in young adults is misdiagnosed In Melissa McCanns case it was clear she suffered a stroke And fortunately the symptoms cleared pretty quickly without treatment But doctors couldnt find any reason for her stroke at age  I wasnt satisfied with that response she says  Take one aspirin a day and hope it doesnt happen again is not an acceptable answer to me So McCann sought out Dr Schwamm in Boston for a second opinion She came to me with a list of questions Schwamm remembers She knew what the right questions were to ask She really wanted to understand was there a treatable preventable cause here that could be modified so that her risk in the future would be lower An ultrasound scan of her heart revealed an   between the two upper chambers Shed had the congenital abnormality all her life Doctors think that eventually it allowed a blood clot to move to her brain causing the stroke A surgeon repaired the hole and she went back to work six weeks later That was almost three years ago Im working fulltime she says I have a grandson thats  years old Im watching my youngest son go through college Yeah you might have to take some medications But you can get yourself back to your normal life And now that she has addressed the probable cause of her stroke McCann hopes that life will be a long one
