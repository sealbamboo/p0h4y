A childs weight in kindergarten can foreshadow a struggle with obesity later in life  and the warning signals probably start even earlier than that a large new study has found Overweight kindergartners are four times as likely as healthyweight children to become obese by the eighth grade and this new report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine adds to growing evidence that a persons weight fate becomes established at a very early age   have shown that children and adolescents who are overweight or obese stay that way into adulthood Its a wakeup call to parents researchers say If a kindergartner is visibly overweight this is might not be something he or she will grow out of The point of intervention for childhood obesity needs to be in the toddler and preK years  ideally even before birth childhood obesity experts say  A lot of risk may be set in place by the age of  so you really have to focus on those very young ages says Solveig Cunningham lead author of the paper and an assistant professor of global health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta What were seeing is among the kids that become obese a lot of that happens the first few years in elementary school Cunningham and her colleagues used data from a study by the   focusing on  kids who were kindergartners in  The kids weight and height were measured seven times between  and  Fourteen percent of the kids were overweight but not yet obese when they started kindergarten By the time those kids entered eighth grade about a third of them had become obese compared to the  percent of their normalweight kindergarten classmates who became obese by the same age The study also found a doublewhammy for overweight kindergartners who also had a high birth weight Kids who weighed about  pounds  ounces or more at birth and were overweight by the time they started kindergarten had the highest risk of becoming obese by age   This means the time to prevent childhood and adolescent obesity is before elementary school begins and intervention needs to happen in toddlerhood or even during pregnancy obesity experts say  Several key preventive measures would include avoidance of excessive weight gain during pregnancy breastfeeding for a least a few months and initiating a healthful diet early in life said Dr David Ludwig director of the Optimal Weight for Life Clinic at the Boston Childrens Hospital That means a healthy diet for the whole family because   that a familys lifestyle is a major factor in whether a kid will become obese One  study showed that teens were more likely to be overweight or obese if their families did not frequently eat together or if the whole family spent a lot of time in front of the TV  Our paper talks more to the timing than to what might actually work Cunningham said But a lot of it is probably familybased These are the ages in which kids preferences and tastes and likes are set By the age of  they already know what they like  and really promoting a healthy lifestyle and diverse diet at those early ages really sets their preferences Theres no doubt that the younger the child is the easier it is to make healthy behavior changes But Cunningham doesnt want parents of a child whos already overweight to become discouraged I think the numbers have a positive side A third of overweight kindergartners become obese But twothirds dont So yes the risks are higher but its not a matter of fate she said  Andrea Lewis a North Carolina mother of two knew she needed to take action to change her familys health habits last year when she needed bypass surgery  I said you know its time that we get on it together lose weight together Lewis said Because you dont want to be like your mom you dont want to be a big girl all your life Lewis enrolled her daughters  yearold Zaniyah who weighs  pounds and yearold Emoni who weighs  pounds  in the Duke Childrens Healthy Lifestyles Program Lewis and her family are black and this new research showed that black and Hispanic kids have a higher risk for becoming obese adolescents  We did find disparities in risks of becoming obese between for kids between kindergarten and th grade  almost  percent of nonHispanic Black and  percent of Hispanic kindergartners became obese eighth graders compared with about  percent of nonHispanic white kids Cunningham said But the Lewis family which includes a toddler son has made healthy lifestyle changes in an effort to stop that from happening The girls now play basketball and take yoga classes with the Duke program and Lewis says the family has made diet changes too although thats been more challenging  Its hard to change what they like to eat because theyre used to eating a certain way Lewis says I think if I wouldve started them out you know eating healthy then they would be used to eating healthy so thats what they would do But since theyre starting out with McDonalds and whatever fried foods thats what they really lean towards Now the family eats more fruits and veggies they go out to eat no more than once a week and they get only one unhealthy snack per day  Were going to lose weight together as a family said Lewis who has lost  pounds since her heart surgery I will work out with you guys and if Mama can do it if I can run or some jumping jacks then you can run and do jumping jacks as well
