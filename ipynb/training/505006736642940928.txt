Theodosiou learned two of her four kids were addicted to drugs I found out within six months that both my sons were addicts and like every other mother I just wanted to go into bed and never get out Her older son Peter now  took prescription drugs and then escalated to heroin Her younger son Daniel now  started whats called robotripping where he would take large quantities of cough medicine to get high She says she first noticed signs of problems when her younger son was  I was taking Daniel to school one day and he was just like almost choking I thought he was having a panic attack she said A short time later the school called and said staff members thought Daniel was on drugs I was like Theres no way  I have talked to my children my whole life about drugs Within just months after a call from her son Peters roommate her husband went to his house and found needles all over the place If you know about addiction then when you find this out you realize not only are you in for the fight of your life but this is not something that gets fixed in six months This could go on she said Its like having someone punch you in the stomach  Youre never the same from the second you find out How does the mother of an addict cope How does she juggle the incomprehensible challenge between supporting a loved one and not enabling their habit And how does she deal with the stigma of having a child who is an addict In my indepth interviews with Theodosiou and other mothers of addicts across the country they made it very clear that being the mother of an addict is an incredibly lonely and isolating place and that often the only people who understand what theyre going through are other mothers who are going through it themselves Theodosious son Daniel overdosed three times that first year she realized he was using and nearly died each time One day she returned to her house and saw police officers out front I remember pulling up and my heart was beating  I was just going to faint right there The police officer asked if she was Daniels mother For sure I thought he was going to tell me Daniel was dead and it ended up Daniel overdosed again and again he was in the hospital Melva Sherwood of Vermilion Ohio got that unimaginable call on October   Her son Andrew  at the time died of an overdose of heroin It was his sons fifth birthday It was  at night I was sound asleep and it was October All the windows were open and the entire neighborhood knew what had happened said Sherwood who says she screamed at the reality of it that it was over that it was done I have a friend who lives down the street and she said it was horrifying to hear Many mothers immediately beat up on themselves when they learn their children are battling addiction  Brenda Stewart of Worthington Ohio says it was heartbreaking realizing two of her three kids were addicts Her son Jeremy  now  used prescription drugs and then heroin and the drug of choice for Richard now  was crystal meth she said Ive been going to counseling for years to figure out what I did wrong Its just like What did I do said Stewart who has adopted Jeremys two children ages  and   And then you come to find out through tons of counseling and parents groups and everything else that this is something you didnt do to your children And thats the hardest thing to get away from because you always feel responsible Debbie Gross Longo whose son started using drugs at  and taking prescription drugs at  says the powerlessness of being an addicts mom is worse than people might imagine As a mother its been hell said the mom of four in Stony Brook New York Its like having a child that you cannot help and sitting on the edge of your seat all at the time because you know something might happen Viewing addiction as a disease was instrumental many mothers say in helping understand they didnt cause their childs addiction and couldnt fix it either When you really start to understand that it is a disease  you can start looking at your child in a different way loving them for who they are and hating the disease said Stewart Sadly the stigma of having a child with addiction is all too real and incredibly painful Announce to your community your child has a disease like cancer and people will jump to help said mothers I interviewed Not so when you tell them your child is an addict There are no little girls selling cookies for addiction Nobody has bumper stickers on their car said Theodosiou  Her son Daniel was in the church group When they found out he was an addict the entire church shunned him He was completely not invited anywhere Every mom I spoke with talked about the intense struggle between supporting their addicted child or children and not enabling their destructive habit It is the hardest thing in the entire world said Theodosiou who said it was only after seven years and plus stints in rehab that she knew she had to make a drastic change All of these people were telling me you have to stop enabling Daniel You need to let Daniel go You need to just stop  I had to actually face leaving Daniel on the street she said I finally spoke to a pastor and an addiction specialist who told me that  the last person in the world who could ever help Daniel is me Sherwood who lost one son to a drug overdose and has another son who battled drug addiction said she was never able to cut off her children completely but she set limits As far as enabling I think you need to lay it on the table for them This is what you can do Here are your options but Im not going to sit here and let you take advantage of me and lie to me said Sherwood who is a registered nurse and the owner of a business providing caregivers for inhome assisted living Stewart whose two sons were addicts said she eventually realized the longer she enabled her children the longer they werent going to face the consequences It took the line in the sand telling them I love them and if they were ever ready to get the help and really wanted it that Im here for them  but Im not going to set up another appointment she said But the enabling isnt just about the addicts said Stewart Parents need to realize they are enabling themselves and are risking losing everything by thinking they can save their children There are moms losing their lives to save their children  Theyre spending their whole paycheck trying to take care of their child Theyre not taking care of themselves Thats just a ripple effect Theodosiou went through the range of emotions that most mothers of addicts experience the guilt followed by the intense sadness and then the anger Its just a very very sad and a very lonely place she said Then one day about a year and a half into her new kind of normal with two sons who were addicted she had a conversation with God I said you know God if my sons are going to be living this life and be destroyed by this Im going to tell every mother and help every mother I can think of Im not going to keep it a secret She headed to Facebook and started a group called The Addicts Mom in  Her friend thought she was insane She was like Are you crazy You are going to go on Facebook and say that you are an addicts mom And I said You know what I am and I know there have to be a million mothers just like me who are addicts moms  Six years later The Addicts Mom with its   its   and its   has more than  members with chapters in every state Stewart is the state coordinator in Ohio for The Addicts Mom Its given me a place that I feel at home a place that I feel I can give back she said I also understand the parents pain and for me if I can help one parent ease that pain then Ive done something Sherwood whos an administrator for the Facebook group said the online community was an unbelievable eye opener It was just like somebody turned on the light in the closet she said It gave me such comfort to  be able to put something out there online at any time during the day and have  people respond back with Hey we know Weve been where youre at We feel for you Were praying for you  It definitely was a lifechanging experience Besides providing invaluable comfort and support The Addicts Mom is a resource center with information on low and nocost rehabs psychologists and sober living environments This month the group is launching weekly online video meetings where mothers can call in from all over the country and talk with experts on addiction The group has also launched offshoots including The Addicts Mom Healthy Moms where the focus is solely on helping the mom live a healthy life We dont even talk about the addict there said Theodosiou and The Addicts Mom Grieving Moms for mothers who lost children to addiction Its also started The Addicts Dad for fathers and a group called The Addict for the addicts to talk directly with each other A big focus now the moms I interviewed said is raising awareness about the problem of drug addiction and finding affordable solutions There is treatment if youre rich and if you can afford it said Theodosiou If you cant afford it jail is your treatment The Addicts Mom is starting programs in states including New York Kentucky and Ohio where moms go into schools and educate students about addiction The member moms are also flexing their lobbying muscles advocating for laws such as legislation that allows a judge to order a person into treatment if a family member feels that person is a danger to himself or others Our children are dying and at such an alarming rate said Theodosiou noting how the day before our conversation there were two posts on The Addicts Mom with reports that two children died We are seeing an alarming rate of death in our society We have to break the stigma Its a disease said Theodosiou They are not bad people We have to get the word out Raising awareness and helping other mothers drives members of The Addicts Mom but they are also always mindful of the lifelong battle their children are facing Sherwoods surviving son is doing well she said working fulltime in marketing and sales and planning to take a nutritional coaching course for a possible career in nutrition  Today I have my son back as he learns and implements the plan he has put into place with nutrition exercise and being with those that truly love him and support his journey toward a better life said Sherwood What more could a parent ask for Stewarts son Jeremy has been in recovery for over two years Hes engaged is getting ready to buy a house and is very active with his two children Our hope is that in the very near future they are back with their father said Stewart who currently cares for her sons kids Her older son Richard is also doing well and has been in treatment since the end of June Gross Longos son now  had been in recovery for six months and just recently relapsed He entered a detox program and is starting again on the road to recovery his mother said I am once again heartbroken she said My son is doing what he needs to do to get well but do you understand how this is a daytoday yeartoyear fight Before her sons relapse Gross Longo told me she was so pleased about his recovery but also very cautious They could change on a dime she said They could be doing wonderful for five years  and then one evening its gone Theodosious older son Peter has been in recovery for  years and is a recent college graduate He will soon begin a masters program in speech pathology  Her younger son Daniel had been in rehab for five weeks  his longest time ever in treatment  but recently relapsed breaking the condition of his release from jail so he is back behind bars I am really sad about Daniel said Theodosiou Despite her sons setback she continues to advocate for other moms of addicts but also gets some much needed help for herself A few days before our conversation a member of The Addicts Mom called her and expressed concern She said Barbara were worried about you And I said Why And she said Because you have to take care of yourself You help so many other people  I still struggle with being OK and with my own issues and they help by reminding me by being there by being able to talk to them by sharing resources and supporting me
