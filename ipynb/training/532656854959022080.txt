As children grow they learn to crawl to walk and then to drive It turns out the way they get hurt and in particular their heads evolves as as their forms of motion change Small children suffer head injuries from falling while teenagers are at risk from car accidents assaults and sports injuries according to a   published Wednesday in the   The authors all part of the   analyzed data from  children admitted to emergency rooms for blunt force head trauma between  and  In children under  years old the top three causes of head injuries were all fallrelated from a height down the stairs or from standing walking or running For children between  and  years the top causes were falls from a height falls from standing walking or running and being accidentally bopped on the head But as children become teens the causes of head injuries change radically Assault topped the list causing  percent of blunt force trauma injuries in children  to  years Sports injuries accounted for  percent and motor vehicle accidents were linked to  percent for the age group It really just is the developmental stages that children are in    a pediatrician at the Washington University School of Medicine and an author of the study tells Shots Its important to understand because head trauma can cause   the leading cause of death and disabilities for children over one year The data from Quayle and her colleagues shows seat belts and bike helmets work to reduce that risk The prevalence of TBIs verified by CT scans for children in car accidents dropped from  percent to  percent if the child was wearing a seat belt or was in an infant carrier Similarly only  percent of children wearing a bike helmet when hit by a car showed a TBI on their CT scan compared to  percent without a helmet If you look at the younger kids the fact that motor vehicle accidents are not showing up as significant causes of head injuries probably means were doing a pretty good job on car seats and adequate infant car protection say   a neurosurgeon at Boston Childrens Hospital who was unaffiliated with the study Although he adds the car seats can lead to falls when not used in a car We see a lot of injuries from a car seat being used as a carrier Theyre great for cars Theyre not great for carriers The carriers easily slip and fall off tables or counters leading to head injuries says Proctor Quayle and colleagues say the data can help pinpoint agespecific injuryprevention measures like reminding teens to buckle up before they drive We dont need to invent new tools says Quayle its just a matter of continuing to be vigilant about the things we already know are there
