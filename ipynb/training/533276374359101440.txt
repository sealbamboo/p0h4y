Every day when his father came home from work Blaec was there ready The pair used to ride dirt bikes together When the family had to sell the bikes to save some money it crushed Blaec He told me he would have done anything to spend a little more time with his father In fact Blaec said when he bought two guns a couple of years later his plan was to give one to his father for Christmas It would be something else they could do together he thought But things didnt work out that way Blaec spent that Christmas in prison instead  His parents told police Blaec had purchased two assault rifles at Walmart They warned authorities he had been hospitalized several times while struggling with mental illness Tricia Lammers told me she thought her son would kill himself because of his depression She believes the mental illness was her sons only crime He didnt shoot anyone or hurt anyone in any way  And yet he is serving two concurrent year prison sentences in lockdown for  hours a day He was convicted of firstdegree assault and armed criminal action He will spend the prime of his life in prison  Tricia and her husband Bill laid their lives bare in an unforgettable interview that left me stunned They let me talk to Blaecs doctors to get a better understanding of Blaecs mindset and diagnoses They also gave me permission to visit Blaec in the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Jefferson City Missouri the maximum security prison he now calls home so I could ask all my questions and draw my own conclusions Blaecs story is really about the bizarre convergence between our prison system and our mental health system  He was diagnosed with dyslexia as a kid and placed on the autism spectrum as a teenager Around his junior year in high school Blaec developed signs of a true personality disorder He had trouble communicating with others started to have trouble with his grades and developed a profound and painful loneliness  My breath stuck in my throat when he described a semester where he hid away in a school bathroom every day to eat his lunch alone because he was shy didnt have any friends and didnt know how to make them  His parents took him to doctor after doctor and within two years he had nearly a dozen different psychiatric diagnoses and a handful of psychotropic medications to go along with them Getting their son admitted and treated was the Lammers goal and given that Bill worked as the director of radiology at a local hospital they thought it was an attainable one  It proved nearly impossible  The number of psychiatric beds   over the last few decades according to Treatment Advocacy Center Back in  there were  public psychiatric beds nationwide When the Lammerses were trying to get their son help in  there were   less than  compared with  years earlier  The couple looked into private camps but the nearly  price tag was not within their reach  The mental health system is not fractured  it is totally broken Bill Lammers told me As we reported this story and talked to experts in psychiatry criminal justice and law enforcement the same questions came up again and again Should people like Blaec Lammers be prisoners or patients And how do you reasonably distinguish between the two When Tricia pleaded with the judge in January he told her  of the people that stood in front of him suffered from mental illness A review from the   shows that startling statistic to be a national trend particularly among younger inmates In the United States  of local jail inmates  and under have been diagnosed with mental health problems    When police brought Blaec in for questioning about his gun purchase the nation was in the aftermath of the  Aurora Colorado movie theater shooting Everyone was on high alert anxious to prevent another awful tragedy  During interrogation Blaec admitted to buying a ticket to the movie Twilight and he admitted to having homicidal thoughts a few years earlier at the age of  Blaec also admitted to buying  rounds of ammunition along with the two assault rifles Blaec said his mother thought he would be another mass shooter   A Virginia Techs gonna happen with me Or Walmart or the guy at the movie theater in Arizona he said And although he repeatedly denied it Blaec eventually told the detective that he had thought about shooting up Walmart and a local movie theater At one point the detective questioned Blaecs intent The interrogation alone was enough to put him behind bars with police convinced they had just prevented a massacre During Blaecs bench trial the prosecution argued the thenyearold had a plan to kill but didnt have a chance to carry it out   It was a sharp contrast to what his family and his doctors described to me His psychologist John Phillips describes Blaec as a model patient He told me he never saw Blaec as a threat and said Blaec never got into a fight or tried to break the rules He told me Blaecs autism made it difficult for him to connect with others and he saw a boy desperate for love and attention  His parents each told me they couldnt imagine Blaec ever hurting or killing anyone with the guns he purchased According to a recent study in the journal   patients with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators And when they are violent it is most often directed at themselves  Blaecs psychiatrist Dr HJ Bains pointed out that unlike a patient with diabetes Blaec will not get treatment for his illness in prison and will likely leave worse off than when he went in Near the end of my interview with Tricia Lammers I realized there was another reason for her pain She had been the one to alert the authorities about Blaec buying the guns She found a receipt in his pocket and became worried She told me Blaec had asked her just days before if she felt he was a failure in life She says it wasnt a mass homicide that concerned her but a lonely suicide  We all worry about our kids and we strive for their happiness first and foremost The Lammers family is no different and in this case Bill and Tricia believe they failed their son  His father wonders out loud if he should have spent more time with his boy and less time traveling He wonders if there were signs he should have seen He secondguesses his decision not to mortgage his home to pay for a special camp so many summers ago He wonders if he should have kept those dirt bikes  When I reminded him Blaec bought the guns as a present with the hope he could one day spend more time with his father Bill was at a loss for words
