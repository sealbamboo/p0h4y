The inexcusable treatment of whistleblowers who suffer financial or professional damage is a stain on the reputation of the NHS MPs have said In a report on complaints procedures the Commons health select committee said medical professionals are deterred from coming forward to raise serious concerns about patient safety because they fear the personal consequences The report said evidence heard by the committee suggested   staff and patients who complain are not seeking payouts but better quality care It added that the public are also faced with a complex defensive and sometimes rude system when making complaints about the care they have received The report urges all sectors of the NHS to adopt a positive complaints system including publishing how complaints have been dealt with which it believes will give staff and the public the confidence to come forward But Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston chairwoman of the committee said despite the treatment of some whistleblowers medical staff had an overriding duty to come forward with fears I would say that you have a responsibility as a professional always to put your patients first  thats unequivocal she said Even if that might cause harm to your professional career your primary duty is to your patients Most people who do raise concerns will not suffer harm and I think thats a very important message Not everybody in the NHS suffers harm as a result but there has been undoubtedly a number of highprofile cases where that has happened We found there is still evidence that those professionals thinking of raising concerns the fear of how that might impact on their career is still acting as a deterrent in coming forward and we feel the system needs to continue to change the culture in how it operates so that shouldnt even be a consideration for any professionals If were going to move on and encourage professionals to feel confident to come forward they need to be sensitive in how they handle complaints She added that whistleblowers who have been vindicated should receive practical redress for any harm they have suffered as a result The report also recommended the government implement a single easily identifiable gateway that would point the public towards who they should complain to rather than being faced by a range of different bodies to contact The committee heard how in some cases complaints made in southwest England were being directed to a call centre in Leeds but handled in London Wollaston added that she welcomed the progress made by the NHS in creating an open and honest complaints culture but said there was more room for improvement
