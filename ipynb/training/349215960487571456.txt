Children often get sinus infections after theyve had a cold It can be hard for parents and doctors to tell when those infections need treatment with antibiotics and when they should be left to get better on their own The nations pediatricians are trying to make that call a bit easier In new guidelines released today they say that its OK to wait a while longer to see if a child gets better before treating a sinus infection with antibiotics Now parents can wait and see what happens for  days instead of  days the pediatricians recommend Theres nothing inviolate about  days says   chair of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin who led the committee writing the new   for the American Academy of Pediatrics If you want to give them another day or two to see if they get better on their own thats perfectly reasonable The doctors are trying to balance the need to treat individual patients with the broader mission of reducing unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics which can promote resistance Were always anxious not to use antibiotics inappropriately Wald tells Shots Children who are getting better but then get worse probably need antibiotics Wald says because thats a classic sign of a bacterial infection following a cold Colds are caused by viruses The guidelines were published in the journal   A review in the same issue of   found that antibiotics can help with childrens sinus infections but the researchers note that theres still only limited data Just four studies that compared antibiotics to placebos have been done and the results varied The use of antibiotics for sinus infections has been a point of controversy A   last year in adults found that participants got better in  days whether they got antibiotics or not One other key bit of new advice Doctors shouldnt order Xrays or more elaborate scans for kids who may have sinusitis the new guidelines say Thats because the swollen membranes of a cold look like sinusitus on an Xray The inflammation that gives you that runny nose is not confined to your nasal membrane Wald says But what about that green snot Thats not a reliable signal for a sinus infection Wald says I think parents used to lean on that a lot But its more likely a sign that the snot has been in the nose overnight not that theres necessarily anything nasty going on up there Some adults turn to surgery for recurring sinus infections but doctors first recommend   including rinsing the nasal passages with saline solution and steroid nose sprays
