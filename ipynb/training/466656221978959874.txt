An antidepressant drug could be used to slow the onset of Alzheimers disease say scientists in the US Research into  people and transgenic mice found citalopram hampered a protein which helps to build destructive plaques in the brains of Alzheimers patients Scientists said they hoped the study could help prevent the disease Experts said the study was interesting and that using an approved drug could be beneficial  Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia affecting around  people in the UK It affects the brain through protein plaques and tangles which lead to the death of brain cells and a shortage of chemicals important for transmitting messages Symptoms include loss of memory mood changes and problems with communication and reasoning  Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University School of Medicine carried out the study between  and   They bred mice with Alzheimers disease and looked at the levels of the peptide  or protein component  amyloid beta AB in the brain  AB clusters in plaques which   are thought to trigger Alzheimers  After giving the mice citalopram the level of AB fell by  compared to the control group with no antidepressant  And after two months of antidepressants the growth of new plaques was reduced and existing plaques did not grow any further the study said  But it noted the drug could not cause existing plaques to shrink or decrease in number  The  people used in the study were aged between  and  and were healthy researchers said  They were given a single dose of citalopram and the levels of AB in their cerebrospinal fluid was monitored according to the study Researchers said AB levels dropped by  in the hour period after treatment compared to a placebo test Lead author Dr Yvette Sheline at the University of Pennsylvania said the antidepressants worked by clipping the AB molecules so they were not able to function properly She said We had predicted the results but they were very exciting Dr Sheline stressed the study was a proof of concept study hence the small number of people without Alzheimers and that if the results were successful they could be used to slow the progression of the disease  to  years before it could typically become apparent  She added I am eager to get on to the next study where we will look at whether the effect can be sustained  Dr Sheline said after that a big study spanning several years would look at the effectiveness of the drug in people compared to a placebo  Dr James Pickett head of research at the Alzheimers Society said This is an interesting paper Taking a study from mice to humans can be problematic  but they have done it  Repurposing a commonlyused drug like this can get studies to the treatment stage quicker and mean they are cheaper to develop  But he said the sample size was small and warned the researchers had not carried out the study on people with Alzheimers or people over the age of  when the disease was most prevalent
