Concerns over the number of people waiting to be discharged from hospital to care homes in the north east of Scotland are set to be highlighted.. Grampian's NHS board will be told that in September this year there were 112 so-called bed-blocking cases.. This was the highest in any month for two-and-a-half years, with seven care homes in Aberdeen closed to admissions.. The fear is that delayed discharges can have a significant impact on the flow of patients through acute services.
