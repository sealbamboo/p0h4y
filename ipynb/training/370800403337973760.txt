Our genes may have a more elevated moral sense than our minds do according to a new study of the genetic effects of happiness They can it seems reward us with healthy gene activity when were unselfish  and chastise us at a microscopic level when we put our own needs and desires first To reach that slightly unsettling conclusion researchers from the University of North Carolina and the University of California Los Angeles had  healthy volunteers complete an online questionnaire that asked why they felt satisfied with their lives Then the researchers drew their blood and analyzed their white blood cells Scientists have long surmised that moods affect health But the underlying cellular mechanisms were murky until they began looking at geneexpression profiles inside white blood cells Gene expression is the complex process by which genes direct the production of proteins These proteins jumpstart other processes which in the case of white blood cells control much of the bodys immune response It turned out that different forms of happiness were associated with quite different geneexpression profiles Specifically those volunteers whose happiness according to their questionnaires was primarily hedonic to use the scientific term or based on consuming things had surprisingly unhealthy profiles with relatively high levels of biological markers known to promote increased inflammation throughout the body Such inflammation has been linked to the development of cancer diabetes and cardiovascular disease They also had relatively low levels of other markers that increase antibody production to better fight off infections The volunteers whose happiness was more eudaemonic or based on a sense of higher purpose and service to others  a small minority of the overall group  had profiles that displayed augmented levels of antibodyproducing gene expression and lower levels of the proinflammatory expression What this finding indicates says Steven W Cole a professor of medicine at UCLA and senior author of the study   is that our genes can tell the difference between a purposedriven life and a shallower one even when our conscious minds cannot Of course genes cannot actually perceive or judge our behavior so the shift in gene expression is very likely driven by an evolutionary strategy of working for the common good At an individual level this finding may strike some as hectoring particularly for those whose stuff really does make them happy But as Cole points out different kinds of happiness can coexist every volunteer in the study displayed elements of both hedonic and eudaemonic wellbeing Some simply had more of one or the other And he adds purpose is an elastic concept not necessarily requiring renunciation but only that you think first of someone else or have a goal greater than your immediate gratification Being a parent participating in the creative arts or even taking up exercise so that you can live to see your grandchildren may ease you toward eudaemonia he says It may even be that this will enable your genes to respond more favorably to how youre conducting your life
