Ron Strang was on patrol in Afghanistan when a primitive land mine exploded When it went off it came across the front of my body Strang says Though he survived the blast his left leg was never the same Shrapnel destroyed most of the muscle on his left thigh He used to run swim and hike But even after he recovered those days of carefree movement were gone It was impossible for me to run Strang says It was hard for me to walk Id use a cane a lot That knee would give out and Id fall over all the time So that was huge  and hard to get used to at first Then Strang heard about a medical team    and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh The researchers have been working on a still experimental technique to help people like Strang regrow muscle tissue Their latest   in mice and people published this week in the journal   suggest that the method was able to coax regrowth and functional improvement in the severely wounded muscles of three men If the results can be confirmed and improved two of the five men initially treated were helped only slightly by the approach it could become a useful alternative for healing these devastating wounds Badylak says Present methods for trying to correct that involve rather heroic attempts at moving a muscle from somewhere else in the body to that location he explains That doesnt work very well and it also means youve created a deficit somewhere else Instead Badylak and his colleagues had the idea of giving wounded muscle cells a healing boost with a substance that normally surrounds cells  the extracellular matrix The matrix can be thought of simply as the glue that holds all of the different cells in different tissues together Badylak says However in addition there are all these hidden signals in the matrix that instruct the cells on what to do So Badylak decided to try surgically transplanting a quilt of matrix cells derived from pig bladders into the legs of patients whose muscles had been partially destroyed He started with five patients  Strang and four other men who were disabled despite the best physical therapy and the best that medicine had to offer Before the experimental treatment some of them could not get out of a chair without help Badylak says Some of them walked with a cane  This was not just a mild loss of strength They had real problems Strang was initially skeptical It kind of seemed farfetched he says But he decided to give it a try And just as Badylak had hoped the pig matrix triggered immature muscle cells that had been dormant in the mens bodies to grow  and to make new healthy muscle rather than scar tissue One of the three patients who was helped a veteran wounded in Iraq had previously endured  unsuccessful surgeries He was actually considering amputation of his leg because he felt like he was just dragging it around Badylak says After successful treatment with the matrix that patient now rides mountain bikes and does jumping jacks Strangs recovery hasnt been quite that dramatic But his limp is gone He can walk without a cane and hardly ever falls anymore In short spurts he can even run Its a great feeling after   to three years of not being able to do that Strang says Its been amazing and definitely lifechanging for me  who studies muscle regeneration at Case Western Reserve University calls the study a very big deal because its proof that the concept can work It means Caplan says theres a good chance that instead of all this muscle being destroyed  not only can you save some of the muscle using this technique but you can actually get real regeneration Badylak says he has now treated about a dozen patients and plans to try the technique with dozens more hoping that if all goes well many doctors will be able to use the same approach to help many more patients whose muscles have been destroyed
