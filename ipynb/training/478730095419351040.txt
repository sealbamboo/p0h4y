A few years ago, Bruce and Melinda Williams had a big fight on their second wedding anniversary. Mr. Williams was on the road for work and didn't call home until eveningâ€”then forgot to mention the anniversary.. Ms. Williams let her husband ramble on during the call. When he was getting ready to hang up, she reminded him of the date and told him she was deeply hurt. Mr. Williams became defensive. Ms. Williams got mad and yelled. Both spouses hung up angry.
