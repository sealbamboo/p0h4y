Do you often if guiltily skip cooling down after exercise A small but soothing body of new research suggests that you arent missing out on much  Most of us were taught in elementary school gym classes that the body requires a formal period of cooling down after a workout or competition Instructors told us that by slowing to a jog or otherwise lessening the intensity of the workout followed by stretching or otherwise transitioning out of physical activity we would prevent muscle soreness improve limberness and speed physiological recovery All of this would allow us to perform better physically the next day than if we hadnt cooled down  But under scientific scrutiny none of those beliefs stand up well  In a   a group of  active adults undertook a strenuous onetime program of forward lunges while holding barbells an exercise almost guaranteed to make untrained people extremely sore the next day Some of the volunteers warmed up beforehand by pedaling a stationary bicycle at a very gentle pace for  minutes Others didnt warm up but cooled down after the exercise with the same  minutes of easy cycling The rest just lunged neither warming up nor cooling down  The next day all of the volunteers submitted to a pain threshold test in which their muscles were prodded until they reported discomfort The volunteers whod warmed up before exercising had the highest pain threshold meaning their muscles were relatively painfree  Those whod cooled down on the other hand had a much lower pain threshold their muscles hurt The cooldown groups pain threshold was in fact the same as among the control group Cooling down had bought the exercisers nothing in terms of pain relief  Similarly in two other studies published last year one in   and the other in   professional soccer players in Spain underwent a series of physical tests to benchmark their vertical leap sprinting speed agility and leg muscle flexibility and then completed a normal soccer practice Afterward some of the players simply stopped exercising and sat quietly on a bench for  minutes while others formally cooled down with  minutes of jogging and  minutes of stretching  The next day the players repeated the physical tests and also told the scientists how sore their legs felt an assessment with which professional athletes tend to be familiar  It turned out that there were almost no differences between the two groups of players The cooldown group could on average leap a little higher the next day than those whod sat around for  minutes but the difference was slight And on all of the other measures of performance flexibility and muscle soreness the groups were the same  The available data quite strongly suggest a cooldown does not reduce postexercise soreness says   a senior research fellow at Neuroscience Research Australia and senior author of what is probably the   from  In that experiment healthy adults walked backward downhill on a treadmill for  minutes courting sore muscles and curious stares from fellow gymgoers Some of the volunteers first walked forward for  minutes as a warmup others did the same afterward to cool down Others didnt warm up or cool down Two days later the group that had cooled down was every bit as sore as the control group  Given all of these findings then is there any valid reason to cool down  Yes says Andrea Fradkin an associate professor of exercise science at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania A cooldown has been shown to prevent venous pooling after exercise or the buildup of blood in the veins she says During prolonged vigorous exercise the blood vessels in your legs expand meaning that more blood moves through them Stop exercising abruptly and that blood pools in your lower body which can lead to dizziness or even fainting  The condition is easy to combat though Just walk for a few minutes at the end of a workout and youll maintain normal circulation to the brain says Ross Tucker a South African physiologist and a founder of the estimable Web site   And thats not really a cooldown as most of us would define the procedure he says   Still if a formal cooldown provides few confirmed physiological benefits it may have a scientifically squishy but nevertheless worthwhile psychological effect If youve done a very hard track session its nice to end with some light jogging Dr Tucker says just to restore a subjective sense of normality to your legs A cooldown in other words feels nice  And its important to note that none of the scientific research shows any negative effects due to performing a cooldown Dr Fradkin says  So in essence the available science suggests that whatever youre doing now at the end of a workout is probably fine  My feeling is that unless future science shows otherwise people shouldnt worry about it Dr Herbert says If they like to cool down then its not going to hurt them But if they dont feel like it then they shouldnt feel a need to do it
