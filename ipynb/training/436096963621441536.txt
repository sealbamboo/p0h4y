
 Dr Robert Lustig became widely known as the antisugar guy after a lecture of his called   was posted on YouTube and gained widespread attention In his talk Dr Lustig explains why   and why he believes those from sugar in particular are driving an epidemic of obesity and chronic disease But Dr Lustig a pediatric endocrinologist who runs a weight management clinic for children and families at the University of California San Francisco says that antiprocessed food guy would be a more appropriate nickname since sugar  while his biggest concern  is just one of a number of ills he sees in the modern American diet I recently sat down with Dr Lustig to talk about his newest book   which he wrote with his friend Cindy Gershen a chef as a followup to his  bestseller Fat Chance Every recipe was vetted by students at Mount Diablo High School in Concord Calif where Ms Gershen teaches healthy cooking To find out more about how children and their parents can learn to eat better why sugar is not banned from his cookbook and why polenta patties are hands down Dr Lustigs favorite recipe in the book read our edited conversation Your  spread quickly and was viewed by millions of people Were you surprised It blows my mind I didnt think anyone was going to watch it I didnt even know it was being taped If I had I wouldve worn a better tie A lot of studies lately have extolled the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet Do you favor one diet or cuisine over another I dont have any money on any specific cuisine or diet I think they could all work and they all did work at one time But now they dont because theyre processed Pioppi Italy is where the Mediterranean diet was centered Did they have pasta No It was meat and vegetables and some red wine and olive oil The bottom line is every country has its cuisine and every cuisine works for that country But theres one thing that doesnt work for any country processed food And any country that adopts processed food which is now everywhere is getting sick This is why I want to be known as the antiprocessed food guy not the antisugar guy What are your thoughts on diets that focus on calories Im not against reducing calories But if thats all youre doing it cant work It depends what those calories are Everything that comes in a calorie container half of it is sugar whether its yogurt or cookies or whatever If a calorie is a calorie then it should work But it doesnt because a calorie is not a calorie And this is the thing that we have to get past Thats why I wrote the cookbook Because the question is once you realize that all calories are not the same what do you do You treat many obese children in your clinic Do you ever end up treating parents as well Almost always we see an obese kid come in with an obese parent And when the kid loses weight the parent loses weight because the parent actually changed whats going on in the home They made the home safe for the kid and safe for themselves as well But if the parent is hooked on sugar and they wont get it out of the house then the kid cant get better If a parent says Oh its my kids problem but Im going to eat the cookies then nobody gets better We see a lot of that How do you change behavior We do one thing at our clinic that nobody else does and its the key to our success We do something called the teaching breakfast Every kid comes in fasting because were drawing blood So theyre all hungry They go to the teaching breakfast with their parents  its six families all at a communal table  and our dietitian spends an hour with them The dietitian narrates exactly whats on the table and teaches the parent and the kid at the same time We make sure four things happen No  we show the parent the kid will eat the food No  we show the parent that they will eat the food No  we show the parent that other kids will eat the food because they have other kids at home and they have to be able to buy stuff that they know other kids will eat And No  we show them the grocery bill so they see that they can afford the food If you dont do all four of those they wont change What are the foods you put on the table We tell them that they can make things like steel cut oats and eggs And on the table well have whole grain muffins whole grain breads cheeses And we have plain yogurt with real fruit mixed in not the standard American flavored yogurt which is super high in sugar And we say Look breakfast is not the time for your sugar fix The more sugar you eat at breakfast the more trouble youre going to be in Sugar is the one thing you need to get out of your breakfast So these foods on the table are not what these children are used to eating If you get your breakfast through the national school breakfast program which  percent of school kids do guess what youre getting a bowl of Fruit Loops and an eightounce glass of orange juice Thats  teaspoons of added sugar This is what we have to fix But it costs money to fix and no one wants to do that So as a country were spending it on the tail end on diabetes heart disease and everything else A lot of the recipes in your book use fruit to add sweet flavors Was this a way to limit refined sugar Exactly People always say to me What about fruit It has sugar But I have nothing against fruit because it comes with its inherent fiber and fiber mitigates the negative effects The way God made it however much sugar is in a piece of fruit theres an equal amount of fiber to offset it Theres only one notable exception grapes Grapes are just little bags of sugar They dont have enough fiber for the amount of sugar thats in them But I have nothing against real food and that includes real fruit Eat all the fruit you want Its only when you turn it into juice that I have a problem with it because then it loses its fiber You have two children at home Do you let them eat sweets So first of all my wife is Norwegian She bakes for therapy When shes mad at me she bakes Thats how she gets her aggression out But she only bakes once a week and the kids only get fresh cookies We never buy storebought Ever And when my wife bakes fivedozen cookies she gives them out to the rest of the block We keep about a dozen cookies for ourselves and for the kids My wife has learned by experimenting that she can take any cookie recipe any cake recipe and reduce the amount of sugar by one third and it actually tastes better and it doesnt ruin the texture If you go down by a half then it does But if you go down by a third the cookies still come out just as good And you can taste the chocolate the nuts the oatmeal the macadamia  whatever is in it So its actually better and the kids get it as a treat On weekdays when they want something sweet its fruit On the weekends theyre allowed cookies So were not militant Were toeing the line What is your favorite recipe in the new book and why Polenta patties with sauted greens poached eggs Roma tomatoes and basil salsa Hands down winner Its
