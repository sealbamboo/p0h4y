When it comes to weaning humans are weird Our closest relatives chimpanzees and gorillas breastfeed their offspring for several years Some baby orangutans nurse until they are  years old But modern humans wean much earlier In preindustrial societies babies stop nursing after about two years Which raises the question How did we get that way When did we make the evolutionary shift from apelike parenting to the short breastfeeding period of humans Scientists combed the fossil record for clues but they came up empty until one researcher decided to play tooth fairy Manish Arora studies tooth chemistry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York He knows that teeth hold many secrets You can almost visualize tooth development in terms of growth rings that you would see in a tree says   Like tree rings the layers of enamel and dentin that accumulate day after day mark the passage of time And the compounds in the enamel can tell scientists a lot about the tooth owners early growth and development But Arora was looking for something very specific a marker in the tooth that would reveal the timing of weaning So he meticulously recorded the breastfeeding habits of women and their babies Years later when the children started to place their lost baby teeth under their pillows Arora was there to collect them Luckily this tooth fairy standin had a research grant They do get a small reimbursement for every tooth they donate Arora says When Arora and his colleagues started to analyze the chemical makeup of the teeth they noticed an interesting pattern in the distribution of the element barium During the period of breastfeeding the barium levels in teeth were higher Arora says At weaning the levels of barium in teeth started to drop Barium is calciums cousin its in the same column on the periodic table and it goes where calcium goes Over the years it accumulates in our bones When a mother begins nursing some of that barium migrates into her breast milk and eventually into her babys teeth Arora had found his marker He could take a tooth and tell when that tooths owner stopped nursing His colleague   who studies human evolution at Harvard knew just the tooth to test first Its a first molar tooth from a   Smith says The tooth is  years old and perfectly preserved Analyzing the tooths barium distribution the researchers determined that this Neanderthal started weaning after about  months and then transitioned to a mixed diet At  months the barium signal dropped abruptly as if mother and child had been separated The   in   Smith says applying the same technique to other fossilized teeth will help paint a clearer picture of the evolution of human weaning The shorter nursing times would have given mothers the freedom to reproduce more frequently and gather food for the group Now were a step closer to finding out when and how this shift happened Arora adds that theres another important application studying human nursing today Most breastfeeding studies are questionnairebased and can be foiled by the faulty memories of their subjects But with Aroras method scientists have access to a dental record that always tells the truth
