The drug company Merck maker of the NuvaRing contraceptive says it will pay out  million to settle thousands of liability lawsuits from women who say they were harmed by using the product These women say that the birth control method put them at greater risk of lifethreatening blood clots and that they were not adequately warned of that risk The settlement was offered to about  women who have filed lawsuits in federal and state courts In a statement Friday the company said We stand behind the research that supported the approval of NuvaRing and our continued work to monitor the safety of the medicine NuvaRing is just the latest hormonebased form of birth control to become the focus of scrutiny All hormonal contraceptives including birth control pills increase a womans risk of blood clots stroke and heart attack Guidelines   by the American Heart Association recommend that women considering oral contraceptives should get screened for high blood pressure because the pills can increase the risk for blood clots and stroke NuvaRing may be even more likely to cause blood clots than other forms of birth control The risk of getting blood clots may be greater with the type of progestin in NuvaRing than with some other progestins in certain lowdose birth control pills the package safety information states But some women may decide that the convenience of a new form of birth control like NuvaRing is worth the increased risk The NuvaRing is a clear flexible ring that fits in the vagina  women can put it in themselves unlike an intrauterine device IUD Over three weeks it releases a combination of hormones that prevents ovulation and blocks sperm from getting to an egg On the fourth week its taken out and replaced with a new ring a week later NuvaRing got attention when it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in  for being more convenient than other methods no daily attention needed unlike the pill while maintaining womens control no regular trips to the clinic unlike the DepoProvera shot But like other hormonal options it comes with a side of blood clot risk Specifically a chance of getting   a blood clot that forms in a vein A clot formed in deep veins like in the legs can cause pain and swelling   If that clot breaks off and moves to the lungs the condition  now called a pulmonary embolism  becomes more serious The warning signs might include chest pain and shortness of breath and it could be fatal In October Merck updated the   section of the package label which states that women should stop using NuvaRing if a blood clot forms and a few weeks before and after major surgery The warning cites two studies that looked into blood clots and NuvaRing One funded by Merck   in the journal   in October and   funded by the FDA with data from Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases The former found a similar risk for the ring and combined oral contraceptive pills The latter found no difference in risk between new users of lowdose combined hormonal contraceptives and the NuvaRing or the birth control patch There was a higher risk found with pills that contain drospirenone which is found in the pill Yaz But   published in the   in May  found a notably higher risk of blood clots from NuvaRing Women using the NuvaRing were about six times more likely to get venous thrombosis than women who didnt use any form of hormonal contraceptive Compared to combined oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel NuvaRing users were about twice as likely to form blood clots The Danish study was not included in the US NuvaRing labels FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer told Shots in an email that the agency questioned the design and study population and did not have the opportunity to independently review the original data For one thing the study compares all users rather than just new users When using any hormonal contraceptive the risk of blood clots is higher during the first few months of use according to Fischer so including both new and longtime users in the same study may make it seem like newer contraceptives are riskier when actually new users of any method are already at a higher risk Merck does cite the Danish study on some labels outside the US but the company also notes that the research has shortcomings including that it does not adjust for some factors that are known to increase risk of blood clots on their own like smoking body mass or family history There needs to be more studies comparing the NuvaRing to other methods of birth control according to Dr   an associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco But he tells Shots that women need to be careful when evaluating statistics about the risks Relative risk compares risk between two groups absolute risk measures any individuals chance of getting the side effect For example that six times more likely statistic from the Danish study is a measure of relative risk And because blood clots are relatively rare an individual womans risk remains low If you take a rare event make it a little more common it is still a rare event Policar says The nonprofit sex education website Besiderorg lays out   For young women who are   pregnant and   using a birth control method with estrogen the risk of forming a blood clot is about  in  per year when using birth control methods with estrogen that risk may be as high as  in  per year Women need to compare that to the risk of pregnancy too says   chief program officer for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy which runs Bedsider The risk of forming a blood clot while pregnant shoots up to about   Albert says Given the various complications of an unplanned pregnancy Albert says skipping birth control altogether for fear of blood clots isnt the way to protect oneself The   has been vocal in pushing for more disclosure of the risks of the NuvaRing  though the organization believes the product is safe enough to be on the market   interim executive director of the NWHN says the NuvaRing warning change in October is not accessible enough to women in part because its in the section for prescribers not users Its not written in a way that makes it easy to digest and thats a shortcoming she says The organization has been advocating for informed medical decisionmaking since the group was created in the s One of its founders   about the side effects of the birth control pill when it first came out and helped   into adding new warnings to the packaging Allina says women can handle ambiguity in the research Even when theres scientific uncertainty she says that information can be presented in a way that women can deal with Mercks proposed settlement is generally a good development if it means that women are able to get the resources they need Allina says But clearer explanations of risk are needed for women who may be looking at NuvaRing in the future A spokeswoman for Merck says the company does conduct routine and ongoing monitoring of the product and that we also update the labeling for our products on a regular basis and where appropriate to reflect reported adverse events regardless of whether causality has been established Women have lots of choices when it comes to birth control Policar says A range of methods  some without any hormones  are available Second blood clots happen almost entirely in women who are predisposed because of their weight age family and personal history or smoking habit Finally if a woman is happy with the method she has and is using it effectively  and is in the lowrisk category  she should know the risk of blood clots with the NuvaRing is still less than with pregnancy Then Policar says he would leave the choice up to her
