I recently took a Ukrainian taxi from the airport to my hotel The fare should have been  The cab driver was adamant that I pay  When I finally paid him  the driver gave me a receipt with a wink Hed made it out for  The driver got a cut by overcharging me and assumed that I would take a cut by overcharging NPR which I did not In Ukraine corruption is a daily fact of life It reaches into big business law enforcement education and even the smallest transactions between people on the street Nobody died because my cab driver was corrupt But the exact same behavior has far greater costs when the government buys medicine to treat fatal diseases Because of the corruption here in Ukraine we dont have enough treatment to treat all of the people in need says Andriy Andrushkiv Hes with a nonprofit group called the   which   in a report last year Heres how medical officials in Ukraine pull the same maneuver as my taxi driver according to Andrushkiv with much more serious consequences On the international market an HIV pill costs a dollar Ukraines government tells the public the international price is  Corrupt middlemen buy pills for a dollar each and sell them to the government for five times the price Then the government claims to be doing the Ukrainian people a favor by purchasing a  pill for  Andrushkiv has heard the routine over and over The government says Ho we are cool guys And we say Oh what bull Here in the international market the price is five times less than you pay Guys why are you making fools of us  Because of this corruption there are enough drugs to treat only half the HIV patients in Ukraine The same problem affects people with tuberculosis cancer and other serious illnesses At a cheap cafe in Kiev Andrushkiv arranges for me to meet a pale middleaged man with bluegray eyes The man asks us not to use his name He was already fired from one job when his boss learned that he has HIV This man and his wife were diagnosed three years ago during a prenatal checkup for their second pregnancy Of course we didnt think it would happen so quickly and that things would go so terribly the man says He stares down at his coffee as he recounts the story speaking in Russian through a translator If we could turn the days back maybe the situation would have gone differently Immediately after he and his wife were diagnosed with HIV they tried to get treatment They were put on a waiting list Eventually the wife became sick with tuberculosis She ultimately wound up in a hospital where there was still no medicine for her Nobody from the hospital showed any interest in treating her he says shaking his head Once she was going to the bathroom and nobody helped her Nobody took her hand She fell and started bleeding They only did something when I showed up They didnt even change her bed sheets Finally the doctors told him Shes going to die anyway Just take her home His wife died almost six months ago at age  The two of them used to work together every day She would decorate aquariums and stock them with fish He would clean the tanks Each morning when he wakes up he feels a slight shock to discover shes not there I still feel it I still feel it and its very difficult the man says My children feel it too They sometimes call for their mama because they still feel her presence His children now  and  dont fully understand what happened They are too small he says Ukraine has worrisome health indicators compared with countries with similar wealth and development Drugresistant tuberculosis is a serious problem Polio which had been eradicated may be on the brink of a comeback Theres no question Corruption leads directly to death says   who heads PATH a global health nonprofit based in Seattle His group does work in Ukraine among many other countries Davis recently visited Kiev where he reflected in an interview on the challenge of working in countries with such widespread corruption Its easy to say maybe we shouldnt do much work in a place like this he says but the reality is the places in the world where most vulnerable people live are often places where theres a lot of corruption So I dont think the answer is Lets not go work there  The answer Davis says is to support the reformers And for the reformers and their clients there is some reason to be hopeful After I returned from Ukraine to London Andrushkiv sent me an excited email with the subject heading Good news from Ukraine New figures showed that last year new AIDS cases in Ukraine dropped by  percent Even more striking mortality declined by  percent Andrushkiv says this is a good start but its only a first step His organization intends to keep pushing to make drugs available to everyone who needs treatment
