Doctors should screen all adults over age  for frailty a medical syndrome that affects  percent to  percent of people in this age group according to    Frail seniors are tired weak thin and listless with a reduced ability to bounce back from physical challenges and   than others of their age This was first identified as a condition worthy of attention in the medical community in the s by Dr Linda Fried now dean of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health   Since then researchers have been debating   A previous international medical conference on frailty failed to produce a recommendation in favor of routine screening for older adults the position advanced for the first time in this new statement  Although there are several reliable tests for frailty very few physicians other than geriatricians routinely evaluate older patients for this condition said Dr John Morley a professor of geriatrics at St Louis University and an author of the statement published this month in The Journal of the American Medical Directors Association That ought to change Dr Morley said because several factors that can contribute to frailty are easily treated For instance fatigue  a signature characteristic of this condition  can be caused by depression anemia thyroid or adrenal disorders or vitamin B deficiency all of which can be addressed with prescription drugs and other interventions  Similarly muscle weakness another characteristic can be improved with aerobic exercise and resistance training I tell my patients Walk for  to  minutes faster than a dog walks and find a couple of bean cans and lift them up and down for five minutes each day in any direction Dr Morley said Thats roughly what people need to do Even the most vulnerable physically challenged   which conferred its greatest benefits to improvements in health status to those who were more frail at baseline according to a  study by Canadian researchers published in the journal PLoS One   Yet another cardinal sign of frailty is weight loss Supplements like Ensure shakes can help elderly people maintain or put on weight Frail seniors with multiple chronic medical conditions and symptoms like fatigue dizziness or mental confusion can benefit when their medications are adjusted Caregivers can help identify frailty by asking five questions from the screening test below Dr Morley said Arrange an evaluation by a physician when an older person answers yes to at least three  Are you fatigued 
 Do you have difficulty walking up one flight of steps 
 Are you unable to walk more than one block 
 Do you have more than five illnesses 
 Have you lost more than  percent of your weight in the last six months Other tests recommended in the consensus statement include questions about walking speed slow walking can be a sign of frailty grip strength a weaker grip is an indication the extent of physical activity and memory complaints Organizations that have signed on to the new consensus statement on frailty include the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics the Society on Sarcopenia Cachexia and Wasting Disorders the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society the American Medical Directors Association the American Federation for Aging Research and the International Academy on Nutrition and Aging
