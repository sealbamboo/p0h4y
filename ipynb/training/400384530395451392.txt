If you want to meet somebody whos really happy with the Affordable Care Act then say hello to Sue Birch Colorados Medicaid director Nearly  Coloradans signed up for health coverage on the states new marketplace   rather than HealthCaregov And   says most of those people who signed up through the website enrolled in   So while Colorado has been enrolling only about a thousand people a week in new private health insurance since its Obamacare marketplace opened the number enrolling in Medicaid is  times that Were pleased that those numbers add up to right under  and that makes us one of the successful states in the country she says We are certainly one of the big successful states Thats seen as a shining example of functionality But not everyone sees the process that way Some people are complaining that Colorados Medicaid system is getting in their way slowing enrollment in private coverage Thats because nearly everyone buying on Connect for Health has to file a Medicaid application first even if they know they make too much money to qualify Cancer patient Donna Smith told the Connect for Health board shes been waiting more than a month to be cleared by Medicaid so she can buy private insurance for next year This is a very real human issue and day  is making me really nervous she says Stories like that are troubling to Connect for Health board members including Ellen Daehnick Getting through the system can be more complicated and time consuming than necessary and there can be points where a user has to wait she says Daehnick and other board members worry that people who wont qualify for Medicaid but will qualify for tax credits to lower their private insurance premiums will get hung up in the Medicaid application and not come back Judy Solomon with the   in Washington says Colorado appears unique in the way it has fashioned the Obamacare application If Colorado is trying to make sure that no possible door to Medicaid has been foreclosed before passing people on for the premium tax credits its really going to slow down the process she says Connect for Health board members got a feel for that last week during a demonstration of the site The application included questions about how much a persons car is worth and whether someone has burial benefits Questions at that level of detail are designed to screen for every possible Medicaid recipient but arent required for the vast majority of people shopping for Obamacare coverage Those questions have since been removed from Colorados application Connect for Health Colorados board chairwoman   says the application still isnt as streamlined as theyd like but shes not convinced its pushing people away We are seeing a number of Coloradans who have not had access to coverage before get that access and get it in a fairly timely manner she says Hammer says shes aware some people are getting hung up but doesnt think thats the only reason only  people bought private coverage through Connect for Health Colorado in its first month She says she thinks a lot of people may be waiting to buy because they cant afford something now that wont go into effect until next year People can wait until Dec  to buy coverage that starts on January first But she admits that Colorados application process could be a lot more efficient and the Connect for Health board is working on a major fix for next year Meanwhile Connect for Health is hoping its sales rate goes up significantly The  people whove bought coverage so far are a long way from the  the state is aiming for by the end of March
