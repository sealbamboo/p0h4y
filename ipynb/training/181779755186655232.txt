You only get to run your first marathon once But if I could do it all again there are definitely some things Id do differently  I was ambitious Deciding to run a marathon and find out what youre made of is a good thing in my book  I decided to write about my mission By making a public commitment my motivation level was cranked up several notches  I fueled my training with complex carbohydrates including lots of whole grains as advised by sports nutrition consultant Nancy Clark  I listened to medical experts when I got hurt Despite my eagerness to train I rested my ankle and followed the prescribed rehabilitation program to reduce the risk of further injury  I was   ambitious Had I trained at a minutepermile pace its quite likely I would have avoided injury and still had a fair chance at finishing in under four hours  I failed to seek even basic advice The mistakes I made were common firsttimer errors that were eminently preventable  I let my ego rule Aching thighs were an early warning that I was going too fast but I paid no heed Now Ill be attempting a marathon having never gone further than  miles in one outing
