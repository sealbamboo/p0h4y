President Obama on Tuesday appointed one of his top management gurus Jeffrey Zeints to head the team working to fix what ails HealthCaregov the troubled website thats supposed to allow residents of  states to enroll in coverage under the Affordable Care Act But even if the team gets the website working as it should millions of Americans may still log on to discover that they arent eligible for any health coverage at all And that wont be due to any technical glitch Its because their state has  This is not the way the health law was designed and enacted says Bruce Siegel Originally the idea was that millions and millions of Americans would get health insurance says Siegel president and CEO of   a group that represents safety net institutions around the country Theyd get coverage through Medicaid or through private insurance on the exchanges Currently in most states you have to be a child pregnant or disabled to get Medicaid The health law was supposed to change all that  expanding the program to include nearly everyone with incomes up to about   or about  a year for an individual But in the summer of  when the Supreme Court upheld the health law as constitutional it did something unexpected Siegel says They said   or not expanding it And that led to a very very different landscape than what we expected Even   to opt in still only half the states have said they will expand their Medicaid programs even though the federal government is   of the additional people for the first three years and  percent going forward As a result according to the   between  million and  million lowincome uninsured adults live in states that are so far not expanding their programs And some of those states have among the largest populations of lowincome uninsured people Over  million of them live in just four states says Genevieve Kenney senior fellow and codirector of the Urban Institutes Health Policy Center Those states are Florida Texas Georgia and North Carolina The problem says Kenney is that for many of those people the law offers them nothing Because they were supposed to get Medicaid theyre   at the exchanges unless their incomes are above the poverty line Thats about  a year for an individual I think its going to be confusing for individuals who are applying for coverage says Kenney It certainly makes the message about the new affordable coverage thats available a lot more complicated to target Among the people who could get left behind is Ellen Wall Shes a nanny and sometime music teacher from Atlanta She says her income fluctuates but most years its right around the poverty line She says as long as she can pay her bills she doesnt mind earning that amount I love doing what I do because Im very good at what I do thats why Ive chosen this profession she says But there are those years when its quite lean and then Im just barely making it And what am I gonna do if something comes up and Im really sick and I need some help Wall doesnt have and hasnt had health insurance She says that was a real problem a few years back when she was in the hospital after an asthma attack It was kind of a very embarrassing situation to be in not to have the health insurance that could have covered that few days that I was in the hospital she says If Wall lived in a state expanding Medicaid she would clearly qualify But so far Georgia isnt And her income may or may not be high enough to let her qualify for help buying private coverage on the states exchange So shell likely remain working poor and uninsured Most advocates say people like Wall should turn to community clinics and public hospitals if they cant get insurance But theres a problem there too says public hospital advocate Siegel The health law cut funding for public hospitals because it assumed so many more people would have insurance But in those states that arent expanding Medicaid the need for free care is likely to go up instead of down Many of these hospitals will be overwhelmed Siegel says Some of them are already overwhelmed many of them are already losing money providing a high level of service to people in need And this will simply not be a tenable position Public and other hospitals are   in the states that so far have opted not to expand their Medicaid programs Some states are still considering opting in But in others patients left behind may have to scramble even harder to find care if they get sick
