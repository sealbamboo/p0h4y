Back in  a research study blew apart the widely held belief that hormone replacement therapy protected women from heart disease and other chronic ills Instead the Womens Health Initiative study found that taking estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement therapy  HRT  actually increased a womans risk of heart disease and breast cancer The study had a huge effect Within months the number of women using HRT dropped by almost half A second WHI study published two years later reinforced the message finding that taking estrogen alone also increased the risk of stroke dementia and other problems But confusion over if why and when to use HRT has lingered This week the Womens Health Initiative published a final comprehensive report on its long broad and deep look at women and HRT The   which was published in   the journal of the American Medical Association monitored the health of  postmenopausal women while they were in the two HRT randomized trials and in the years after It sums up results that have been published piecemeal in more than  articles Shots talked with   lead investigator of the Womens Health Initiative and a professor of medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health to get the final word Shes been with the study since its birth in  This is an edited version of that conversation The key point is that the results are now broken down by age and time since menopause This is really what women and their clinicians have needed in order to interpret the findings and provide individualized care The recommendation is dont use hormones for chronic disease prevention but do consider whether younger women could use them for treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of menopause The younger women are less likely to have adverse events like heart attacks blood clots and stroke So hormone therapy is appropriate for women in early menopause because they are likely to have qualityoflife benefits that outweigh the small likelihood of adverse events A clinician would make a very different risk interpretation for a yearold woman interested in taking hormones for chronic disease prevention But it really should not be used for longterm disease prevention by women in any age group because there is concern about an increased risk of blood clots and stroke The bar is set very high for longterm use because of those potential risks It was never the intention to deny hormone therapy to women in early menopause We said OK hormone therapy shouldnt be used for chronic disease prevention But many women and their clinicians were misinterpreting that If that distinction is clearly made I think theres a really important advance in health care We dont really have a clear understanding of the mechanisms for a finding of lower breast cancer risk for conjugated estrogen alone It really needs to be looked at more carefully There are so many medications that are being taken that havent been studied They all have their own risks Hormone replacement therapy is now one of the beststudied medications in history It will be helpful to have more research on different formulations of estrogen the lower doses and the skin patch and skin gel routes of delivery But in terms of oral hormone therapy I think theres a very comprehensive evidence base to use for decisionmaking You know theres such an irony to the saga of hormone replacement therapy The pendulum has swung so widely from hormone therapy is good for all women to its bad for all women to now somewhere in between This really does seem to be the appropriate place for the pendulum to come to rest But its been a long saga getting there Laughs Weve learned never to say never We want to look at genetic factors and blood biomarkers and other factors that may help with clinical decisionmaking But the bottom line is unlikely to change This is really likely to be the most definitive report from the Womens Health Initiative
