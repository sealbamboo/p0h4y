Vaccines have wiped out smallpox and theyve nearly eradicated polio Vaccination can control measles and mumps and they protect travelers against yellow fever and cholera Most are so good that a few doses in childhood cover people for decades even life But theres one vaccine that people have to get every single year and even then its not guaranteed to fully prevent infection Its the flu shot and scientists are struggling to find a way to make a better one Debbie Fauver believes in flu vaccines  so much so that she brings home a batch of syringes to immunize her family every year Shes a nurse working at a hospital in Greenville Ky and vaccinated her grown children and husband last November She was surprised when her yearold daughter Molly got the flu anyway It hit her quick Fauver told NBC News Molly developed back pain chill and a fever of  degrees Knowing prompt treatment can make a difference Fauver advised her daughter to visit a doctor right away where an onthespot test confirmed she had influenza and she was treated with a pill called Tamiflu The doctors seem to think that her flu strain probably wasnt covered in the flu shot Fauver says Thats one possibility Flu mutates like crazy and there are dozens of different strains and hundreds of possibilities In any one season three to four strains could be circulating and making people sick which is why this years vaccines protect against three or four strains  HN HN and either one or two B strains Theres a little bit of a guessing game each year Sometimes its not a good match says Dr Alicia Fry a physician with the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Influenza Division But even when the vaccine is a close match  when the virus strains that are infecting more people are the same strains used to make the vaccine  some people  even when they have been vaccinated The CDC usually reports in midFebruary on how well that seasons vaccine is performing This year so far virtually everyone who has had influenza had it tested and had it typed has had HN flu  a strain thats included in the vaccines Its been about an average flu season and flu seems to be on the wane but  children have been reported killed by the virus so far this year In  CDC says the flu vaccine  out of the hospital even though just  percent of Americans who should have been vaccinated did so At a  percent vaccination rate  more people would have been spared a hospital visit CDC estimates In any given year on average flu vaccines are about  percent effective  although theyre more effective than that in children We are trying to understand this We are trying to make vaccines better says Fry One worrying finding that has popped up on occasion seems to suggest that people who get vaccinated every year as recommended may sometimes have less protection than people who dont get regularly vaccinated Most recent was a study done last year by Dr Arnold Monto and colleagues at the University of Michigan who found that people vaccinated two years in a row didnt seem protected against flu at all But it was a very small group of people and it would be important to do a larger study designed specifically to ask that question Monto says Of the  people who tested positive for flu  percent had been vaccinated his team found We think that this is a good vaccine Its not a great vaccine Monto said We think that the disease that you get if you get vaccinated and still get infected is a milder disease We are trying to document that Fry notes that people who choose to be vaccinated every year may be different from people who dont for many reasons They tend to be older she said They often have other conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure or asthma We are trying very hard to understand prior vaccination and what it really means but I think at this point we dont understand it and we cant explain it in a simple way Fry added The bottom line is that at this point vaccination is the best prevention strategy that we have One reason that its hard to study the issue of prior vaccination is that its not considered ethical to do a randomized study  one in which people are randomly assigned to either get a vaccine or not and then watched to see if they get sick says Dr John Treanor of the University of Rochester in New York who helps develop and test flu vaccines So studies have to be done in the very complicated messy real world People who routinely get vaccinated may be different from people who dont They may be more likely to report  or admit  they are ill for instance And other studies have shown just the opposite  that people who get vaccinated more often have better protection Thats been shown more clearly in kids than adults I think the jury is still out Treanor said And there is always the issue of influenza itself changing and mutating a lot some years and not at all in others From the mids to  more than  years the HN strain dominated Then in  the pandemic HN swine flu a very distant relative of the Spanish flu that wiped out millions in  came into the mix Last year HN didnt do much at all And now this year its the dominant strain again This unpredictable pattern would make it hard to advise people to do anything but just get vaccinated Treanor says Its conceivable that if you were vaccinated last year and there was no change in the vaccine composition from the year before that you wouldnt need to be vaccinated Treanor said But as a public health policy it would be very hard to implement Scientists at government agencies universities and drug companies are all trying to solve this problem by working towards a socalled   Thats one that would protect against all or most flu strains Theyve improved vaccines a little bit and this season scientists are watching closely to see if the changes have an effect For instance theres a new highdose vaccine formulated to protect seniors better Older people who have weakened immune systems dont mount   to disease when they are vaccinated There are socalled quadrivalent fomulations which protect against four different strains of flu instead of three No flu vaccine protects people as well as a natural infection with influenza Monto notes But no one suggests skipping the vaccine and going for that natural infection  flu puts hundreds of thousands of people into the hospital every year and kills anywhere between  and  people including many   We all admit these are not optimal vaccines They are the best we have Fry said The admission may provide convenient excuses to people   to get vaccinated But CDC notes that  percent of the illnesses people get after theyre vaccinated are not flu but are caused by  such as rhinoviruses coronaviruses parainfluenza viruses and dozens more And even Fauver isnt put off by her daughters experience I would still take one every year and I recommend flu shots to everybody she said
