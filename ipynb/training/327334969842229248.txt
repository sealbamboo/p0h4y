When Superstorm Sandy inundated lower Manhattan last year thousands of lab animals drowned and many scientists lost months or even years of work One of those scientists is   a brain researcher at New York University Just hours before Sandy reached New York Fishell says he began to worry that animals housed in a basement below his lab were in danger I realized Hurricane Sandy and high tide were going to coincide at Battery Park which is right where my lab is he says But by then public transportation had shut down and Fishell was stuck at his home in suburban Westchester NY The next day as he tried to get back to his lab his worst fears were confirmed I got through to one of my postdocs who had been there since  in the morning Fishell says I asked Well how about the mice And he said he was really sorry but they were gone Fishell describes the events and the recovery process in  He says his first concern was for the younger researchers in his lab Some had lost more than a year of work But he was also disturbed to learn that thousands of animals had died unnecessarily It is hard to express how close a partnership we have with these animals Fishell says I mean they really are the way we learn about what we care most about which in our case is brain function But theyre living breathing individuals They also can be very hard to replace Fishells lab studies how cells in the brain communicate and what goes wrong in diseases like epilepsy and bipolar disorder The research depends on mice that have been genetically altered in very specific ways He couldnt just order replacements Fortunately Fishell had shared his mice with researchers at other institutions And when those scientists heard what had happened he says they responded Emails were pouring in from everyone from my very good friends to my very fierce competitors to say What can we do  he says  Can we send you mice Can we take your people and do research here Can we help you pick up an experiment sooner  Almost immediately Fishell began rebuilding his research program He also began thinking about how to prevent something like this from happening again Thats something places like the   have been working on since  when a tropical storm flooded downtown Houston We had  feet of water in a basement says Bradford S Goodwin a veterinary scientist at the center so every animal in our basement did drown Animals at other downtown institutions also died he says because no one had anticipated an event like that This is not something you learn in veterinary school Goodwin says He also says the loss was devastating and something he will never get over Every year he says researchers still hold a memorial for monkeys who died in the flood In response to the loss of so many animals the University of Texas began building a new facility with a different design Goodwin says The lower floors are research laboratories Animals live on the upper floors New York University also plans to move its animals to higher floors Fishell says In the meantime his lab is recovering more quickly than he thought possible He says one reason is something that happened after hed been told all the mice were dead About four days later he says the relief crews broke through the roof to the top of where the animal colony was and realized that about   percent of all the mice had survived Fishell says they lived because as Superstorm Sandy approached the woman in charge of lab animals asked her staff to move some mouse cages to the highest racks possible  just in case
