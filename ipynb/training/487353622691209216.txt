There are antlers everywhere on the walls of Bryan and Mike McDonels place near Pine Bluff Ark The house is hardly big enough for all their hunting trophies Both are good shots with their hunting bows Bryan and Mike his father served in the Arkansas National Guard and deployed together to Iraq twice The McDonel family has served in the military for generations But Bryan  is out of the service now He is one of thousands of troops and veterans who struggle with addiction to prescription drugs During wartime doctors and medics need to treat troops for pain and often use prescription opiates to solve that problem Americans in the military are prescribed narcotic painkillers three times as often as civilians This year the Department of Veterans Affairs is treating about  veterans by giving them opiates And that can end up creating a new problem for patients with pain addiction Abuse of prescription drugs is higher among troops than civilians and the rate soared throughout the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Both the Pentagon and the VA fear this drug use contributes to suicide and homelessness among the men and women who have served in the military In the leadup to his second tour in Iraq Bryan McDonel got hit in the back by a trailer hitch while loading heavy equipment and wound up getting back surgery He missed some training but his company needed his expertise with satellites and radios so they made sure he was classified as fit to deploy We knew the deployment was coming up and I didnt want to let my team down McDonel says You know that whole Im not gonna get left behind  I was hardheaded I ended up probably reinjuring it before it had time to heal Bryan McDonel got through his second Iraq deployment popping six Vicodin the powerful opiate painkiller per day as his doctor had prescribed When he got home his doctor kept him on opiates which is not uncommon Its a national problem says Dr Gavin West who heads the Opioid Safety Initiative at the Department of Veterans Affairs West says prescriptions for narcotic medications have skyrocketed inside and outside the military but that combat veterans have more pain to deal with than most We have a very large number of people coming home West says We have people coming back that maybe in the past would not have survived these injuries that have really significant pain syndromes from their injuries sustained on the battlefield The VA set up the opiate safety program last year in response to alarming rates of drug dependency among veterans The Pentagon also tracks substance abuse among troops which tripled between  and  Drug dependency can begin while troops are in the field  Bryan McDonels father Mike says he saw plenty of that in Iraq The troops if they got hurt theyd just shove you a bag of pills Mike says You never got a bottle and knew what was in it you always got a baggie If the pain medications made a soldier drowsy on patrol medics would give them a stimulant like Adderall If that made it hard to sleep Mike says there were medications for that too No matter what you needed there was a pill Everything under the sun from Adderall to Percocet to hydrocodone oxycodone you name it Mike says  My knee is hurting Well here here you go Well several of them got dependent And I guess theres that fine line between whats dependency and whats addiction Mike McDonel never thought his son had crossed that line Neither did Bryan  until his third deployment this time to Afghanistan He went on a twoweek assignment to Kandahar airfield without enough pills No big deal he thought The third or fourth day I was there I didnt have any more pills Bryan says I was OK You know it just hurt My lower back hurt like hell And I thought Id hurt myself again but then I started feeling real sick I didnt want to get out of the bed and I didnt understand what that was Bryan went to the medic who informed him that he was experiencing withdrawal from the Vicodin She put him on Percocet Bryan finished up his last deployment tired but proud He had a chest full of medals and even a Bronze Star Back in Pine Bluff he landed his dream job as an instructor with the Arkansas National Guard But he also brought home a wicked tolerance to opiates and the pills didnt work anymore I would take as many as I needed to stop hurting and I could function again normally says Bryan That was the whole deal I didnt want to be lazy I didnt want to stop And then everything came apart Bryan failed a routine urine test in August  Among the prescribed drugs in his system he tested positive for morphine  His commander told Bryan hed probably be kicked out of the military possibly with a less than honorable discharge Once it spiraled out of control there was no gaining it back I resigned my position says Bryan I called my wife and told her The McDonels are now divorced Without a job he lost the house and moved in with his parents Bryan did a bunch of things hes not proud of to get drugs He had some scrapes with the law When he stole money from home his parents kicked him out He lived in his car If he wasnt an addict before he was now The VA says drug dependence contributes to homelessness among veterans like Bryan And it is also a factor in the high rate of veteran suicide Gavin West of the Opioid Safety Program says the VA is trying to change its approach to stop offering opiates as a first option for pain Its always easier to just prescribe a pill West says At the VA weve really tried to work with other resources other types of medications These include acupuncture aqua therapy pool therapy physical therapy There really is a large arsenal for treating patients pain Four VA pilot programs are pushing alternatives for treating chronic pain The Pentagon is trying the same and both have seen a modest decrease in use of opiates since last year But much of this may be a bit late for Bryan His mother Pam says the damage is already done Its the worse thing Ive ever gone through Pam says I love the military more than anything in this world but I dont think its been done right this time Still at his discharge hearing something finally went Bryans way The presiding officer looked at his record over  years It was excellent Hed served three combat deployments She saw that he got hooked on pain medications because the military had prescribed them She insisted that Bryan McDonel had earned an honorable discharge  and thats what he got Since then its been one day at a time Bryan says Looking daily to find work every day working hard to try and start relationships again Bryan hasnt found work yet and says a sandwich shop just turned him down The manager said he was afraid that because Bryan had been to war he might have PTSD and snap  Because of uncertainty
