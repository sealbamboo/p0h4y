 Researchers at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston have discovered a cellregulating mechanism that they say plays a major role in metabolism and fat storage possibly paving the way for new obesity treatments The research in published in the journal   The mechanism called a cellcycle transcriptional coregulator manages the expression of DNA by either activating or suppressing genes This particular regulator is called TRIPBr and it works on the metabolic genes involved in   When researchers compared mice on a lowfat diet to mice on a highfat diet they found that the mice eating highfat diets had higher levels of TRIPBr in their fat tissue When they tested this theory on human fat they also found that TRIPBr significantly elevated the level of visceral fat in obese humans   and internal organs and has been found to be more harmful than fat elsewhere in a body notably raising a persons risk for heart disease and type  diabetes To further test the effect of TRIPBr researchers fed groups of mice genetically engineered not to produce TRIPBr either lowfat or highfat diets The mice on highfat diets who did not have TRIPBr in their bodies did not   and had healthy blood sugar and insulin levels This was surprising because normally any mammal on a highfat diet would automatically put on body weight says lead author Rohit N Kulkarni MD PhD This result suggests that suppressing TRIPBr could eventually help control obesity in humans Kulkarni says The results are particularly promising because biopsies of human fat appeared to be similar to the results of the mice study Many times when you move from mice to humans its slightly different Kulkarni says But here it looks like theres a solid link to pursue Kulkarni and his colleagues are next trying to identify what it is that leads to an accumulation of TRIPBr and what regulates its expression in the body In humans the next steps are to identify who is most susceptible to high and low levels of TRIPBr and determine whether   such as diet and exercise can reduce levels of TRIPBr in obese individuals
