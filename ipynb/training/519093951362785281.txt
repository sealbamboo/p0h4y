Those cells mark our position navigate where were going and help us remember it all so that we can repeat our trips the Nobel Assembly said in a statement  Their research could also prove useful in Alzheimers research because of the parts of the brain those cells lie in  the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi which lie in the inner core of the bottom of the brain and are responsible for memory and orientation The entorhinal cortices share these functions and connect the hippocampi with the huge neocortex the bulk of our gray matter In Alzheimers patients those two brain components break down early on causing sufferers to get lost more easily Understanding how the brains GPS works may help scientists in the future understand how this disorientation occurs The research is also important because it pinpoints a cellular basis for higher cognitive function the Nobel Assembly said The scientists conducted their research on rats but other research on humans indicates that we have these same cells OKeefe a British neuroscientist who is also an Americanborn US citizen made the first discovery in  when he came upon a nerve cell in the brain of a rat that was set off whenever the rat was in a particular place the statement said The scientist called them place cells  In  the Mosers Norwegian neuroscientists discovered yet another component  They identified another type of nerve cell which they called grid cells that generate a coordinate system and allow for precise positioning and pathfinding the statement read They also later figured out how place and grid cells work together to make the brain know where it is and where its headed  Oversimplified one could say that the place cells mark point A and point B in the brain and the grid cells help the brain get from point A to point B The prize money of  million Swedish kronor  million took an interesting split Half went to OKeefe and half went jointly to the Mosers who are a couple It would seem to reflect the halfhalf nature of their discoveries Mondays ceremony at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm Sweden will be followed by the announcement of the physics prize Tuesday the chemistry prize Wednesday and the economics prize on October  The prize for literature will be awarded on a date to be announced later The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded Friday Two Americans and a German shared the Nobel Prize in physiology last year James E Rothman and Randy W Schekman and German Thomas C Sudhof were awarded the prize for discoveries of how the bodys cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in  to honor work in physics chemistry literature and peace The first economics prize was awarded in
