Human sperm cells are very good at swimming upstream against a strong current to reach their ultimate goal  the egg  scientists have discovered Rather than swim in a straight line they spiral along to move to where the flow is slowest the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team observed  Their laboratory studies also hint that sperm may work together as a team rather than in competition Swimming as a shoal may boost the odds of fertilisation the scientists say  Of the hundreds of millions of sperm cells that begin the journey up the oviducts only a few ever reach their destination Not only do the cells have to swim in the right direction over distances that are around  times their own length but they are exposed to different chemicals and currents along the way To study how sperm deal with this challenge Prof Jorn Dunkel working with a team at Cambridge University set up a mini sperm assault course in their laboratory using a series of differentsized tubes and channels They discovered that at certain flow speeds the sperm cells were able to swim very efficiently upstream for several minutes The sperm tended to avoid the centre of the tube where the flow was fastest and instead wiggled along the walls of the channel in a spiralling motion The researchers suspect sperm cells do the same in the fallopian tube when swimming towards the egg  What is more sperm group together probably in order to swim faster the scientists told the journal eLife Prof Dunkel said It is a commonly held belief that there is competition between sperm cells with the fittest reaching the egg first But recent studies by our team and others show that sperm practically always accumulate at the surface of a tube and you can end up with a high local concentration of sperm cells so there could actually be cooperation among these cells that allows them to swim faster collectively
