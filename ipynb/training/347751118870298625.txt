A person having a stroke may not be in a war zone but his or her life is in danger all the same Thats enough to trigger posttraumatic stress disorder in some stroke survivors researchers say with symptoms like panic attacks nightmares and flashes of anger Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center reviewed all the studies on   and   and found that  percent of people who have strokes or ministrokes called   end up with PTSD symptoms in the year after PTSD is usually associated with the stress of battle but the anxiety disorder can affect people who have lived through any dangerous event  a tornado an assault the death of a loved one Since   that means that about  people could have PTSD after a stroke each year Not only is PTSD a devastating qualityoflife issue in its own right it appears to place people at risk in the future says   an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia and lead author of the study We know thats true in heart attacks Edmondson has studied   and has found that people who have PTSD are more likely to have another heart attack and die Though that hasnt been studied in stroke he thinks the pattern will be the same In heart attack the severity of the heart attack doesnt seem to matter Edmondson told Shots Its how much you feel youre in danger And he says the stress probably comes not only from having a lifethreatening medical condition but also from encountering an oftenchaotic health care system Earlier research has found that heart attack patients treated in a crowded emergency room develop more PTSD than those with a less turbulent health care experience The feeling of loss of control plays a big part in both PTSD from a health crisis may be more difficult for people to manage than battle stress Edmondson speculates A soldier can leave the battlefield and return home but no one can escape the body I cant avoid my heartbeats Edmondson says I cant avoid my blood pressure The very things that remind me of these stressful events are things I have to pay attention to all the time This   which was published online in the journal   is pretty small involving nine studies and just over  people Whats needed is a much bigger study that screens stroke patients for PTSD and follows them over time Edmondson says
