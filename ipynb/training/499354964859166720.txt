The case of the Australian couple accused of abandoning a baby born with Downs syndrome has made Caroline White  whose son has the disability  determined to change attitudes  I have been saddened by the recent coverage of   It shocked me that we still attach a value to peoples lives We are talking about twin babies here Twins who shared a womb for nine months and share the same birthday Yet the way they have been treated has been very different  I am forever grateful that I did not know that my sixyearold son Seb had Downs syndrome until he was in my arms A prenatal diagnosis would have sent me into a frenzy of fear but thankfully I had no choice but to get to know my baby and fall headoverheels in love with him Gammys Australian parents have said that they didnt know until late in the pregnancy that he had Downs and his father has said that if they had he probably would have asked the surrogate to abort This isnt surprising After all more than  of positive prenatal diagnoses in the UK end in abortion  But Seb in six tiny years has taught me more than any words or textbook or Facebook page ever could and I would not swap a single thing about him or our lives together I now have a very different attitude and understanding not just to Downs syndrome or disability but generally in life I now do see that we are born equals all with our own different and unique strengths and weaknesses we are all of equal value and it saddens me that others cannot see this It seems it is only those of us who have a child or relative with Downs or those who have worked with children with Downs who are not afraid of it  I see everywhere we go how Seb touches people with his vibrant personality his lust for life and giant beaming smile People always comment on how gorgeous he is  a blessing Sometimes it may be patronising or pitying but most of the time it seems genuine  And Seb does stand out  but largely due to his incredible social skills and impeccable manners  not because he has an extra chromosome Seb makes friends with other children eats in restaurants plays table tennis and loves swimming  Yet there is still talk of the risk of having a child with Downs syndrome Risk is a word associated with danger It is placing your life savings your house and your car on one number on a roulette wheel I have lost count of the number of friends and colleagues who have told me excitedly that their pregnancy is low risk for Downs I am not silly enough to think anyone wishes to have a child with Downs and I would be a hypocrite for being offended After all I was relieved with my subsequent pregnancies too that I was low risk But the word hurts me because without realising it people are telling me they are delighted they are at a low risk of having a child like mine Such a big deal is placed on testing for Downs that it only serves to wrongly send fear through those who receive a positive diagnosis I know it did for me at first  If we could replace risk with chance I think we would make a small bit of difference  I cant help but wonder how the people who have interacted with Seb would feel if they themselves were told they had a high risk of their child or grandchild having Downs I imagine theyd be full of fear too but I like to think that Seb changes outdated attitudes wherever he goes and I am sure this is true to a point  People need to stop placing a value on babies lives They cannot be treated like a commodity an accessory and a right Both of the twins in the Thai surrogacy case have the right to equality and the potential to enrich and change the lives of those around them for the better  as Seb does for us
