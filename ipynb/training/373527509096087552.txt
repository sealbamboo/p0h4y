It was hard to ignore those headlines saying that people with migraine have brain damage even if youre not among the  percent or so who do suffer from these painful recurring headaches Dont panic says the neurologist whose work sparked those alarming headlines Its still not something to stay up nights worrying about says Dr Richard Lipton director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York But knowing about the brain anomalies that Lipton and his colleagues found might help people reduce their stroke risk Some people who get   do have a slightly   And some of the brain changes identified in the study look like ministrokes On the MRI they look like very tiny strokes Lipton tells Shots But the people arent having any stroke symptoms Still Lipton is convinced that the process is the same We now know its a risk factor for these very small silent strokes he says The scientists evaluated data from  studies in which people with migraine headaches got MRI scans of their brains Just about everybody is going to have some abnormalities show up in a scan But the people who had migraines were more likely to have two common abnormalities white matter abnormalities and infarctlike lesions The   were published in the journal   The brains white matter coordinates communication among brain regions Whitematter abnormalities are more likely in people with headaches and as people grow older Scientists have been studying these abnormalities for decades but still dont know if they have any health impact This study found that people with migraines were more likely to have whitematter abnormalities compared to people with no migraines but only four studies had good enough data to evaluate They sometimes scare the patient and even the doctor Lipton says of the abnormalities My take is that because theyre common and of unknown significance theyre nothing to worry about Doctors should reassure patients that this is nothing to worry about the study says But the infarctlike lesions might be something for people to worry about or at least act on The scientists found that people with aura who see flashing lights or other visual disturbances before the migraine itself starts are more likely to have tiny brain lesions that look like strokes called infarctlike lesions That doesnt mean that people with those lesions will have strokes But since there is a slightly higher stroke risk in people who have migraine with aura Lipton says it would be wise to practice   My sense is that people who have migraine with aura should be particularly vigilant about managing their other stroke risk factors Lipton says That means not smoking getting exercise and eating healthful foods If they have high blood pressure diabetes or high cholesterol they should work with their physician to reduce their overall stroke risk Thats good advice for everybody not just people with migraines Historically migraines were considered harmless if miserable But recently scientists have begun to think that the disorder may be tied to neurological abnormalities caused by genetic mutations That may be why migraines often run in families This research is part of ongoing efforts to figure out how brain structure and function could be causing   or how the headaches might affect the brain The study also found that people with more frequent migraines had more infarctlike lesions suggesting that avoiding migraine triggers could protect the brain Taking steps to reduce the number of migraines you have will certainly improve your life today Lipton says and might have longterm benefits
