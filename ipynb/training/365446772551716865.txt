Imagine a friend of a friend brings his family to stay with you  his family of tiny survivalists For weeks or months you all live quietly side by side with no problems You share meals Your kids play together Then one day you get sick  maybe felled by a bad cold or the flu Suddenly certain the end is near your jittery houseguest breaks out an armorys worth of chemical weapons He abandons his community to save himself and hunt for a new home wreaking havoc on the way out the door Thats essentially the story line microbiologists in Buffalo NY have now worked out for why colonies of   bacteria aka   can camp out happily and harmlessly for months at a time in the nose and throats of humans then abruptly turn on their hosts The germs sometimes trigger painful earaches or even meningitis in kids and often pneumonia in the elderly and others with weak immune systems Its no small problem The World Health Organization calls   a major global public health problem In  alone pneumococcus provoked an estimated  million bouts of serious illness worldwide according to the WHO and killed perhaps  children under the age of  We were interested in getting at the mechanism  why these bacteria would suddenly migrate from the throat to the middle ear lungs or bloodstream which are normally sterile   a microbiologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo tells Shots We wanted to know why people get sick He thinks he and his colleagues may have figured it out In a cool bit of science they recently   in the journal   the researchers describe how they created a microbial community in a lab dish that mimics what happens in the lining of the human nose and upper throat Normally   bacteria organize themselves there into a stable and highly structured slick or   with other microbes Hakansson says Youll see towers growing up he says with channels coming down for water and nutrients all layered atop the human cells But when the scientists added a pinch of flu virus to the mix  or in several other ways tweaked the little ecosystem to mimic what happens to the body when we catch the flu  the bacteria changed dramatically Increasing the colonys temperature mimicking the fever of flu for example or adding the stresslinked hormone norepinephrine prompted some of the microbes to abruptly break off from the community And as they dispersed the bacteria switched on a set of genes that made each one far more virulent when the scientists squirted them into mice In contrast squirts of bacteria taken from the stable colonies of   migrated to the animals throats and harmlessly set up shop there just as they usually do in people Hakansson says he suspects though cant say for certain that the lungs and middle ears are just culdesacs where the activated pioneering bacteria get stuck during their hunt for a new home in a healthier host The fact that their human host gets very sick or even dies from such infections isnt good for the bacteria either At any given time between  and  percent of children under age  are colonized with the bacteria Hakansson says and between  and  percent of adults Typically these bacterial campsites persist for a few days weeks or months and dont produce symptoms They dont mean to make us sick Hakansson says Find that cold comfort You can boost your defenses The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that all children under age  adults with certain risk factors and all adults  or older get vaccinated against the microbe
