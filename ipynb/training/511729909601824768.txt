Doctors are overextended, skeptical of changes wrought by the federal health law, but more optimistic about the future of medicine than they were two years ago, according to a new survey of 20,000 U.S. physicians.. Despite many specific complaints, 71% of those polled said they would choose to become doctors again if they were making the choice today, up from 66% two years ago. And 50% would recommend it to their children, compared with 42% in 2012 and 40% in 2008.
