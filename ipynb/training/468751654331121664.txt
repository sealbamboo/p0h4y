Heres a new reason to leave that seatback tray table in its upright and locked position Diseasecausing bacteria can linger for days even up to a week on most airplane surfaces new research shows Its no reason not to fly of course but a team of microbiologists and engineers at Auburn University in Alabama found that nasty bugs like MRSA and E coli OH can hitch extended rides on armrests window shades tray tables toilet handles and more Given the right circumstances that contact could lead to infection with methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus or the E coli gut bug that can cause kidney failure said Kiril Vaglenov a postdoctoral fellow in materials science who led the study He presented the findings Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology Many travelers are concerned about the risks of catching a disease from other passengers when they spend long hours in crowded air cabins Vaglenov told NBC News Vaglenovs study was funded in part by a program of the Federal Aviation Administration or FAA in partnership with Delta Air Lines He didnt test the germs inside an actual plane Instead he collected old parts from Delta and used them in his experiments that applied MRSA and E coli bacteria suspended in various solutions including those that mimicked human saliva and sweat What he found was unsettling for anyone whos wondered how many fingers have touched the seat pocket that holds the inflight instructions MRSA lasted  hours  a week  on the cloth seatback pocket Vaglenov found Other tests showed that E coli O hung around for  hours  four days  on the material from the airplane armrest I wouldnt touch that pocket Vaglenov said I think that it should be replaced with something less porous Delta officials emphasized that all surfaces in their planes are disinfected every night and before every departure according to spokeswoman Lindsay McDuff But a top infection control specialist says that its no surprise that the Auburn team found bacteria hang around on such surfaces We live in a microbial environment or we could say in a germy world said Dr William Schaffner a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville Tennessee He calls the new study overly meticulous and suggests that the real worry on a plane isnt the germs on the armrest but the cold and flu viruses many passengers pack with their carryons In either case the best defense isnt an arsenal of bleach wipes but simple hand hygiene Schaffner said Its another reminder to wash our hands
