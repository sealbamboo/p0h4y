Plenty of Americans wouldnt dream of buying a book or renting a movie without checking online ratings first  and increasingly theyre going online when looking for a doctor too a new survey shows Nearly two thirds of the  people polled in the Internetbased survey said that physician ratings were at least somewhat important in choosing a doctor Of those  percent said internet ratings were very important Researchers compensated for potential bias of an Internet poll by providing free Internetconnected computers to respondents without access The new findings may make a lot of physicians unhappy said the studys lead author Dr David Hanauer an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan School of Medicine Most physicians are very concerned about Internet rating sites he said They feel that the negative comments are going to outweigh the positive ones Though physician rating sites are gaining traction the report published in JAMA found that a personal reference from family and friends was still more important to most people as was whether a physician was accepted by the patients health insurance policy Hanauers main concern is the trustworthiness of the websites doing the rating How do consumers know where to go to get reliable information he said That problem may soon be solved said Dr Ashish Jha a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health Its something that Medicare is working on Jha said Theyre trying to build a site with good quality information In the meantime doctors shouldnt be so worried about negative patient reviews Jha said adding if you look at websites that let patients rate doctors most of the ratings are quite positive His message to consumers is simple If you go to a site and see one rating and its negative dont put too much stock in it But if there are  ratings and theyre mostly negative thats a lot more compelling
