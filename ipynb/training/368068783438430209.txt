What happens in our brains while were asleep Thats one question neuroscientist Penelope Lewis is trying to answer She directs the Sleep and Memory Lab at the University of Manchester in England Her new book is   Lewis joins  s Terry Gross to talk about how sleep affects memory and how REM sleep can affect depression When it comes to strengthening memory we know that the neural responses in your brain that are associated with things youve recently experienced are spontaneously replayed or we say reactivated while youre asleep So that means supposing you are learning to play the piano  youre moving your fingers a lot Thats associated with responses in motor areas of your brain  Those areas will become active again while youre asleep and that replay  or reactivation  is what we think is responsible for the strengthening So its kind of like your brain is rehearsing stuff without you knowing while youre asleep You clean up after youve made a mess right So thats exactly what sleep seems to do for the brain  Across the day while were busy doing things experiencing things seeing things hearing things learning things processing different kinds of information the connections between neurons in the brain get strengthened because theyre trying to retain all of this information And an awful lot of it is garbage its stuff you dont want to remember or dont care about  what you had for breakfast or the color of a stain on the cover of a book or something Its really not useful or interesting And the problem is if you keep storing all of this stuff you reach capacity and you cant keep storing more And so what happens during sleep and specifically during the deep stage of sleep that we call slowwave sleep is that all of those synapses get downscaled again So where theyve been strengthened up they all get proportionally downscaled In some people who are depressed its a good thing to suppress their REM sleep because REM is associated with specifically strengthening emotional memories and in many cases negative memories So theres an idea that it might be that in people who have too much REM as many depressed people do these negative memories are getting overstrengthened and that can actually be quite damaging and quite pathological My lab is particularly interested in how memories change while were asleep People might think that memories once theyre formed they remain static and its just kept like a library book on a shelf and then you can pull it out when you want to But actually thats not the case Memories evolve constantly They change and a lot of that evolution seems to happen while youre asleep  Wed like to understand what sleep is really for So we spend onethird of our lives asleep as humans Thats a huge proportion Thats more time than we spend doing anything else So its got to be important for something So part of the purpose of the research that Im doing is trying to understand that  Another part of it is trying to understand something about memory Memory is fundamental to the way our brains work Its fundamental to our personalities and there are an awful lot of unknown questions about memories  How they change over time how do we extract this information How do we go from an experience to having that experience integrated with everything else you know about the world
