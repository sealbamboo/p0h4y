A recent study reported that joggers who exercise strenuously have the same life expectancy as people who do barely any exercise at all But the author has now admitted he hasnt actually proved this Training very hard as bad as no exercise at all reported the BBC Fast running is as deadly as sitting on couch agreed the Daily Telegraph and countless other newspapers around the world striking fear into the hearts of hardcore runners The headlines were based on the results of a large Danish study  more than  healthy joggers and almost  healthy nonjoggers were followed up over  years as part of the Copenhagen City Heart Study  The results were published in the prestigious   The headline conclusion was that light and moderate joggers live longer on average than people who have sedentary lifestyles and dont exercise at all whereas  and this was the surprise  strenuous joggers dont  Strenuous joggers were defined as people who run at a fast pace  more than mph  for more than four hours per week or more than three times per week for at least twoandahalf hours in total  But although the overall number of people studied was large the number of strenuous joggers was not Only  people fitted the strenuous jogging category  two of them had died  Critics say these numbers are too small to be statistically significant And the researchers dont know how the two strenuous joggers died  whether they had succumbed to an illness such as cardiovascular disease or whether they had been involved in some sort of accident They could have been knocked down by a bus The lead author of the study clinical cardiologist Dr Peter Schnohr now concedes that he didnt have the evidence to say that strenuous jogging is bad for you We should have said we suspect that it is so but we cant say for sure Everybody makes some mistakes in papers he says But Schnohr thinks experienced readers of research papers would have realised this  he says it was obvious from the statistical analysis that you couldnt have confidence in the claim that strenuous joggers have the same average life expectancy as those with a sedentary lifestyle It shouldnt have been misunderstood he says because if you go into the statistics the limits of the research are clear If you normally read papers you could say Ah This is not good statistically  this is too thin  But most journalists around the world werent going to be delving into the statistical tables  they take their lead from the researchers conclusions according to Alicia White who analysed the study for the UKs    In todays world research findings can rapidly be disseminated across the globe  particularly when they capture the public imagination due to a shocking finding she says  Its not realistic to assume that everyone who hears a headline will track down the research paper read and critically appraise it before they decide to act or share it with their friends Thats why it is so important that research findings their implications and limitations are communicated in a clear way right from the start The Journal of the American College of Cardiology which published the research stands by the paper Some news articles appear to have misinterpreted and exaggerated the story leading to misleading headlines says editorinchief Valentin Fuster  But the fact remains that the papers headline conclusion included the statistically insignificant finding about strenuous jogging  something Peter Schnohr admits shouldnt have been highlighted Even so he doesnt regret the shockhorror headlines and isnt worried that they might have put people off jogging I dont think so you always have deaths in marathons and so on he says  and suggests that with regular checkups cases of heart disease may have been detected and some of these fatalities could have been prevented  Schnohr remains convinced that although he hasnt proved it this time strenuous jogging might be bad for you Were not saying that you should not do the marathon but were saying that maybe every other year you should do an investigation  echocardiography and so on  to look at your heart He says that his findings that light jogging is associated with significantly lower mortality rates is robust though and that this important health message was picked up by a number of media outlets
