Federal drug investigators have joined Pennsylvania officials' effort to find the source of a deadly batch of heroin that has killed 22 people in the western part of the state during the past two weeks.. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office, federal Drug Enforcement Administration and local law-enforcement authorities have been on high alert because the heroin involved in some deaths has contained fentanyl, a synthetic opiate often used during surgery that has played a role in other outbreaks of heroin overdoses.
