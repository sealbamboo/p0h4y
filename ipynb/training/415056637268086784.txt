For Matthew and Brianne Wojtesta it all started about a week after the birth of their daughter Vera Matthew was picking up his son from kindergarten when he got a phone call It was their pediatrician with some shocking news Vera had been flagged by New Yorks   as possibly having a potentially deadly disease and would need to go see a neurologist the next day Like every state New York requires that newborns get a small heel prick so that a few drops of blood can be sent to a lab for testing The idea is to catch health problems that could cause death or disability without early intervention But in recent years patient advocacy groups have been pushing states to adopt mandatory newborn screening for more and more diseases including ones that have no easy diagnosis or treatment One of those is   a rare and devastating neurological disorder In  New York became the first state to screen for Krabbe and until recently it was the only state to do so Screening for this disease is expanding even though some experts say the treatment available doesnt seem to help affected children as much as was initially hoped  and testing can put some families in a kind of fearful limbo New York has screened nearly  million children for Krabbe About  have been picked out as needing followup tests and evaluation to see if they really have the disease One of those was Vera Wojtesta After getting that disturbing news Matthew Wojtesta went to the familys home in Rochester where his wife was still recuperating from childbirth Brianne remembers that he sat on the bed and woke her up very gently putting his hand on her knee and saying You know honey the doctor just called   That night after their older children were sleeping they got on the Internet and read and read It was terrifying to learn what Krabbe can do to a child Babies with Krabbe have an enzyme deficiency that damages a coating around nerves called myelin At first babies with the disease seem normal But then everything starts to change  and without screening families become desperate as they struggle to figure out whats wrong Angel Custer and Anthony Shaffer had that awful experience They are Grammy and Pappy to   Custers monthold granddaughter She lives with them in Harrisburg Pa When Jaylah was a few months old she stopped drinking from her bottle because she couldnt suck on it She was screaming in pain almost nonstop She stopped smiling she stopped laughing says Custer We lost all that By the time a doctor diagnosed Krabbe disease it was too late for any treatment Jaylah cant move her arms or legs She cant sit up or talk She cant even swallow her own spit  someone has to suction it out with a tube many times an hour Custer and Shaffer work staggered shifts so they can care for Jaylah around the clock They try to help her experience everything she can She eats through a tube but they let her taste pickles and olives and give her Dum Dum lollipops Jaylah watches cartoons like Dora and SpongeBob and Shaffer gives her elaborate manicures But like other children with Krabbe Jaylah will eventually go deaf and blind and then die I always said you wouldnt put your dog through that But weve got to watch our child go through that says Custer Thats why Custer has been urging lawmakers in her state to follow the lead of New York The New York screening program really only began because of Jim Kelly a former Buffalo Bills quarterback who is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame After his son Hunter was diagnosed with Krabbe Kelly and his family started a foundation called Hunters Hope In  physicians published an   in the   on using umbilical cord blood transplants to treat newborns with Krabbe Babies who survived this risky treatment did much better than babies who got no treatment But the transplant had to be done before symptoms appeared And babies were only being diagnosed that early if they had an older sibling who previously had developed Krabbe revealing that the disease ran in the family With a viable treatment suddenly available the   convinced New York officials that every newborn in the state should be tested I was frankly amazed when it went through I really never thought theyd be able to do it says   a neurologist who was working at the University at Buffalo School of Medicine when she diagnosed Hunter Kelly in  I didnt realize how complicated it was going to be says Duffner None of us realized how complicated it was going to be Because the disease is so rare there was a lot that doctors didnt know One thing was clear There are different forms of Krabbe The early infantile form hits babies but lateonset forms of Krabbe can start in childhood the teen years or even decades into adulthood Duffner says a consortium of experts in New York had to quickly come up with an approach that would let them identify newborns with the severe early form that requires urgent action No one else had done it prior to New York state says   director of the states newborn screening program And so there wasnt really demonstration at least early on that the screening test actually worked or that it could be done The state lab in Albany checks a babys enzyme level and if its below a certain cutoff the lab also examines part of the babys DNA Then these initial screening results are sent to a specialist who meets with the family and evaluates the infant Brianne and Matthew Wojtesta didnt sleep much as they waited for Veras neurology appointment I think the scariest part was that they are asymptomatic at the very beginning says Brianne Vera looked so healthy But if Vera had Krabbe theyd have to fly her to specialists at Duke University in North Carolina for an irreversible procedure that she might not survive They went to the University of Rochester Medical Center where a neurologist   had their lab results She told them that what was seen in Veras DNA probably meant shes just a carrier who did not actually have the disease I didnt think it was going to be a difficult situation at all says Kwon But she couldnt be sure until she ran more tests The parents spent an anxious week waiting for the results We talked a lot we cried we read science says Matthew To their great relief the tests showed Vera does not have any form of Krabbe In this case Kwon says she could be reassuring But for other families she cant When doctors run DNA tests and see genetic mutations its not clear what they all mean There is one mutation strongly associated with the early infantile form of Krabbe but many other mutations are a mystery With ambiguous test results sometimes Kwon has to tell parents that its possible that their child may develop some form of Krabbe at some point But I cant tell you when I cant tell you what its going to look like I cant tell you if theres any way to prevent it And I cant tell you that we will be able to treat it if it develops says Kwon So thats very difficult for families to hear She says theyre often angry and scared Now as they watch their children grow up theyre haunted by the thought of this terrible disease This has happened to dozens of families in New York None of these kids has shown any symptoms as far as anyone knows And when the screening program does find unmistakable signs of infant Krabbe the treatment has turned out to be problematic as well Five infants in New York have been candidates for cord blood transplants One family refused Four babies got treatment Two of them died of complications One child is severely neurologically impaired And one child has had problems but has been able to start kindergarten All of this has left Kwon feeling like the benefits do not outweigh the potential harms No one should be screening for disorders that are this difficult Kwon says She wants to help children and doesnt want Krabbe to exist but she is not convinced that newborn screening is the way to make it go away Shes not the only one who takes this view My heart goes out to any parent who is going to have a child with this diagnosis It is a devastating diagnosis But just because parents are desperate doesnt mean that we should offer them things that actually arent going to help says   a medical ethicist at the University of Chicago With so many unknowns newborn screening for Krabbe has to be seen as research Ross says And she points out its unethical to enroll people in a research experiment without their consent If states want to try screening newborns for Krabbe she says they should first get parents permission instead of simply requiring the test by law When we think of a public health mandate we think about something for which early testing and screening is going to prevent morbidity and mortality says Ross We dont think of creating individuals for whom we say we dont know if this is a health problem we dont know when it will be a health problem It can be wrenching for parents who get false positives or uncertain results from newborn screening says   a sociologist at the University of California Los Angeles who has studied families reactions to screening for rare disorders You have completely changed the experience of having a baby You have completely changed what it means to have a newborn he says Rather than looking at your little bundle of joy and smiling you are looking at a child as if he or she can die at any moment But some doctors do support Krabbe screening   a Krabbe specialist at Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh says that even if the available treatment isnt perfect families develop relationships with their children and no matter what degree of disability they have they treasure each day that they are spending with their children And without screening undiagnosed babies with Krabbe will suffer she says They wont get the right drugs to ease pain and other symptoms until doctors finally figure out that they have this uncommon disease It is a terrible thing to see And when you experience that when you live that thats when you realize how important newborn screening is says Escolar The small group of families whose children have lived is the driving force behind an expansion of Krabbe screening Missouri started last year and has found a halfdozen ambiguous cases with test results that suggest a risk of some form of this disease New Jersey and Illinois will start screening next year and New Mexico has decided to do it too Christina Levasheff is trying to get her home state California to start screening  and her husband lost their son   to Krabbe He seemed perfectly healthy until he was about   years old Then he began to have symptoms and within five months he could no longer speak move or see Levasheff who lives in Orange County says she first heard of newborn screening for Krabbe after Judson had passed away Thinking back to the days before Krabbe struck her son she asked herself Would I have wanted to know that he had this disease She decided that the answer is yes When you have a child thats going to face a terminal disease she says do you want knowledge and options and choice or do you want it to just happen to you Levasheff says screening is needed because all efforts to find new treatments for Krabbe in the future are going to depend on knowing about this progressive disease before symptoms appear The Hunters Hope Foundation ultimately wants screening to be done nationwide Children are not being screened for Krabbe at birth and dying because of it And they die a very slow and painful death says Anna Grantham who runs the foundations newborn screening effort In  an expert committee that advises the federal government looked at New Yorks results and did not recommend that all states adopt it Grantham says she hopes the committee will revisit that decision but that will take time We feel like theres not time to wait for that because lives are being lost says Grantham Brianne and Matthew Wojtesta say they dont know if mandated screening is the right way to handle all of these difficult issues They personally were glad for the testing even though they also say it was traumatic Brianne says for her the fear lingers even though the good news they got about Vera was the best possible outcome What part of this disease do we not know what part of the genetic composition do we not know what about the late onset she wonders Irrationally I know it still hangs over me Its still scary The experience has changed her and she says it will forever be a part of her relationship with her daughter
