The pull of addiction can come from many directions from food to alcohol to the Internet So what connects those dependencies Addiction is a memory its a reflex Its training your brain in something which is harmful to yourself says Dr Charles P OBrien cofounder of the Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania Brain imaging shows that associations with the addiction  pictures odors or people  make the brain light up even a month after a person has quit Its a reflex They dont have to think about it OBrien tells   host Rachel Martin There have been many advances in treatment he says including medication that can minimize the euphoria an alcoholic feels when drinking But OBrien says combining various treatments is the best approach I tell all my students that they should learn about the AA groups in their area  and they should be proud of it because its an American invention that doesnt make any money for anyone  its free Its not violent and it only helps people And unfortunately AA groups contain wellintentioned people but they dont have the kind of information and training that they need to be good therapists And I always refer all of my patients to an AA group as an adjunct  but it is not treatment We also have evidence from randomized trials showing that patienttreatment matching is in general the best way to go So that means essentially you evaluate the patient you find out about their problems  whether theyre marriage problems depression problems or whatever  and then you focus on that in addition to the drinking So patients are different even though at its core addiction is similar One of the most vexing problems for me is to see all the progress thats been made and to see how little this has permeated the medical profession and the specialists that run the treatment programs You know theres a lot of rigidity in these therapists and I think that something good is happening today since the people who framed the Affordable Care Act decided that all people with substance abuse disorders should be treated  and I hope that doctors will begin to learn about the benefits of these new medications I think that in general the safest thing is to be totally abstinent Now what weve learned based on scientific articles is that going from being a very heavy drinker to just a moderate drinker is better for your health and for your behavior and so forth but its also risky So that those very heavy drinkers who dont become abstinent but rather just reduce the level of drinking theyre at a higher risk for slipping all the way back to the worst kind of drinking So I tell my patients that the best thing is to totally stop
