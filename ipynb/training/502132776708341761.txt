To improve your odds of a highquality marriage try not to have too many sexual partners before you meet the one And when you do find him or her consider inviting at least  people to your wedding Thats just some of the practical advice offered by a pair of psychology researchers from the University of Denver who have studied  people who participated in the   All of them were single and between the ages of  and  when they joined the study in  and  and all of them had tied the knot by the time the researchers checked in with them five years later The goal was to identify patterns of behavior that tended to set people up for successful and fulfilling marriages The researchers asked study volunteers questions about marital happiness confiding in one another believing things are going well in the relationship and thoughts of divorce according to their report published this week Those who ranked in the top  were considered to have highquality marriages The researchers    and    emphasized that the choices men and women make long before they say I do seem to have a strong influence on their marriages years later What happens in Vegas doesnt stay in Vegas so to speak they wrote Our past experiences especially when it comes to love sex and children are linked to our future marital quality For instance the study volunteers were asked how many sexual partners they had before they got married and the response on average was five But  of them had slept only with the person they married and they scored higher on the marriage quality test than those who had more experience In fact for women the higher the number of sexual partners the less happy she reported her marriage to be according to the report People who had already been through a divorce or who had lived with someone before meeting their current spouse were also less likely to have a highquality marriage The researchers found that  of these people earned that designation compared with  of those who had only lived with their eventual spouse Whats wrong with having a past More experience may increase ones awareness of alternative partners Rhoades and Stanley wrote and a strong sense of alternatives is believed to make it harder to maintain commitment to and satisfaction with what one already has Theres also the fact that people who have more exsignificant others have been through more breakups A history of multiple breakups may make people take a more jaundiced view of love and relationships they added The researchers also noted that  of the people in the study either had children from a prior relationship by the time they tied the knot or married someone who did There is no question that raising children from prior relationships can add stress to a marriage the researchers wrote Couples that took relationship milestones seriously were more likely to have highquality marriages compared with couples that merely stumbled into things For instance  of the study volunteers said their relationship with their husband or wife began with a casual hookup Among these folks  had a highquality marriage compared with  of those who took things more slowly Likewise among couples who moved in together before making a commitment to marry only  had a highquality marriage the researchers reported That compares with  of couples who decided to live together only after agreeing that they were on a path to marriage You might think that cohabitation before marriage would improve ones chances for a successful marriage since it gives couples time to adjust to the realities of living together But Rhoades and Stanley theorized that once men and women had meshed their finances furniture and pets the effort required to get out of a lessthanideal relationship was simply too great Some may therefore slide into a marriage that they would have otherwise avoided the researchers wrote A safer way to test a relationship would be to take a trip together or meet one anothers families they added Even worse than casually moving in together before marriage was having a child together before marriage at least for those who had graduated from college Only  of collegeeducated couples who had a baby before they got married had a highquality marriage That compares with  of collegeeducated couples who had not yet had a child together Finally theres the matter of the wedding itself Among the  study volunteers  did not have a formal wedding ceremony and only  of these couples had a highquality marriage Meanwhile  of couples that did have formal weddings achieved highquality marriage status The researchers speculated that couples who are struggling or less happy in their relationship may be less likely to want to celebrate getting married They also noted that the act of having a public ceremony  symbolizes a clear decision to commit to ones marriage Apparently the larger the guest list the bigger the statement The researchers found that  of couples that got hitched in front of  or more guests had highquality marriages compared with only  of those who had  or fewer guests That means that couples who had big weddings were  more likely to have highquality marriages than couples who had smaller weddings In case you were wondering  of the couples who had mediumsized weddings went on to have highquality marriages How could this possibly matter There is some reason to believe that having more witnesses at a wedding may actually strengthen marital quality the researchers wrote People want to keep the promises they make in public so the bigger the crowd the greater the pressure this thinking goes For those who are already married and cant go back in time to rewrite their relationship history Rhoades and Stanley have some encouraging words No one is doomed to an unhappy marriage Its never too late for couples to make deliberate decisions about important milestones instead of simply sliding into them Talking openly about how past experiences shape your current views can help as well they wrote The Relationship Development Study was funded with a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development part of the National Institutes of Health The new report was published by the   at the University of Virginia
