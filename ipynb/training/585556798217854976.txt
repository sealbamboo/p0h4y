What does an oceangoing titaness do after she has the lost the ability to bear young Well for starters she goes on livingsometimes past the ripe old age of  while male killer whales over  are dying off in droves Throughout the animal kingdom that is unusual enough But the menopausal female killer whale does more than survive says a new   She leans in becoming an influential leader of younger killer whales honing the survival skills of her progeny unencumbered by direct childcare duties of her own Quite the opposite of being a burden to her kind her postmenopausal leadership role seems to make the older female killer whale her species evolutionary ace in the hole Published in the journal Current Biology the new research finds that among killer whales also known as orcas females beyond their reproductive years become habitual leaders of collective movementgenerally foraging movementwithin their pods Their position on point becomes particularly prominent in lean years when salmonthe mainstay of the killer whales dietis scarce The new findings offer the first evidence that in certain species and under specific circumstances females who live well beyond their reproductive years act as repositories of ecological knowledge That helps solve an enduring mystery among biologists Whyin humans and in two species of toothed whales onlywould individuals who no longer propagate their genes continue to survive The authors of the study are marine mammal researchers from the universities of York and Exeter in Britain and the Center for Whale Research in Washington state To glean their findings they analyzed  hours of video taken of Southern resident killer whales during annual salmon migrations off the coast of British Columbia and Washington The videos were taken over a period of nine years They captured the movements of pods of killer whales whose populations have been identified and tracked since  That allowed the researchers to determine the age and relatedness of the  creatures whose movements they analyzed Such detail also allowed the authors to speculate on why postmenopausal survival is so very rare If postreproductive females can be such an evolutionary boon for their kin why do they not survive to serve that function across many species Some have suggested that for humans at least the postmenopausal survival of women is merely an artifact of better medical care Not so new researchincluding the killer whales studysuggests The answer the authors of this study wrote may lie in different kinship patterns Among killer whales generations of males and females stay together throughout their lives foraging as a group As a female ages her level of genetic relatedness to members of her pod increases Menopause will only evolve they wrote when inclusive fitness benefits outweigh the costs of terminating reproduction In short an older females continued value to the group may be a function not only of her accumulated knowledge about the whereabouts of food shelter and predators but also of her genetic stake in the groups survival That was the case too in huntergatherer human societies the authors note As human societies evolved women reaching sexual maturity tended to leave the group As her sons and their many mates and children populated her group an aging womans relatedness to that group tended to grow In contrast among other longlived mammals sons move off as they reach sexual maturity So a female becomes less related to the pod she stays with as she become older Under those circumstances the authors write she may have sufficient ecological wisdom but not a sufficient level of relatedness to her group to ensure her survival beyond the years of reproduction
