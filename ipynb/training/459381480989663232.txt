Measles cases in the US are surging at the fastest pace in nearly two decades fueled mostly by unvaccinated travelers sparking outbreaks from California to New York  and now in Ohio where  members of an Amish community may have fallen ill The  are contracting the highly contagious virus in places like the    where a measles outbreak has sickened more than  people and killed at least   and then infecting communities of unvaccinated children and adults back home Current outbreaks of measles in the US serve as a reminder that these diseases are only a plane ride away CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said Thursday Borders cant stop measles but vaccination can At least  measles cases from  states have been reported in the US in  so far the highest number for the period since  officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported But those figures dont count cases reported after April  including four unvaccinated Amish people who went to the Philippines to help with typhoon aid and returned to possibly infect nine others according to Pam Palm a spokeswoman for the Knox County Ohio Health Department Test results are pending for victims who range in age from  to  in the community where vaccination is discouraged Health officials are concerned about the growing cases of measles nationwide which are on track to outpace the  logged last year and the  cases reported in  In California which is leading the surge there have been at least  measles cases this year nearly all of which have been imported by unvaccinated travelers according to the CDC report Those travelers spread the highly contagious infection to people at a church on an airplane and at a school the report said Most of the California cases were in people who were unvaccinated or had no vaccination documentation Of the  who werent vaccinated  had philosophical objections to the vaccine Three of those cases were in kids too young to get the vaccine a situation similar to current outbreaks in New York where  cases have been identified including at least four in babies younger than  months health officials said That alarms Megan Campbell  of San Diego California whose son contracted measles when he was  months old after sharing a waiting room with a sick child whose parents didnt believe in vaccination He breathed the same air in the waiting room for about  seconds Campbell said Her son was hospitalized and ran a degree fever for weeks in  Campbell said shes still haunted by the illness that threatened his life all because of another familys choices It is a very selfish perspective People think their decision only impacts them and they overlook the young babies who are affected and dont have a choice she said But recent research shows that  and that growing numbers of parents are deferring or delaying vaccines because of concerns about possible sideeffects on their own children Despite the rise in cases some US doctors might not recognize the signs and symptoms of measles which was considered eradicated in the country in  said Dr Julia Shaklee Sammons in an online commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine Indeed Campbell said doctors thought her son had Kawasaki disease which also produces a rash Others mistake measles for scarlet fever or Fifth disease wrote Sammons a professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania It is crucial that providers become familiar with this deadly disease and apply the necessary control measures to contain it she wrote Before a measles vaccine was licensed in the US in  about  cases occurred nationwide each year resulting in  hospitalizations and  deaths the CDC says Measles is highly contagious about  percent of people who arent immune will catch the disease if theyre exposed Immunizations for measles and other childhood diseases provided through the national Vaccines for Children program have prevented more than  million hospitalizations and saved  lives since the program was implemented in  the CDC said in a report Thursday The VFC program was launched in direct response to a measles resurgence that caused more than  deaths More than  percent of US parents choose to vaccinate their kids against measles and other childhood infections on schedule but in certain parts of the country  particularly  states that allow philosophical exemptions to vaccination  optout rates for the are much higher   shows Some states have tackled the problem by making it harder to obtain philosophical exemptions In California a law passed in  requires that parents visit a doctor to discuss the benefits of vaccination before they can file a personal belief exemption with the school But other health experts believe that simply adding hurdles isnt the best way to solve the problem leading to outbreaks of measles and other vaccinepreventable diseases such as mumps and pertussis or whooping cough A new report Thursday from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences calls for new research into how when and why parents make vaccination decisions and the best way to communicate with those who are hesitant A certain proportion of parents objects to vaccines and theres probably no changing their minds said Barry Bloom an expert in infectious diseases from the Harvard School of Public Health who is cochairing the effort But if they want to reach parents in the middle  and stop the surge of public health consequences  doctors and researchers are going to have to do better This concerns an awful lot of people who genuinely want to do whats best for their kids he said
