Even for a hardcore David Lynch fan the idea that a film of his would be used to weird people out in a psychology experiment is a tad   But it gets much stranger than that  fast Imagine the experiment involved testing whether Tylenol could help people overcome the angst triggered by a fourminute dose of Lynch A related experiment tested Tylenols effect on people asked to write about what happens to their bodies after they die At the University of British Columbia psychologists went both places Their findings Tylenol may relieve more than physical pain it may just dull existential aches too The results were   by the journal   Were fairly confident the effect we have seen reflects an underlying process   one of the researchers tells Shots What were not confident in is that Tylenol would be useful in any clinical setting says Randles a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of British Columbia We would in no way recommend Tylenol as a therapy Still the findings are consistent with a growing body of research that suggests the brain processes physical and emotional pain in similar ways Other experiments had found Tylenol helped people cope with social pain and frustration as well Randles says Now how did these researchers investigate the existential phenomenon About a halfhour after receiving either  milligrams of Tylenol or a sugar pill volunteers were asked to watch a couple of minutes of a Donald Duck cartoon to loosen up Then they got to see one of two very different clips One group watched a clip from   a  Lynch film that IMDb   a story of a group of humanoid rabbits and their depressive daily life Yep The others watched a clip from   Both groups then watched a few minutes of a Snoopy cartoon to distract them Still with me The researchers then asked the volunteers to pass judgment on   after the Vancouver Canucks lost to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup in  The people who got a placebo and watched   meted out greater punishment than those whod kicked back with  Tylenol or not and those whod had the benefit of Tylenol while squirming to the surreal Lynchian clip Why would that be After people are made to feel uneasy or anxious Randles says they tend to affirm things they believe in more strongly Its called a compensatory affirmation because it makes people feel better In a previous experiment the researcher asked the volunteers to contemplate their death and then write a couple of paragraphs about it or to write about dental pain Half in each group got Tylenol the others got a placebo Researchers then asked them to set the bail for a prostitute after reading a hypothetical police report The higher the bail on a scale from  to  the more they were affirming a belief that prostitution is wrong Sure enough the volunteers whod thought about death and got sugar pills went for higher bails than those who got Tylenol The volunteers who contemplated dental pain were more lenient whether they got Tylenol or not Even David Lynch might have trouble thinking this up
