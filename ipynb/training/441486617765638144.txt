Its been decades since the advertising industry recognized the need to woo Hispanic consumers Big companies saw the market potential and sank millions of dollars into ads The most basic dos and donts of marketing to Latinos in the United States have been understood for years So when officials started thinking about how to persuade the states Spanish speakers who make up nearly  percent of Californias population to enroll in health care plans they should have had a blueprint of what to do Instead they made a series of mistakes For example one thing health policy experts love about Obamacare is that no one can be denied coverage for a preexisting health condition   the states health insurance exchange made this a selling point in almost all its Spanish ads But that doesnt resonate with Latinos Many have never had insurance never considered it Bessie Ramirez is with the Los Angelesbased   a Hispanic market research firm that has consulted for large health care clients like HealthNet Cigna and Blue Cross She says another problem is that all the early TV ads end with a web address for    no phone number or physical address She says that completely misses how Hispanics like to shop especially for a complicated product like health insurance Hispanics are heavily on the Internet and theyre growing very fast on the Internet however theyre not transacting on the Internet Ramirez notes They transact on a personal basis Hispanics will wait to go to a Eleven until  oclock if at  oclock they know that their friend Juan is on duty Covered Californias biggest mistake was perhaps simply translating ads developed in English into Spanish Think of   the longrunning Englishlanguage campaign At worst a literal translation into Spanish could be a rude reference to breast milk At best it just falls flat Thats what happened with Covered Californias The ad features a series of people looking directly into the camera saying in Spanish Welcome to a new state of health Welcome to Covered California Ad experts say that was an obvious misstep To say were in a new state of health for California its grammatically correct to translate it literally but it doesnt have the same nuance or cuteness that it does in English says Roberto Orci CEO of   in Santa Monica Calif He found one of the states followup ads just boring  the music the message and the man in the ad This guy was stiff as a board and    which in English means dry he says If the product is chicken nuggets or milk it might not matter to anyone but the company if Latinos buy it But if Latinos dont buy health insurance it matters to everyone On average Latinos are younger and healthier than the general population The premiums they will pay if they sign up help cover the health care costs of older sicker Californians That keeps premium costs down for everyone else Thats why Covered California is sweating the numbers Just  percent of people who enrolled in Covered California health plans last year speak Spanish as their first language The state is worried how far that number is from the number of Spanish speakers We dont think weve done a good enough job yet says Peter Lee executive director of Covered California Relative to our ambitions and our aspirations we dont stack up well enough yet and so were going to be doubling down The state spent almost  million on its Spanishlanguage ad campaign last year It plans to spend more than  million in the first three months of this year Covered California has upped its market research efforts and has vowed to adjust its creative messaging This time around it will put a lot of emphasis on ads where people can go to get help in person Even from day one we thought Spanish speakers would need inperson help Lee says How important that is has really crystallized over the last three months The final deadline to sign up for coverage this year is March  Its not clear if Covered California can come up with a more effective marketing campaign before then
