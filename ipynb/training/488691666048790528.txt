Movie stars and musicians have used crowd funding to finance projects. So have any number of start-up businesses and non-profit organizations. But can crowd funding become a successful tool for underwriting very early-stage research for new drugs or diagnostic tests?. A new study suggests that researchers should explore the possibilities. After analyzing 97 crowd funding campaigns, the study concluded this is a “viable approach” for supporting research that tests proof-of-concept, or nascent theories. By doing so, researchers may increase the likelihood of success in securing traditional grants or private investment needed to underwrite additional clinical work.
