t was not so long ago that mentally ill characters were portrayed on TV only as mad bad and dangerous to know Fast forward to the present day and soap operas and dramas including Coronation Street and EastEnders regularly win plaudits for their sympathetic depictions of people with conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression A report commissioned by the antistigma campaign Time to Change confirms that producers are moving away from dated stereotypes Based on research from the Glasgow Media Group the findings indicate this is having a positive impact on the public by encouraging them to discuss taboo issues openly or even seek medical help This desire to get it right has partly been informed by production teams seeking advice behind the scenes from experts including nurses counsellors and charities on writing realistic storylines viewers can identify with These advisers include Alison Kerry who worked on the EastEnders storyline where Ian Beale suffered a breakdown  a plot widely praised for being both moving and realistic As head of media for the charity Mind Kerry put producers of the BBC soap in touch with Kevin Shepherd who had suffered a similar crisis to Ian Beale Kerry says Shepherds personal experiences inspired the scene where Ian walks down a dual carriageway in despair Involving real people in script development is crucial in portraying mental illness accurately says Kerry and can also be really empowering for those such as Shepherd who share their stories This is very different from a decade ago when mentally ill characters appeared only as oneoffs in dramas According to Kerry the gamechanger was the EastEnders storyline written around Stacey Slater a woman diagnosed with bipolar disorder like her mother Jean To have two characters in a major soap was the start of exploring the issue in a gritty way not just two dimensional says Kerry Stacey was a young attractive woman and one of the shows stars Publican Steve McDonald in Coronation Street is also a major character who everyone likes and can relate to and his struggle with depression has attracted a positive response on social media Mind helped develop a wellresearched plotline one that set out to change opinion about how people adapt and deal with mental health problems Steve is shown visiting his doctor for example These scenes were incredibly moving but also show the process of what happens when you go to your GP says Kerry As a viewer you really feel for him Mental illness is not the only health issue soap operas are approaching from a more understanding angle Since September  the   has been involved with a Hollyoaks plotline where character Ste Hay is diagnosed as HIV positive As well as editing scripts for accuracy Will Harris the charitys head of media has fielded questions including Would he be obliged to disclose his status at work answer he wouldnt Authentic dialogue is key to the impact of any drama especially one with a storyline on the reality of life with HIV Harris says We put the team in touch with the kind of people Ste might encounter from an HIV clinician to one of our counsellors A lot of the dialogue on screen will be rooted in these conversations Producers have a vital role to play not just in educating people but in starting a dialogue about taboo health issues believes Harris From our perspective storylines like this Hollyoaks dont just educate they give permission for those conversations to happen and that can only be a good thing A wellresearched and welltold storyline can increase public understanding perhaps more so than any governmentfunded public health campaign Sensationalising a sensitive health issue however can reinforce stigma In the case of Hollyoaks Harris says it would have been easy for the producers to ramp up the drama around Stes diagnosis Instead he says they made a real effort to understand the reality of the condition which is more nuanced Actors too appear to have a genuine commitment to raising awareness according to Victoria Harmer a breast cancer nurse who has acted as a consultant to radio television and film Harmer a clinical nurse specialist at Imperial College healthcare   trusts breast care unit assisted EastEnders with the Carol Jackson storyline where the character discovers not only that she has breast cancer but that the faulty gene which caused it may run in the family Lindsey Coulson who plays Carol was so receptive and involved in the role says Harmer The producers and actors were desperate to get it right down to the medical equipment used The impact was considerable the programme led to a raft of referrals according to Harmer Soap operas and TV still have a way to go though The   highlights that they can still get it wrong through overly simplistic portrayals of people with mental health problems and the misinformation they convey about medication Soap operas are primarily about entertainment says Kerry It is therefore a question of finding the right balance between fact and fiction Kerry says A good drama has to be drama but it also has to be grounded in reality
