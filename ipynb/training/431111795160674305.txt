Being an Olympic bobsledder is a job that requires a precise balance of speed muscle and weight The athletes must explode off the starting line while pushing nearly  pounds of bobsled at full speed They need to be strong enough for a powerful launch so the sled will reach speeds exceeding  miles an hour But the athletes also need to be lean in order to lighten the load and wind resistance as they hunker down in the sled To find out how bobsledders achieve this combination of power and speed we asked Army Capt Chris Fogt a member of the fourman American bobsled team that will compete in Sochi Russia to show us the bobsled workout Captain Fogt  grew up in Georgia and Utah and is a soldier athlete who served in Iraq and competed in the last Winter Olympics in Vancouver We caught up with him at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid NY to talk about the bobsledders training routine why beach muscles are not a good thing and the highs and sometimespainful lows of a milesanhour sport Heres an edited version of our conversation I was running track in college at Utah Valley University back in  when I was recruited for bobsled Theres not much glamor to it but I love it because its a lot of fun Its fast its a little bit dangerous and we get to travel the world and race with the biggest fastest athletes on the planet  Bobsledding is a very physical sport It requires a lot of speed and power We have track guys that try out and some of them are good but theyre not quite powerful enough We have weightlifters come and try out but theyre not fast enough Thats because its a hybrid of the sports We lift three to four times a week we sprint twice a week and we push the sled out here twice a week Its mostly legwork So we do a lot of squats a lot of power cleans jump squats box jumps lunges  everything legs We also do some upper body stuff but more just for fun and for overall body balance  During the summertime when were in the off season and were not out in the freezing cold four or five hours a day we usually lift three to four times a week While were training and sliding at the same time we usually lift twice a week On Mondays we do the heavier slower lifts like squats lunges and bench press On Wednesdays we do jumps cleans and the more explosive lifts And then we race Friday and Saturday Every athlete has their own program but a few of the constants will be power cleans squats jumps and deadlifts Those three to four base exercises everyone does whether youre on the US team the British team German team or Latvian team Those are the lifts that build the most strength and power No We dont do a whole lot of curls shoulder type work biceps or chest When I was back in college youd do curls for half an hour a day trying to get large arms Here its just not functional for us When youre in the sled youre trying to get as low as you can and if you have a huge upper body you become a wind sail If you have huge massive shoulders and a big chest the wind is hitting you and the sled is slowing down Whereas if youre leaner and smaller and flexible you can get real low and that helps the air flow right over the sled We want to be strong but lean and mean Our diet is basically just to eat everything we want I try and consume about  calories a day to maintain weight So we eat a lot of food Im naturally a lot smaller than this When I first started in the sport I weighed about  pounds Now I weigh about  So Ive gained about  pounds doing the sport Most of it Most guys in our sport weigh between  and  pounds Thats the sweet spot If you get much larger than that its hard to have the speed to push the bobsled And if youre smaller than that you dont have the power to push the bobsled  We try to eat a lot of protein and a lot of carbs To get my hunger and metabolism going I eat a huge breakfast And we have a large lunch and large dinner At breakfast I eat two pancakes three or four eggs oatmeal a glass of orange juice and some yogurt If I just eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast Ill burn it instantly while Im eating it  My job as a fourman brakeman is we get to the starting line and we have to push the sled The sleds weigh between  and  pounds Youre trying to move that sled from zero to as fast as you can very very quickly And thats where the speed and power come into play So we push for about  meters then all four of us load in very closely together  While were in the bobsled we try not to move as much as we can Thats very hard to do because we hit around  to  Gs But you want to be very fluid with the sled almost like water in a glass If the sled moves to the right you slightly lean to the left and you lean with it as it goes down the track Its kind of like a car wreck Some trips are better than others Some trips are very smooth and fast Some trips you crash At the last Olympics we were going about  miles an hour when we crashed on our heads So it can be very violent and not very much fun Thats one of the unique things about our sport During one of our last races the temperature was minus five degrees and weve had races where its been minus  before So right before the race youre trying to get warm and not pull any muscles You have to learn how to feel light and fast while youre freezing Its pretty tough but its something you learn to cope with I joined the army in  when I was in school and I got into bobsledding in  Theres a program called the   and it allows me to do both So after the games in  I went to Iraq for a year with my unit and served out there When these games are over Ill report to Fort Huachuca in Arizona on May  I get to wear the flag on both my uniforms as a soldier and as a US athlete So its a great honor for me
