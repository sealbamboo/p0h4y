As a culture we tend to suffer from the angelordevil mindset Especially when it comes to food And for  years now saturated fat  found in high amounts in meat cheese and other fullfat dairy products  has been one of our top nutritional demons The   urge us to limit consumption because of concerns that saturated fat raises the risk of heart disease But after decades of research a growing number of experts are questioning this link In fact the authors of a new metaanalysis published in the     that theres insufficient evidence to support the longstanding recommendation to consume saturated fat in very low amounts So lets walk through this shift in thinking The concern over fat gathered steam in the s when studies showed that saturated fat increases LDL cholesterol  the bad cholesterol  the arteryclogging stuff The assumption was that this increased the risk of heart disease But after all this time it just hasnt panned out at least not convincingly When researchers have tracked peoples saturated fat intake over time and then followed up to see whether higher intake increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes they havent found a clear consistent link In fact the new study finds null associations to quote the authors between total saturated fat intake and coronary risk And a   that included more than  participants came to a similar conclusion So what explains this Well researchers say the relationship between cholesterol and heart disease is a lot more complicated than was once understood LDL is just one indicator of risk Whats now thought to be a more important predictor of risk is the ratio a person has of LDL to HDL the   cholesterol And theres evidence that compared with carbohydrates saturated fat can increase HDL and lower fat deposits in the blood called triglycerides  which in theory would be protective against heart disease So when you put this all together says   of the Harvard School of Public Health a coauthor of the paper what you see is that saturated fat has a relatively neutral effect Its not a beneficial effect but not a harmful effect And I think thats what the recent studies show  So where does this lead us Lots of experts say the lesson here is that you cant take a reductionist approach to good health Look what happened when Americans reduced fat intake at the height of the fatfree boom in the early s and compensated by eating lots of carbohydrates All of the calories from refined grains think fatfree bagels and lowfat cookies led lots of folks to gain weight There were definitely unintended harmful consequences of the lowfat craze Mozaffarian says He says the lesson is to get away from recommendations that are built on single nutrients A healthful diet he says should include a wide variety of minimally processed whole foods such as nuts and vegetable and olive oils which have some saturated fat as well as fish fruits vegetables and small portions of animal products such as yogurt and cheese Surprisingly the healthpromoting   has about  percent of calories from fat including small amounts of meat So if youre still asking the question  is saturated fat good or bad  the answer Mozaffarian says depends on what youre eating instead He points to another study that found replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates has no benefits Now of course not everyone is convinced by the new studies that question the link between saturated fat and heart disease Groups including the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association promote a low intake of saturated fat And vegan groups do as well I think there is support for removing all animal products from the diet for health purposes says   of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine which advocates vegan diets She points out that two population studies an   and a European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition   study have shown that the fewer animal products you consume the less likely you are to have diabetes or to be overweight Some argue that the type of fatty acids that make up the saturated fat in a food makes a difference too For instance recent studies suggest that the fatty acids in milk and yogurt may be beneficial for heart health And as weve   researchers are actively studying this fullfatdairy paradox But processed red meats also high in saturated fat are shown to   of heart disease and certain cancers So saturated fat isnt automatically the bad guy  and shouldnt be demonized these researchers say Its just one part of the complex dietary puzzle Experts say remember this big picture Too many calories from any source whether its fats or carbohydrates can lead to weight gain And its that extra weight that increases the risk of heart disease
