If the icy blast of polar air thats descended upon much of the US over the last couple of days has you reaching for the cookie jar for comfort  and ready to give up on those New Years resolutions  then seriously Its time to toughen up Just think At least youre not in the Antarctic That  putting the deep freeze on America comes from the Arctic but the coldest official temperature ever recorded on Earth  minus  Fahrenheit  was actually at the other end of the world Even so Antarcticas vast frozen barren landscape has beckoned scholars and adventurers alike for more than a century And one thing weve learned from them is When life is stripped down to man versus the most brutal elements bring plenty of snacks Indeed the history of exploration on the continent is as much about hunger as heroism as Jason Anthony explores in his book   Hunger Anthony writes was the one spice every expedition carried Think those aboard that Russian research vessel and Chinese icebreaker that just spent several days   had it rough The ordeal pales compared to the legend of what British explorer Ernest Shackleton went through In  on his way to try to cross the continent he never made it Shackletons ship the Endurance got trapped by ice  then crushed  in the Weddell Sea So there he was  miles from the nearest humans with no way to call for help stranded on the ice with his man crew for about a year It was nearly another year before all were rescued Frank Hurley the expeditions photographer wrote of men crazed by their privations Their waking and sleeping hours filled with dreams of food  especially dumplings and other carbohydrates In the meantime they survived on tinned goods theyd brought with them and plenty of hoosh  the bleak Antarctic soup as Anthony calls it of meat and snow The meat in question was often seal or penguin  thousands of the animals gave their lives to feed the ambitions of those early continental explorers And not all were gorged and slaughtered without qualms Carl Skottsberg a botanist on an early s Swedish expedition that hungrily ransacked the newly laid eggs of Adelie penguins seemed to be warding off critics when he wrote How many of my readers know what it means to lie in cold and darkness and hunger week after week But it was all a sort of cruel survival math Even today it takes roughly plus calories a day to feed a person doing outdoor work   who spent a year as the medical officer at the British Antarctic Surveys remote Halley Research Station tells me He chronicles his time there in   a lyrical meditation on the continent Those involved in manhauling  ie pulling sleds across the ice and snow with their bodies  need more like  calories a day Those of us shivering back home stateside may also be tempted to munch more right about now  some say for    but we dont have the same excuse to chow down The mix of calories matters too Ironically before British explorer Robert F Scott famously starved and froze to death on his way back from the South Pole his party conducted a study that suggested a highcarb highfat diet to be optimal for the harsh climes Of course its not just physiology but psychology at play Hunger does strange things to a man In the s transAntarctic aviator Lincoln Ellsworth  a bona fide millionaire  found himself pondering whether a piece of twoyearold gum stuck under his bunk was still safe to chew More heartbreaking is the tale Anthony recounts of Xavier Mertz and Douglas Mawson with the   who at the end of  found themselves alone some  miles from base with but a day supply of food after the third man in their party fell through a crevasse with most of their supplies and dogs Mertz a longtime vegetarian and Mawson were forced to eat their remaining dogs to survive They werent the only polar party to turn mans best friend into dinner Mertz eventually went mad and died leaving Mawson to carry on the final  miles back to camp alone At one point Mawson fell into a crevasse but one thought motivated the emaciated man to pull himself out After having stinted myself so assiduously in order to save food he wrote I should pass on now to eternity without the satisfaction of what remained These days the food is plentiful in Antarctica  though many freshies  fresh produce  must still be flown in and thus remain relatively rare The greenhouse at the US McMurdo Station helps As for the quality It has everything to do really with what cooks you have on staff Anthony who spent eight seasons with the US Antarctic Program tells The Salt Rumor has it the best place to feast is at the Italian research stations while foodies should steer clear of the Russians And a good meal remains essential to morale adds Francis who was lucky to have a professional chef as one of just  staff members who wintered over at Halley with him One of their diversions through the endless Antarctic night Cooking classes The chef Francis tells me is not only one of the hardestworking base members how good he or she is at his or her job just about defines what kind of winter youre going to have
