With old age comes the increasing likelihood of memory loss But when should we worry asks Joan Bakewell Getting old just happens of course  It creeps up on you when you arent looking and suddenly youre forgetting names and losing keys  At once alarm bells ring   could this be the first indication of dementia   I am in my s now and I would be foolish not to consider whether these irritating incidents are more than simple forgetfulness  I console myself  wasnt I always forgetful without taking it as a sign of something significant  When I mentioned the problem to my novelist friend Malcolm Bradbury he sympathised But Joan you and I have stuffed our brains full throughout our lives we shouldnt be surprised if some of it begins to fall off the shelf  I felt better and carried on being randomly forgetful But now the argument has quickened  Dementia is growing in its impact as we all live longer lives Its reckoned there are more than  sufferers in the UK When and how will I know if I am one of them   Its estimated  of people worry that they may be afflicted in the future  that number rises to  for the over s  At least I am not alone  Indeed I am among friends  I have known the actors Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales for four decades If we arent exactly in and out of each others houses we certainly go to each others parties exchange Christmas cards and rejoice in the successes of children and more recently grandchildren  Over the past year they together have decided to go public on the fact that Pru has dementia   It first began with lines Pru has had a distinguished career for over  years She has starred in some of televisions most popular series Marriage Lines opposite Richard Briers After Henry Mapp and Lucia and of course as Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers   About  years ago she began to notice it was getting harder to remember lines  She put it down to age   Her last stage appearance was five years ago in Carries War in the West End  Of course work continues with voiceovers which she can still handle with her usual flair and aplomb But their doctor indicated that her condition would get worse  It is getting worse but only slowly I enter their home exactly as I know it full of welcome and laughter cups of tea and theatre gossip But there are differences  a huge whiteboard in the kitchen lists in order the things Pru will be doing that day  A trained helper Meegan familiar with the progression of dementia has moved in to live with them  She goes about her caring with a tactful absence of fuss   We sit and talk about the how much their lives are affected and it becomes clear there are two narratives here Pru complains of occasionally forgetting things  but then I am  years old  surely thats allowed   But she is shocked when Tim explains how at a party Pru will tell someone the same anecdote time after time Oh I dont do that do I Surely not Oh how dreadful   I hear in her outrage the familiar response of the Pru I know But her response is characteristic of the denial which is common among dementia sufferers   Source    The fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together but as in the best of marriages it is a shift rather than a catastrophe Tim clearly feels the loss  when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event  but once back home Pru cant talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory  I leave for home reflecting on how several friends of my generation are now drifting into this unknown world I wonder about my own forgetfulness and decide it is so far as I can tell of a quite different order  Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps   sticky notes left around the house  a notepad beside the bed a list of things to do each day   But then didnt I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me I have been a journalist for over  years working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through wellordered and sometime scruffy diaries shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors   The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months  I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship  A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track If dementia looms I simply havent time to notice   Nonetheless what Ive been learning about early intervention the memory clinics the ongoing research is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon   The UK is only now gearing up to meet the enormous challenge dementia presents for the future There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills If individuals can help with their own diagnoses rather than hide away from bad news then that will help   Theres no denying the harrowing experience of families whose members no longer know who they are But my friends Tim and Pru have shown me that there can still sometimes be happiness and laughter to be got out of life  Broadcaster Fiona Phillips reflects on the difficult decisions she faced when    With an ageing population a wave of dementia is approaching
