From time to time the Center for Science in the Public Interest a Washingtonbased advocacy group prepares an updated   on changes in the American diet The latest collated by the nutritionist Bonnie Liebman and published in the September issue of the centers Nutrition Action Newsletter is   The analysis of changes in food consumption from  to  reveals that we still have a long way to go before we come close to meeting dietary guidelines for warding off obesity and chronic health problems like   and heart disease The news isnt all bad Our consumption of added sweeteners though still significantly higher than it was in  has come down from the sugar high of  when the average was  pounds per person Nonetheless an average of  pounds per person in  mostly as sugar and highfructose corn syrup is still too much Ms Liebman points out Even our Bplus for cutting back on fats and oils the highest grade Ms Liebman awarded is a mixed bag Yes weve dramatically reduced consumption of heartdamaging trans fats and to a lesser extent saturated solid fats like margarine and shortening But theres been a steady steep climb in total fats added to the diet in the form of salad oils and cooking oils As a country we have definitely not been on a lowfat diet The average person consumes  pounds more in total fat yearly than in  which partly explains why the obesity rate among adults has more than doubled since then when only  percent of Americans were obese In  the Agriculture Department has reported the average American consumed  calories a day in added fats and oils not counting the fats naturally present in foods like meats and dairy products Americans seem to think that if a food is considered a healthier alternative its OK to swallow as much of it as one might like People forget or never knew that a tablespoon of olive oil or canola oil has about the same number of calories as a tablespoon of lard about  and even more calories than a tablespoon of butter or margarine We never were on a lowfat diet Ms Liebman said in an interview We increased our fat intake from pizzas burgers French fries baked goods and restaurantprepared foods Likewise grain products Theres been a huge increase in grains in the last  years  bread cereal pasta rice burritos pizza crust panini muffins scones  mostly made from white flour she said Weve been blaming the   epidemic on sweets and we are eating too much sugar but we need to pay more attention to grains It would not be great to simply replace refined grains like white flour and white rice with whole grains she added We need to cut back on grains period Whether made from white flour or whole wheat one unadorned New Yorkstyle bagel supplies about  calories and a st century muffin often contains as many as  calories For the average adult who should aim for a daily intake of  calories these grain foods displace far more nutritious and relatively lowcalorie fruits and vegetables Our consumption of those earned a Bminus on Ms Liebmans report card We need to replace sandwiches with salads swap starches for veggies and trade cookies cupcakes and chips for fresh fruit she wrote We started eating more vegetables not counting potatoes in the s but the rise has stalled Ms Liebman was surprised to find that combined consumption of beef and pork is still higher than that of chicken and fish Although chicken itself is now slightly more popular than beef our consumption of fish has remained relatively flat In     the director of the Healthy and Sustainable Food Program at the Harvard School of Public Health noted that Americans eat only about  pounds of seafood per person per year and about  percent of that comes from only  species Mr Seaver a former chef encourages diners to stray from the familiar to more sustainable  and wholesome  species like pollock sablefish Spanish mackerel haddock and farmraised barramundi and shrimp He champions farmraised mussels clams and oysters as sources of fabulous lean protein that clean the aquatic environment Contrary to popular thought frozen fish is comparable to if not better than fresh fish because it is frozen on ships within hours of being caught Mr Seaver said Ms Liebman applauded the steady precipitous decline in whole milk consumption and the booming popularity of mostly lowfat yogurt But she noted that consumption of lowfat and fatfree milk has remained low displaced by sugary soft drinks and that our consumption of cheese rich in dairy fat is at an alltime high up threefold since  and still climbing And were not just eating more sweets grains meat and cheese Were eating   about  more calories a day per person than in  Ms Liebman said Weve lost track of what a normal portion of food should look like She blamed restaurants for portion distortion If you eat what restaurants serve you will end up like twothirds of Americans overweight or obese she said People should assume that restaurants serve double what you should be eating and either share a meal or take half of it home to eat the next day While some restaurants have added lean or light meals to their menus those should be the standard because thats what we all should be eating not just dieters Ms Liebman said And vegetables and fruits should fill up half the plate not just be treated as a little side dish Take or order a salad instead of a sandwich for lunch And try cut vegetables with a yogurt dip for a munch between meals or before dinner This summer I discovered a great new way to enhance the familys fruit intake Its a gadget called Yonanas using frozen slightly overripe bananas as a base and other frozen fruits for color and flavor like strawberries pineapple or mango it produces a sweet creamy dessert or snack with the consistency of frozen yogurt but no added sugar or cream With a percent off coupon from Bed Bath  Beyond this tool costs  and  who knows  could ultimately save hundreds in medical bills
