When Massachusetts passed its landmark health insurance law under Gov Mitt Romney in  no one claimed the state would get to zero  as in  percent of residents who are uninsured But   suggest Massachusetts is very close Between December  and March of this year the number of Massachusetts residents signed up for health coverage increased by more than  If that number holds true over time it will mean the percentage of Massachusetts residents who lack coverage has dropped to less than  percent Were thrilled that we are getting this close to universal health care access said the Rev Burns Stanfield president of the   Stanfield says the strong numbers  especially when coupled with last months finding that   in the first four years of expanded coverage in Massachusetts  show that our statewide move to universal access is working and its a powerful witness to the nation But that kind of enthusiasm is not coming from state officials  yet These numbers are a sign that we are moving in the right direction but there is still a lot of uncertainty about what they will ultimately mean to the total level of health insurance coverage in Massachusetts says ron Boros of the   the state agency that tallied the latest insurance figures Uncertainty might be an understatement There is still a tremendous backlog of applications to process Most of the new enrollees are in a temporary coverage plan because the state with   has not been able to figure out if these people qualify for free or subsidized care What if they dont qualify for help asks   president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans Will these new enrollees be willing to pay what could feel like a hefty premium The real challenge Pellegrini says is going to be to move these folks from the temporary coverage into the permanent coverage where they belong and then see if were able to retain these numbers There are reasons to think the numbers may hold Despite the states broken website and confusion about deadlines and eligibility it looks like more than  Massachusetts residents who did not have health insurance last year managed to enroll There are some good explanations for why First there was a big federal enrollment campaign in the fall and spring that might have caught peoples attention Second more residents are eligible for free coverage or subsidized help with premiums under the new federal insurance law Third most of those who were still uninsured in Massachusetts at the end of  were lowincome workers who could not afford premiums under an employers plan Under the previous Massachusetts health care law enacted under thenGov Mitt Romney workers were not allowed to sign up for statesubsidized insurance if they had access to a health plan through work The federal law lifts that restriction It is hard not to look at this and say if it turns out the numbers are actually correct  thats a big if  this is good said   a senior fellow at Project Hope and a former health care adviser to President George HW Bush It is urgent that we have confirmation that continued enrollment after the first year can happen and in fact in a place like Massachusetts did happen The state may be dropping even closer to zero than the numbers released this week indicate because of movement in the coverage market The analysis reflects March numbers when  residents were in temporary coverage but as of this week Gov Deval Patricks office says there are  in that plan Its not clear how many of these people are newly insured Private health insurers lost at least  members during the first quarter of this year Massachusetts will continue to have some undocumented residents and others who lack health insurance Making sure coverage is affordable is an ongoing challenge and subsidizing insurance for more residents could strain the state budget But for now it looks as though Massachusetts is the first state in the country where nearly everyone can focus more on their health  and less on whether theyll be able to see a doctor  if they become injured or ill
