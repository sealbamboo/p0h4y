Debra Blackmon was about to turn  in January  when two social workers came to her home  offer some details about what happened that day Blackmon was severely retarded they note and had psychic problems that made her difficult to manage during menstruation Her parents were counseled during the visit and it was deemed in Blackmons best interest that she be sterilized Blackmon is among the more than  people in North Carolina  many poor many AfricanAmerican many disabled  who were sterilized between  and    North Carolina   of the staterun program last year This week the state sent out the first checks to qualified applicants But Blackmon like many others who are fighting for restitution is not among them Blackmon now  has a hard time with the details of that day in   but she does remember a few things from her trip to Charlotte Memorial Hospital My daddy said Dont hurt this baby And he was crying she recalls Latoya Adams Blackmons niece grew up knowing her aunt had been sterilized But she says we didnt find out until recently the extent  exactly what all they did to her After the compensation law passed she went looking for documentation  and came back with a mother lode a court order names of social workers and the entire procedure outlined from preop to discharge The doctor had labeled it a eugenics sterilization And while it was it relief to have the information she says it was also remarkably sad They were telling my grandparents that the surgery was going to be minimally invasive They told them it would be a tubal ligation And they wound up doing a full abdominal hysterectomy  on a yearold Adams says With all this evidence Adams and her family thought they had a case They filed the paperwork and waited to hear back The news wasnt good The denial letter the only thing it really stated was that there were no records found and that her case was not approved by the North Carolina Eugenics Board Adams says The problem lies in a technicality The new compensation law says to be eligible operations have to have occurred under the states Eugenics Board As it turns out the board very likely  aware of all the sterilizations taking place Judges and social service workers were greenlighting sterilizations as well Thats kind of become the fundamental problem here says Bob Bollinger an attorney representing Blackmon and a few other people who say they are victims You have some old dusty filing cabinet in Raleigh thats full of Eugenics Board paperwork from decades ago but yet youve got all these people who got sterilized involuntarily where it was instigated at the local level and their paperwork didnt wind up being preserved in the eugenics files in Raleigh  if it was ever there to begin with he says Graham Wilson a spokesman for the North Carolina Industrial Commission which decides who qualifies for compensation from the  million fund says A lot of people may have had this done under the auspices of local county groups Theyre not qualified he says They may think theyre qualified and obviously they had this procedure done to them he says But if it was not done under the Eugenics Board of North Carolina then theyre not qualified Lawyers working with victims estimate hundreds of people  people like Blackmon  could fall into this category Blackmons operation was ordered by a judge who was part of the state court system That judge cited a state law When asked if that then makes the state responsible Wilson says Thats kind of hard to say Again its just an unfortunate part of our history Its just something that was done So its kind of hard to say that the state would be responsible when it was just kind of an accepted practice Its frustrating sometimes It really is Blackmon says Shes not the only one frustrated Her niece Adams says the denial feels like a double blow Everything is there but because you cant find a piece of paper saying it got approved by the North Carolina board youre not gonna be compensated I think its sad I really think its sad Its like youve hurt her once before but then now I feel like youre turning around and hurting her once again There is an appeals process and Adams and Blackmon are working through that right now As for people who will be compensated the first half of the money went out this week  checks for  each The rest will be disbursed next summer after the approval process is complete
