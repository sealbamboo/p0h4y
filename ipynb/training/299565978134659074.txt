 Noninvasive electric stimulation of the brain appears to help the initial phase of treatment in   especially in combination with an antidepressant a doubleblind trial showed Six weeks of daily transcranial direct current stimulation sessions reduced depression scores roughly the same as sertraline Andre R Brunoni MD PhD of the University of So Paulo Brazil and colleagues reported online in   The two together brought scores down by an average  points more than sertraline alone on a depression rating scale and by  points more than direct current stimulation alone A point difference on that MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS is considered clinically relevant Noninvasive brain stimulation is becoming an established therapy for the treatment of depression Brunoni and colleagues wrote The weak electrical current applied across large electrodes on the scalp may work by boosting activity in an area of the brain known to be hypoactive in depression with the advantage of not having the same adverse effects and contraindications as antidepressant drugs the group pointed out The device also is relatively inexpensive so it might be a costeffective alternative for regions with low resources where the prevalence of major depressive disorder is high such as most developing nations they added However the treatment is less practical than taking a pill and its not clear how its results would hold up in the maintenance phase Even if transcranial direct current stimulation becomes available for inhouse use it would still require  to minute daily sessions for several weeks Brunonis group wrote Their Sertraline vs Electrical Current Therapy for Treating Depression Clinical Study SELECT TDCS compared in a twobytwo design treatment with  weeks of sertraline at  mg per day or placebo and mA anodal leftcathodal right prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation minute sessions each weekday plus two extra sessions every other week or sham It included  antidepressantnaive patients with moderatetosevere major depressive disorder but no psychotic or bipolar component seen at a single outpatient center in an academic setting in So Paulo The cohort had a relatively low degree of refractoriness and short duration of the index episode The only thing that wasnt better than inactive treatment at the end of the week period was sertraline alone with a mean difference of  points versus placebo The explanation may have been that  mg per day was a low dose for some participants though there have been negative trials with sertraline in major depressive disorder the researchers pointed out Transcranial direct current stimulation improved MADRS score by  points over sham The combination of the two appeared to work fastest as that was the only group with a significant change in score at week two Factorial analysis suggested that the initial effect was driven primarily by the electric stimulation treatment The two appeared to be additive rather than synergistic Clinical response with at least a  percent reduction in baseline MADRS score was significantly more common with transcranial direct current stimulation or combination treatment than with placebo  percent and  percent versus  percent Remission with MADRS score falling to  points or less occurred in  percent of the combo group and  percent of the electrical stimulation group which were both significantly better than the  percent rate with placebo Sertraline alone induced remission in  percent although this difference didnt reach significance No negative cognitive effects were seen with transcranial direct current stimulation though skin redness was more common at the end of week two Of the seven episodes of treatmentemergent mania or hypomania five were in the combined treatment group including one severe manic episode requiring pharmacologic intervention Mania or hypomania induction may be similar with transcranial direct current stimulation as with antidepressants so such events need careful monitoring in future trials Brunonis group noted Further research is needed into longerterm effects and into use in the inpatient setting they added Their trial includes an openlabel phase for sham nonresponders to cross over to  days of active transcranial direct current stimulation as well as a month followup phase for those who responded to active treatment in the first  weeks Source
