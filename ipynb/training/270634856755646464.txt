A massive research project in California is beginning to show how genes health habits and the environment can interact to cause diseases And its all possible because  people agreed to contribute some saliva in the name of science The projects goal is to find new ways to identify people at risk before they develop problems like heart disease cancer and diabetes This month researchers reported on some early successes involving cholesterol and a genetic marker of aging at the   in San Francisco The saliva came from members of Kaiser Permanentes health plan in Northern California We sent them a little plastic kit that looks sort of like a large contact lens case says   an epidemiologist and executive director of Kaisers research program on genes environment and health Before long she says people had mailed in  saliva samples One of those people is   a Kaiser member who is also a scientist at the Environmental Working Group When I heard about the study I was very excited it was happening and wanted to be involved any way I could she says The National Institutes of Health provided grant funding of nearly  million which allowed Kaiser and UCSF to process the saliva samples in just  months Then came another daunting task matching each participants genetic information with detailed health information in Kaisers electronic records which go back to  The records include diagnoses procedures prescriptions and results of medical tests For people who sent in saliva Kaiser also has information on smoking and drinking habits body mass measurements and even geographic information that could be used to estimate exposure to certain chemicals in the air or water This combination of genetic and health information has created one of the most powerful research tools on earth says Nobel laureate   of the University of California San Francisco which is a partner in the Kaiser project Its just this playground of incredibly rich data Blackburn says Were just scratching the surface It will take years to fully explore the data But early results are promising One study presented at the ASHG meeting looks at genes that affect levels of lowdensity lipoproteins also known as LDL or bad cholesterol I think we discovered something like  different genetic variations that influenced that measure says   a geneticist at UCSF Some were known before but a number were not previously known Another early result involves cholesterol drugs known as statins Researchers realized that the saliva samples included  people who had started taking statins in the past few years So they looked to see whether certain gene variations affected how well the drugs worked We have already shown that there are genetic factors that are predictive of drug response Risch says And future studies may reveal which people are likely to have dangerous side effects from the drugs he says The Kaiser project is also turning up new information about differences in the way men and women age That information comes from measurements of telomeres which are like caps on the ends of chromosomes These caps tend to shorten with age and with exposure to environmental factors like cigarette smoke The Kaiser project included telomere measurements as part of the genetic information extracted from saliva samples For many years people have know that women and men have different averagelength telomeres says Blackburn Women tend to have longer telomeres than men and they tend to outlive men she says But the Kaiser project showed that as young adults men and women have telomeres that are about the same length We found theres a big split above age  and it gets bigger and bigger with age until about  or so  a marvelous new finding nobody had ever seen before she says The data also show that people with very short telomeres are more likely to die at a younger age Findings like that suggest that someday doctors probably will look at telomeres and lots of other genetic information when assessing a persons overall health Blackburn says Most of the time the blow falls and we say Oh weve got a disease  she says Well its not an event It was a process that took years to happen inside our bodies And the Kaiser project should help identify ways to interrupt that process Blackburn says The National Institutes of Health provided grant funding of nearly  million which allowed Kaiser and UCSF to process the saliva samples in just  months
