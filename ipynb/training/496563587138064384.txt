Carmen Smith remembers the day about a year ago when she gained Medicaid coverage It was like Christmas Day it was like getting a gift from Santa Claus she says People dont realize how important and how special it is to have insurance to be able to go see a doctor on a regular basis when you have an illness like mine Smith  has Type  diabetes Before qualifying for Medicaid coverage she was what policy experts call a frequent flier She had used the emergency room at MetroHealth the public hospital in Cleveland five times in one year She bought insulin over the counter guessed at her dosage and frequently got sick I remember one instance when my sugars were up and I felt like I was having a heart attack So it was like heart palpitations And I ended up staying in the emergency rooms hour observation department Smith says That kind of triage care is expensive Smith couldnt pay the bills but she made too much to qualify for Medicaid MetroHealth has struggled for years to cover the costs of patients like Smith So long before Ohio expanded Medicaid the hospital redirected more than  million it receives from county taxpayers each year into a new pot It used the money to create its very own Medicaid program for county residents And then it tracked the patients The results from the first nine months are in All of the clinical outcomes are really amazing says   a researcher at MetroHealth The hospital used extensive electronic medical records to carefully select uninsured patients and send them Medicaid cards before they even applied Then MetroHealth gave personalized attention to patients Cebul says they focused on  of them who came to the hospital a lot The diabetes outcomes were probably the most impressive he says The sugar control the blood pressure control the lipid control  virtually everything was much better and dramatically so Heres how it works Each patient is assigned a nurse That nurse books their appointments calls them if they miss one and checks to make sure they take their medications In nine months emergency department visits dropped  percent and primary care visits went up  percent The hospital also ended up spending less than it budgeted saving an average of  on each patient every month Better care better outcomes better costs Cebul says Outside of Cleveland a handful of cities and states expanded Medicaid earlier than the rest of the nation But results havent always been so promising In Oregon for example emergency department use   when patients got Medicaid not down They ran their experiment differently giving some people Medicaid while leaving others uninsured And they didnt do any of the oversight that Cleveland did No one program will have all the answers according to  executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors And at a time when health reform is changing the way patients everywhere are treated Salo says theres a lot at stake in trying to figure out what works Weve got plus states who are out there actively trying to steal best practices and good ideas and reform principles from other states he says But Smith a stayathome mom knows this is working for her She recalls how before getting Medicaid she was using a scooter to shop at WalMart Now she rides her bike to get around town Im really excited cause Im doing a good job I feel so good about myself I get off my bike and Im like out of breath Im not tired Smith says She says she cant wait to call her nurse and talk about blood sugar levels
