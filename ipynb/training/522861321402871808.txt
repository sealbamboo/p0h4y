Until recently freezing a womans eggs was reserved mainly for young women facing infertility as a result of cancer treatments like chemotherapy But recent advances in technology have made freezing eggs easier and more successful and likely have a lot to do with the recent decisions by Facebook and Apple to offer female employees a health benefit worth up to  to freeze their eggs The benefit is intended for women who dont need to freeze eggs for medical reasons but rather as a choice This would likely appeal to women who want to focus on their careers instead of child rearing as well as women who just havent yet met Mr Right Doctors have had the technology since the mids But according to   director of the fertility program at the University of Southern California it just didnt work very well Everybody figured there was something wrong with the eggs after freezing them you just couldnt get them to fertilize he says Then about  years ago someone came up with the smart idea to use   typically used to help weak sperm fertilize an egg I think it would be fair to say the ahha moment came when someone figured out that you could bypass the hardened egg shell he says When eggs are frozen their shells harden Researchers bypassed the hardened shells by injecting sperm through the shell and directly into the egg Then within a few years a rapid new freezing method enabled eggs to be quickly frozen with their quality preserved putting the eggs into a state of suspended animation says Paulson Even so age remains a major caution Since eggs degenerate with age the younger a woman is when she freezes her eggs the better For example if a yearold freezes her eggs and then uses them at age  or  she will be getting pregnant with the eggs of a yearold with lower risk of miscarriage and genetic defects including Down syndrome Egg freezing doesnt stop the biological clock says Paulson It just sort of   it he says giving women the option to delay childbearing until theyre ready While egg freezing is an exciting new option it shouldnt be relied on to make familyplanning decisions says   a fertility specialist at Stanford University Medical Center We wouldnt want to have people think this is a substitute for making family building decisions in a broader context Its not a guarantee that if a woman freezes her eggs shes eventually going to be able to have a baby with one of those eggs Baker says its more reliable for women to try to get pregnant at a younger age if possible rather than banking eggs and hoping to get pregnant later in life Even so in vitro fertilization or IVF either with fresh or frozen eggs certainly boosts a womans chance of getting pregnant at any age But egg freezing is costly both emotionally and financially Many women will have to undergo the procedure more than once It cost about  to harvest eggs from the ovaries after a woman has taken medications for several weeks to stimulate egg production Then the eggs need to be frozen and stored at a cost of about  a year Each time eggs are thawed fertilized and transferred to the uterus with IVF it costs about  Baker adds another caution Not all women have the same biological clock Some women are running out of eggs when theyre in their late searly s whereas other women may have reasonably good fertility into their mid to late s she says Reproductive specialists can help women figure out which category they are in which is an important factor to consider when thinking about freezing eggs Most insurance companies dont cover the cost of egg freezing not even for medical reasons when a young womans fertility is jeopardized by cancer So the decision by Facebook and Apple to foot the bill is a significant benefit for women who want to freeze their eggs
