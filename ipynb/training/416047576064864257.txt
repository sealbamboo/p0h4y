Amy GartonHughes is  but the size of an eightyearold  She has Cockayne Syndrome  a rare genetic disorder which degenerates the body and shortens young lives  This cruel illness has taken away Amys balance her speech is deteriorating and she has signs of dementia  But she still enjoys a busy life  listing swimming bowling and seeing friends as her hobbies Jayne Hughes from Merseyside spent years trying to identify her daughters illness Doctors were mystified and library books gave no answers  But online searches eventually did  yielding pictures of other children with the same distinctive sunken eyes and pixielike faces Jayne said When I found Cockayne Syndrome on the internet there were a couple of photos of different children that all looked like her  So I printed them off and when my dad came round I said have a look at this He asked when Id taken that picture of Amy I said actually its not Amy  It was at that point when I thought  this is it thats definitely what shes got Jayne Hughes jokes that she only recently learnt to cut and paste But she has found the internet invaluable  Her familys website Amy and Friends supports  other young people around the world who are affected by Cockayne Syndrome  Jayne added If it wasnt for the internet Id still be searching Trying to find out what was wrong with Amy was like an obsession  I couldnt settle or sleep and I couldnt look after my other children properly Without the internet Id be lost But for others the world of web forums and online symptom checkers can be a minefield  At a mental health centre run by Imperial College Healthcare in London community psychiatrists treat people who have cyberchondria  health anxiety fuelled by the internet  Professor Peter Tyrer said Cyberchondria is just being recognised as an extremely important part of this We find that approximately four out of five of our patients with health anxiety spend literally hours on the internet He says cyberchondria which gives sufferers a deep fear of diseases is on the rise His research on this has been published in The Lancet  There is good news  it can be treated effectively with simple therapy Prof Tyrer said One of the first things we do in treatment is we tell them to stop browsing the internet  And we ask them to keep diaries which demonstrate very clearly that when they look at the internet their anxiety increases The trouble is the internet contains all the knowledge you need to know  but it doesnt have any judgement associated with it Technology does of course present new opportunities for solving old problems  Dr Christian Jessen  a GP TV presenter and voracious user of Twitter  estimates about twothirds of his  tweets have been answers to peoples health questions One recent example was someone who was struggling to get an appointment to have their ears syringed  Dr Jessen said I advised them to use olive oil as drops Olive oil is antibacterial antiseptic and softening  they may not need their ears syringing after using that He has some ground rules he always retweets the original question and he refuses to offer medical opinion on photos that people send him  He sees this as a modern and succinct way of helping people  Dr Jessen added When I started doing this there was a backlash Doctors hated me doing it They said I shouldnt interact with people Id never seen before and answer medical questions But its no different to being at a party when you announce youre a doctor The first thing people do is launch into a long medical story and ask for advice Its exactly the same thing He recommends   and   as balanced sources of information  but warns nothing can replace a doctor for actual diagnosis  Another respected website   focuses on patients stories It is carefully researched and curated by academics  In its seventieth collection of stories people talk frankly about being on antidepressants Stuart Jessup an engineer turned teacher was recruited by Twitter to take part in the work He has walked the British coastline to raise awareness about depression At the launch he jokes about how online forums for depressed people are best avoided  He said Depression is a cycle of negative thinking So put lots of people who are stuck in negative thinking together and moderate it  its dangerous Professor Sue Ziebland from Oxford University has spent  years examining how patients use the internet  including people with cancer She said One of the men we interviewed went to his local library to go online and look for information about local support groups Almost the first thing he found on one of the voluntary society websites for that particular cancer was the very distressing fiveyear survival rate  He was horrified He shut down the computer and ran out of the library The information he found was entirely accurate  but perhaps it shouldnt be on the front page Its about signposting  After sometimes seeing the internet as a threat in its early days Prof Ziebland says doctors now routinely discuss it as a resource with patients during consultations  It has become an everyday part of medical conversation
