A few years ago physicist  asked himself What are the odds I will die in the next year He was  What got him wondering about this I have no idea but hey its something everybody asks When I cant wedge my dental floss between my two front teeth I ask it too So Brian looked up the answer  there are tables for this kind of thing and what he discovered is interesting Very interesting Even mysterious Obviously when youre young and past the extrarisky years of early childhood the chances of dying in the coming year are minuscule  roughly  in  for yearolds This is a group average of course But eight years later the tables said the odds will roughly double As Brian writes in his   When Im  the chances of my dying that year will be about  in  And eight years after that he says the odds double again It will be about  in  And eight years later theres another doubling Looking down the chart youll see that keeps happening and happening and happening Your probability of dying during a given year Brian writes doubles every eight years Hmmm When I looked at the   Brians came from  hes more or less right Which got me wondering  Why eight Why the doubles This wasnt Brians discovery A British actuary   noticed this pattern back in  and ever since its been called the    yes death creeps closer but it creeps closer in orderly steps for humans about every eight years Doubling of this sort when plotted on a chart looks scary in the later years but every interval early in the curve is also a doubling So the same thing keeps happening only the effects become more pronounced Anyone reaching the age of  seems to have a  in  chance of getting to  Looking at his pattern Brian writes I can say with  percent certainty that no human will ever live to the age of  Thats assuming which one shouldnt that we have no new heroic medical advances OK so this happens The pattern says Brian holds across a large number of countries time periods and even different species While actual average lifespan changes quite a bit from country to country and from animal to animal the same general rule that your probability of dying doubles every X years holds true But heres the dangling question Why the regular interval Why eight years for humans Brians answer Its an amazing fact and no one understands why its true Really Shouldnt there be some obvious explanation Its pretty obvious that when surveying a large population death is not really a random sudden bolt of lightning out of the blue If it were as Brian points out the bolt would hit randomly and in any collection of people   the babies would be as likely to die as the oldsters youngsters middleagers But thats not how it works Older people die more frequently than younger people in peacetime anyway So  random death isnt Couldnt the latest biological explanations for aging explain an eightyear doubling pattern Brian considers this question in his essay He calls it the cops and criminals theory Its based on a   by   As Brian describes it This sounds right that our immune system deteriorates at a steady pace leaving us with fewer and fewer cops to remove the troublemakers in our bodies As a metaphor it works But says Brian unfortunately the full complexity of human biology does not lend itself readily to cartoons about cops and criminals There is no biological finding that explains the eightyear pattern we find in the mortality tables The idea is nice But the math It has no obvious logic no explanation  not yet We know death is approaching but why does it like the number eight
