For Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, the drug company’s nearly .  is like going back to the future.. Since 2000, Pfizer has relied on three huge mergers to bolster its top line, plug holes in its product portfolio and appease investors. But those deals—in which Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and then Wyeth—mostly bought time as the drug maker cut costs, narrowed its R&D focus and then began raising its dividend.. Since being promoted to CEO three years ago, though, Mr. Read repeatedly has promoted the idea of splitting the drug maker into three separate units and pooh-poohed the notion that huge deals would be pursued in order to chase revenue. Specific financial details for those entities are, in fact, due to be released next month.
