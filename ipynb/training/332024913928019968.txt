Theres been a buzz of activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta since scientists   of a new bird flu virus from China four weeks ago Already theyve prepared seed strains of the virus called   and distributed them to vaccine manufacturers so the companies can grow them up and make them into experimental flu vaccine Theyve also come up with a   for HN that the Food and Drug Administration has approved on an emergency basis Meanwhile CDC researchers have almost concluded experiments that involve infecting   with HN  in particular a virus derived from a yearold Chinese housewife who died last Monday from the flu Because ferrets respiratory tracts are similar to those in humans researchers want to see if the animals can infect each other through droplets in their exhalations a possible clue to the allimportant issue of whether this virus has the potential to spread readily among humans Dr Daniel Jernigan deputy director of CDCs influenza division says there are two main reasons why HN is getting so much attention First people who get it usually get   sick and so far   Second the genetic makeup of this new virus is disturbingly different from an   that has sickened more than  people over the past  years and killed more than half of them That virus is an H type The thing thats different between them is the H virus still maintains a lot of the avian or bird flu characteristics Jernigan tells Shots whereas this HN shows some adaptation to mammals And thats what makes it different and concerning for us For instance the newer bird flu has adapted to thrive at human body temperature which is much lower than the body temperature of birds Its a necessary step toward becoming a flu that could spread easily from human to human  but its not sufficient It still has a ways to go before it becomes like a human virus Jernigan says But the fact is its somewhere in that middle ground between purely avian and purely human Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says thats a red flag Thats something you have to keep an eye on Fauci tells Shots But we still dont know the complete road map of how it goes from a relatively nonadaptable to an adaptable virus to humans Meanwhile officials arent just waiting to see if this virus becomes fully adapted to humans The CDC   state and local officials to dust off the plans they worked up several years ago when it looked like the earlier bird flu virus might cause a big pandemic Fauci says serious planning sessions are underway throughout the federal government The pandemicpreparedness engines are already humming he says For instance plans are being laid for human trials of several candidate HN vaccines We would hope that theres enough vaccine by the end of June or so so that you could start the clinical trials through July August through the end of the summer Fauci says Hopefully it wont be any later than then Those studies will tell scientists if they have a goodenough vaccine against the new flu  in case the virus begins to spread easily among people Meanwhile the problem is how to prevent people from getting it from chickens In the past that has been accomplished by wholesale killing of poultry flocks as soon as any get infected Thats what Chinese officials did this week at a chicken farm in Guangdong the southern province that provides Hong Kong with most of its poultry  chickens   after the HN virus was found in one bird But Jernigan of the CDC says that wont work as a general strategy because this new virus doesnt make chickens sick though they can be infected and spread the virus around For this particular virus which we know can cause severe disease in humans but does not necessarily cause severe disease in poultry it makes it very difficult to know where that virus is Jernigan says After all health officials cant just kill every chicken in China It is a difficult problem the CDC official acknowledges There are lots of chickens in China Even if a chicken vaccine were developed against HN thered be no incentive for farmers to buy it  because this virus doesnt kill chickens
