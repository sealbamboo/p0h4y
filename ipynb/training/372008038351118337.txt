A way of screening for ovarian cancer appears to detect the disease in early stages and if confirmed in clinical trials the test could become a routine screening for women  In the study researchers tested the screening on more than  women over an year period The women underwent yearly blood tests and the researchers recorded the levels of a protein called CA which is produced by the majority of   Women who had sudden increases in CA levels were referred to a gynecologist and were given an ultrasound  On the basis of their ultrasound results  women underwent surgery during the study period It turned out that four women had ovarian cancers still in an early stage and five others had ovarian tumors that were either benign or of low malignant potential tumors that may become cancerous but usually do not One woman had endometrial cancer according to the study published today Aug  in the journal Cancer  The study suggested that the testing strategy had a specificity of  percent the researchers said meaning that only  percent of patients without cancer would be falsely identified as having the disease  Two women in the study turned out to have ovarian tumors that were not detected by the screening but both were of low malignant potential the researchers said  The results from our study are not practicechanging at this time however our findings suggest that using a longitudinal or change over time screening strategy may be beneficial in postmenopausal women with an average risk of developing ovarian cancer study researcher Dr Karen Lu professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas said in a statement  Despite advances in treatment ovarian cancer remains a highly lethal disease mainly because most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed when the disease is at a late stage When caught at an early stage  to  percent of patients survive at least five years the researchers said  There currently are no established   For a cancer screening test to be useful it has to be sensitive enough to detect markers of the disease before symptoms manifest while also being specific enough so that it doesnt falsely suggest cancer in people who dont have it  Previous investigations have looked at whether measuring womens CA levels might be an effective way to screen for ovarian cancer but too often the test has not been found to be sensitive enough to detect all cases of the disease and at the same time has found too many false positives women who turned out not to have cancer  The new strategy is different because it tracks changes in each womans levels of CA instead of only looking for a CA level that might be considered high based on the average of the entire population Its more personalized and it also incorporates age Lu told LiveScience  One of the challenges to developing an effective ovarian cancer screening strategy for women in the general population is that the screening has to be highly specific so that followup testing and surgery that turn out to be unnecessary are kept to a minimum  In breast cancer screening when a   is abnormal a biopsy is made before anything further is done Lu said But in ovarian cancer in order to confirm cancer an actual surgery is needed to take out the ovaries and examine them  In order for this method to become a screening test it has to pass the gold standard she said It has to show that in a large group of women who did the screening there were   compared to another group who didnt get screened  The researchers are waiting for the results of a larger randomized study currently being conducted in the United Kingdom that uses the same screening strategy The results are scheduled to be released by   If the results of this study are also positive then this will result in a change in practice Lu said
