The world of dieting is awash in halftruths and wishful thinking Just have a look at some of these   to be reminded of how much we are willing to stretch reason in pursuit of weight loss  a researcher and director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama Birmingham is fascinated by the mountain of myths and assumptions about what makes us fat Lately hes turned his attention to understanding why so many researchers recycle these myths despite the lack of good evidence supporting them In a   out this week in the   Allison and colleagues examine the longrunning presumption that its better to eat breakfast than to skip it if you want to lose weight They found that this presumption is common in obesity research and its usually a result of researchers bias when describing their own or others work But wait a second Does that mean there is zero connection between breakfast and weight No says Allison Studies show there is an   between regularly skipping breakfast and higher body mass index Allison tells The Salt But it is an association so it does not necessarily represent cause and effect Theres also an association between skipping breakfast and a higher risk of heart attack as Allison Aubrey   in July The only way to truly understand cause and effect is with a randomized control trial  the gold standard for clinical research Only one such study  conducted in  with  women participating  hinted at a link between breakfast and weight change he says and no similar trials have been done since then But in the meantime Allison says hundreds of papers have presumed that skipping breakfast does affect weight So why are researchers so susceptible to repeating unproved ideas Allison says he hasnt studied this question specifically but he can speculate We all eat and we all have beliefs about food family morals and body weight he says Its a very emotional issue for many people and some of that leads to  passion that sometimes clouds judgment And the breakfastskipping hypothesis is far from the only one out there that needs better testing Earlier this year Allison and some colleagues published a   in the   detailing seven big myths about obesity Allison isnt just complaining hes doing something to address the situation Since there is no big controlled trial on the effect of breakfast on weight loss he has one in the works It will involve  adults at six sites around the country He says he hopes to have results in six months
