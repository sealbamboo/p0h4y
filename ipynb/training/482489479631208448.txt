He is a worldrenowned surgeon who has been described both as a daring pioneer and as a cowboy who takes dangerous risks with his patients Dr Paolo Macchiarini of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm Sweden is pushing the boundaries of the emerging field of regenerative medicine which involves using a patients own cells to rebuild tissues and organs Eventually scientists hope to get to the point where any replacement body part or organ you need would simply be manufactured in a lab manmade just for you This could eliminate the need for donor organs which are in short supply all over the globe But for now there is only one surgeon in the world who is doing transplants in humans with artificially grown organs Patients come to the controversial surgeon because he is literally their only hope Take Julia Tuulik a Russian dancer whose trachea was destroyed after a car accident They offered for me this one chance Tuulik told Meredith Vieira for NBC News A Leap of Faith A Meredith Vieira Special airing Friday at  pm ET pm CT And I havent other chance in my life Or little Hannah Warren Born without a trachea and unable to breathe on her own she had spent her entire life in the hospital kept alive only by a tube No child with her disorder has ever lived past the age of six and Dr Macchiarinis artificial trachea was her only hope Or Ciaran FinnLynch an Irish boy who was born with a windpipe less than a tenth of an inch wide At age  he was the first child in the world to get a transplant made from a donor organ and his own stem cells Many of Macchiarinis patients have been given only months or a few years to live left with no options or any hope You see a patient and this patient has no other alternatives Macchiarini said And he will die very very soon As a human and as a doctor are we allowed to say no I dont think so Though it might sound like science fiction scientists around the world are actively experimenting with this promising science Recent accomplishments include Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centers announcement that four teenage girls with a rare genetic disorder were implanted with   and at the University of Basel in Switzerland scientists regrew the   of older people whose noses had been partially lost to skin cancer But while scientists are eagerly working toward being able to grow vital organs like hearts lungs and kidneys in the lab it will be years before they are ready to attempt transplanting those in humans But Dr Macchiarini has already taken the science out of the lab He first made headlines six years ago in  when he transplanted the worlds first labmade windpipe It was constructed from a donor trachea that had been stripped of its original cells leaving it as a skeleton upon which a new trachea could be built with the patients own stem cells The groundbreaking method would allow Macchiarini to bypass two of the major problems associated with donated organs the risk of rejection and the need to take powerful antirejection drugs By   the Italian surgeon had moved on to plastic as a scaffold rather than a donated trachea The first recipient would be Andermariam Beyene a yearold engineer from Eritrea Macchiarinis team began by collecting stem cells from Beyenes bone marrow Those cells were mixed with special growth factors and then poured onto a scaffold made from plastic  in fact the very same plastic that is used to make soda bottles  which had been made to mimic the shape of a real windpipe In just a matter of days the scaffold began to transform into an actual functioning windpipe Macchiarini described the magical sounding process like this Its like if you roast a chicken Its the same thing You fill this box with fluid that includes cells And then this chicken scaffold just is submerged in this fluid and the cells penetrate inside Eight patients have now received his completely   but because the surgery is still highly experimental and unproven critics worry that he is putting his patients at risk and taking the science out of the lab prematurely Skeptics have questioned whether he is using his desperate  and highly vulnerable  patients as human guinea pigs I do believe hes in the gray zone Dr Joseph Vacanti surgeon inchief at the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children told Vieira in September of  Not all of Macchiarinis patients have survived but supporters argue that this is how surgery advances Take a look at any major turn in surgery said Dr Rick Pearl pediatric surgeoninchief at Childrens Hospital of Illinois in Peoria It never started out working did it Tom Starzl when he started doing liver transplants the first seven eight nine patients all died Everybody said he was nuts OK Christian Barnard when he started doing heart transplants everyone threw rocks at him This is how were going to treat diseases in the future and this is the start of it One of Macchiarinis most promising success stories is Claudia Castillo a Spanish mother who is doing so well six years after her transplant that an increasing number of Macchiarinis colleagues are beginning to see him in a new light I believe for the field we are now at the end of the beginning Vacanti said And so he may feel alone but he is not alone Hes part of the group thats making fantasy real
