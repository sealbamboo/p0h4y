It wasnt dementia at all  It was hypoglycemia or low blood sugar  The woman had diabetes and was taking too much medication Once the doses were lowered her cognitive symptoms disappeared Dr Kasia Lipska an instructor at Yale School of Medicine told me this story as she described hypoglycemia among older adults a growing concern Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that  million Americans have diabetes up from  million in   Older adults with diabetes are more likely than younger people to have bouts of low blood sugar because of altered kidney function other medical conditions other medications that interact with their diabetes drugs and a reduced ability to sense   shakiness sweatiness dizziness weakness a feeling of intense hunger and blurred vision among others When glucose circulating in the blood plummets precipitously people can collapse lose consciousness become delirious and die Yet physicians trained to aggressively control elevated glucose levels or hyperglycemia havent always paid close attention to the risk of too little glucose in older people with diabetes  In the past low blood sugar reactions seem to have been thought of as the price we pay for blood sugar control and there wasnt as much concern Dr Lipska said  Now were recognizing that these reactions are much more common than we previously thought and not as benign A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine for which Dr Lipska was a coauthor documented   among nearly  million older adults on Medicare between  and   During that period admissions for hypoglycemia jumped  percent while admissions for hyperglycemia fell by  percent The increase was particularly striking among adults aged  and older who were hospitalized nearly twice as often for hypoglycemia as adults aged  to    The trend began to slow after  most likely because major clinical trials showed   Still the study noted hospital admission rates for hypoglycemia now exceed those for hyperglycemia among older adults  Thats not to say that the management of blood sugar in all older adults with diabetes is overly aggressive But it does imply that doctors may need to improve treatment for an especially vulnerable group  frail diabetes patients with multiple medical conditions and compromised functioning according to Dr Jeffrey Halter a professor of internal medicine and director of the Geriatrics Center at the University of Michigan   Its a systems failure when older adults get hypoglycemia since most of these cases are preventable he said Further evidence that hypoglycemia deserves more attention in older diabetes patients comes from another study published earlier this year also in JAMA Internal Medicine That report examined  patients with Type  diabetes aged  and older who were treated by Kaiser Permanente in Northern California  The study found that hypoglycemia was   in adults aged  and older who had had diabetes for at least  years   The authors conclusion  As longterm survivorship with diabetes increases and as the population ages more research and public health efforts to reduce hypoglycemia will be needed For older people with diabetes and their caregivers the implications are clear  Be on the lookout for symptoms of hypoglycemia make sure you report these to your physician and be actively engaged in making treatment decisions Dr Lipska said
