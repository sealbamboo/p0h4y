 When taken as a supplement unroasted  or green  coffeebean extract can help people shed pounds according to a small preliminary study The research which is being presented this week at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego involved just  overweight and obese patients who were given daily doses of green coffee extract in capsule form All the patients were instructed to maintain their usual   while the study team monitored them for weight loss over a period of nearly six months The apparent result Daily consumption of a small amount of green coffee extract translated into a nearly  percent drop in body weight on average The study was conducted in India and funded by Applied Food Sciences the American manufacturer of two greencoffeeextract products It has not been published in a journal and therefore has yet to undergo peer review  of this kind however are not subject to the rigorous US Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy testing typically applied to all pharmaceutical medications This was indeed a small study acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild   But here with higher extract doses than have been used before the patients experienced what I would call rather large weight loss While this of course needs to be confirmed with followup I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration Vinson added Vinson said his team was not focused on the weightloss impact of caffeine as much as that of unprocessed unroasted coffees primary ingredient chlorogenic acid Thats the main natural compound in unroasted coffee and roasted coffee has much much less of it than unprocessed coffee Vinson said So were not talking about something that is interchangeable with the coffee we drink which is produced by roasting beans at a temperature between  and  degrees Fahrenheit Green coffeebean extracts are sold online at prices ranging from about  to  for  capsules The study was broken into three sixweek sections In one section study participants who were all between the ages of  and  consumed a capsule filled with  milligrams of green coffee extract In the second section participants took a milligram capsule The third section had participants taking a placebo Each patient ultimately cycled through each section While maintaining their prestudy dietary and   regimens the patients lost an average of  pounds by the studys close On average patients lost  percent and  percent of their body weight and body fat respectively Basically there was steady weight loss without side effects while the active green tea extract was being taken at either dose Vinson said A followup study involving  patients is now in the planning stages Lona Sandon a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas cautioned that the study is short on specifics making it difficult to draw any conclusions First of all you need more than  people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings Sandon said And we really have no idea how this might be working For example the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet But did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat and then what they actually ate We dont know What we have here is basically just a hypothesis that theres something about this compound that could be helpful Just because it might cause weight loss doesnt mean its healthy she warned Because supplements are not regulated as drugs they can be put on the market with no safety or efficacy testing They dont even necessarily have to be tested for purity That means that in the past various weightloss supplements have been found to contain weightloss drugs or other drugs at higher doses than what would be allowed in a prescription dose Sandon added So while people might have this perception that its all natural since its coming from a coffee bean with supplements in general its still a buyerbeware market
