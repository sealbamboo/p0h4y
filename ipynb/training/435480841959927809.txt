Paul Divinigracia does not consider himself a saint But to observe how he cares for his wife Virgie now  years into   you might think otherwise The Divinigracias celebrated their th anniversary in August At  Mr Divinigracia still calls his yearold wife dear and he clearly means it even after he has answered the same question a dozen times within a few moments Patience he said in an interview is the watchword of his existence We laugh a lot  laughter definitely helps he said I make jokes out of many of the problems Maintaining a sense of humor enables me to stay in balance Lest he run out of things to laugh about he and his wife watch amusing programs on Filipino television both are natives of the Philippines It reduces the tension he said But there is no question that being the fulltime caregiver of a family member with Alzheimers or any other form of     New challenges frequently arise Mr Divinigracias latest is trying to persuade his wife to bathe Sometimes I offer a reward like telling her Were going out for lunch or dinner and the restaurant wont let us in unless we smell goodÂ  he said Mr Divinigracia could easily have been the subject of one of the  stories in a new book Support for Alzheimers and Dementia Caregivers The Unsung Heroes by Judith L London Dr London is a psychologist in San Jose Calif whose first book Connecting the Dots Breakthroughs in Communication as Alzheimers Advances broadened her contacts with family and professional caregivers facing and often solving everyday problems related to dementia She based each of the stories on situations confronting caregivers she has encountered offering suggestions that could help others in similar circumstances The challenges include convincing patients or other relatives that something is really amiss that lapses are not only a result of the gradual decline in memory that can accompany aging as well as keeping people with dementia from slipping unnoticed out of the house and getting lost Double deadbolts on all the doors are a common and effective deterrent I have to be very observant of whats going on at all times Mr Divinigracia said Shes become very obsessive about safety constantly checking to be sure all the doors and windows are locked and plugs are unplugged and wanting to take out the garbage One day after putting garbage in a pail outside Mrs Divinigracia forgot where the house was and had to be brought home by a neighbor The Divinigracias often visit family Their daughter has taken to putting notes everywhere in her home reminding her mother what to do and what not to do She does read the notes and follow the instructions Mr Divinigracia said Caregiving is an act of love even for paid caregivers Dr London said in an interview You put so much of yourself out there all the time especially with Alzheimers patients The average span of the disease is seven years and it can go on as long as  years and the challenges only increase with time Dr London worries a lot about the stress on these caregivers and rightly so According to the data from Stanford University and the Alzheimers Association more than   unpaid care for family members or friends with Alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia The strain of the task has been shown in many studies to increase the risk of a variety of illnesses and   Mr Divinigracia loves to travel and hes discovered that taking trips stimulates his wife in a positive way Her   increases and information is better retained from the new places we visit he said On a recent drive from Fremont Calif where they live to Seattle for a family event they passed through beautiful mountains north of San Francisco She just loved that and can recall it even though she cant remember what I told her two minutes ago he said To maximize quality time together in whatever time they have left hes planned trips to Hawaii in April and Europe in September Sometimes though returning to an old activity can be stimulating and fun In one of Dr Londons stories a caregiving wife gets her husband who has serious dementia to again enjoy golf his former passion by saying she wants to play Once at the driving range with club in hand he suddenly remembered what to do and sent the ball flying The message Once you get him started he may still know how to do something he could do years before What a thrill Dr London wrote Likewise there may be ways to awaken pleasant memories through new experiences Dr London tells the story of a woman who picked a sprig of rosemary during a walk around a lake The smell reminded her husband of how much he liked her rosemary chicken and he said so in the first complete sentence hed spoken in months One of the most common distressing challenges faced by caregivers occurs when dementia patients become agitated or physically or verbally abusive situations that are emotionally exhausting and sometimes dangerous for patients and caregivers alike  a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing works with a team of occupational therapists to find ways to cope with such situations without drugs They prescribe   tailored to the patients abilities needs and interests The result is patients who are calmer safer and more engaged and caregivers who are less stressed Still there are times when even the most astute and clever caregiver fails to overcome a challenge particularly when an Alzheimers patient becomes violent When one womans husband seemed possessed by demons screaming curses and menacing her with a knife Dr London wrote she finally realized that she could no longer care for him safely at home Reluctantly she had to place him in a home so that both of them could be safe From conversations with others and participation in a semimonthly Alzheimers Association support group Mr Divinigracia knows that the worst is yet to come He continues to learn effective ways to cope with the challenges that arise and how to take them in stride Still Dr London said caregivers are often the casualties the hidden victims of Alzheimers disease No one sees the sacrifices they make she said It is vital for caregivers to take good care of themselves she added by exercising eating and sleeping properly and getting respite care when needed
