Today is the day the uninsured can sign up for insurance on Connecticuts new health care exchange under the Affordable Care Act But technical glitches have hampered the rollout Kevin Counihan is pretty good at managing expectations Hes the head of Access Health CT the agency that runs the states new health insurance marketplace Hes got his eyes on  and beyond By then he says well be able to judge whether the health care overhaul has succeeded So for him Oct  may be exciting but its not all that telling I consider this Day One in a threeyear enrollment period Counihan said So I think its sort of a nice metaphor for launching a major social program But frankly in the big picture it doesnt have a lot of value And it might be a good idea for him to focus on the long term Because in the short term the agencys website for enrolling     has been glitchy at best and offline at worst Shortly after  am Counihan said the website was live that there had been more than  page visits and that by  someone had already enrolled But throughout the morning it was nearly impossible to get the website to load Counihans agency took to Twitter to explain One tweet read Our website is up now please try reloading Another said We appreciate your patience as we continue to launch our systems today Dont forget you have till Dec  to enroll for Jan  coverage The website will eventually work consistently And when it does thats when the truly complicated work of enrolling the uninsured will begin in earnest
