The FDA Thursday morning .  about how it will regulate electronic cigarettes — the pen-like, battery-powered gizmos that heat up nicotine-laced water and create vapor.  E-cigarettes have been a quandary for the FDA: Should they be supervised like cigarettes because of their addictiveness and potential dangers — or are they actually a health boon for smokers who switch away from traditional smokes? The answer: The FDA will give e-cigarettes much more leeway than cigarettes, at least for now.
