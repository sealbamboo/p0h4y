A letter signed by more than  researchers and public health specialists is urging the World Health Organization WHO to resist the urge to control and suppress ecigarettes The letter says the devices  which deliver nicotine in a vapour  could be a significant health innovation But the UKs Faculty of Public Health says it is too early to know whether benefits outweigh potential risks  The WHO said it was still deciding what recommendations to make to governments  has been organised in the runup to significant international negotiations on tobacco policy this year  Supporters of ecigarettes who argue the products are a lowrisk substitute for smoking fear they might become subject to reduction targets and advertising bans  On some ecigarettes inhalation activates the batterypowered   Other types are manually switched on  A   inside the atomiser heats liquid nicotine contained in a cartridge  Liquid nicotine becomes   and is inhaled The smoke produced is largely water vapour Many ecigarettes have an LED light as a cosmetic feature to simulate traditional cigarette glow  There has been a big growth in the market for ecigarettes but the Department of Health says they are not riskfree  Critics say not enough is known about their longterm health effects A recent report commissioned by Public Health England said ecigarettes required appropriate regulation careful monitoring and risk management if their benefits were to be maximised The letter has been signed by  researchers  including specialists in public health policy and experts such as Prof Robert West who published research last week suggesting that ecigarettes are more likely to help people give up smoking than some conventional methods  Some of the signatories work on research into tobacco science and smoking cessation Three were involved in advising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE on its guidelines about reducing the harm from tobacco The letter says These products could be among the most significant health innovations of the st Century  perhaps saving hundreds of millions of lives  If regulators treat lowrisk nicotine products as traditional tobacco products they are improperly defining them as part of the problem Regulators should avoid support for measures that could have the perverse effect of prolonging cigarette consumption We are deeply concerned that the classification of these products as tobacco will do more harm than good The potential for tobacco harm reduction products to reduce the burden of smokingrelated disease is very large The organisers of the letter quote a leaked WHO document that refers to ecigarettes as a threat which could result in a new wave of the tobacco epidemic The WHO treaty on tobacco control currently covers  countries and  of the worlds population  Ecigarettes are batterypowered devices that mimic the experience of smoking Users inhale a vapour from a heated liquid that contains a concentration of nicotine  Prof West of University College London told the BBC ecigarettes should be regulated appropriate to what they are and that they are orders of magnitude safer than tobacco cigarettes He called for bespoke regulation including banning sales for unders and having marketing directed at those who already smoke  A WHO spokesman said WHO is currently working on recommendations for governments on the regulation and marketing of ecigarettes and similar devices This is part of a paper that will be submitted to the parties of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control later this year  We are also working with national regulatory bodies to look at regulatory options as well as toxicology experts to understand more about the possible impact of ecigarettes and similar devices on health The British Medical Association BMA has called for stronger regulation of the devices in the UK Dr Vivienne Nathanson the BMAs director of professional activities told BBC Breakfast there was evidence that children who had never smoked   having been influenced by marketing campaigns Rather like cigarettes in the s and s we really need to look at that and I believe ban it advertising to stop them advertising in a way that attracts children she added Prof John Ashton president of the Faculty of Public Health said he was also concerned about children using ecigarettes We need to weigh up the benefits of fewer people smoking against the risk of electronic cigarettes leading to more people starting to smoke particularly children he said  Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said The health community is completely divided on the subject of whether electronic cigarettes are safer than real cigarettes  While the signatories to this letter are clearly supportive the World Health Organization correctly bases its decisions on the best available evidence He said it would be premature to advocate the use of ecigarettes until their safety had been established  The Welsh government wants to restrict the use of ecigarettes in enclosed public places because of concerns that they normalise smoking  Richard Evans vicechairman of the Welsh Pharmacy Board which is part of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Wales believes they should be regulated in the same way as traditional cigarettes He said At the moment the products that are on the market  we dont know what standard they are They can vary from product to product  there is no uniformity at all
