Domestic violence affects a third of women worldwide according to the World Health Organization In many cases nobody knows of the suffering and victims arent able to get help in time Thats why in many countries including the US theres been a push to make screening for domestic violence a routine part of doctor visits Last year the influential US Preventive Services Task Force  that clinicians ask all women of childbearing age whether theyre being abused These days after your doctor asks you whether youre allergic to any medication or whether you smoke she might also ask whether you feel safe with your partner But an   published Monday in  formerly the British Medical Journal suggests such generalized screenings may not be helping much A review of  studies involving  women in wealthy countries found that screening questions did help doctors identify more than twice as many patients who were suffering from abuse But routine screenings didnt necessarily help those women get the followup support they needed researchers found The emphasis on how to identify victims distracts attention from the real issues says   a professor of primary care medicine at the University of Bristol and one of the researchers behind the review Instead the medical community should be focusing on providing known victims with proper support Feder tells Shots We dont think screening is necessarily harmful Feder says We just cant give doctors a compelling reason for doing it To be effective doctors and nurses need to be trained how to ask the right questions and to connect those whove been abused with the right resources Feder says Instead of indiscriminately spending a little time screening everyone clinicians would do better to spend more time with the patients who they think might be in trouble he says Thats pretty much in line with the WHOs  that clinicians only ask in certain contexts  the group doesnt recommend universal screening Great Britain once had a policy to screen every pregnant woman for domestic abuse as a part of prenatal care Feder says But it was being asked in a very mechanistic impersonal way he says and that doesnt help anyone Still the notion of completely doing away with screenings is controversial among health care workers and fairly complicated says   a nurse practitioner and associate director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health Weve been having this conversation for several years now says Glass Shes a proponent of routine screenings Even skilled doctors can miss subtle signs of abuse she says and theres not one symptom that all abused women have in common So she says asking more women more often is better than not asking at all Women in abusive relationships have a lot of reasons not to report Glass says Women are often afraid that their partner will retaliate or they simply dont feel comfortable talking about it But if a physician asks respectfully in a private setting  and with the assurance of confidentiality  women are more likely to open up Glass says That doesnt mean that that day theyre going to go out to shelter or call a hotline Glass says But she thinks such conversations between patient and doctor are a step in the right direction Glass and Feder both agree that doctors need training to ask the right questions They also agree that the way doctors ask makes all the difference Its not  rolling down a list of questions Glass says The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has   and   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But asking the right way takes practice Dr Owen Montgomery who chairs the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Drexel Universitys College of Medicine in Philadelphia says hes found in dealing with his own patients that screenings are helpful I can tell you  percent of the time when I ask a woman if shes safe even if the answer is no she is grateful he says Until the research unequivocally shows that screening doesnt help at all Montgomery says it makes sense to continue the practice Every woman who delivers in our hospital is screened for postpartum depression and domestic violence he says To not acknowledge the importance of domestic violence doesnt sit right with me
