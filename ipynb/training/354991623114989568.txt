Surgeons often listen to music while theyre operating but in Brad Carters brain surgery it was the patient who supplied the tunes  Carter an actor who has landed guest starring roles in popular television shows like Bones and The Mentalist says his real passion has always been singing and playing the guitar But seven years ago his hands started shaking making it hard to play some of his favorite songs  Im a guitarist since  Carter told NBC chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman And music is my first love Im an actor for a living but I always have had music to turn to Carter was diagnosed with benign essential tremor No one knows exactly what causes the shaking but experts suspect that a part of the brain that controls muscles movements does not work correctly in patients with essential tremor according to the National Institutes of Health  While medications initially helped quiet the tremors eventually they stopped working  As the shaking grew worse Carter stopped performing his music on stage  You watch all your skills and who you are as a person sorta    theyre vanishing in front of your eyes he said tearing up Its hard to watch that happen and you cant do anything about it Carter started looking for another solution and found a doctor at the University of California Los Angeles who thought he could help We essentially put a pacemaker in the brain said Dr Nader Pouratian a neurosurgeon at UCLA And with the stimulation we help it restore a more normal pattern of activity Deep brain stimulation has long been used to calm the tremors associated with illnesses such as Parkinsons disease Doctors surgically implant electrodes in the thalamus a structure in the brain that is involved with coordinating muscle movement The electrodes fire off tiny electrical signals that seem to quiet tremors  For the best results though Carter would need to be awake His doctors suggested that he play the guitar during his operation so that they could see when his tremors weakened  Carter lay awake for six of the seven hours of surgery helping doctors adjust the DBS  Weeks later Carters tremors had quieted down enough for him to get back to playing  What this offers is hope that I didnt have before he said And you know theres a way to go Theres a way to go Carter has already returned to acting and has a role in an HBO series coming out next year  and he may now have a chance to get back to what he loves best  A few months down the road Id like to record and share my music he said
