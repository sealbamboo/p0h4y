When a fire department gets a call for medical help most of them scramble both an ambulance and a fully staffed fire truck But thats way more than most people need according to Rick Lewis chief of emergency medical services at South Metro Fire Rescue Authority in the Denver suburbs Its not the prairie and the Old West anymore where you have to be missing a limb to go to the hospital Lewis says Now its a sore throat or one day of cold or flu season sometimes and that can be frustrating for people I know it is South Metro receives more than  emergency medical calls a year and takes about  patients to area hospitals Somebody whos been running a fever for a couple of days may need help  just not necessarily a ride to the ER That disconnect can be frustrating for both ambulance crews and patients Crews arent required to transport everyone who calls but Lewis says they fear lawsuits if they were to leave and a patient got worse Also ambulance companies typically dont get paid unless they take somebody to the hospital So Lewis teamed up with Mark Prather an emergency room doctor to try and come up with   We created a mobile care unit that can go to a given patient if we think theyre safe to treat on scene and provide definitive onscene treatment says Prather The mobile care unit is basically a station wagon Advance practice paramedic Eric Bleeker shows off some of the gear This one is a suture set so it has everything for wound closure from staples to regular sutures he says Ambulances dont have that kind of equipment so even someone who just needs a few stitches gets a ride to the emergency department Several cities across the country are using paramedics as physician extenders sending ambulance crews to do routine things like hospital followup visits in places where basic health care is hard to get South Metros model focuses on responding to calls The team always includes at least one nurse practitioner who can prescribe basic medicines that they stock in the mobile unit A lot of what we do is sort of that midlevel between the acute care you receive in an emergency department and what the paramedics can currently do says Bleeker Its kind of like an urgent care clinic on wheels Theres also a miniature medical lab We can run full blood chemistry we can do complete blood counts we can check for strep throat we can check for influenza he says Those are capabilities that even many doctors offices dont have on site South Metro Fire also relies heavily on Colorados new   The nurse or EMT can call up patient records on the scene to provide care thats more like an office visit and dispatchers can check recent medical histories to make sure they send ambulances to people who might really need one That person who called  because they were running a fever could end up being diagnosed and treated in their living room by South Metros station wagon for about  instead of spending a lot more for similar care at an emergency room Insurance companies dont yet pay for this though says Prather Thats maybe why nobody has done it yet he says laughing For the last nine months South Metro has been running the service basically for free to prove that it saves money But Prather thinks thats about to change because of Obamacare The law aims to get insurance companies Medicare and Medicaid to stop paying for too much medical care And it can penalize health care providers who contribute to overuse of emergency rooms It allowed us to think about payment differently and basically switch from a volume situation to a quality situation he says But its not like the law just flips a switch and starts paying for appropriate care instead of rewarding providers who see a high number of patients and do lots of procedures The change to reward efficient appropriate health care is just starting to happen Slowly But Prather is now in talks with insurers and hopes to be getting paid soon
