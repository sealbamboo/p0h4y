Nina Pham, the Dallas nurse who was infected with Ebola while caring for a Liberian man who died this month, has been upgraded to good condition, the National Institutes of Health said Tuesday.. Pham, 26, had been listed in fair condition since she was flown Thursday to a special NIH clinical studies unit in Maryland from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where she and a second nurse tested positive for the virus after Thomas Eric Duncan died Oct. 8. The NIH said it would release no further information, but it said Pham was grateful "for everyone's concerns and well wishes.". The other nurse, Amber Vinson, 29, was being treated at Emory University Hospital near the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Worldwide, the worst outbreak of the virus on record is believed to have killed more than 4,500 people and to have infected more than 9,000 others.
