Nigeria is the latest country to become affected by the outbreak The first person to die of Ebola here was an   who arrived from Liberia Now WHO suspects Nigeria has had  cases and three deaths  Our team in Lagos is a small part of the CDCs effort to fight Ebola with work going on in several African countries and back in the United States at our headquarters in Atlanta There the CDCs Emergency Operations Center has activated its highest level to maintain  operations to coordinate the agencys efforts   We are five hours ahead of Atlanta a fact my family has yet to grasp as I receive texts during odd hours asking Whats Lagos like and What are you doing  Good questions  A typical day for our team begins at a hotel  one big advantage of an urban outbreak After breakfast we move to one of several locations including the hospital US Consulate or a training site depending on the work to be done that day   Team Lagos is working as part of a much larger team in Nigeria to find and isolate all possible patients tracking down everyone who could have been exposed to Ebola and educating the public about the risks  A great deal has been accomplished in a short time A Nigerian emergency operations center is up and running now and we are about to move Ebola patients into a newly remodeled treatment facility  There are  folks on the   which has been tracking more than  people thought to have come in contact with the virus These teams visit the contacts daily to take their temperatures and check to see if they have developed any symptoms On Tuesday  of the  contacts were visited and assessed When difficulties arise locating contacts additional teams are employed and efforts ramped up to conduct the tracing  The Ebola response team in Nigeria recently saw  people finish the day risk period  the longest time period during which Ebola symptoms have been known to be present These  people were able to leave the contact tracing list which is a hopeful sign There is a great deal of fear in Lagos as many worry about a virus of which they know precious little CDC communicators like myself work to provide accurate information to the public and health care workers Health care workers are critical as they are on the front lines of this battle WHO says  of the deaths during this epidemic have been health care workers   Our infection control experts have been training workers on proper infection control and teaching them how to don Personal Protective Equipment properly a critical task given this virus  I was taking pictures of this training near the Ebola ward when one of the trainers came out of the hot zone and asked if anybody had a paperback to give one of the patients I donated a weathered copy of Shakespeares Henry the IV Part  I always carry a book on deployments So the Bard has entered the Ebola ward in Lagos One interesting aspect of this outbreak has been the rumors and misinformation spurred by Ebola Last week communicators were working quickly to respond to a rumor that bathing in or drinking salt water would prevent Ebola I have seen local press coverage that notes two people may have died from attempting this treatment As I write this we are in a temporary emergency operations center at a psychiatric hospital waiting for remodeling to be complete on our own center We made the change with some grumbling but did not miss a beat  flexibility is essential in an evolving outbreak situation Our work is made more difficult by traffic in the city a lack of Internet connectivity and security which is a concern We typically make it back to the hotel late anywhere between  and  pm local time and try to eat together  Team members who gather are tired and the outbreak dominates the conversation But we also try to distract ourselves On my third night a team member asked Has anyone else noticed that the background music is all Celine Dione It was true Turns out she has quite a few songs and I am pretty sure we have heard them all I am not afraid of catching the Ebola virus I know how Ebola is transmitted and will not put myself in jeopardy thinking of my wife and four children at home The work is long hard challenging but worthwhile The CDC team in Lagos is amazing one of the best I have been on And the larger response team that includes all our partners and our colleagues from Nigeria is doing important work to break the Ebola infection cycle
