If you live in a college town you might have noticed that campus coffee shops are still buzzing late into the evening And that makes sense New survey data from the   which tracks trends in what Americans eat and drink finds that  to yearolds are turning to coffee rather than caffeinated sodas as their pickmeup of choice In  about  percent of  to yearolds reported drinking coffee sometime within a twoweek period But by  the percentage of young adults drinking coffee in that same time frame hit  percent Its an explosive growth in the consumption of coffee says   of the NPD Group    For evidence of this trend I hit a coffee shop near the campus of George Washington University which is just a Metroride away from NPR headquarters here in DC In midafternoon I found a packed house This is nothing for two oclock in the afternoon senior Arturo Lichaucho tells me Often times the line is out the door and around the block he explained and lots of students hit the coffee shop before hitting the books in the late afternoon The students I chatted with gave lots of reasons for a steady coffee habit including increasing demands on their time that lead to less sleep and the  culture of overstimulation And why not drink more coffee Recent studies link coffee consumption to a range of good health effects including   and   among women But experts say there is one downside thats often overlooked Coffee consumption can get in the way of a good nights sleep Our   has shown that a brewed coffee contains much more caffeine than a cold cola beverage says  a toxicologist at the University of Florida The Center for Science in the Public Interest took a look at several popular items and analyzed their caffeine content It found that a ounce cup of coffee from Starbucks contains about  milligrams of caffeine which is about five times more than a ounce can of Diet Coke The caffeine content of coffee varies widely McDonalds coffee for instance has about  mg for a similarsize serving which is significantly less than Starbucks And Dunkin Donuts coffee is somewhere in the middle For more comparisons see their   When adolescents and young adults are habituating to the effects of caffeine its easy for them to overdo it And often even adults with lots of experience drinking coffee dont necessarily connect sleep problems to caffeine consumption There are absolutely negative implications explains   of the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who has studied how caffeine influences sleep among adolescents For instance studies have linked high caffeine use to decreased REM sleep We know that REM sleep is needed and has positive implications for memory consolidation and learning says Wolfson And if college students are getting too little sleep or poorer quality sleep Wolfson says its likely to have negative implications for academic performance So whats the smartest way to consume coffee for the boost but without the bust of a good nights sleep Pay attention to how much you drink and when you drink it Consider this The halflife of caffeine in the body can range from   hours to  hours Because of genetic differences some of us metabolize caffeine much more quickly than others But Goldberger says the typical halflife is probably about five hours which means caffeine typically stays in the body for about  hours  or longer Technically he says it takes up to five halflives to rid the body completely of a drug If someone has a cup of coffee at  pm the caffeine that theyve ingested is still in the body affecting the central nervous system when theyre going to bed says Goldberger So as a rule of thumb if you want to go to sleep by midnight  and stay asleep  its probably best not to drink coffee after  pm
