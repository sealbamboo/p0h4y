 When and how long a baby looks at other peoples eyes offers the earliest behavioral sign to date of whether a child is likely to develop autism scientists are reporting In a study published Wednesday researchers using eyetracking technology found that children who were found to have autism at age  looked less at peoples eyes when they were babies than children who did not develop autism But contrary to what the researchers expected the difference was not apparent at birth It emerged in the next few months and autism experts said that might suggest a window during which the progression toward autism can be halted or slowed The study published online in the journal   found that infants who later developed autism began spending less time looking at peoples eyes between  and  months of age and paid less attention to eyes as they grew older By contrast babies who did not develop autism looked increasingly at peoples eyes until about  months old and then kept their attention to eyes fairly constant into toddlerhood This paper is a major leap forward said Dr Lonnie Zwaigenbaum a pediatrician and autism researcher at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the study Documenting that theres a developmental difference between  and  months is a major major finding The authors Warren R Jones and Ami Klin both of the   and Emory University also found that babies who showed the steepest decline in looking at peoples eyes over time developed the most severe autism Kids whose eye fixation falls off most rapidly are the ones who later on are the most socially disabled and show the most symptoms said Dr Jones director of research at the autism center These are the earliest known signs of social disability and they are associated with outcome and with symptom severity Our ultimate goal is to translate this discovery into a tool for early identification of children with autism The eyetracking differences are not something parents and pediatricians would be able to perceive without the technology and expertise of an autism clinic Dr Jones said We dont want to create concern in parents that if a child isnt looking them in the eyes all the time its a problem he said Its not Children are looking all over the place Autism therapies have not yet been developed for young babies but there are efforts to adapt intensive behavioral therapy for use with children as young as  months Dr Jones said Diagnoses of autism have increased according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from one child in  in  to one in  in  The reasons are unclear although some factors could be greater awareness of the disorder and a growing number of older fathers Dr Jones and Dr Klin who directs the autism center studied two groups of babies One group was at high risk for autism with a  times greater likelihood of developing it because they had siblings with the disorder The other group was at low risk with no relatives with autism The researchers assessed  children from  months to  years of age  times while watching videos of friendly women acting like playful caregivers Eyetracking technology traced when the babies looked at the womens eyes mouths and bodies as well as toys or other objects in the background At age  the children were evaluated for autism Ultimately researchers used data from  boys  of whom developed autism They excluded data from girls because only two developed autism While the number of children studied was small  and the researchers are now studying more children  experts not involved in the study said the results were significant because of the careful and repeated measurements that were not just snapshots but showed change over time Its well done and very important said Dr Geraldine Dawson director of the Center for Autism Diagnosis and Treatment at Duke University She said it was notable that early on these babies look quite normal this really gives us a clue to brain development She said a possible explanation was that early in life activities like looking at faces are essentially reflexes controlled by lower cortical regions of the brain that are likely intact in children with autism But as the brain develops babies begin to use these behaviors in a more intentional way They can look at what they want to look at We think that these higher cortical regions are the ones that are not working the same as in typical children Dr John N Constantino a child psychiatrist and pediatrician at Washington University in St Louis said the study showed that babies who develop autism are for the most part doing an awful lot of things right for the first few months Perhaps the genes that drive autism begin to derail typical development after that so that what you are looking at moment by moment day by day second by second is completely different from what other children are looking at and the cumulative experience is what sends you off into the trajectory of autism The researchers found that children who developed autism paid somewhat more attention to mouths and sustained attention to bodies past the age when typical children became less interested Even more noticeable was that children who developed autism looked more at objects after the first year while typical childrens interest in objects declined Were measuring what babies see but more importantly were measuring what they dont see Dr Jones said Dr Dawson said that looking at people teaches babies about facial expressions and language and gesture If the baby whos developing autism is paying attention to objects theyre really losing out on those opportunities Before this study experts said research found that potential signs of autism  including differences in temperament eye contact and pointing out objects  could be detected late in a childs first year Most cases of autism in children are diagnosed between ages  and  although the   recommends screening children at between  and  months But the new study suggests the need to develop therapies that begin even earlier The train has long left the station if you dont start intervention until  months Dr Constantino said Dr Jones said eye contact was just one very important channel He continued I think wed see the same things if we were measuring a childs social reciprocity via touch or auditory listening preferences but those are harder to measure He and Dr Klin advocate the eventual use of eye tracking and other measures in social development growth charts similar to height and weight charts Still the authors and other experts cautioned that the results required confirmation in many more children Autism is so complex and varied that eyetracking is unlikely to be able to identify every condition on the autism spectrum Dr Zwaigenbaum and others said But they said the study helped illustrate the need for therapies to increase social engagement among very young infants either by intensifying the experience for them or making it pleasurable in other ways Dr Constantino said It really does present an opportunity for seeing if we could do some preventative interventions said Dr Sally Ozonoff vice chairwoman for research in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the MIND Institute of the University of California Davis Maybe you could keep the child from heading into that decline so it doesnt turn into autism
