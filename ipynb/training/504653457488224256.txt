Eating tomatoes may lower the risk of prostate cancer research suggests Men who consume more than  portions of tomatoes each week reduce their risk by about  according to a UK study Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide with  new cases and around  deaths in the UK every year  Cancer experts recommend eating a balanced diet which is high in fruit and vegetables and low in red and processed meat fat and salt The Bristol team analysed the diets and lifestyles of around  British men aged between  and  They found men who consumed more than  portions of tomatoes each week  such as fresh tomatoes tomato juice and baked beans  saw an  reduction in prostate cancer risk  Eating the recommended five servings of fruit or vegetables or more a day was also found to decrease risk by  compared with men who ate twoandahalf servings or less  Our findings suggest that tomatoes may be important in prostate cancer prevention said Vanessa Er from the School of Social and Community Medicine at   However further studies need to be conducted to confirm our findings especially through human clinical trials   Men should still eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables maintain a healthy weight and stay active The cancerfighting properties of tomatoes are thought to be due to lycopene an antioxidant which can protect against DNA and cell damage The researchers also looked at two other dietary components linked with prostate cancer risk  selenium found in flourbased foods such as bread and pasta and calcium found in dairy products such as milk and cheese Men who had optimal intake of these three dietary components had a lower risk of prostate cancer they said Commenting on the study Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said there was not yet enough evidence to make concrete recommendations on which specific foods men should eat to reduce their risk of prostate cancer  What we do know is that men shouldnt rely too heavily on one type of food such as tomatoes he said  A healthy balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables together with regular exercise is by far the best option Tom Stansfeld of Cancer Research UK added While eating foods rich in lycopene  such as tomatoes  or selenium may be associated with a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer this has not been proven and this study cant confirm whether there is a link between diet and prostate cancer risk  Diet and cancer prevention is a complex issue with few black and white answers we encourage everyone to eat a balanced diet which is high in fruit and vegetables and low in red and processed meat fat and salt The research published in the journal   was carried out in collaboration with the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford
