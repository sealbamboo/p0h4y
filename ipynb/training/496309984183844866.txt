These days its just good to have a job But remaining gainfully employed can take a toll on health especially if your work has you up at odd hours and sleeping irregularly Shift work say two studies out this week poses particular problems for women who appear to be at greater risk of Type  diabetes and possibly breast cancer if they maintain work schedules that mess with their internal clocks    Researchers have uncovered a   between humans respect for their circadian rhythms and their health prospects Those who toil while their neighbors rest or who have chronic sleep deficits are more likely to suffer a wide range of health problems besides just being tired Theyre more likely to be   and to have high blood pressure heart disease and depression    In a  published this week in the journal PLoS Medicine researchers tracked the extent to which more than  participants in the Nurses Health Study and its followup study the NHS II worked rotating night shifts over the  to  years of their participation in the study Nurses of course attend their patients around the clock so it is a profession notorious for rotating shifts     Those who had spent more than  years rotating their work schedules so they sometimes worked nights were almost  more likely than women who had never worked rotating shifts to develop Type  diabetes Women who had racked up less time doing shift work also were at higher risk for developing the metabolic disorder but less so than longtimers about  for women who had donethree to nine years of shift work and  for those who had rotated work schedules bewteeen night and day for  to  years    The researchers noted that obesity appeared to be a potent contributor to the trend and that obese shiftworking women appeared at greatest risk of diabetes    Also out this week a comprehensive   and environmental factors cited growing evidence that shift work is probably associated with increase risk for breast cancer and called for more research to define that link and explore what measuresaside from quitting your night jobmight mitigate the effect    The panel which prepared the   at the request of the Susan G Komen for the Cure foundation speculated about why shift work might boost breast cancer risk including evidence that irregular sleep patterns disturb the proper function of hormones and that clock genes knocked offkilter by irregular sleep patterns may set off cancerous cell growth in breast tissue      of course is a common factor in Type  diabetes and in breast cancer and shift workers do appear to be at greater risk of weight gain So if youre working the night shift making time for exercise and healthful eating might be as important as wedging in some time for shuteye
