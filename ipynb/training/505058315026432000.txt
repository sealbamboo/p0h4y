For the first time scientists have been able to follow the spread of an Ebola outbreak almost in real time by sequencing the virus genome from people in Sierra Leone The findings published Thursday in the journal   offer new insights into how the outbreak started in West Africa and how fast the virus is mutating An international team of researchers sequenced  Ebola genomes with extremely high accuracy from  people diagnosed with Ebola in Sierra Leone in June The Ebola genome is incredibly simple It has just seven genes By comparison we humans have about  genes In general these viruses are amazing because they are these tiny things that can do a lot of damage says   a computational biologist at Harvard University and the lead author of the study Hidden inside Ebolas tiny genome she says are clues to how the virus spreads among people  and how to stop it As soon as the outbreak happened and was reported in Guinea she says two members of my lab flew out and worked to set up the diagnostics to pick it up in Sierra Leone The team helped to find the first Ebola cases in Sierra Leone They also immediately shipped diagnostic samples from the patients back to the US and started sequencing the viruses genomes We had  people in my lab working aroundtheclock Sabeti says Their furious pace paid off After just a week or so the team had decoded gene sequences from  Ebola viruses The data offered a treasuretrove of information about the outbreak For starters the data show that the virus is rapidly accumulating new mutations as it spreads through people Weve found over  mutations that are changing in real time as were watching Sabeti says While moving through the human population in West Africa she says the virus has been collecting mutations about twice as quickly as it did while circulating among animals in the past decade or so The more time you give a virus to mutate and the more humantohuman transmission you see she says the more opportunities you give it to fall upon some mutation that could make it more easily transmissible or more pathogenic Sabeti says she doesnt know if thats happening yet But the rapid change in the virus genome could weaken the tools researchers have to detect Ebola or potentially to treat patients Diagnostic tests experimental vaccines and drugs for Ebola  like the one recently used   two American patients  are all based on the gene sequences of the virus Sabeti says If the virus is mutating away from the known sequence that could be important to how these things work The new genomic data also indicate that the outbreak started when just   caught Ebola from an animal Since then the virus has been spreading through humantohuman transmission    through humans eating infected bush meat wild game as was first thought Were really concerned because a lot of the messaging going around  is Dont each bush meat dont eat mango dont anything that might be in contact with animals  she says When you see some of those fliers youre like OK you just told them not to eat all the main sources of food  So the advice from health officials to avoid bush meat may be doing more harm than good she says Sabeti and the team also compared the Ebola genomes from Sierra Leone with those found in   in Central Africa Their findings suggest the virus has been circulating around West Africa for about a decade This study is really an impressive tour de force says virologist   of Columbia University But he says hes not surprised the virus is mutating so rapidly Weve seen this in a number of infections  SARS for example influenza and HIV of course Morse says Very often when a new virus is introduced into the human population very suddenly it will show accelerated rates of evolution So should we be concerned that the virus might pick up a mutation that makes it more contagious or deadly Thats very hard to say In most cases the answer would be no  Morse says But Ebola is obviously a concern and very virulent Id say its too early at this point to speculate on what any mutation or any change even with rapid evolution might lead to A number of scientists working on the project contracted Ebola while treating patients Five of them passed from Ebola Sabeti says including   He was Sierra Leones top virologist and had treated dozens of Ebola patients before catching the virus Health workers in Sierra Leone who   to NPR in the spring blamed a lack of proper protective equipment for infections at the governmentrun hospital in Kenema where Khan worked The work treating patients is just that dangerous Sabeti says Another British nurse at the hospital has just come down with Ebola Youre seeing so many infections going on Its an extraordinary thing thats going on right now in Sierra Leone
