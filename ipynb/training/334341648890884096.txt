The murder conviction in Philadelphia of   in the deaths of three babies and one of his female patients is likely to further inflame the already heated abortion debate Both sides of the abortion divide   for what comes next for some time now The irony of this case is that those on both sides of the debate were hoping for a conviction Thats because what Gosnell means to the abortion debate really comes down to this Was he an exception Or are there more abortion providers like him who just havent been discovered yet Abortion rights backers insist hes an outlier The fact is that what he did was illegal  unethical unscrupulous illegal says Jodi Jacobson And it bears no comparison to safe abortion care or even late abortion care because he performed abortions postviability on women without indications for such so they were illegal Jacobson who runs   an online daily news service about reproductive rights and sexual politics says most states already have laws that bar abortions late in pregnancy  except when there are medical reasons If you have a late abortion situation in the third trimester you are facing either a threat to the life or the health of the mother or a fetus with anomalies incompatible with life she says Abortion opponents however say Gosnell is anything but an exception The tentacles of this type of approach to abortion are all over the country says Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the   He is not an outlier You just have to do a Google search and youll find in the last several months many other examples of rogue abortion providers she said But whether or not there are more doctors like Gosnell antiabortion forces say theyll try to harness the public outrage created by this trial to further their cause Republicans on the House side of Capitol Hill have already launched a series of efforts Leaders of the   are asking state public health officials to provide details on state licensing of abortion clinics and providers information on revoked licenses state inspections of clinics and other details about regulation of abortion providers The deadline for responses is May  Meanwhile   Chairman Bob Goodlatte RVa has asked every state attorney general if state and local governments are being stymied in their efforts to protect the civil rights of newborns and their mothers by legal or financial obstacles that are within the federal governments power to address Dannenfelser says she hopes the case will help efforts to pass legislation to ban abortions after a certain point in pregnancy The question would be is there a point where the civil rights of the unborn child comes into play And there is a solid majority that says that late in pregnancy that point exists she says Anywhere from  to  weeks there is a good    percent support for that type of measure Both  and  weeks however are well before fetal viability and thus   for when abortion should be generally legal Abortion rights groups meanwhile are using the Gosnell case too Theyre making the case that as abortion becomes more and more restricted women will have fewer and fewer options and will end up turning to sketchier providers like Gosnell He was acting wholly outside the law and the fact that that is the case really suggests the reason why we need to make sure that we have good providers that abortion has to be safe and legal and accessible says Nancy Northup president and CEO of the   One thing is clear coming out of the Gosnell case It is likely to once again shift the emphasis of the abortion debate Until recently its been on   where abortionrights groups enjoy broader public support Now its likely to swing back to later abortions where abortion opponents have the publicopinion edge
