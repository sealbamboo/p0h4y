President Obama has announced an ambitious plan to explore the mysteries of the human brain In a speech Tuesday Obama said he will ask Congress for  million in  to better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember Other goals include finding new treatments for Alzheimers disease epilepsy and traumatic brain injury The   BRAIN Initiative would accomplish this by developing tools that would allow researchers to monitor millions or even billions of individual neurons as they interact to form thoughts or create memories Its an amazingly ambitious idea says   director of the National Institutes of Health To understand how the human brain works is about the most audacious scientific project you can imagine he says Its the most complicated structure in the known universe The technologies that allow scientists to watch the brain at work are advancing with amazing speed Collins says so he thinks its the right time to take a chance Five years ago this might have seemed out of reach he says Five years from now it will seem like we waited too late to take advantage of the opportunity Collins was the federal scientist in charge of the Human Genome Project which was completed in  But he says this initiative is a bit different because it wont be clear when the job is done People are remarkably similar genetically so researchers can learn a lot about all people by looking at the genetic sequences of just a few says   of Washington University in St Louis But with human brains he says the differences are vastly greater And trying to keep track of every one of the brains nearly  billion neurons may be unrealistic says Van Essen who is also principle investigator of the   an NIHfunded effort to map connections in the human brain But he says it is likely that researchers will be able to monitor smaller brains like those found in fruit flies or mice Scientists involved in creating the BRAIN initiative say it could provide some really helpful research tools even if it falls short of some goals Whats going on in the brain is like a conversation between thousands of neurons all at once says   director of the Brown Institute for Brain Science at Brown University So the tools we need are the ability to pick up many many cells at the same time And you have to pick them up so you can hear each conversation very clearly Donoghue says the ability to do that would make a big difference in his own efforts to allow paralyzed people to control a robotic arm as if it were their own We know enough to get crude approximations he says But if we really understood the brains language the brains code we could potentially recreate everything you do with your own arm The BRAIN initiative also could lead to a better understanding of Alzheimers disease and perhaps new treatments says   vice president for scientific affairs at the BrightFocus Foundation which supports research on Alzheimers disease macular degeneration and glaucoma For example Eakin says some research indicates that Alzheimers spreads from cell to cell in the brain using the connections between cells With a better understanding of those connections he says perhaps we can identify interventions that would stop that spreading
