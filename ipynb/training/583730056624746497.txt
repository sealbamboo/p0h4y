The end of winter is the official start of sunglass season as the sunlight lingers and people stay out and play longer This year sees a number of innovative lightweight polycarbonate models available for the athletically minded outdoors person from surfers to cyclists  Metalrimmed polycarbonate glasses with carabiner clips integrated into the end of each arm for attaching a neck strap Two straps are included one with a zippered pouch with a flotation insert that keeps it from sinking in water Available with prescription lenses  Finally no more wasted money on lost sunglasses An improvement over traditional addon straps like Croakies because the strap cannot slip off The pouch strap has room for keys and a credit card and its flotation pad assures it wont end up in the bottom of the ocean Oddly perhaps usefully the pouch can also be worn separately around your wrist as a wallet  None     Polarized hydrophobiccoated plasticrimmed polycarbonate surfer sunglasses from Brazil Include detachable arms that can be replaced by a snapin neck strap and a fogeliminating foam spacer that distances the glasses from skin  Great solution to the problem of eye protection in the waves longtime surfers are apparently prone to developing cataracts and pterygiums surfers eye a growth on the cornea The clever design lets you swap conventional temple arms for a snug adjustable nonstretchable strap the ends dockundock in a port located just in back of the rims The nonelastic head band keeps them snug but theyll float if they fall off The foam spacer stops fogging and provides shock absorption against the force of a wave Back on dry land remove the spacer and strap and put on a nose piece and arms  I tend to lose things so even though it comes with a classy zippered carry case I can see a missing arm or nose piece in my future     Polycarbonate sunglasses that collapse to half their size for easy storage and transport  Seems like a magic trick Ingenious design in which the wraparound frame and lenses slide on patented builtin microrails and spoon together Convenient for slipping into your pocket Five styles available in April A case and carabiner are included  None   to  nonpolarized  to  polarized   Polarized plasticrimmed runningcycling sunglasses with patented proprietary SR polymer lenses set in snapin halfrims Available with prescription lenses  Extremely crisp optics and antiglare capability The lens Kaenons longtime claim to fame warranted I think has a hydrophobic coating that beads up water and a scratchresistant and antireflective hard coating The halfrims allow good peripheral vision for cycling Holes in the back of each arm allow you to thread a strap or a string through although Kaenon does not sell one  At this price Id like to see an extra lens or two cyclists in particular need a clear lens when they get stuck riding at night but none is available  odd considering that the frame features an easy snapinout design    on Amazon
