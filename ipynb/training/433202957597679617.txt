As many as five patients died in Northern Irelands biggest hospital last year partly because they were not treated quickly enough in the emergency department a senior doctor has said  The patients died at the Royal Victoria Hospital Dr Tony Stevens said Dr Stevens is the medical director of the Belfast Health Trust which runs the hospital Health Minister Edwin Poots has told the NI Assembly the coroner might have to look into the deaths  Mr Poots said that the medical response could have been much better if more doctors had been available in each of the cases  The minister said he had only learned of the five deaths from a BBC Radio Ulster interview with Dr Stevens on Tuesday morning In that interview Dr Stevens also said that a shortage of doctors and patient waiting times had been significant factors in the deaths Speaking on BBC Radio Ulsters Nolan Show Dr Stevens said Specifically in terms of a contributory factor from people waiting longer than we would like them to be seen we believe last year five patients in the Royal When asked if that was five patients who had died or who had came to harm he replied Came to harm and some I mean some came to harm some died When he was asked how many of those had died he replied four or five These were very sick patients and they were very complex cases so those patients may have succumbed or died anyway this is a contributory factor he said  Dr Stevens said that some of the patients had not been seen for two or three hours after triage when they should have been seen within an hour This is something were not happy about that their care could have been better and their outcome might have been different but I need to reassure the public you cannot assume that five patients came into our hospital and for want of waiting longer than we would want to they died Dr Stevens said there was a shortage of doctors throughout Northern Ireland A significant contributory factor for us is that in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK were struggling to both train and recruit the high calibre of doctors we require  We have very excellent doctors working in the Belfast Trust very excellent doctors  but we need more of them  He added All these cases are serious adverse incidents They are reported up to the Health and Social Care Board they are all fully investigated and part of our policy is to inform the families so it is my assumption that all the families are fully aware of this but I am double checking that  Garrett Martin deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing said they had raised staff concerns with management some  months ago He said the situation was very disturbing  We have many members who have approached us in very distressed states he said They are saying that they do not have the required staffing levels to provide safe and dignified care certainly its compromised  The physical environment where care is taking place is not adequate  Maeve Hully chief executive of the Patient Client Council said the whole health system had to be looked at I think whats currently happening is that were trying to fix bits so whatever the problem is today we try and fix that she said  I think everybody needs to take a step back and say lets look at the totality of the problems       On Monday Health Minister Edwin Poots   on the initial findings of a review set up after a major incident was declared at the Royal over a patient backlog The review by the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority RQIA found that not enough medics are available at times in the Royals emergency department to properly treat patients Mr Poots said it was disappointing In the assembly on Tuesday the SDLPs Fearghal McKinney asked whether there had been a coverup about ongoing pressures in the accident and emergency department at the Royal Victoria Hospital Mr McKinney referred to remarks made by Mr Poots following a serious incident at the emergency department in January that the pressure situation was a oneoff Mr Poots said he did not intend to engage in some kind of pingpong about peoples deaths Cathal OHoisin of Sinn Fin asked the minister if he would apologise to the families of the five patients who had died Mr Poots said he certainly would express my sympathies He said he attended the RVH on the morning after the major incident was declared and I spoke to staff and  I took my actions on the basis of speaking to staff nothing less or nothing more In June    who had been treated at the hospital in the previous eight weeks were recalled after concerns were raised by medical staff about possible cases of misdiagnosis  At the time Dr Stevens said there were no immediate concerns about the patients wellbeing  In March of  an   apparently died unnoticed on a trolley in the hospitals AE After that incident Dr Stevens said the quality of care given by doctors and nurses was not a concern The issue of waiting times is explored in a BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight programme being shown on BBC One at  GMT on Tuesday During the programme reporter Declan Lawn tells Health and Social Care Board chief executive John Compton that they have obtained figures that show that waiting times have contributed to two deaths in Northern Ireland In response Mr Compton said Serious adverse incidents in my experience are a combination of events  They may have time aspects to them they may have diagnostic aspects to them they may have classification aspects to them they may have judgement decision making aspects to them What we have is a very robust process that looks at serious adverse incidents
