The Studio MDR offers Pilatesinspired  meaning generally tougher  workouts called the Lagree Method using a pretty complicated machine called a Megaformer It is indeed a fullbody workout and a strenuous one but its low to noimpact  perfect for people with knee or IT band injuries or other reasons not to jump and run around The standard class is  moves in  minutes I really appreciate those shortduration exercises No matter how bad it gets it doesnt last too long   Washington Blvd Marina del Rey and  Washington Blvd Culver CityÂ   Despite her constant patter to keep everyone inspired the attentive helpful teacher Dana Goodman Sands made sure I wasnt fumbling to figure out where to put arms and legs or which part of the Megaformer should hold my feet at any moment Its a welcoming studio that makes sure no one is stumbling to figure out what to do  The Megaformer has more gizmos and options for body placement than the traditional Pilates reformer equipment from which it descends Students with experience could move from one exercise to the next quickly which makes the workout that much more draining But even a newbie breaks a good sweat I took the basic Total Body class which required plenty of strength and endurance it was as the teacher promised a lungeheavy class that required balance and coordination There are some upperlevel classes that only accept experienced students  Dont let the sweet pinkandwhite decor fool you This is a nononsense place No chatter among students everyone was purposeful At one point the teacher said This shouldnt feel good No kidding   for an introductory class otherwise  per class with various packages available Wear those grippy toe socks and bring water and a small towel
