And so, another working week will soon draw to a close. This is, you may recall, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans. Our agenda is rather modest. We intend to escort Mrs. Pharmalot to the .  in our ‘Let’s-see-them-before-they-die’ concert series, schmooze with friends and keep the short people gainfully occupied. But what about you? With holidays approaching, this is a splendid time to open the purse strings and boost the economy or make plans to catch up with those who matter most. Of course, it is always helpful to spend time tidying up around the castle or simply contemplate the state of the world, such as it is. Well, whatever you do, have a grand time, but be safe.
