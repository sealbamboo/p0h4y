Moms who feel guilty about going back to work can give themselves a break  a new study suggests their kids may do better once they start kindergarten than children of women who stayed home The effects are strongest for lowincome kids And in wealthy families the older wisdom may hold true  the kids of working moms did not fare as well as children of athome moms Its only one study and it contradicts a large body of older work But the researchers at Boston College say its one of the first to look at stcentury moms and kids Moms going back to work when children are still babies may affect the children differently in contemporary society because there are so many more working women today with greater responsibility for their families income said Caitlin McPherran Lombardi of Boston College who led the study Different cultural attitudes more readily available and higherquality child care and more fathers participating in childrearing are other possible reasons for the difference Lombardi and colleagues looked at data from a survey that started with  children born in the year  Moms reported whether they had jobs either fulltime or parttime when the babies were  months old and again at two years Then the children were tested when they entered kindergarten and their teachers were surveyed About a third   percent  of the mothers said they were not working for pay for the first two years of the childs life Another  percent took jobs or started back to work when the kids were ages  months to  years while  percent went back to work before the baby was  months old The lower the income the better the children did if their mothers were working the survey found Highquality childcare may explain it Lombardis team wrote in the journal Development Psychology published by the American Psychological Association For middleclass families there didnt seem to be much difference between kids of stayathome moms and those who worked while in the upperincome brackets the children of moms who did not do paid work fared better in kindergarten than the children of working mothers Our findings suggest that children from families with limited economic resources may benefit from paid maternal leave policies that have been found to encourage mothers employment after childbearing Lombardi said The US has very limited policies on guaranteeing mothers or fathers time off after having children All that is legally required is the  weeks provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act and that time off does not have to be paid France guarantees three years Britain guarantees more than a year and Canada guarantees one year
