For more than five years Phyllis Edelstein managed to care for her husband Richard in their Long Island home as his dementia slowly progressed She felt fortunate to have found and to be able to pay for a livein couple to help her But last fall he was becoming more negative about things like showering she told me Thered be flareups of anger She saw her husband a retired dentist try to strike his hired helper one day and she was startled as they watched a Western together to see him jump up and lunge toward the TV as if he intended to beat up the bad guy It reached the point where I was uncertain being alone with him on weekends she said In January she moved Dr Edelstein  into a nearby assisted living facility He seemed to be settling in though he did once hit another resident But one Saturday last spring he just lost it Mrs Edelstein said A tremendous physical outburst He broke planters upended furniture pulled a closet door off its hinges Dr Edelstein was found to have a urinary tract infection long known to cause suddenly aggressive or bizarre behavior in dementia patients But although his infection was treated he hasnt regained his previous level of function He remains in a hospital psychiatric unit where doctors are trying to adjust his medications so that he is calm but not somnolent Lets be clear physically aggressive behavior arises in a sizable minority of dementia patients  a German study of nursing home patients published last year    but those most endangered are the people with dementia themselves and their caregivers It is irrational   near a residential neighborhood as some Minnesotans did a few years back as though its elderly residents would break out and menace passersby But violent behavior presents a particularly knotty problem for families They know their loved ones with dementia generally dont intend to cause harm Yet when confused fearful angry or in pain they may kick hit bite throw or shove  
 A Montana woman named June recently told me that her husband diagnosed with Alzheimers three years ago was becoming more irritable and resistant  and sleeping with a loaded gun At his doctors insistence she and her sons removed his three firearms from the house a blow to a longtime hunter Yet Joe still carries a canister of pepper spray in his pocket when he leaves the house Aggressive behavior and fears that a person will harm himself or others are among   an Alzheimers Foundation of America survey found last year But facilities concerned about safety for their staff and other residents arent always willing to take on that challenge either Most of the time families and staff can use behavioral approaches to soothe aggressive responses said consultant Susan Gilster founder and former director of the Alois Alzheimer Center in Cincinnati She recalls a former resident who started yelling and swinging when aides tried to rouse him from bed at  am Facilities have their routines but this centers motto was person before task Ms Gilster said The person is more important The task eventually gets done The man did fine when allowed to sleep until  then given a light breakfast Some men at the facility didnt get shaved until afternoon if that made their day go more smoothly  Why fight over these things Nobody wins Ms Gilster said Allow people to do what they want to do and a lot of these behaviors go away The Alzheimers Foundation of America provides   and also cautions caregivers to look for medical problems  infection pain depression  that can cause people who cant describe their symptoms to act out The environment  crowds noise disrupted routines  matters too They cant handle that much stimulation and it upsets them Ms Gilster said Medications to control aggression and other problem behaviors particularly antipsychotics like olanzapine trade name Zyprexa quetiapine Seroquel or risperidone Risperdal represent a last resort These have serious side effects and have been shown to increase the risk of death the Food and Drug Administration requires black box warnings on their packaging Still in some circumstances where it becomes a question of safety of the patient himself the family or staff the other residents some of these medications are a possibility said Dr Ronald Petersen director of the Mayo Clinics Alzheimers Disease Research Center He cautioned however that we have to frequently reassess the need for them Dementia symptoms shift over time The drugs may be useful now and not needed in two or three months he said If you are thinking that these are a demanding and sometimes heartbreaking set of responses  ceaselessly trying to control an ailing persons environment to adapt the way you communicate to consider dangerous drugs  well yes The public generally thinks of dementia in terms of memory loss sometimes thats the least of the problems These are difficult decisions Dr Petersen acknowledged Theres no easy solution Phyllis Edelstein mourning the man she has known since a blind date  years ago is considering where he can be cared for when the hospital releases him He cant return to his previous facility Were trying to see what our next step is she said She has yet to figure it out
