Every week Dr Michael Poshkus visits the John J Moran Medium Security prison in Cranston RI to see patients infected with hepatitis C Until recently their only treatment option was a weekly injection in the stomach for at least a year It worked less than half the time and caused debilitating side effects But everything has changed Drug maker AbbVie   Monday for a new hepatitis C treatment that combines several drugs and can cure the disease in a matter of weeks or a few months The news caps a year of medical milestones for the estimated   including   who are chronically infected with this viral liver disease Yet most of the hepatitis C   cost tens of thousands of dollars That puts them out of reach for many inmates and threatens to break prison health care budgets On a recent day a Moran inmate named Louis shows up for his appointment with Poshkus and settles onto the exam table NPR agreed to not use his last name in this story Louis is worried that after hes released in  he might not be able to get a job if people know his history Poshkus tells Louis his liver shows signs of damage from hepatitis C but treating it now will prevent further damage If a medical review committee from the prison approves his case Louis will take a drug called   One pill a day for  weeks But   and patients have to take it in combination with another expensive drug The prison simply cant afford to treat everyone who is sick right now so the review committee  made up of prison health officials and local doctors who specialize in treating hepatitis C  decides who will get the drug prioritizing the sickest patients Louis figures that now that hes a candidate for the treatment hell be high on the list It kind of brings tears to your eye you know he says because finally its going to be over with Louis is  and hes served a lot of time for crimes he committed while dealing or doing drugs Hes had hepatitis C nearly half his life He knows the treatment is expensive and that some taxpayers might not like the idea of footing a prisoners bill We are still somebodys father daughter mother Louis says And time to time you will hear people say Well theyre bad people this and that But until it happens to somebody in their family its a different ballgame Besides Louis asks isnt it better to treat inmates while theyre a captive audience So many inmates already struggle with addiction and if they end up shooting drugs and sharing needles when they get out they could spread the disease to others But beyond the public health argument theres a legal one The Constitution guarantees prisoners the same medical care thats standard in the community The trouble is that standard of care changed practically overnight   director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections says he still hasnt figured out how to pay for it The advent of these new treatments for hepatitis C came like a monsoon on a calm summer day Wall says We didnt see it coming When Wall submitted this years prison budget to Rhode Islands General Assembly he didnt know the new hepatitis treatment would cost nearly  per inmate Now he faces some impossible math Hundreds of inmates under his care have hepatitis C many with advanced liver disease But his entire health care budget barely tops  million Prisons across the country are facing the same dilemma according to   of the National Hepatitis Corrections Network a group that advocates better hepatitis prevention testing and treatment in prisons and jails Most facilities Feffer says are simply waiting for something to give Even in systems where those drugs are being used there are still tight controls on access he says and theyre not being used in a wide variety of people or universally by any means Treating these inmates could make a big dent in the epidemic Feffer says Finding the money to do it is another story
