Motivating children to stop playing and help out with chores isnt exactly an easy sell as most parents and teachers will attest But how you ask can make all the difference psychologists say If you say something like Please help me the kids are more likely to keep playing with their Legos But ask them Please be a helper and theyll be more responsive researchers report Wednesday in the journal   Being called a helper makes kids feel like theyre embodying a virtue says   a psychologist at the University of California San Diego and one of the researchers behind the study Its really important to all of us to be good people Bryan says Helping is nice but helpers are good people In the study experimenters rounded up around  preschoolers and divided them into two groups One half got a talk about helping while the other half heard about being helpers Then we got the kids playing with some really fun toys Bryan says While the children were playing an experimenter gave them various opportunities to lend a hand Preschoolers who got the talk about being helpers actually dropped their toys to offer aid  percent more often than kids who heard a lesson about helping The phenomenon isnt unique to kids In a previous study Bryan found that asking grownups How important is it to you to be a voter was more likely to motivate them to get to the polls than asking them about the importance of voting Interestingly Bryan says Nounbased appeals to not cheat are also more effective than a verbbased approach Sure you may not want to cheat  but you  dont want to see yourself as a cheater Still when dealing with kids adults should be careful not to take the approach too far Bryan says In some cases it can set kids up to fall harder if they fail Helping isnt something you can fail at Bryan says But drawing is An earlier   from Stanford University found that kids who were told they were good drawers versus good at drawing were much harder on themselves when they thought they had created bad artwork When adults put labels on kids  whether its helper drawer or something else  the childs identity and selfworth becomes entangled with the label says   a psychologist at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign who led the drawing study Later down the line when they encounter difficulties thats going to be a lot more painful he says When it comes to behavior thats skillbased Cimpian says parents might do better to use verbs instead of nouns For example instead of telling your little Picasso that shes a great artist he says Say Wow you spent a lot of time on that It looks great  And dont sweat the verbnoun choice   much he says Its not that one exposure to a noun phrase will forever make a child afraid of failing Still theres no question that children soak up subtleties in language for clues in how to live the scientists say Adults frequently talk to kids about being a good boy or a bad boy a good girl or a bad girl Bryan says And kids notice
