
 I agree wholeheartedly with the Tufts nutrition professor Alice H Lichtensteins   in which she writes Particularly in an era when dietary restraint is not our strong suit returning to butter and fatty cuts of meat may likewise return us to the high rates of heart disease we had decades ago  Shes talking about the   to a metaanalysis published last month in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine saying that there was   Even if the study is sound  and there are scientists who dispute that   the message should still be that a healthy diet consists of real as opposed to processed food with an emphasis on plantbased foods though not necessarily to the exclusion of animal fats  This week I decided to work with both I made quiches those old vegetarian mainstays I used butter in my crusts but I also used wholewheat flour and eggs milk and cheese in the custard The amounts of cheese were moderate  I have seen recipes that call for as much as eight ounces of cheese and I have no idea where all that cheese could fit  and there is no cream The real focus of these savory pies is the produce that goes into them  My quiches are delicious vehicles for vegetables Right now this means fat spears of asparagus and sweet spring onions green garlic and lush bunches of spinach I also slipped in a few other vegetables that we can get yearround in the supermarket like cabbage and red peppers I used lots of scallions too but they were fat ones from the farmers market not the thin scallions from the supermarket though they work too you just need more of them  These tarts have everything necessary for a satisfying main dish  protein from the dairy delicious vegetables cooked in olive oil with fresh herbs and a little bit of indulgence in the presence of an almost classic French pastry though with a nutty wholewheat twist  This dough made with half wholewheat flour has a nutty rich flavor that works well for a savory tart  Spinach is plentiful and gorgeous this time of year and slow cooking makes even the blandest red peppers sweet  Seasonal onions and a winter stalwart cabbage make a deliciously sweet filling  An underappreciated vegetable celery is the star of this tart  Roasting asparagus makes it succulent even when its hidden inside a quiche
