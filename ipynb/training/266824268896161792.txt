The public health world has waited for the results for more than a year After a halfbillion dollars in RD would the frontrunner malaria vaccine protect the toppriority targets young infants The results are disappointing The vaccine  called   for its various molecular components  reduced infants risk of malaria by about a third To be precise malaria was  percent less frequent among  infants between  and  months old who got the vaccine compared to controls The risk of severe malaria was  percent lower The infants got three vaccine shots over three months The news was announced Friday at a meeting in South Africa and   online by the   It was a letdown after the first results from the largest malaria vaccine trial  involving nearly  children in seven African countries A year ago researchers   the vaccine lowered malaria incidence by  percent among children ages  to  months The vaccine reduced their incidence of severe malaria by  percent Malaria experts hoped the efficacy would be as high in young infants The World Health Organizations goal is a vaccine effective enough to be added to the Expanded Immunization Program for infants The main issue from WHO was Should we add this to the infant regimen Dr   of Albert Einstein College of Medicine said in an interview with Shots And for this vaccine the answer is probably no Thats disappointing but parasites are very good at avoiding our immune system Daily says and the malaria parasite resides in our blood where all our immune cells and blood proteins are So it has gotten particularly good at staying under the radar  chairman of research and development for vaccine sponsor   expects the new results will be met with skepticism and disappointment Everybody would have hoped for that number to be higher than  percent Slaoui told Shots But he still has a glasshalffull view of the results This is the second demonstration of a significant effect of the vaccine he says He points out that the vaccine reduced the incidence of malaria from  cases for every  infants among those in a control group to  cases GSK has invested  million in the RTSS vaccine and Laoui says the company expects to spend another  million to get the vaccine licensed He says the company will file for licensure with the   within the next few months  if it has the support of   The main Gatessupported sponsor the   also seems undeterred Malaria is so prevalent in these African kids Dr   of the MVI told Shots that even a modest protection translates into large public health impact just given the sheer numbers So the vaccine will reduce disease and it will save lives More than  million people get malaria each year   and  people die from it Most of the burden is in subSaharan Africa Still Kaslow says he cant predict whether RTSS will ever be widely deployed Sitting with the data we have in hand I cant answer that question he says The honest answer is we wont know until  Between now and then RTSS researchers will try to figure out why infants have a less robust immune response to the vaccine It could be one or more of several factors Infants immune systems are immature and less responsive to infections Antimalaria antibodies in their mothers blood may interfere with infants ability to make their own antibodies in response to the vaccine Perhaps the administration of other infant vaccines interferes with their ability to make antibodies to malaria antigens in the vaccine Investigators dont know how longlasting the vaccines protection is and how much difference a booster shot would make Beyond that researchers want to investigate whether the vaccines efficacy varies depending on the prevalence of malaria where they live Slaoui hypothesizes that the vaccine may be less effective among infants who live in areas where they are more likely to be bitten by malariainfected mosquitoes One would rationally expect when youre getting bitten three times a day by an infected mosquito the chance that one of these would break through the vaccines protection would be higher than if you have one bite per week or one per day Slaoui says There was a wide range of malaria prevalence among the  African sites where the vaccine was tested But so far the researchers havent parsed vaccine efficacy by the different sites That could have important implications for decisions about how or whether to deploy the vaccine An effectiveenough vaccine might tip the balance in areas where malaria has been suppressed over the past  years by heavy investments in insecticidetreated bed nets indoor spraying and use of effective antimalaria drugs Dr   helped test the vaccine in a district in Tanzania that used to be a highprevalence area and now is lowtomoderate Hes disappointed the vaccine didnt lower malaria by at least half in infants But he thinks it could still prevent malarias high fevers seizures anemia and death in a lot of African children Being a father from subSaharan Africa I have witnessed my own children suffer from several episodes of malaria Lusingu told Shots So I would highly encourage that this vaccine should be incorporated into other existing tools to control malaria That will be the subject of intense debate over the next few years says Dr   director of the global health group at the University of California San Francisco Because the efficacy is disappointing and there are still some questions about the duration of its protection those will be difficult discussions Feachem told Shots The best childhood vaccines are  percent protective But many argue that the perfect shouldnt be the enemy of the goodenough A clear failure is a clear failure and a  percent efficacy is you know a glass of champagne Feachem says But this lies in the middle because there are so many uncertainties Whatever the ultimate fate of the RTSS vaccine  or the  other malaria vaccines in the pipeline  Feachem says the results increase the urgency to develop new better insecticides against malariainfected mosquitoes and new classes of drugs to cure those who get infected and circumvent the parasites ability to evade the best current drugs
