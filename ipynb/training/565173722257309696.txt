With food as with fashion tastes change Today bread cubes dipped in a cheddar cheese fondue seems about as dated as bell bottoms Nutritional advice changes too Foods that were once touted as healthful can suddenly gain unsavory reputations and vice versa Sometimes a single study  and the media reports that go with it  can make or break a foods reputation says Dr David Heber chief of clinical nutrition at UCLA And sometimes all it takes is a few vocal experts with ulterior motives When you hear an expert raise alarms about a particular food Heber recommends considering the source Foods get vilified because food is never politically neutral he says At a time when everyone agrees that the American diet could use a serious upgrade certain foods make for easy scapegoats says Melinda Johnson a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and a nutritional lecturer at Arizona State University in Tempe We tend to zone in on specific foods because people want simple tips But she adds good nutrition is too complicated for a simple blame game On closer inspection some foods with unhealthy reputations are ready for a little redemption Here are some supposed dietary offenders that are more healthful than you might think  Perhaps more than any other food eggs have been caught in the revolving door of nutritional advice In  a muchpublicized Canadian study concluded that eating a single egg yolk every day was almost as bad for the heart as smoking But that study drew sharp and immediate criticism from cardiologists and nutritionists alike Among other things the researchers admitted that they had only a vague idea of how many yolks subjects were actually eating Eggs are now largely back in favor Eggs are a lot healthier than people realize says Maria Luz Fernandez professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Connecticut in Storrs She says that egg yolks contain highly absorbable lutein and zeaxanthin antioxidants that are also antiinflammatory and the white is loaded with highquality protein Besides she adds the oftenmaligned cholesterol in eggs seems to have little effect on a persons levels of cholesterol or triglycerides An average person can have one or two eggs a day with no worries Fernandez says Eggs can be an especially smart way to start the day Heber says Theres a lot of evidence that eating protein at breakfast is good for you he says It will satisfy hunger more than a cup of coffee and a bagel  When even Dominos offers a glutenfree pizza crust you know that gluten  protein found in wheat and some other grains  has a serious image problem Many people believe that gluten can sap their energy cloud their thinking and above all mess with their digestive system But for most people those fears seem to be misplaced Heber says By latest estimates about  of Americans or even fewer have celiac disease a condition that makes any bit of gluten a serious threat to health Some unknown number of people are sensitive to gluten in other ways but most people can eat and digest gluten without problems Heber says Americans eat so poorly that they have a lot of gastrointestinal problems he says A lot of people think they have gluten sensitivity but they really have irritable bowel syndrome Wholewheat breads pastas and cereals are a good source of fiber and vitamins Johnson says and glutenfree options dont always pack the same nutritional punch Its certainly possible to eat a junky glutenfree diet she says  Steaks chops and even burgers can be a healthful diet choice Johnson says As she explains reasonable portions of lean meat can provide protein iron zinc and other nutrients without much downside A  study of nearly  European adults found no evidence that eating  ounces of red meat or more every day could shorten anyones life That same study did suggest that large amounts of cured processed meats could lead to an early death another reminder that there is such a thing as too much bacon For his part Heber is reluctant to say much positive about red meat mainly because its so easy to go overboard He notes that a slab of prime rib at a restaurant can contain more than  calories enough to blow up just about anyones daily budget He recommends avoiding cornfed beef because its loaded with omega  fatty acids that can promote inflammation Lean grassfed beef is a much smarter choice he says Coffee is the secondmost popular beverage in America after water but a lot of people still think of it as a vice If so its one vice thats actually good for you A February study in the journal Circulation found that people who drank three to five cups of coffee each day actually had a lower risk of heart trouble than people who didnt drink coffee Previous studies suggest that regular coffee drinkers also enjoy protection from Type  diabetes  If they havent been slathered in butter and sour cream or infused with oil from a deepfat frier white potatoes can be valuable little packets of nutrition Johnson says She notes that theyre good sources of fiber vitamin C potassium and other nutrients especially if you eat the skin too Some nutritionists warn that potatoes can cause a surge in blood sugar but Johnson says thats only likely to be a problem when potatoes are eaten by themselves When potatoes are combined with some protein and vegetables the effect on blood sugar is much less dramatic We dont eat individual foods she says We eat meals
