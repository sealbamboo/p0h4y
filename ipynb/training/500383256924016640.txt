Talk about a commitment to her sport Bethany Hamilton lost her entire left arm to a shark attack while surfing  and within a month was back on her board riding the waves She was  At  Hamilton still competitively surfs the seas and like every professional athlete there is a behindthescenes workout regimen that keeps her strong sturdy and flexible She also has a new book Body and Soul thats all about motivating young girls to live healthier lives I wasnt sure that I was even able to surf with one arm and I had developed a fear of sharks I remember lying in the hospital room and was visited by someone who had lost his leg to a shark attack and he actually had learned how to surf again after losing his leg so I thought if he can do it with one leg I can do it with one arm  All my friends surfed and my whole family surfed It was almost getting back to normal life I think God had given me this passion for surfing for a reason and I was thankful to give it another go At first I started off on a long board When youre that young youre so determined and resilient so I just really set my mind to it There were definitely some frustrating times but my parents would just give me a hug and keep encouraging me  Both my parents were supportive My dad was really encouraging and he came up with a handle on my surfboard so I could duck dive and push myself under the waves My mom was a little hesitant though Ive developed a real passion for taking care of myself and focusing on posture and spinal alignment I do a lot of stretching that focuses on this and some highintensity floor workouts I like to focus on good techniques and doing things properly Having one arm I like to focus on evening out my body Its one of my favorite things to work out with because I can travel with it Im on the road about six months a year and its my travel buddy We have some easy userfriendly workouts in the book  My friends and I will go to the park and set up our TRXes on trees and have a workout in the park Its nice to be outside with my buddies for a workout I run a little bit but not long distances because its not the best for surfing I do more shortdistance running and sprints and stairs more anaerobic and powerdevelopment stuff and flexibility as well Your body gets into weird positions when youre surfing so its important to be flexible but also strong and fast
