Pakistan is one of the remaining corners of the world where polio still lingers Last year the government declared a national emergency and with the help of international institutions embarked on an aggressive vaccination campaign So far the results have been promising The number of new polio cases is about a third of last years total of  But the new campaign like previous efforts hasnt been able to overcome one critical problem getting into parts of Pakistans lawless tribal regions along the border with Afghanistan to vaccinate the children there About  percent of Pakistans polio cases can be traced back to certain areas there primarily   the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and neighboring   Quetta in Baluchistan is also difficult to enter says Pakistans point person for polio   The Taliban alQaida and other Islamist groups are based throughout the region and its volatile and dangerous This is a traditionally tribal society Wazir Ali says And no one from outside can access those communities because of their very very strict tribal laws In certain areas we have not been able to access children for more than three years because of military operations because of the American drone strikes  because of the reaction to what the Americans and other countries are doing in Afghanistan Wazir Ali says In July the Taliban flatout banned any polio teams from entering North and South Waziristan until the US drone attacks stopped Rumors about the polio vaccine are rife Itll make the children sterile it contains the AIDS virus the vaccinators are really CIA agents Plus its difficult enough getting into these areas And the population  mostly ethnic Pashtuns  is highly mobile People often leave the tribal area to escape the danger or to find work and they take the polio virus with them Checkpoints have also been set up on major thoroughfares and at railway stations across the country to catch the children from the Pashtun areas who would not otherwise be inoculated At one checkpoint outside of Islamabad yearold Khan Wali scrutinizes every car that goes by to see if there is a child under  Police officers stand next to him to make sure the car stops Wali asks parents if their babies have been vaccinated and he checks the childs finger If theres a blue mark on the nail then the child has been recently inoculated If not Wali pulls a vial out of a blue cooler and tips the vaccine into the childs mouth The whole thing takes less than a minute Many children are malnourished and arent very healthy so their immune systems are very weak To be fully protected from polio the children will need several doses of the vaccine There are already  polio campaigns scheduled each year yet Elias Durry who leads Pakistans polio eradication program for the World Health Organization says he knows theyre missing so many children When you look into different parts of the country each time we have like  million children at one point that we are not able to access Durry says And for every child that exhibits polio paralysis there are more than  carrying and transmitting the virus Health workers monitor the progress of vaccination campaigns by looking for the virus in community sewages Far fewer areas are testing positive for polio as the international campaign in Pakistan takes effect  but not the city of   Pakistans fourthlargest city which sits right next Islamabad is considered a highrisk area for polio and it usually tests positive Still there have been only three cases of polio discovered in the city over the past couple of years Recently a yearold Pashtun boy was diagnosed here After that teams of vaccinators spread through the Pashtun slums in Rawalpindi and neighboring Islamabad The slums are congested and filthy Theres no sanitation and the children are in rags The vaccinators go house to house looking for children and delivering extra doses of the polio vaccines They examine the writing left by vaccinators on an old wooden door And they doublecheck the childrens fingernails for the telltale mark that they were given the additional doses Then they move on to the next house scrupulously tracking down every child The vaccinators are three women with their faces covered with veils They carry a cooler containing the polio vaccine They say many of the mothers ask a similar question They are asking questions repeatedly Why are you again and again administering the polio drops  Khadeja Kubra who works for the health department says We have to tell them there is a polio case in Rawalpindi and we will   come back in a week It can be dangerous work Some vaccinators have been attacked Another was killed in a Pashtun slum in the southern city of Karachi this summer UNICEF has trained and recruited more than    to educate families about the polio virus encourage people to vaccinate their children and dispel rumors about the vaccine These socalled social mobilizers talk to students womens groups and in particular religious leaders who have an enormous influence in the community Its a painstaking job but the health workers know they have to repeatedly vaccinate every single one of Pakistans  million children if the country wants to eradicate polio once and for all
