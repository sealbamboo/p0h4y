Lauren Kay has never met her therapist in person The yearold entrepreneur found it difficult to take time off work for appointments So she started seeing a psychotherapist online Its definitely been different she says Kay who lives in New York found her counselor through an online therapy service called   When its time for an appointment all she has to do is log in to the website click a link and start video chatting The format works well for her It felt like Skyping with a friend she says And when I was at my parents house the other day I got to show my therapist my cat Now she says she prefers these video sessions to traditional therapy And shes not alone in that thinking More and more people  especially millennials  are trying Web therapy And mental health care providers are increasingly taking their services online Aside from Pretty Padded Room theres       and plenty of others Theres a real demand for this sort of therapy says   a licensed mental health counselor and the founder of Pretty Padded Room which is based in New York Our target market is women in their s and s she says People from all over the world can sign up We have clients in Belgium Saudi Arabia Korea Arthur says Its been amazing Those seeking help can choose from nine licensed family therapists and clinical social workers It costs  for a minute session or less if you sign up for a monthly plan The company doesnt accept insurance but Arthur says some clients have gotten their insurance providers to reimburse them for sessions Some   suggest that therapy online can be as effective as it is face to face We have a lot of promising data suggesting that technology can be a very good means of providing treatment says   a clinical psychologist who helps develop health care policy for the American Psychological Association I dont think we have all the answers yet Bufka says There are cases where therapy online may not work she notes Therapists usually dont treat people with severe issues online especially if they are contemplating suicide Thats because in case of a crisis its much harder for online therapists to track down their patients and get them help Privacy is another concern Instead of Skype many online therapy companies choose to use teleconferencing software with extra security Arthur at Pretty Padded Room says her company takes measures to protect her clients records But it can be hard for people to know exactly how secure the website theyre using really is Bufka says And then theres the issue of licensing Family therapists mental health counselors and clinical social workers are licensed to practice by individual state boards But its unclear whether a practitioner who lives in one state can or should treat someone who lives elsewhere Wed like to see a little more mobility and flexibility with that because certainly for licensed psychologists the standards are pretty similar across state lines Bufka says Perhaps she adds therapists could get a special certification that would allow them to practice in multiple states or countries The APA released a   for online therapy last year It encourages online practitioners to take care protecting clients data and to familiarize themselves with state and international laws But it doesnt resolve these issues Right now some therapists try to dodge the licensing issue by calling themselves life coaches which doesnt require state licensing The problem with that Bufka says is anyone can call himself or herself a coach Those seeking therapy online should ask potential therapists about their training she says Policymakers are going to have to sort out these legal ambiguities sooner rather than later says Arthur of Pretty Padded Room Ultimately its about reaching people she says We have to meet clients where they are And if theyre at home and theyre not feeling so hot why would you deny them treatment Therapists have to keep up with the times says   founder of The Angry Therapist Its kind of like bookstores and Blockbuster Everything is shifting online The same thing will happen with mental health In addition to therapy from a group of licensed therapists and life coaches that Kim trains those who sign up on his website get daily motivational emails and access to group sessions via Google Hangouts The service grew out of Kims personal blog Hes a licensed marriage and family therapist in California and he sees clients both online and in person But he says some of his clients actually feel more comfortable chatting on Skype than they do talking in person It helps that communication technology is getting better and better Kim says When the Internet was on dialup and stuff it was really hard to do something like this But now you can literally see a teardrop
