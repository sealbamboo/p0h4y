If youre confused about the latest recommendations for treating high blood pressure take heart Doctors are confused too On Wednesday a panel of specialists called the   published guidelines saying that many people over  dont need to start taking medications to lower blood pressure until its above  millimeters of mercury If doctors follow the advice theyll be less likely to prescribe blood pressure drugs to people at milder risk for heart problems Why Theres a lack of conclusive evidence that using drugs to get pressures lower than that will reduce a persons risk of heart attack and stroke  or increase life expectancy Thats a substantial change from the current recommendation for all adults to get their   the first number below  which is endorsed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology two big medical professional societies People with diabetes or kidney disease were told to go even lower to  In the new guidelines the systolic goal for adults under  remains at  but it wipes out the lower target for people with diabetes and kidney disease You may wonder why there are dueling guidelines when the Joint National Committee was convened by the National Institutes of Health five years ago to come up with a single national standard Well theres a story behind that Earlier this year the NIH decided it was going to get out of the   handing it over to the professional societies That left the Joint National Committee orphaned Figuring that joining up with the AHA and the ACC would substantially delay release the group published its own   in   the journal of the American Medical Association Producing guidelines in the United States has become increasingly more complicated and contentious one of three   accompanying the guidelines noted Indeed one reason that NIH may have bailed is because the process has become so politicized The Obama administration came under   from the American Cancer Society and patient groups for a  decision to raise the recommended age to start mammograms to  And in  the Infectious Diseases Society of America was sued by the state of Connecticut for recommending against longterm antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease This is a funny situation says   a cardiologist at the Yale School of Medicine Whats good here is that theyre really adhering to evidence and being honest about what we dont know I think in earlier guidelines theres been this false sense of security People with very   like  or  systolic and above clearly benefit from aggressive treatment with medication to lower blood pressure Krumholz says But the evidence shows that people with moderately elevated blood pressure dont gain the same reduction in risk of heart attacks and stroke even if they manage to lower their numbers We should be going after people with marked elevation to make sure theyre all getting treated Krumholz told Shots People with mild risk you have to be honest with them and say I dont know if Im doing much for you  The new guidelines also reflect the fact that after a point it becomes increasingly difficult to push blood pressure lower with drugs Its easy to bring someone from  to  says   a nephrologist at Virginia Commonwealth University and presidentelect of the American Society For Hypertension But if youre on three drugs and youre at  you may need three more drugs to get from  to  The low odds of making that big a change can discourage both patients and doctors Its a daunting task Sica tells Shots Having more reasonable evidencebased goals may encourage people to work with their doctors to come up with a liveable plan including healthful eating exercise and perhaps less medication and blood pressure monitoring But for now patients and doctors will have to decide what guidelines they like best Its a conundrum Sica notes adding that it will also affect how insurance companies rate doctors based on performance and how they reimburse Do they really think insurance companies are going to accept  over  If this isnt confusing enough for you stay tuned Next year the AHA and the ACC are scheduled to release their own updated guidelines
