Overweight and obese adults who use diet drinks to help them lose weight need to take another look at the food they eat according to researchers who reported Thursday that those people ate more food calories than overweight people who drank sugarsweetened beverages The scientists writing in the American Journal of Public Health did not say the dieters should give up on no and lowcalorie drinks rather they said the dieters should look at what else theyre consuming especially sweet snacks to find other ways to modify their diets Although overweight and obese adults who drink diet soda eat a comparable amount of total calories as heavier adults who drink sugary beverages they consume significantly more calories from solid food at both meals and snacks Sara Bleich lead author of the study said in a statement Bleich is an associate professor in the Bloomberg School health policy and management department at Johns Hopkins University She and her colleagues used data about people age  and older from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  a populationbased survey that collects information on many healthrelated topics The issue is important because the consumption of diet beverages has increased from  of adults in  to  today and the beverage industry has said it is responding to the obesity epidemic in part by producing more low and nocalorie choices for consumers A common weightmanagement strategy is to switch from what are commonly called sugarsweetened drinks to low or nocalorie drinks The trade group the American Beverage Assn responded to the study with a statement noting that diet beverages have been shown to be effective in weight management Numerous studies have repeatedly demonstrated the benefits of diet beverages  as well as lowcalorie sweeteners which are in thousands of foods and beverages  in helping to reduce calorie intake Losing or maintaining weight comes down to balancing the total calories consumed with those burned through physical activity the statement said The study published Thursday says the evidence from longterm studies is mixed It also showed that total caloric intake among adults who drank sugarsweetened beverages was higher than among those who drank diet beverages But it said that difference in calories was significant only for adults at healthy weights So on a typical day adults drinking sugarsweetened beverages consumed  calories those drinking diet beverages consumed  calories Among dietbeverage drinkers  total caloric consumptions increased significantly by body weight with overweight and obese adults consuming more than healthyweight adults  calories and obese adults  calories consuming more than overweight adults  calories the researchers said Among those dietbeverage drinkers the consumption of food calories went up with each bodyweight category the researchers said They said that about  in  overweight or obese people drinks diet beverages Thats about twice the average among healthyweight adults It was interesting that dietbeverage consumption appeared to be protective for adults at a healthy weight the researchers said adding that those people ate  fewer calories from food on a typical day Overweight and obese people who drank diet beverages ate  and  calories more respectively the study said The researchers noted that their study relied on single hour dietary recalls which could mean unreliable or underreported results The Beverage Assn cited several studies about diet drinks and weight loss including one that suggested the difficulty of determining any causality The study authors also said they can only address associations not causes The trade group also quoted a paper published in Nutrition Bulletin calling food and drinks sweetened with aspartame an effective way to maintain and lose weight without losing the palatability of the diet The Public Health journal article could not conclude why heavier people who drank diet beverages ate more food but the researchers suggested that the brains sweet sensors may no longer provide a reliable gauge to whats been consumed marymacveanlatimescom r
