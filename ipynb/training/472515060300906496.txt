Its almost summer More skin will be visible on and off the beach And more tattoos Will they be an inspiration Or a warning Stuart Yellen wanted to be rid of his tattoo almost as soon as he got it and a week later the ink began to drip down his arm Eleven years later theres still something that looks like a bruise or a birthmark ringing his left arm People should really think before they get tattoos they dont Yellen  of Woodland Hills said after one of the monthly treatments he gets at UCLA Just as the hangover is worse than the partying its tougher and more expensive to be rid of a tattoo than to get one Job requirements or life changes  the name of an ex inked on a shoulder say  can make removal seem necessary said Dr Ray Jalian a laser cosmetic dermatologist at UCLA Medical Center And tattooed makeup  eyeliner or lip liner most frequently  doesnt always work out as planned he said I see all the ones that have a smudge or a crooked lip line I do a lot of handholding then Jalian said Yellen got his tattoo a sort of tribal design in Palm Desert at a cousins urging I had apprehensions I had second thoughts Yellen said I wasnt drunk Yellen is benefiting from the latest laser procedure approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in  The picosecond technology delivers supershort energy bursts to the skin substantially shorter than the industry standard nanosecond equipment which replaced other techniques including abrasion and surgery The new picosecond technique can cut the number of treatments in half according to research thats been done with a small number of patients said Jalian who said he performed two unpaid clinical trials one for skin cancer and one for tattoos for Cynosure which makes the picosecond machine called PicoSure The PicoSure machine at UCLA cost  to  Jalian said Dr Suzanne Kilmer of Sacramento an expert in tattoo removal said dermatologists had hoped the picosecond machine would be more colorindependent meaning it wouldnt be more difficult to remove some colors than others So far that isnt the case though she expects more advances Dr Elizabeth McBurney a dermatologist in Lafayette La said I think it is an advance but I dont think its a home run It has marched us forward But I am not sure its worth the price tag Like Green she has yet to invest in a picosecond machine Patients cant look to insurance which will pay the same amount to take it off that they did to put it on Green said wryly Removal runs an average of  Jalian said and its difficult to know how many treatments a person will need adding that the last  of the tattoo can be the hardest to remove But he tells people to expect  to  treatments usually I tell people its quicker hurts less and is cheaper to get one than to remove one he said Gary Lask Yellens doctor said all kinds of people have had it with their body art  executives entertainers parents who drag in their tattooed children But with earlier versions of laser removal he said hed sometimes talk people out of removal That cute little rose I knew that would look better than the scar he said Easiest to remove are jailhousestyle drawings or letters  just one color not much ink and not very deep into the skin The more elaborate multicolored tattoos especially those with some white pigments pose challenges Jalian said In the treatment room at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Yellens left arm is numbed before Lask directs the red light over the inked areas the laser clicking as it goes The treatments  done monthly so the skin can heal  take just a few minutes and leave the skin slightly red and welty for a day or two Lask said The laser shatters the ink particles into tiny bits that mostly spread harmlessly through the immune system into the body or sometimes emerge through the skin in a blister Yellen hopes one day to have his old arm back As for his cousin He loves his tattoo and his looks perfect
