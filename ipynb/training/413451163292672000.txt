Ever since I can remember I always played sports Most people would say I wouldnt succeed but I proved them wrong by finding ways to make it work  by finding ways that helped me hear and put me in a position to succeed  Was it easy No but it was worth it   If you ask me what Im most proud of its not just playing football in the NFL its graduating from Troy High School and from UCLA with a political science degree I could have easily made excuses as to why I couldnt do my work and blamed it on not being able to hear well but I didnt  Some people ask me do I wish that I had normal hearing like everyone else and honestly looking back at my life now I would say no  Being hearingimpaireddeaf has made me who I am The struggle pain tears happiness and joy has put me in the position where I am today  Dont let adversity define who you are Let how you respond to diversity be who you are  Find a way No excuses  It will be worth it It was for me
