Ever since I can remember, I always played sports. Most people would say I wouldn't succeed, but I proved them wrong by finding ways to make it work -- by finding ways that helped me hear and put me in a position to succeed. , Was it easy? No, but it was worth it.  , If you ask me what I'm most proud of, it's not just playing football in the NFL; it's graduating from Troy High School and from UCLA with a political science degree. I could have easily made excuses as to why I couldn't do my work and blamed it on not being able to hear well, but I didn't. , Some people ask me, do I wish that I had normal hearing like everyone else, and honestly looking back at my life now, I would say no. , Being hearing-impaired/deaf has made me who I am. The struggle, pain, tears, happiness and joy has put me in the position where I am today. , Don't let adversity define who you are. Let how you respond to diversity be who you are. , Find a way., No excuses. , It will be worth it. It was for me.
