Pennsylvania Gov Tom Corbett may have been watching fellow Republican Gov John Kasich of Ohio who bypassed the Republican Legislature in his state this week to expand Medicaid As part of the Affordable Care Act states have the option to make coverage available to lowincome adults with the federal government picking up the entire tab for the first three years Only   so far have planned to do that starting Jan  and Pennsylvania has so far not been among them But Corbett is now canvassing the state touting his   plan which calls for accepting the federal funding to expand Medicaid with some caveats We need a medical insurance program thats designed for Pennsylvania One size does not fit all Corbett said at St Christophers Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia recently Healthy Pennsylvania would direct newly eligible people mostly lowincome adults without children into the health insurance exchange where they could buy private coverage Thats in contrast to how it works now where the state puts Medicaid patients into private managed care plans and sets the rates for what doctors and hospitals are paid Corbetts idea is to use the federal expansion funds to subsidize people buying individual plans instead Most important its not putting  more people into an entitlement program he said Its putting them in a program where they are invested in the program they are invested in their health care in a way where a person in Medicaid may not have that same personal investment he said Last month the federal government approved a   that allows new Medicaid recipients to shop for coverage on the insurance exchange The Arkansas decision shows that the feds are willing to let states be creative with the expanded program Corbetts plan differs from Arkansas though so federal approval isnt guaranteed Hed also change some current Medicaid benefits and include a jobtraining component The governor is looking for a way to draw down the federal money says   a professor of health law at the University of Kentucky Shes not surprised by Corbetts latest move The Legislature may or may not be on board but the governor recognizes a lot of federal money to be had that will likely save the state a lot of money in the long run she says When the Supreme Court gave the states the option last year to expand Medicaid many Republicans didnt have an appetite to do it no matter who paid the bill according to   a Republican lawmaker in Pennsylvania The Democrats in Harrisburg by and large support a fullblown Medicaid expansion he says The Republicans do not And were very very concerned about the cost But Baker doesnt view Corbetts plan as an expansion because of the shared responsibility element and it doesnt appear to be facing severe political backlash Democratic leaders worry Corbett is moving too slowly and say they want more details But some advocates for a full expansion are cautiously optimistic including   of Pennsylvanias Partnerships for Children While he would have preferred to see Medicaid expansion put on the table he says he was hopeful early on a plan would surface The whole plan isnt a done deal but the University of Kentuckys Huberfeld says one thing is clear Federal officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have signaled from the outset that theyre willing to work with states to give them maximum flexibility to expand Medicaid under their own terms
