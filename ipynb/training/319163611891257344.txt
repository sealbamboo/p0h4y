Retail therapy may be more than a quaint catch phrase  new research suggests that easing sadness may be just a purchase away Shopping to improve ones mood long derided as a temporary fix for the blues has been the subject of a string of new reports and surveys that suggest that shopping while sad may indeed help ease this feeling and minimize the impact of a looming stressful event More than half of Americans say they have shopped and spent money to improve their mood according to a survey released on Tuesday from Ebatescom Although more women admitted to this behavior with nearly  percent of women saying theyve engaged in socalled retail therapy some  percent of men attempted to shop their blues away While Ebates was not designed specifically for retail therapy shoppers the phenomenon is core to the companys model as a place where consumers can locate deals and cashback offers said Mark Moran Ebates senior vice president of marketing and distribution I think itd be fascinating in a future study to look at time of day and see if retail therapytype shopping happens most often in the afternoon or early evening and then we might change the type of deals that we highlight on the site then Moran added Among the  adults polled by TNS Global on behalf of Ebates in March more than half said they think online shopping provides better therapy than visiting physical store locations     Its really convenient Moran said explaining why he thought shoppers felt that way I dont have to drive anywhere If I have five minutes to shop I can do it right now I dont have to hop in a car Interestingly those with a household income of  or more were more likely to abstain from retail therapy than those on the opposite end of the income spectrum who make less than  and potentially have fewer bucks to spend Of those surveyed nearly four out of  women said retailtherapy improves a persons mood compared to about  percent of men     A   supports this theory In the first study people watched a sad video clip and then were given money to buy a snack Those who did were less sad afterward In the second study participants watched a sad clip and then were either instructed to go to a shopping site where they were told they could either browse for useful items or choose things to buy Those who were allowed to choose items to buy had lower sadness scores afterward When participants decided to purchase an item their levels of residual sadness fell as the purchasers benefited from the increased feeling of control However choosing not to buy did not reduce sadness The sadnessreducing benefits of choosing to buy cannot be explained by the distraction afforded by buying the pleasure associated with obtaining a new good or the possibility that people who choose to buy are fundamentally different than people who choose not to buy the Michigan study found Instead the benefits of choosing to buy were driven by increased feelings of control The studys authors also proposed that retail therapy has been viewed too negatively and argued that the practice may be an effective way to minimize lingering sadness Still its unclear whether potential financial impacts down the road outweigh the lift that shoppers feel at the time they make a purchase acknowledged the Michigan report Whether the increased control afforded by buying results in a loss of control later due to increased debt and reduced savings and thus counteracts the temporary benefits of retail therapy remains an important open question it concluded A separate report from Northwestern Universitys School of Management published last year looked at five experiments and found that the timing of a stressful event can impact whether people consume to distract themselves While consumers often shop to cope with stressful events they are more selective when buying to cope for future challenges such as buying supplies before an academic exam or preparing for a natural disaster than past events This proactive consumption provides people with more protection before a threat occurs which in turn minimizes the threats negative impact the study said But once consumers experience the threat theyre willing to latch onto a broader range of potential purchases to distract themselves It seems that consumers not only salt the sidewalk just in case there is a snowstorm but also know exactly what kind of salt to use at least until the snowstorm hits added the studys authors
