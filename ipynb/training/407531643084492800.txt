Tambra Momi has been eagerly awaiting the promise of guaranteed health insurance Since  she has battled   a rare and painful condition in which noncancerous tumors sprout throughout her body pressing against nerves Jobless and in a wheelchair Momi needs nine different drugs including one costing  a month to control the pain and side effects No insurer has been willing to cover her she says except a few that have taken her money and then refused to pay for her medications Yet her effort to sign up for the health laws coverage has been painful in its own way Momi who lives in Fort Mohave Ariz hasnt been able to complete an application on the federal HealthCaregov website Three attempts to submit an application over the phone havent panned out Once when she called back she says she was told they had no record of the application Another time officials told her they could see the application but couldnt open it I was so elated with this whole thing Momi  says about the health insurance marketplace Now Im praying to God that Ill be able to get something Enrollment has been open since Oct  but hitches such as those that Momi encountered have put many people behind schedule The next three weeks are critical for consumers keen on getting health coverage as soon as the health law allows it on Jan  People who want coverage by then need to sign up no later than Dec  Consumers can still enroll up to the end of March but their coverage will begin later For people in the states with wellfunctioning insurance websites such as California New York and Kentucky this appears to leave plenty of time But making the deadline could be dicier for people in Arizona and the  other states where HealthCaregov is the path to coverage Same goes in Oregon and Hawaii which have struggled to get their sites working On Sunday the government reported progress in improving HealthCaregov saying the site now allows more than  visits a day with the rate of timeouts or crashes reduced to below  percent Officials said repairs continue The technological trials for these websites have turned an enrollment period that was supposed to be a leisurely threemonth stroll into a lastminute sprint for millions of Americans The challenge ahead is you have a lot of people who need to get into the system says   an analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a Washington think tank that focuses on issues related to low and moderateincome people Within the Obama administration concern is great enough about accommodating everyone who wants coverage by the first of the year that   from its original date of Dec  Prompt enrollment is critical for people in several circumstances Some have no coverage either because they havent been able to afford it or like Momi because they have preexisting medical issues that led insurers to reject them in the past Some have insurance that is going to expire That group includes people whose health plans have been canceled and those in a highrisk pool that is closing For people with serious medical issues such as cancer patients in the middle of treatment the loss of coverage could be medically and financially devastating Sara Collins a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund a New York health care foundation predicts two waves of people will try to sign up for plans in the first half of December those who had tried to shop on the websites but were stymied by technological glitches and those who were able to look at plans but didnt settle on one For people who wait until the Dec  deadline  either by choice or because they encountered difficultiesinsurers will have just a week to process the applications before people can start filing claims Robert Laszewski an industry consultant says insurers generally need two weeks to add newly covered people to their computer systems The chances are were going to see lots of customer service problems he says Sandra Fox a psychiatric social worker in Pittsburgh has been trying to buy insurance through the marketplace since the day it opened at the beginning of October After many failed attempts she succeeded But HealthCaregov said she and her husband an artist arent eligible for a government subsidy while she believes they are Based on information she provided KHN calculated they are eligible for a  monthly subsidy She was told to mail a written appeal Despite sending it off Nov  her case remains unresolved Foxs husband goes to a pain clinic and uses medication for his   She fears if they arent enrolled in new insurance when their current policy lapses at the end of the year they will have to pay out of their own pockets It would be extremely expensive she says And nobody knows what accident they can be in tomorrow I dont think its wise to be without insurance for one day frankly Early mixups occurred in the launch of the last major federal health expansion the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit People were supposed to sign up by Dec   to start using the benefit when coverage began on Jan   But that turned out to not leave enough time for Medicare to process all the enrollments There were all these stories about people showing up to pharmacies and the pharmacies not having the seniors in the systems said   who directs the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University And the seniors walked away empty handed because Medicare hadnt transferred the information Momis pain is so intense from her disease that any delay would be agonizing I have lipomas fatty tumors that grow throughout my body she says Theyre attacking through my spine my internal organs My nervous system is actually growing through them You can see them She drives monthly to Las Vegas more than  miles north of Fort Mohave to see her doctor He wants to install a pain pump for a new medicine from sea snail venom but its so expensive she has had to delay the surgery My doctor is helping me so much I cant even begin to tell you she says crying I pay him what I can pay him No one knows how many people might still be clamoring for coverage at the cusp of Christmas When Massachusetts launched its health insurance exchanges the big spike in enrollment didnt occur when the program began in  Instead it hit when the financial penalty for not signing up kicked in that December according to a   by Harvard professor Amitabh Chandra and other researchers For the federal law the comparable time is the close of the enrollment period at the end of March After that people without health coverage face tax penalties of  or  percent of income whichever is greater unless they meet the criteria for exemptions Chandra however notes that there are differences from Massachusetts experience that make it less than a perfect comparison For one the Massachusetts penalty was higher than the federal health laws penalty in the first year On the other side he noted that more people in the United States are aware of the health laws penalty because weve had a fouryear fight about the law nothing like this had happened in Massachusetts Laszewski says the political controversy over the rules may have left consumers confused Is my policy really canceled What do all these objections from insurance commissioners really mean he says The consumer is left in the lurch trying to figure out what is going on
