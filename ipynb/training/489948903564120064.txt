That ended Thursday when the CDC reported a man in Florida who had not recently traveled outside the country came down with the illness  As of right now the Florida Department of Health confirmed there are at least two cases One case is in Miami Dade County and the other is in Palm Beach County   Its arrival did not surprise the chair of the  It was just a matter of when We are prepared in the Keys and have been prepared for some time to deal with chikungunya Steve Smith said  From what I am seeing Im sure there are more cases out there that we dont know about Its really a matter of time The CDC is working closely with the   to investigate how the patient came down with the virus The CDC will also monitor for additional locally acquired US cases in the coming weeks and months The virus which can cause joint pain and arthritislike symptoms has been on the US public health radar for some time  Usually about  to  infected travelers bring it to the United States each year  But this new case represents the first time that mosquitoes themselves are thought to have transferred the disease within the continental United States   The arrival of chikungunya virus first in the tropical Americas and now in the United States underscores the risks posed by this and other exotic pathogens said   chief of   This emphasizes the importance of CDCs health security initiatives designed to maintain effective surveillance networks diagnostic laboratories and mosquito control programs both in the United States and around the world The virus is not deadly but it can be extremely painful with symptoms lasting for weeks Those with weak immune systems such as the elderly are more likely to suffer from the virus side effects than those who are healthier  About  to  of those infected will have symptoms says Nasci  People infected with chikungunya will often have severe joint pain particularly in their hands and feet and can also quickly get very high fevers The good news said   an infectious diseases expert with Vanderbilt University in Nashville is that the United States is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations and should be able to keep the problem under control We live in a largely airconditioned environment and we have a lot of screening window screens porch screens Shaffner said So we can separate the humans from the mosquito population but we cannot be completely be isolated Chikungunya was originally identified in East Africa in the s Then about  years ago chikungunya spread to the Indian Ocean and India and a few years later an outbreak in northern Italy sickened about  people Now at least   plus the United States are reporting local transmission of the virus  The ecological makeup of the United States supports the spread of an illness such as this especially in the tropical areas of Florida and other Southern states according to the CDC The other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness Unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by   and   which are most active during the day which makes it difficult to use the same chemical mosquito control measures  These are the same mosquitoes that transmit the virus that causes dengue fever The disease is transmitted from mosquito to human human to mosquito and so forth A female mosquito of this type lives three to four weeks and can bite someone every three to four days Shaffner and other health experts recommend people remember the mosquitocontrol basics  Use bug spray if you are going out especially in tropical or wooded areas near water  Get rid of standing water in empty plastic pools flower pots pet dishes and gutters to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds  Wear long sleeves and pants
