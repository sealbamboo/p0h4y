We boomers havent heard much about the generation gap lately although it was a big topic the stuff of newsweekly covers decades back  But Im wondering if this phenomenon  fundamentally different perspectives on goals behavior and values based largely on ones age cohort   resurfaces in later life These musing were prompted by  what else  a new study this one led by Debra Moser a cardiovascular researcher at the University of Kentucky on the seemingly unrelated subject of how people suffering from heart failure assess their quality of life When a damaged heart cant pump enough blood the consequences may include shortness of breath fatigue and swelling people with heart failure   Medication can help especially in the early stages but short of a heart transplant there is no cure It interferes with daily life Ms Moser told me And it shortens life Average life expectancy after diagnosis is less than five years Small wonder that patients with heart failure also referred to as congestive heart failure often contend with anxiety and depression You might expect that distress to intensify in older people among whom heart failure is fairly common Compared to younger patients they have more comorbidities Ms Moser pointed out meaning that they have other diseases at the same time Their functional capacity is worse Theyre hospitalized more often  Yet when her team asked a national sample of  people who had a diagnosis of heart failure about their healthrelated quality of life the younger patients up to age     the worst  on a questionnaire measuring the negative physical psychological and social impact of their illness They reported significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety too as assessed by commonly used scales  In this study published in Age and Ageing patients in the older groups age  to  and over  reported better quality of life and significantly less depression and anxiety even though older patients with heart failure are likely to be sicker and more impaired  What All the age groups defined quality of life similarly in terms of happiness relationships and the ability to perform activities The apparent reason that people who could do less still felt they had better quality of life Ms Moser said is that older people are better able to reframe their lives   When the researchers interviewed a small subset of subjects only  the younger patients lamented what they could no longer achieve Im just a shell of my former self a yearold man said Their loss and disappointment sound shattering The elders compared themselves not with their former selves but with the peers they saw around them they felt grateful to be alive and able to do whatever they could do It could be worse was a common theme  Researchers have long talked about the Ushaped curve in which people say they are happiest in youth and in old age We know that older people see things more positively and it often pays off   Your ability to be flexible to cognitively restructure challenging or threatening events to see the positives in the situation is almost always associated with positive outcomes both emotionally and physically Ms Moser said  Which led me to ponder what is probably the single most common grievance that adult children express about elderly parents their resistance to accepting assistance or permitting change even in circumstances their caregivers see as crucial to their safety and wellbeing Why wont they hire an aidecall a cabinstall grab barsbuy a hearing aidconsider assisted living Why do   for their wellintended families to help them We tend to chalk up this intransigence to fear of dependence or denial of reality and those factors frequently do come into play But the older heart failure patients werent in denial They acknowledged their physical and social limitations they just didnt seem as bothered by them   So consider An elderly woman insists on continuing to brave the steep basement stairs to do the laundry waving off her son or daughters protest that someone else should take over the task No no she says Everythings fine no need Maybe shes not fearful of admitting decline as we sometimes think or unable to see the risk she is taking Maybe she just thinks about it differently   The child compares her mother with her younger stronger and more capable self and wants to take action because at some point the older womans kind of thinking can become dangerous And perhaps the mother compares herself with more debilitated peers and tells herself it could be worse  which is also true  As a careful researcher Ms Moser doesnt want to make claims beyond the parameters of her study  But to me it looks as if the generation gap a stark difference in the way two age cohorts regard the same phenomenon has returned to bedevil us again
