More than  billion of   went into creating the health laws insurance marketplaces and about   But some experts say its still too early to declare these markets a success or failure So what  we say about what the public is getting for its money The markets including HealthCaregov and the staterun exchanges are longterm investments They have to work in the short term but also be desirable places for buyers and sellers to get together for years going forward In that sense theyre a lot like other marketplaces  like the   Buyers and sellers flock to the market because its an easy place for them to find each other and make deals Dillon Keller is here on a Saturday looking to move some roller skates My mother in law works for a roller rink he explains and these are the ones people left behind for over a year So she said Get rid of them  Keller drove across town and is spending  for a little square of asphalt here to sell the roller skates He could have just had a garage sale But its not as successful he says You dont have near the number of people For every one person at a garage sale you probably have at least  out here The flea market does a lot to draw customers in It has a big billboard next to its highway exit a food court and even hires a live band on weekends In the same way the Affordable Care Acts exchanges are supposed to be desirable markets for selling and buying health insurance Its the same principle even behind the New York Stock Exchange says economist   You could look at health insurance and see the same thing HoltzEakin says Do people want to sell their policies on there Or is it growing in magnitude Those are standard metrics of success for marketplaces he says and should be applied to the insurance exchanges Eight million people showed up to buy insurance on the exchanges in the first six months But will it be a good enough deal to bring them back Will more insurers jump in HoltzEakin says we dont know enough yet to conclude which states exchanges are successful I think we know the outliers he says We know the big failures in Oregon and Maryland for example We know what appear to be the great successes in places like Kentucky which is quite cheap and has a big fraction of people signed up In between its pretty hard to make the case we know whos better than someone else One way thats tempting to try to figure out which states were successful is to divide the number of federal grants sent to the states by the number of people who signed up in the marketplaces That gives a costpercustomer But comparing states based on that is really not a meaningful calculation says   an economist at MIT He says insurance exchanges are longterm investments They should last for decades and every state that set up its own had similar upfront costs like hiring technology companies to create their online shopping sites A lot of the programming  the computer setup  is the same regardless of how many people enroll Gruber says So by that costpercustomer number California is going to look better than Rhode Island But thats misleading he says Its sort of like inferring that we should never let small states do anything Its also nearly impossible based on the financial information the White House is releasing so far to compare the states that relied on Healthcaregov with the  states that instead did their own exchanges And some states got millions or tens of millions of dollars in outside help from private donors  even   Theres just   right now HoltzEakin says for economists to pass judgment on the Affordable Care Acts marketplaces And anyway he says they represent only one way of measuring the federal health laws success I think the focus on the exchanges per se is a natural fallout from Healthcaregov melting down at the beginning HoltzEakin says but its really not the right metric for success or failure Economist Jonathan Gruber agrees Success Gruber says can really only be defined ultimately as a significant improvement in the wellbeing of the US public  uninsurance rates drop seeing health improved seeing bankruptcies drop The public wont know whether thats what they got for the tax money they spent on health insurance exchanges until well after   Next year though federal grant funding to subsidize state exchanges will start to run out The challenge now for these new marketplaces is to grow on their own Most have still only enrolled   of the uninsured people in their states
