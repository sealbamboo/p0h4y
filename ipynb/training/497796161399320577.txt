Cant you hear the music pumping hard Salt N Pepa may not have known that they were asking a valid question at the time but according to a study published on Tuesday the answer is important to your state of mind  Researchers at Northwestern University found that music can make us feel powerful though not all kinds of music have the same effect Music with high levels of bass evoked higher levels of power and dominance among the  undergraduate students tested in the study When watching major sports events my coauthors and I frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room said study author Dennis Hsu in an editorial accompanying the study  So whatever the big event may be  a job interview game day or vital presentation  put on your headphones and jam away  Journal     Its well known that aspirin has more benefits than just easing headaches Past studies suggest that the cheap pills can also   and protect against    Now for the first time researchers have reviewed all the available evidence and looked at the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for preventive use Prophylactic aspirin use for a minimum of  years at doses between  and  mgday appears to have favorable benefitharm profile write the researchers from Queen Mary University of London in the journal Annals of Oncology  A daily dose of aspirin for  years cuts bowel cancer cases by  and deaths by  in both men and women between ages  and  their review found The rates of stomach and esophageal cancers were cut by  to  The study published Tuesday also addressed the most common side effect of taking aspirin daily stomach bleeding Among yearolds who take daily aspirin for  years the risk of stomach bleeding increased from  to   Journal    Scientists dont know exactly what prevents Alzheimers and dementia but getting enough vitamin D may delay devastating brain disease  A new study published in the journal Neurology suggests that low vitamin D levels in elderly men and women more than doubles their risk of developing dementia later in life  The researchers tested vitamin D blood levels of  dementiafree people over the age of  Over the following six years people who were severely vitamin D deficient had a  increased risk of developing Alzheimers or dementia compared with participants with normal levels of vitamin D Clinical trials are now needed to see whether vitamin Drich foods like salmon or eggs and vitamin D supplements delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimers and dementia the researchers say Journal  A study published Monday in Diabetologia suggests that alternating slow and fastpaced walking could be better than walking at a continuous speed for those with type  diabetes who are trying to manage blood sugar levels   When comparing interval training with continuous speed training researchers found that interval training displayed more favorable outcomes for controlling blood sugar levels despite the fact that the overall energy expenditure in both forms of training remained the same  The Danish study looked at type  diabetic patients between the ages of  to  years who were randomly divided into three groups eight people in the control group  in the continuous walking group and  in the interval walking group  The walking groups were instructed to train five times a week for an hour while their insulin secretion levels were measured   After four months the study concluded that improved blood sugar control was evident only in the interval walking group No changes were observed in the control and continuous walking groups   According to the authors the most important finding of the study is that the interval walking group experienced increased insulin sensitivity which diabetics typically struggle with without making their bodies produce less insulin   Brushing your teeth may not be enough to save you from tooth damage caused by soft drinks and fruit juice A study published Tuesday by researchers at the University of Adelaide found that drinks with high acid content can erode tooth enamel within  seconds of consumption  If high acidity drinks are consumed it is not simply a matter of having a child clean their teeth an hour or  minutes later and hoping theyll be okay Sarbin Ranjitkar an author on the study said in a news release The damage is already done Researchers say the damage to teeth from acidic drinks can be irreversible To avoid permanent consequences Ranjitkar recommends that parents limit the number of acidic drinks that their children consume and choose fresh fruit over fruit juice
