Weightloss surgery is becoming increasingly popular because its the only treatment that pretty much guarantees weight loss There is very little evidence on how it will affect peoples health over the long haul But people who had surgery maintained substantial weight loss three years later according to a study thats trying to figure out if it works But the amount of weight lost varied according to the   and so did the effect on diabetes blood pressure and cholesterol Researchers say that may have to do with both the type of surgery and variations among the patients The variation also reflects the fact that there are lots of reasons why people become seriously obese and doctors arent sure how treatment should be tailored to match those differences Very few studies have tracked people with weightloss surgery for more than a year The   study funded by the National Institutes of Health was launched in  to overcome that problem The  people who had   which creates a new connection between the top of the stomach and the small intestine had maintained a weight loss of about a third nt of their presurgery weight three years out or  pounds on average The  people who had   where an elastic band is used to make the stomach smaller maintained an average  percent weight loss or  pounds The death rate for both surgeries was about the same at just under  percent But the lapband patients were much more likely to need further surgery with  percent going in to get things fixed The median weight for people in the study before surgery was  pounds Many people end up getting weightloss surgery because they have diabetes or other weightrelated health issues In the bypass group almost threequarters of the people with diabetes had at least a partial remission of the disease In patients with lapband surgery that number was  percent The more invasive gastric bypass was also better at reducing blood pressure and improving lipid levels Lapband surgery has been popular because it is less invasive and has a quick recovery time But because of the need for more operations to adjust the band and deal with other problems surgeons instead have been turning to   which reshapes the stomach into a bananashaped tube but doesnt remove the valves at the top and bottom of the stomach It also may not interfere with absorption of iron and other nutrients as much as does a RouenenY bypass This study didnt evaluate the vertical sleeve procedure The LABS study is big but its not a randomized trial the patients chose which surgery they would have So that could affect the results The   were published Monday in   the American Medical Associations journal The varied response shows that more effort needs to go into figuring out what type of obesity a person has and not treating them all the same according to   an epidemiologist at Childrens Hospital Boston who studies obesity She wrote an   in  to accompany the report We dont think all breast cancer should be treated the same  not at all Field told Shots We need to start thinking the same way with obesity Current approaches to weight loss including diets and exercise result in only small amounts of weight loss when averaged out across the American population Field notes And with  percent of American adults and  percent of children overweight or obese there are a lot of people who could do with some help Bariatric surgery isnt appropriate for almost all of those people she notes There need to be tailored nonsurgical approaches too If you look at Weight Watchers its focused on education and navigating social situations Field adds It works very well for some people but not others We need to figure who the subgroups are and how to match the best treatment to them We have a ways to go to get there The LABS study is also looking at how weightloss surgery affects teenagers and published a very shortterm   Monday in   It found that  teenagers who had bariatric surgery did fairly well in the first  days afterwards Eight percent had major complications like needing more surgery and  percent had minor complications like dehydration That study will continue to see how the teens fare over the next few years Weightloss surgery in children is controversial because they arent able to give legal consent and because any ill effects would dog them for many more years than in adults who typically have bariatric surgery in their s or s Parents and doctors should think about nonmedical reasons why surgery may help teenagers according to   a bariatric surgeon at the Mayo Clinic He wrote an   in   arguing that having to go through adolescence weighing  or  pounds can result in psychosocial retardation The elephant in the closet is social ostracism and social isolation Sarr told Shots Many of these kids are markedly obese from age  Theyre isolated Theyre made fun of Theyre excluded from things That he says can stunt a life as much as Type  diabetes and other health issues in seriously obese children
