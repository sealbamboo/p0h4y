Thomas Edison thought it was waste of time Bill Clinton used to brag that he could get by on only five hours of it a night And Margaret Thatcher once famously said that it was for wimps   Who needs it right Well actually   need it And so does everyone else  including selfproclaimed short sleepers like Clinton In a  interview with CNNs Anjali Rao the former commanderinchief admitted that his previous years of sleepdeprivation had taken a serious toll on both his body and his mind In my long political career he told Rao most of the mistakes I made I made when I was too tired because I tried too hard and worked too hard Clintons situation is somewhat unique of course  who   stay up nights if they had the fate of the country in their hands  but the fact is that were all guilty of overextending ourselves According to the National Sleep Foundation Americans average about  hours of sleep a night which though not exactly bad isnt   either So what   good How much shuteye is enough to keep us functioning through the day the week our lives Technically there is no onesizefitsall   Everyones needs are different so while some people may feel the effects of just one night of missed slumber others may be able to endure three or four nights before slowing down For the majority of the population however seven to nine hours is considered ideal  anything less than that will start to negatively affect your ability to perform When sleep gets below seven hours time in bed for otherwise healthy adults a cumulative deficit develops for the majority of people explains David Dinges PhD chief of the division of sleep and chronobiology at the University of Pennsylvania That is each day their alertness level attention and cognitive functions become steadily worse As one of the leading researchers in the field of sleep deprivation Dinges has seen these effects firsthand In one landmark study from  he and his colleague Hans Van Dongen assigned dozens of subjects to a twoweek program of restricted sleep in a lab Some slept four hours a night others six and still others eight During the day each group took part in psychomotor vigilance task PVT evaluations every two hours to test their cognitive response times The PVT involves sitting in front of a computer screen for  minutes and pressing the space bar whenever you see a predetermined visual stimulus Pilots truck drivers and astronauts use it to measure their attention span and alertness Not surprisingly people assigned to the eighthour program showed virtually no cognitive decline or lapses into sleepiness over the twoweek period People in the four and sixhour groups however began to suffer almost immediately and performed progressively worse as the study went on By day six a quarter of those on the latter program were falling asleep at the computer And by day  their level of impairment was equal to that of a group who had been deprived of sleep for  consecutive hours The rate of deterioration is faster with four hours a night than five faster with five than six faster with six than seven Dinges says And the more nights you go without adequate sleep the worse it gets Eventually even if youre getting six hours a night it will progress to a deficit equivalent to going one or two nights without any sleep  which cognitively speaking is like being legally drunk You would never think of going to work intoxicated but you probably dont think twice about going to work tired  even though exhaustion may be just as damaging to your performance and your health In fact research shows that chronic sleep deprivation may raise your risk for heart disease stroke dementia and even cancer  and those are just the longterm effects The immediate consequences can be harmful too People with   are less alert during the day more likely to be inattentive and more likely to have problems concentrating or performing tasks that require them to think fast Dinges warns Their memory may also be affected and of course theyre at greater risk for driving drowsy This isnt just dangerous for you  it could be deadly to others as well According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration driver fatigue causes  motor vehicle accidents each year  of which result in death And it doesnt take much to happen A halfsecond cognitive delay may not seem like a big deal but it takes only a two to foursecond lapse  whats called microsleep  for someone to lose control of a car You may not even notice youre tired until its too late Under chronic sleep conditions people may feel tired at first but then wrongly assume their bodies have adjusted to the deficit Dinges explains They say I think Ive adapted  but in fact they continue to get progressively worse Theyre just no longer aware that the sleep debt is affecting their performance he says We used to wonder why people couldnt understand but now we realize that at some level the brain cannot introspect or know what its state is Once the condition is chronic the brain just redefines whats normal One problem may be that were distracted from our fatigue by stimulation from work or friends or   These socalled countermeasures keep us awake  but often at a price You might not   the effects of missed sleep as quickly or as severely as say someone in a sleep lab but that doesnt mean youre not experiencing them In some people the loss of function may be so gradual that theyre not aware its happening until theyre literally falling asleep at their desks Some people just dont deteriorate as fast as others Dinges says Many are okay on Monday or Tuesday but may start to feel worse as the week goes on By Friday it can be quite bad Poor sleep may affect everyone at different rates but it will eventually affect everyone  except perhaps the very small percentage of true shortsleepers According to scientists at Germanys Ludwig Maximalians University of Munich certain people may be able to operate on just four to five hours of sleep without naps or coffee thanks in part to a gene called ABCC Experts say however that the gene is exceedingly rare  only three to five percent of the population actually has it though many more Clinton perhaps may   they have it In fact out of every  people who believe they can function on less than six hours a night only about five people really can Part of understanding your sleep is understanding not just how much you need at night and how to get it but also what your vulnerability is to   getting it Dinges says If youre constantly overemotional or drowsy youre not getting enough sleep  and if you think you are theres something   with your sleep Its not just how much you sleep that counts experts say but also how   you sleep Anything that interferes with your bodys ability to rest can add to your sleep debt which becomes more and more difficult to erase over time According to the National Sleep Foundation and research from Harvard Medical School theres no real way to recoup all the sleep youve lost But that doesnt mean you shouldnt try Sleeping in on the weekend can actually be quite useful Dinges notes Does it completely reverse your sleep debt Not entirely But getting some extra hours every once in a while may help We just cant claim to know how   extra Really in the end he says the true solution to this is for people to prioritize their sleep at a much higher level Because every day that you get adequate sleep youre capable of functioning at your best
