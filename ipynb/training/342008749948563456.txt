Young women covered by a parents health insurance dont necessarily get maternity coverage The National Womens Law Center thinks it may have found a way to get them benefits The group has filed   against five large publicly funded employers using a littlenoticed provision of the Affordable Care Act that bars discrimination in health benefits on the basis of gender The provision   prohibits discrimination in any health program or activity that receives any sort of federal funding or financial assistance The complaints filed with the US Department of Health and Human Services   attempt to address a recently noticed glitch in coverage policy While employers are generally required to provide maternity benefits to spouses of their employees they are not generally required to extend those same benefits to dependents That has not been a big issue before but it has become more of one since the Affordable Care Act allowed young adults up to age  to remain covered on their parents health plans Under the    employerprovided health insurance generally must cover maternity benefits for spouses But that law has never been interpreted to   It wasnt hard to figure out why lack of coverage for dependents wouldnt have been considered discriminatory says Sharon Levin director of federal womens reproductive health policy for the NWLC In the case of spouses it was assumed that male spouses of female employees would be getting all their needs covered but female spouses of the male employees would   be getting their needs covered if maternity benefits were excluded said Levin Thus not offering maternity care was deemed discriminatory Abortion services were mostly excluded under the law owing to political controversy But for dependents says Levin male and female employees are getting the same coverage because their children all of their daughters are not getting pregnancy coverage So theres no difference in how the male and female employee is being treated In fact lack of pregnancy coverage for dependents is   One estimate is that  percent of firms that selfinsure for health benefits dont provide it Yet the need is not insignificant Nearly  million teenagers and young women got pregnant in  according to the   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But the nondiscrimination language in the health law provides a potential remedy at least for companies that receive some federal funding Levin said We were always aware that section  would apply to this situation but we wanted to make sure that we had all our ducks in a row to file the complaints before we started talking about it Levin said the group chose the targets of its complaints to reflect regional representation and different industries and to make it clear that its a systemic issue rather than just a few problem employers The subjects of the complaints are   in Columbus Ohio   in South Bend Ind   in Auburn Ala   in Spokane Wash and the   in Harrisburg Pa None of those parties has commented
