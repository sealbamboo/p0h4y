I am always looking for an athletic challenge I need something to train for or I lose my motivation This year I decided to try a triathlon swimming biking and running one after the other Total disclosure I am a niece of triathlon greats My aunt and uncle created the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii in  and in June they were inducted into the USA Triathlon Hall of Fame in Chicago From afar they inspire For anyone thinking about this event here are some guidelines I used I would sign up for a small triathlon within driving distance of my home in Los Angeles and I would not make any major investments in equipment I would go simple a cap bathing suit and goggles a bike and helmet and running shoes Triathlon season runs from March to September with the majority of the races clustered in June July and August The Goleta Beach Triathlon was in late July The race was just short of Olympic distance with a mile swim a mile bike ride and a fivemile run It was an hour and a half away the swim was in a sheltered cove and the race organizers said the event was geared toward beginning and intermediate triathletes Plus the setting was supposed to be beautiful Triathlons arent cheap This one was at the low end at  The event is a fundraiser for the Santa Barbara County Parks Foundation  And it was small Only  people competed in the long course event Next I wrote to my aunt and uncle for advice They recommended The Triathletes Training Bible by Joe Friel Finally I called the fittest friend I have a guy from San Francisco who has a dozen triathlons under his belt He turned out to be indispensable an oncall sage I could text whenever I had a question First thing I did was sign up for my race Then I would be committed no excuses I had exactly  weeks to race day and I was pretty much starting from zero That may have been overly ambitious I ordered the book a fantastic resource on everything from workouts to diet to training regimens I referred to it repeatedly First you had to decide how serious you were and how many hours a week you wanted to train I set the bar low six hours a week I also signed up for an email list in which a coach would send me encouraging words every couple of days He gave me one important tip Concentrate on your weakest event For me that was biking I have no technique and no experience Also the bike leg is the longest so if you are weak that will kill you Setting your training schedule is complicated because it has to be so diverse There are triclubs but I trained on my own I took Spin classes at the Y swam with a masters swim group during lunch a couple of times a week and ran on my own in the mornings I also did yoga to keep limber and help prevent injury On the weekends I vowed to do a long run a long bike ride or a combo Once I started working out six days a week I realized how out of shape I really was By week five I could feel myself getting stronger In weeks six and seven I finally started seriously doing bricks as the backtoback workouts are known Experienced triathletes will tell you the hardest part of the triathlon is the transitions particularly from biking to running I did a swim and then a Spin class at the Y and a long bike ride followed by a twomile run The first mile my feet were numb and my legs felt like clubs Then I went on vacation for two weeks I did not run or bike the whole time though I did a couple of easy ocean swims Week  I was sick and I wondered if I should drop out But the week before the race I swam a mile a couple of times and did an mile ride followed by a minute run I ate oatmeal and drank coffee then swallowed a banana a halfhour before the race I splurged on triathlon bike shorts that I could swim bike and run in And I bought some bars to eat during the race I got up at  am and drove to Santa Barbara I followed the example of everyone around me and laid out my shoes towel bike and snacks in my own personal station Some people had little basins of water to wash their feet so they wouldnt have sand between their toes for the rest of the race I wish Id done that The beach was so foggy we could only see the first buoy on the swim course but officials assured us we would be able to see where we were going The sea was glassy the water  to  degrees Nearly everyone was wearing a wet suit Should I have gotten one I was starting to freak out The hardcore competitors had everything packed onto their bodies A wetsuit over their biking suit which was in turn packed with Gu and other snacks for the rest of the race You could see their food bulging out in little bumps Some women told me they wore wet suits not for warmth but for buoyancy People who arent comfortable in the water say wet suits help At  am our wave hit the water The water was cold and gray people kick you in the head and knock off your goggles and you are guaranteed to swallow some seawater But the swim was the part of the race in which I felt most comfortable For most of the race I moved forward in fear praying I would finish The pacing is so tricky  to know how hard to push when you are using different muscle groups But there were a few minutes when I felt gloriously strong The last half mile in the ocean I hit my rhythm The Goleta Beach bike course is a narrow county bike trail winding through marsh habitat woods and suburban neighborhoods It was hard to pass and there were a lot of sharp turns We flew down the trail over bridges beneath underpasses We had to duck low branches I felt like a kid again on a crazy grownup obstacle course It was fun By the time I got to the run I hurt but I finished strong and walked around dizzy and grateful A yearold man won the event At  I was last in my age group  to yearold women but that was good enough to earn me a place on the podium and to leave with a thirdplace medal And I caught the bug Next year I will do the Nautica Malibu Triathlon  If you want to try a tri here are a few good ones in the Los Angeles area Small beautiful driving distance from LA  July    A quartermile ocean swim an mile bike ride and a mile run  A onemile swim a mile bike and a mile run This is a great race in the San Fernando Valley for novices and professional athletes The swim is in a lake so for those who fear ocean swimming this is an excellent option  Aug    A yard swim an mile bike course and a mile k run  A meter about  mile swim a mile bike ride and a mile k run If you are going to be in the ocean you might as well be somewhere gorgeous This race is big and fills up fast so sign up early  Sept    A halfmile ocean swim an mile bike and a mile run  A meter ocean swim a mile k bike ride on the Pacific Coast Highway and a mile run on the blacktop and sands of Zuma Beach
