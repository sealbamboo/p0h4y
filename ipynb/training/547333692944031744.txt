Its a dramatic picture  rows of empty white tents the Ebola treatment units built just as the epidemic was waning in the Liberian capital Monrovia It looks so hopeful  maybe the international response is finally beginning to make a difference in an epidemic thats sickened  people and killed at least  of them Its an appealing thought But then reports come from Kono the diamond mining district of nextdoor Sierra Leone Thats where horrified aid workers  overwhelming an underequipped clinic with  dead in the space of a few weeks Dr Dan Kelly a founder of the nonprofit Wellbody Alliance whos been working in Sierra Leone since the epidemic began came back after a break in November to find chaos Nurses were too scared to go into the holding area Kelly told NBC News They were throwing water at the patients sliding food across the floor to the patients There was no place to decontaminate There were all these dangerous activities happening Kelly and colleagues alerted the World Health Organization US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the British military which has taken responsibility to help in Sierra Leone like the US military has for Liberia The International Committee for the Red Cross sent ambulances and people piled in to get out of there I was begging people to calm down Kelly said He was trying to pull healthier people out of ambulances holding confirmed Ebola patients when one man started arguing with him He said I know if I come down from the ambulance you are going to send me into a holding center and I would rather sit next to a positive Ebola patient than go back into that place Kelly said He and two other patients decided to stay in the ambulance and off they went It was bad Its better now And so it is but that outbreak is a reminder of just how fragile any victory is over this Ebola epidemic The virus shifts quickly easily steps ahead of slowmoving international aid efforts Thats why the WHO says the epidemic wont be under control until the middle of next year Im hopeful about stopping the epidemic but I remain realistic that this is going to be a long hard fight CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden just back from visiting the three worsthit countries told reporters Monday Usually Ebola outbreaks are put out quickly after at the most a few hundred cases This ones so much worse that even the most optimistic aid experts say theyre on the fence about whether even controlling it by midsummer is a realistic goal If the international community continues to expand support for containment activities in West Africa then it is possible that there will be only a small number of new cases of Ebola occurring each week by the middle of  However it appears unlikely that there will be zero new cases occurring by summer says Kathryn Jacobsen an epidemiologist at George Mason University I think it is entirely possible that we will have ended Ebola by next summer and its also entirely possible that we dont adds Dr Emmanuel dHarcourt senior health director for the International Rescue Committee It could go either way In Liberia the US military rushed to build Ebola treatment units tented clinics where the sickest could be kept away from everyone else and given the care they need Most are standing empty now We have a lot more Ebola treatment unit beds than we need at present said Dr Darin Portnoy the vice president of Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF international board What we really need is for the international response to focus on what is going on outside the Ebola treatment units Portnoy told NBC News Outbreaks are still flaring up in rural areas and it can take days for word to get out We need rapid response teams and the capacity to go out to these areas Some of these are very difficult to reach Portnoy added They need to go to these areas support those affected provide care and then help with contact tracing with education about safe burial practices and they need to build trust with those communities Its trust more than anything thats needed right now DHarcourt argues If people dont trust what their governments the WHO and aid workers are telling them about how not to spread Ebola it will continue to spread This is kind of high noon for us he said Everybody acts as if either treatment or some new idea is going to conquer Ebola We know how to conquer Ebola but its not easy to do well It requires identifying and isolating patients quickly and burying bodies safely The instinct may be to treat patients and thats important he said but that wont affect the spread Treatment has its role but its not the heart of the matter DHarcourt said My choice would always be to prevent If you see a train about to hit someone do you get the trauma unit ready or do you get them out of the way Each flareup is a chance for the epidemic to take hold again until everyone in the region knows how to prevent Ebolas spread the experts all agree As long as Ebola is occurring anywhere in the region these flareups may continue to occur Jacobsen said It is very very very possible not to get Ebola said DHarcourt Thats where efforts will really matter he said
