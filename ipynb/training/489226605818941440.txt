Labelling people as having prediabetes is unhelpful and unnecessary researchers claim The definition given to people on the cusp of type  diabetes has no clinical worth a joint UKUS team argues There is no proven benefit of prescribing drugs as many will not develop diabetes the researchers write in the   But a charity said being identified as being at high risk was helpful It offered the chance to reduce risk by eating a healthy diet and being physically active said Diabetes UK People with prediabetes have no symptoms of ill health but their blood sugar levels are at the high end of the normal range  The term is not recognised by the World Health Organization but has been used in many scientific papers According to a new wider definition of prediabetes adopted by the American Diabetes Association in  a third of adults in England and half of those in China fall into this category Prof John Yudkin of UCL and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota US said current definitions of prediabetes risked unnecessary medicalisation and created unsustainable burdens for healthcare systems He said for prediabetes the risk of developing diabetes was probably  over  years  Prediabetes is an artificial category with virtually zero clinical relevance he said There is no proven benefit of giving diabetes treatment drugs to people in this category before they develop diabetes particularly since many of them would not go on to develop diabetes anyway More people are being included in the medical category of prediabetes without the evidence that they are going to benefit from the interventions he told BBC News However Diabetes UK said that while there may be debate about the exact criteria and definitions of prediabetes more people were developing  type  diabetes or showing signs of being at risk  Being identified as having prediabetes borderline diabetes or being at high risk provides an opportunity for those people who have a major chance of developing type  diabetes a lifelong condition which is associated with extremely serious complications such as blindness and stroke to walk away from it said chief executive Barbara Young Up to  million people in the UK potentially fall into the category of having prediabetes she said This highlights the need for public health interventions to avoid a dramatic increase in type  diabetes in the future  Eating a healthy balanced diet low in salt sugar and fat and rich in fruit and vegetables as well as being physically active is the best way of reducing the risk of developing type  diabetes Around  million people in the UK have type  diabetes and Diabetes UK estimates that figure will rise to five million by  The condition develops when the insulinproducing cells in the body are unable to produce enough insulin or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly
