Manuel Antonio Tejarino used to be a lean fit field hand  During the sugar cane harvest hed swing a machete for hours hacking at the thick towering stalks Now Tejarino is slumped in a faded cloth deck chair outside his sisters house on the outskirts of Chichigalpa Nicaragua Tejarinos kidneys are failing Hes grown gaunt His arms droop by his side In the tropical midday heat he alternates between wiping sweat off his brow and pulling a sweatshirt up over his bare chest I feel like Im burning says Tejarino  My blood pressure goes down I get dizzy Someone has to help me walk If Im alone Ill fall down In Central America a form of kidney disease is attacking men in the prime of their lives Researchers are struggling to explain whats causing it The condition appears to be concentrated among male agricultural workers particularly sugar cane cutters along the Pacific coast The town of Chichigalpa has been hard hit Its surrounded by the cane fields of   one of the oldest and largest sugar estates in Central America The estate produces raw sugar thats shipped to the US and elsewhere It also refines ethanol to make a popular rum marketed globally under the name Flor de Cana Tejarinos doctor says hundreds of men in Chichigalpa are suffering from this mysterious kind of chronic kidney failure Its not related to diabetes or other wellknown kidney diseases In the past Tejarino used to join the roughly  people who work the sugar harvest here each year I worked nine years in the sugar cane harvest Tejarino says And thats whats made me sick The first reports of this disease date back at least  years At first the clusters of men dying of kidney failure was dismissed as a fluke Then it was written off as diabetes or some other underlying health problem that hadnt been correctly diagnosed Despite years of research all over the world scientists still cant definitively pinpoint the cause We dont know Thats the unfortunate part and we do desperately need to find some answers says   a medical epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions office in Guatemala City This form of kidney failure known as   in Spanish or   in English is now found from southern Mexico to Panama TurciosRuiz says But it occurs only along the Pacific coast The disease is killing relatively young men sometimes while theyre still in their early s Researchers at Boston University have attributed about  deaths to this form of kidney failure over the past two decades in Central America As the disease progresses agricultural laborers who may earn a couple of thousand dollars a year if theyre lucky end up in need of dialysis that costs tens of thousands of dollars annually Treatment options in   Guatemala and Nicaragua for kidney problems are extremely limited TurciosRuiz says The epidemic has become a major burden on already overstretched public health systems One of the prominent theories about the disease is that men get dehydrated as they cut sugar cane under the intense tropical sun Then the dehydration somehow makes them more susceptible to environmental toxins Researchers are also   whether an agricultural chemical might be causing the problem A similar epidemic is afflicting sugar farmers in Sri Lanka which has a hot dry climate similar to western Nicaragua In response the Sri Lankan government   the use of glyphosate this past March   is the generic version of the popular herbicide marketed by Monsanto as Roundup Officials at the Ingenio San Antonio in Chichigalpa say they also use Roundup But a link between the herbicide and the disease hasnt been proven Other theories about why these men are dying have been all over the map For a while health officials blamed the kidney failure on a potent local moonshine which included industrialstrength ethanol smuggled out of the sugar plant Some people think the epidemic might be linked to   a rare respiratory virus spread by rats Tejarinos doctor at the clinic in Chichigalpa thinks overuse of overthecounter pharmaceuticals could be to blame Tejarino dismisses this idea and goes back to the herbicide theory It was the chemicals the chemicals at the plantation he says More than a decade ago the sugar company in Chichigalpa recognized that something was amiss The company started testing the kidney function of workers before each harvest Anyone showing signs of kidney failure even early stage kidney disease wasnt allowed to work Now the town is burdened with sick unemployed men and widows One community on the edge of Chichigalpa has lost so many men that its called La Isla de las Viudas  the Island of Widows Tejarino accuses the company of poisoning its own workers then abandoning them They got rid of me he says They treat us like garbage Company officials deny such allegations The refinery has its own stateoftheart hospital The company offers free education to its workers children And it feeds employees during their shifts What about the sick laborers who cant work The company says it provides monthly food packets and basic medical supplies to a group of about  ailing former workers as well as to widows in Chichigalpa The company is as eager as everyone else to find the cause of the disease says Alvaro Bermudez the head of El Ingenio San Antonio Its a problem in the sense that any problem that affects our community affects us But Bermudez says the company is not sickening its own workers Frustration over the disease  especially whats causing it and whos to blame  has led to violent protests against the sugar company in Chichigalpa Earlier this year police killed one protester and seriously wounded another near the plantation gates Tejarinos wife Laura is also frustrated but in a quiet motherly way Hes been throwing up all morning she says Its very hard to see him this way She sits next to her husband slowly running her fingers through his black hair She says people all around them are dying Its been going on for years and in her opinion everyones ignoring it This disease doesnt spare anyone she says And researchers think it could be years before anyone solves the mystery
