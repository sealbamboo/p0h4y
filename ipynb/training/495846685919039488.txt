The Ebola virus has killed more than  people in Africa and could have catastrophic consequences if allowed to spread world health officials say So why would anyone allow infected Americans to come to Atlanta The answer experts say is because Emory University Hospital is one of the safest places in the world to treat someone with Ebola Theres virtually no chance the virus can spread from the hospitals supersecure isolation unit And another thing they say medical workers risking their lives overseas deserve the best treatment they can get Dr Kent Brantly became the first person infected with Ebola to be brought to the United States from Africa He arrived Saturday at one of the nations best hospitals Fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol was expected to arrive in several days I hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill Americans return to the US for care said Dr Tom Frieden director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention His agency received nasty emails and at least  calls from people questioning why the sick aid workers should be let into the United States Despite the calls and messages directed to the CDC few of those nearest the hospital Saturday seemed concerned I just think its a blessing that we can help possibly make the infected persons life a little more tolerable said Ashley Wheeler who was shopping just down the street on Saturday If I were that person I would want my country to help me the best way they could Emorys infectious diseases unit was created  years ago to handle doctors who get sick at the CDC It is one of about four in the country equipped with everything necessary to test treat and contain people exposed to very dangerous viruses In  it handled patients with SARS which unlike Ebola can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes In fact the nature of Ebola  which is spread by close contact with bodily fluids and blood  means that any modern hospital using standard rigorous infectioncontrol measures should be able to handle it Still Emory wont be taking any chances Nothing comes out of this unit until it is noninfectious said Dr Bruce Ribner who will be treating the patients The bottom line is We have an inordinate amount of safety associated with the care of this patient And we do not believe that any health care worker any other patient or any visitor to our facility is in any way at risk of acquiring this infection Ribner also said the patients deserve help They have gone over on a humanitarian mission they have become infected through medical care and we feel that we have the environment and expertise to safely care for these patients and offer them the maximum opportunity for recovery from these infections he said Friday Amber Brantly was heartened to see her husband climb out of the ambulance that met his plane at Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta It was a relief to welcome Kent home today I spoke with him and he is glad to be back in the US she said in a statement I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital Inside the unit patients are sealed off from anyone who doesnt wear protective gear Negative air pressure means air flows in but cant escape until filters scrub any germs from patients All laboratory testing is conducted within the unit and workers are highly trained in infection control Glass walls enable staff outside to safely observe patients and theres a vestibule where workers suit up before entering Any gear is safely disposed of or decontaminated Family members will be kept at a distance for now the doctors said The unit has a plate glass window and communication system so theyll be as close as  inches from each other Ribner said Dr Jay Varkey an infectious disease specialist who will be treating Brantly and Writebol gave no word Saturday about their condition Both have been described as critically ill after treating Ebola patients at a missionary hospital in Liberia one of four West African countries hit by the largest outbreak of the virus in history There is no cure for the virus which causes hemorrhagic fever that kills as many as  percent of the people it infects in Africa There are experimental treatments but the missionary hospital had only enough for one person and Brantly insisted that Writebol receive it His best hope in Africa was a transfusion of blood including antibodies from one of his patients a yearold boy who survived thanks to the doctor There was also only room on the plane for one patient at a time Writebol will be next following the same route to Emory in several days
