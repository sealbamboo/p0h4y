Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London are aiming to reconstruct peoples faces with stem cells taken from their fat The team has grown cartilage in the laboratory and believe it could be used to rebuild ears and noses They say the technique   could revolutionise care   Experts said there was some way to go but it had the potential to be transformative The doctors want to treat conditions like   that results in the ear failing to develop properly and can be missing or malformed  At the moment children have cartilage taken from their ribs which is then delicately sculpted by surgeons to resemble an ear and implanted into the child It requires multiple operations leaves permanent scarring on the chest and the rib cartilage never recovers  The team envisage an alternative  a tiny sample of fat would be taken from the child and stem cells would be extracted and grown from it  An earshaped scaffold would be placed in the stem cell broth so the cells would take on the desired shape and structure And chemicals would be used to persuade the stem cells to transform into cartilage cells This could then be implanted beneath the skin to give the child an ear shape  The researchers have been able to create the cartilage in the scaffold but safety testing is needed before they could be used in patients  One of the researchers Dr Patrizia Ferretti told the BBC It is really exciting to have the sort of cells that are not tumourogenic that can go back into the same patient so we dont have the problem of immunosuppression and can do the job you want them to do It would be the Holy Grail to do this procedure through a single surgery so decreasing enormously the stress for the children and having a structure that hopefully will be growing as the child grows The technique could help patients like year old Samuel Clompus who has had the reconstructive ear surgery His mother Sue said the family welcomed the research She told the BBC They wouldnt have needed to take the cartilage He has a scar there now and Sam said it was the most uncomfortable bit The technique could be used to create cartilage for other tissues such as the nose which can be damaged in adults after cancer surgery Doctors say they could also make bone using the same starting material Obviously we are at the beginning of this the next step will be to perfect just the choice of materials and to develop this further said Dr Ferretti Commenting on the study Prof Martin Birchall a surgeon at University College London said If you had something that was truly regenerative that would be transformative He was involved in the first operations to give people labgrown windpipes  He said the fatbased technique needed more safety testing to reach that stage We used bone marrow stem cells as theyve been used in s of people for bone marrow transplants fat stem cells are likely to be fine but they havent got that safety record yet
