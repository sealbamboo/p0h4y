Call it what you will  acid reflux gastroeso phageal reflux disease or just plain heartburn About  in  Americans suffer symptoms  each week They spend  billion a year on medication to relieve those symptoms including indigestion chest pain and difficulty breathing Some even get major surgery to cure this digestive disorder And its becoming more common with one   finding  percent increase in cases between  and    a gastroenterologist at the University of Pennsylvania Health System blames it partly on our frenetic fastfood culture and on another epidemic Obesity is really the underlying factor that is causing this increase in reflux that we are noticing says Metz But not everyone with this condition is obese Ralph Thomas of Arlington Vt is just a little overweight Hes a professional musician so he often needs to eat after concerts But late night suppers became agony when   started serving up chest pain and breathing trouble Thomas took fistfuls of overthecounter antacid tablets He even had to sleep sitting up to prevent an attack at night Acid reflux can be treated with major surgery that wraps the upper part of the stomach around the bottom of  the esophagus to strengthen it No thanks says Thomas That looked very invasive to me he remembers thinking after his doctor told him about the surgery called   So   his doctor at DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center  in New Hampshire showed him a small bracelet of magnetic beads which he likes to roll around in his hand So Im holding a new device called a   which is an esophageal sphincter augmentation device Trus explains at the hospital Trus says the beads cinch the lower esophagus like a little elastic belt keeping food moving in the right direction Then food stays in the stomach Trus says but its still able to get down around the beads because the beads will expand when you swallow allow things to pass and then tighten up again to prevent things from coming back up A surgeon implants the bead band  fairly easily  at least thats how it worked for Thomas By   in the afternoon I was dismissed to go home he recalls I had a cheeseburger on the way home with no fear of any pain And since then its just been like   years ago I can eat anything at any time  Thomas feels like he has his life back Before everything was a negotiation with everybody else No we cant go out for that type of food  No I cant eat now  Ive got to eat now because Im not going to be able to eat then Its none of that I can just go along with everybody else and be normal again For him normal means eating pretty much what he wants to eat including spicy food when he wants it Thomas was the first patient to have the procedure at DartmouthHitchcock which was the first hospital in northern New England to try it He says heartburn made him so miserable he didnt mind being a guinea pig Still he knows that  wrapping magnetic beads around his esophagus may not be riskfree The procedure is still brand new The FDA gave its   only in  after  patients in clinical studies showed good results And not all physicians are on board Metz has decided not to use the LINX  device with his patients  because he thinks its still unproven Earlier   have been known to fail Some slipped out of place causing pain Others did not improve the ability of the esophagus to expand and contract So they were taken off the market Thats why  Metz wants to see more longrange studies to make sure the beads stay in place and do what they are supposed to do Im not knocking it Im just reserving judgment at this time says Metz Reflux and similar disorders are notoriously difficult to diagnose correctly Metz notes He says that for the vast majority of patients who really do have it medications which include    and   are enough to relieve  symptoms Right now the LINX beads are the only devices of their kind available and Trus expects to keep using them with patients But even he admits Its impossible to predict what will happen  years from now So he says he will keep close watch on how patients do over time looking for unexpected side effects
