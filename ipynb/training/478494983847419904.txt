A bionic pancreas that uses a smart phone glucose monitor and insulin pump to automatically control blood sugar levels helped more than two dozen people live free of finger pricks and other troublesome reminders of diabetes researchers reported Sunday And the system controlled their blood sugar levels far better than they could have done on their own the researchers told a meeting of the American Diabetes Association I was astonished at how well it worked in a realworld setting said Ed Damiano of Boston University who worked on the project Its finally offering a tantalizing glimpse at a normal life for people with Type  diabetes often called juvenile diabetes Christopher Herndon hated giving the device up Herndon  tested it out last August while at a special summer camp for kids with diabetes He had to go through the regular blood sugar checks because its camp policy but he could have skipped them My blood sugar never got so low that I had to sit anything out Herndon told NBC News It is like a dream for a diabetic It takes away the responsibility It takes away the high blood sugar and the low blood sugar It prevents damage to the body and it makes you feel better all the time The Newburyport Massachusetts thgrader usually wears a standard insulin pump and he got a reallife comparison when he had to give up the new device after five days and go back to the old pump When I wasnt wearing it I had to sit out a lot of activities because my blood sugar was low It was frustrating he said Life for someone with Type  diabetes revolves around testing blood sugar and thinking about every single thing they eat At camp we start the day out checking our blood sugar after morning wakeup Herndon said The counselors give us menus we count our carbs add them up and then take insulin shots or set our pumps to deliver a bolus of insulin Only then do they eat After breakfast the campers can play sports  Herndon plays basketball runs crosscountry and plays lacrosse at school  but have to check to make sure the exercise hasnt lowered their blood sugar too much Then its the same routine of checking blood sugar estimating how much theyll eat in carbohydrates for lunch delivering insulin and finally eating And another round comes at dinner You have to face this  hours a day seven a week There is no vacation from it said Kristina Herndon Christophers mother About  percent of the  with diabetes have Type  diabetes Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot process blood sugar properly Type  diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused when the body mistakenly destroys pancreatic cells that produce hormones like insulin and glucagon that control blood sugar High glucose levels damage tiny blood vessels which in turn can lead to blindness heart disease stroke and kidney failure People can lose toes feet or legs to amputation When levels fall too low patients can pass out and even die It is just fiendishly difficult to control the blood glucose as well as we know it needs to be says Dr Steven Russell of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston whos been working with Damiano and others on this project for years You are constantly at risk of low blood sugar which can be acutely dangerous It is hard for people to appreciate how hard this actually is The teams been working on making an  for years and the first human studies started in  Their device monitors blood sugar  standing in for the fingerprick test that people with diabetes must do many times a day It delivers insulin when needed and in the right amounts  something diabetics must do several times a day either with a syringe or by pressing a button on an insulin pump And it does something extra  it delivers another hormone called glucagon which brings blood sugar back up when its too low During the last trial the team tested the artificial pancreas on patients in the hospital They wanted them still and resting so their blood sugar levels didnt fluctuate too much And at that point they needed to be near a laptop computer because it takes complicated software to calculate how much insulin someone needs from moment to moment What made the wearable bionic device possible was the invention of the smartphone says Damiano It was specifically the iPhone  with a lowenergy Bluetooth signal that could be used to help the various components of the device communicate The iPhone is a perfect platform We could not have done this without   cofounder Steve Jobs Damiano said Smart phones are powerful computers that people can carry with them  perfect for coordinating the components of the artificial pancreas The system is still a bit clunky The insulin pump itself attaches to a quartersized glucose monitor implanted under the skin of the abdomen A phonesized external pump is stuck to the abdomen with an adhesive A second pump delivers the glucagon and its all controlled by the iPhone In two separate experiments Damiano and Russells team tested the device on  freerange adults and  teenagers at a special summer camp for youth and children with diabetes The results surpassed anything the researchers had hoped for they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine The system was able to bring everybody into the range that reduces complications Russell said Not just half of them Not just threefourths of them Everybody No one had a hypoglycemic crash Theres no current standardofcare therapy that could match the results we saw Damiano said The next step in trials starts on Monday when  patients will try an even more challenging test at Massachusetts General Hospital Theyll wear the device and use it in truly reallife conditions living and working normally without a nurse hovering nearby Their blood sugar readings will be sent wirelessly via the iPhone to be monitored miles away at the hospital But there will be no intervention unless it starts to look like an emergency Thirty other patients are enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Stanford University and the University of North Carolina And theyll try it out in younger campers this time on the  to yearolds Kristina Herndon says she cant wait for Christopher to get another chance too Well be the first ones with our hands raised for a new trial she said Damiano is in a hurry His son now  has Type  diabetes and he wants a marketable device ready for when the boy starts college The most practical difference would be not having to think about diabetes  not having to constantly make decisions about things that those of us without Type  never have to think about he said Another real problem that would be relieved is the fear  fear of going to bed at night and not knowing if your blood sugar level will drop dangerously low while you sleep The team working with funding from the National Institutes of Health and private donations by groups including the Leona M and Harry B Helmsley Charitable Trust is working with an unnamed device maker to get the two pumps combined into one We still have a couple of years of work ahead of us Russell said Getting the price down will be a big factor The glucagon alone costs  a day right now We dont want this to be a niche thing We want this to be available to everybody he added For Christopher and his mother Kristina it would mean a good nights sleep My mom wont have to worry at night Herndon said She wont have to check my blood
