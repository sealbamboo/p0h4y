Many doctors encourage their patients to exercise But one who follows his own advice  and then some  is Dr Jordan Metzl a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York Dr Metzls specialty is treating injuries without surgery His favorite medicine he says is exercise It is one he takes often and prescribes to all of his patients Hes completed over  marathons and Ironman competitions and his goal is to do at least one Ironman every year To his patients Dr Metzl is not only the healer of their achy knees and sore shoulders but a fitness instructor He designed and teaches an exercise class he calls   which combines high intensity cardio with strength training The class is free open to the public and held at parks and other locations around New York City Recently I showed up at Central Park on a weekday morning to give the class a try After a fun but grueling hour of doing sprints jump squats and push ups I sat down with Dr Metzl to talk about why exercise is the best medicine how a strong kinetic chain makes you a better athlete and why science shows that working out in a group is better than working out alone Here are edited excerpts from our conversation Can you tell us about your role as a sports medicine doctor Well I have three roles I think As a sports medicine doctor I have a lot of people that come in to see me and I try to fix their injuries and keep them from getting hurt again I really believe that exercise is the best medicine and I want everybody to be able to take that medicine all the time I also have a role as an athlete This year Ill be doing my nd marathon and my th Ironman competition And the reason I do that is I think everybody needs a goal myself included  And finally I think I have a role as a fitness instructor It didnt start out that way but what Ive realized is that if Im going to talk about exercise I want to help people learn how to do it as well What are some of the more common injuries you see in your practice I see all kinds of sports injuries  everything from achy knees to achy backs shins and shoulders I see athletes of all ages In my waiting room it could be everything from an elite level yearold gymnast to a yearold person who wants to run a marathon Tell us about your most recent book The Exercise Cure It takes what I believe in personally and puts it in a scientific approach namely that exercise is medicine I want people to learn how they can take exercise for their problems whether its memory issues depression anxiety heart disease or high cholesterol How do you use exercise as a first line drug and how do you talk to your physician about that Those are things I want people to learn How long have you been teaching the Ironstrength class I started it a few years ago The first time I did it I wondered if anyone was going to come I just emailed some of my patients We had about  people But Ive now built a listserv for this class of about  people Its always free Every fourth class we raise money for a different nonprofit We do it in different places around the city and people of all ages come and work together What is a typical class like When we do it in the summer outside its a combination of hill running and then plyometrics When its indoors  and I usually teach indoors at Equinox gym in the winter  we have just basically strength workouts twice a month People come and they learn how to strengthen their bodies and prevent injuries Todays class was pretty challenging Can you talk about about the exercises we did So today we did a combination of some skipping up a hill followed by some sprinting up a hill and I alternated skipping and running Skipping is a great example of whats called plyometrics The muscles are rapidly elongating and contracting much like when youre running So its a great way to strengthen your running muscles 
When you start sprinting up the hill youre pushing not only your muscles but also your heart Intensity matters in your workout So what Ive done in the sprinting part of this is to really push your lactate threshold and your VO max It gets you breathing really hard which teaches your heart to squeeze harder to squeeze more blood and that makes you more efficient at extracting oxygen from your blood This intense training over time pushes your lactate threshold meaning that your fatigue level gets further and further out the more you do it In the second part of the workout you had us switch gears a bit Right The second part of the workout was all strength based We did plyometric jump squats to strengthen the butt muscles and the quads and the hamstrings And we did a combination of pushups and situps and all kinds of exercises that strengthen the kinetic chain which is all the muscles of the body connected tip to toe This workout strengthens the whole body If you have a hurt knee for example I want you to learn how to make all the muscles stronger so you take pressure off the knee As an athlete you do much better with a strong kinetic chain It doesnt matter the sport You can run faster jump higher and hit a golf ball further if those muscles are stronger How often do you do this workout This kind of workout is great about twice a week You can do it anywhere You dont need a gym You dont need any equipment I believe body weight strengthening is the way to go I have kids who are  and  years old doing this kind of stuff I have grandmothers in their s doing it and everyone in between Strength training is wonderful medicine for anybody If you have arthritis if you have osteoporosis it really helps Is there research that shows any benefits to working out in a group There was actually a study done in England where they took rowers and they put them individually in a room and had them do maximum erg  essentially the maximum effort that they could do And then they put all those people together and had them do it again And the study found that there was a  to  percent increase as a group versus as an individual meaning that you could work so much more effectively in a group than you can by yourself Even if you think youre pushing yourself as hard as you can you can always go a little bit harder if someones encouraging you Whats your personal workout like I do a combination of this kind of stuff once or twice a week And then I do a lot of biking a lot of running a lot of swimming just to try to keep myself as fit as I can be in the confines of my schedule and work which is sometimes tough But my overall hope is that I can keep myself going I want to do this stuff until Im  if I can Thats the plan Do you follow a special diet Im not an absolutist I eat a little bit of everything I love pizza I love hamburgers But I try and lay off that kind of stuff before a race But other than that I pretty much eat everything in moderation Im not a nocarb guy Im not a high protein guy My general feeling is if you can stay away from stuff that doesnt expire until  then youre in good shape How can people join one of your classes They can go to my Web site   and click on the subscribe tab Youll get my emails that tell you when the classes are If youd like to join me wed love to have you
