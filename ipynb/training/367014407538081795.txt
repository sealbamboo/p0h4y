Children with chronic stomach pains are at high risk for anxiety disorders in adolescence and young adulthood   suggesting that parents may wish to have their children evaluated at some point for anxiety Researchers at Vanderbilt University tracked  children with recurring stomachaches that could not be traced to a physical cause  socalled functional abdominal pain  comparing them as they reached young adulthood with  children who had never had such stomachaches About half the teenagers and young adults who had had functional abdominal pain as children developed an anxiety disorder at some point compared with  percent of the control group the researchers found The vulnerability to anxiety persisted into adulthood even if the pain had disappeared although the risk was highest if the pain continued Forty percent of the children with functional abdominal pain went on to experience depression compared with  percent of those who had never had these stomachaches The study was published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics What this study shows is a strong connection between functional abdominal pain and anxiety persists into adulthood and it drives home the point that this isnt by chance said Dr John V Campo chairman of the department of psychiatry at Ohio State University who was not involved in the new study In  Dr Campo   that found that  young adults who had suffered functional abdominal pain as children were far more likely to have an anxiety disorder than  similar adults who had experienced another childhood illness Chronic abdominal pain affects  percent to  percent of schoolage children The problem can lead to school absences and take a toll on families Somebody might say Of course they have mental issues or they are emotionally distressed  its because of the painÂ  said Lynn S Walker senior author of the study and director of the division of adolescent health at Monroe Carell Jr Childrens Hospital at Vanderbilt But we found even if the pain went away these adolescents and young adults still have anxiety Dr Walker said So maybe we need to treat their anxiety The stateoftheart treatment for functional abdominal pain is rehabilitative focused on getting patients to participate in daily activities despite their stomachaches Theres no question that there are triggers for the pain but the problem is in the perception of the pain and adaptation to the pain said Dr Samuel Nurko director of a functional abdominal pain center at Childrens Hospital Boston Dr Nurko compared the pain to a light on a dimmer switch which psychological techniques can help children control You dont take away the pain he said You dim it to be able to cope better The new study underscores the importance of screening children with the condition for anxiety or depression the authors said Anxious children tend to be good children who are concerned about doing their best Dr Walker said and parents may be flummoxed by the suggestion that such a child could be grappling with a mental health issue The majority of the children enrolled in the study had not seen a mental health professional ever Dr Walker said But Miranda van Tilburg an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine cautioned parents against leaping to the conclusion that a childs unexplained stomach pain is all anxiety based because we dont know that The takeaway message should be you should not be afraid if your doctor talks to you about anxiety in your child to seek help from a mental health professional because it could help your child feel better Dr van Tilburg said Such a referral is not an admission that thats whats causing the pain she said Its just an admission that anxiety is linked to the pain Nasrin Kazemi a parttime real estate agent in Brentwood Tenn has three children all of whom had frequent stomachaches If I get a little more excited or sad or mad about something my stomach will start hurting said Mrs Kazemis youngest daughter Donya  The anticipation of starting sixth grade this fall has set off new waves of stomach pain Its probably not going to stop until I get used to sixth grade Donya said She became anxious two years ago after a ghastly fortnight of fluinduced vomiting her mother said Since then Donya worries about attending birthday parties where she might catch another flu and such concerns make her abdominal pain flare up At first Mrs Kazemi was reluctant to seek psychological help for Donya but her daughter eventually saw Dr Walker Mrs Kazemi is hopeful about the new research even though it suggests that Donya may have a lifelong vulnerability to anxiety Because she is learning to deal with her emotions and to not let them get the better of her shell be better with dealing with negative things that happen later in life Mrs Kazemi said
