An increasing number of Indian women are choosing not to have children in a country where motherhood is revered reports BBC Hindis Divya Arya Anjana Kumar has been married for more than nine years years now and does not have a child  But that hasnt deterred her parents from giving her traditional herbs to help her conceive because they still cannot believe her decision to remain childless Ms Kumar  does not feel that the absence of a child has made her an incomplete woman  Frankly I think motherhood is overrated It may be joyous but its also a big longterm responsibility that I could never prepare myself for she says  Ms Kumar is among a growing number of women who are choosing not to have children in the worlds second most populous country where motherhood is glorified in society literature and films  An Indian scholar once wrote that the apotheosis of motherhood has reached a greater height in India than anywhere else   Opting out is not easy for women in a country which in  had a total fertility rate of  only slightly higher than the replacement rate It is also a country where more than  mothers also die out of every  live births ever year and an infant accounts for every sixth death Leading feministwriter Urvashi Butalia who is single examined the dilemma of an Indian woman who opts out of motherhood in a   earlier this year  How often have we heard that a couple is childless that a woman who cannot bear a child is defined as barren Why should this be I did not make a choice not to have children but thats how my life panned out  I dont feel a sense of loss at this my life has been fulfilling in so many other ways Why should I have to define it in terms of a lack Am I a barren woman I cant square this with what I know of myself But as Anurag Bishnoi who runs a fertility clinic in northern India says women earn respect in India by fulfilling two responsibilities  bearing children and feeding the family He says there has been a  increase in couples aged above  seeking fertility treatment at his clinic since it began in  The desire to have ones own child is paramount and overrides everything else despite the high risks associated with late births induced through fertility treatment he says So how do women like Anjana Kumar create space for themselves in a society which values motherhood so much She was born and brought up in a small city in the eastern state of Jharkhand But studying and working in the cosmopolitan Indian capital Delhi changed everything  Now I am in charge of my life I live it on my terms and that doesnt include motherhood And I know the decision to become a mother will change a lot of things she says I will have to quit my job will have to curtail my travel and will probably have very little time for myself But such utterances can often invite ridicule and she is often described as irresponsible People get so judgmental I take care of my parents my career and my house Whenever there is a crisis I dont turn to my brother I behave like an equal and figure things out myself So how can I be called irresponsible only for not wanting a childs responsibility she asks Preet Rustagi a Delhibased researcher with the Institute of Human Development believes that she is being a very responsible woman by opting out of motherhood  People dont think before deciding to have children about the kind of childhood they can provide about how much time they can spend with the child increasingly they just rely on helpers and maid servants to bring up their children Ms Rustagi  says she and her economist husband were never in a situation to give a fulfilling childhood to their child and hence decided to not have one We didnt want the child to be lonely And it wasnt like we were completely bereft of the joy of parenting A lot of our friends are working couples like us and their children have lived with us enough for us to have a special bond with them Janaki Abraham  married eight years ago and decided to not have a biological child In August she adopted a twoyearold baby girl  A teacher of sociology at Delhi University she says not having a biological child was a conscious decision  I never wanted a gun to my head in terms of missing the biological age for having a child I wanted to have the choice to wait till I felt confident financially and professionally to raise a child Ms Abraham says she really likes the idea of giving a home to children who are orphaned Even when I was single I wanted to adopt I never wanted to experience motherhood in terms of giving birth but always looked forward to the idea of watching a child grow Amrita Nandy an academic researching motherhood and choice believes that girls in India are brought up to look up to marriage and motherhood as the big inevitable goal in life  Most women who decide to remain childless tend to be highly educated urban Englishspeaking professionals she says Over the last three years she has interviewed more than  women in Delhi who have opted out of the motherhood and met many more Traditionally motherhood is considered to be the most fulfilling aspect of a womans life but class and education opens up horizons for women to see that there are many more ways of finding meaning and purpose in life Ms Nandy said that most women she spoke to had faced some sort of stigma or barbed comments from friends family and acquaintances for their decision  But the fact that they had been able to exercise that choice was because some support existed in their immediate social circle Interestingly all the women I met were happy with the choice they had made  They look back and tell me that their lives are more enriched dynamic and fulfilling and that given a second chance they will not live them any other way
