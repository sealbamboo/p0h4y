On this cold and rainy Tuesday Bafana Khumalo stood in front of the White House with a controversial demand for President Obama The US should provide foreign aid to fund abortions for women whove been raped during conflicts and in other circumstances Currently the   prohibits the use of foreign aid money for abortions as family planning About  protesters joined Khumalo On Wednesday morning the South African activist will be in New York City rubbing shoulders with Vice President Joe Biden They are two of the four men being honored with the first   presented to men who speak out to stop violence against women I know Vice President Bidens history is very luminous in terms of his engagement in genderbased violence says Khumalo I will be calling on him to use his influence Khumalo is cofounder of the nonprofit   in South Africa Sonke means all in the Nguni language the group is dedicated to building a world in which all men women and children can have equitable healthy and happy relationships Its efforts include community workshops political advocacy and media outreach So how did a man become involved in urging action to improve the lives of women We spoke with him after the demonstration Women suffer at the hands of men Leaders who have an opportunity to make a difference in terms of legislation and policies tend to be men Therefore I think we need more male voices coming out and speaking out on these issues so we challenge the patriarchy and its consequences on the lives of women and girls Ive been in this game for more than  years When we first started as men talking about this issue there was a lot of skepticism But I think we have proved we are not in this just as a fluke For me its a nobrainer I couldnt struggle against apartheid which was a crime against humanity and then ignore crimes against women Having come from a history where I have been on the receiving end of policies that were against black people in South Africa I think it would be amiss for me to ignore the stark reality that is faced by women everywhere every day in terms of their safety in terms of how womens bodies are used in conflict settings as weapons of war Men rape women as a way of showing other men that they are weak and cannot even protect women in their community We think world leaders look the other way on these issues We just had the situation of over  girls abducted in Nigeria With all the technology we have these days its scandalous that we are not able to move quickly to bring back these girls to their parents In our society women are there to be seen and not heard and therefore what are  girls Life can go on without them Im sure the world would have woken up if it was young boys who had been abducted And so we think there isnt enough anger to move leaders to respond to this challenge in Nigeria and elsewhere in the world Im shocked that its happening in the US given the democratic nature of this society But this is the problem in our society When women are raped people first dont believe them or begin to question Have you done something to encourage this kind of response Were you flirting with a man What were you wearing We just had an   in Nairobi Kenya in which young women who were wearing miniskirts were stripped naked by men in that society Those men believe when you wear clothing like that you are asking for trouble This kind of behavior  dictating what women wear where they can walk  reduces women to children Im humbled about the event tomorrow because I have to stand not just as an individual but on behalf of the many young people in our organization who are passionate about these issues Its in that context that I am almost approaching tomorrow with trepidation considering that we have a long way to go in transforming the world
