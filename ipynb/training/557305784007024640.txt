Its an astonishing act of human generosity  one man donating his   to a total stranger living on the other side of the world  A man working as a driver in Shanghai registered for a stem cell registration drive through his workplace thinking little would come of it Shortly after he received word that his stem cells had been matched to a boy in England The needy recipient is just seven years old The driver Jiang Yongfeng agreed to the donation without hesitation I was very surprised I was so excited to get a match so soon Fate was knocking on my door he says When I learned the boy was only born in  I was even more confident I made the right decision Its a good thing Mr Jiang was so eager Those needing stem cell transplants to treat cancer or other immune diseases must find a donor with near identical genes In reality that means the matched pair must have the same ethnic background so the immune cells of the donor and recipient work in tandem That small percentage makes the longdistance match between Jiang Yongfeng and the little boy something akin to a medical miracle The little boy receiving Jiangs donation is of Chinese heritage Hes lucky that Mr Jiang gave a saliva sample in order to sign up for the stem cell registry since relatively few in China have signed up for the scheme Chinese people make up approximately  of the worlds population but only  of people on the global stem cell registry are of Chinese origin explains the OtherHalf Chinese Stem Cell Initiative A match between someone living inside China and another living outside Chinas borders is particularly rare explains Dr Zhang Yi from the Shanghai division of the Chinese Red Cross the organisation managing the donation There are fewer people of Chinese origin in European and American countries so most matches are within China says Dr Zhang We have found only  matches using the Shanghai database out of  potential donors   The donation experience was relatively painless for Jiang Yongfeng the driver  Some are still required to donate stem cells by extracting bone marrow a more complex procedure that uses a needle to withdraw cells in the marrow directly from a donors pelvic bone However Mr Jiang was able to use a different method that extracts cells using a lengthy blood transfusion He flew to Beijing a few days before the procedure to receive injections into his blood that would activate the stem cells He was then hooked up to a transfusion machine for three hours while the healthy stem cells were extracted from his blood system Its unlikely that Mr Jiang will experience any negative health effects from the procedure Usually donors and recipients do not meet the Red Cross says because the patient often has recurring illnesses In the past if recipients met donors directly they sometimes pressured them to donate stem cells again if their illness resurfaced Does Jiang Yongfeng mind that he doesnt even know the little boys name No he shrugs I just want the procedure to be done as soon as possible so they can send my cells back to the UK and help the little kid recover as soon as possible I hope he can be brave and strong and he can live a good life
