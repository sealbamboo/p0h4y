The Obama administration is delaying the start of a key piece of the Affordable Care Act Workers in small businesses will have to wait an additional year to be able to choose from more than one plan in the marketplaces that start next January The delay  first proposed in   and    is the first acknowledgment by the administration that it wont be able to meet the tight timetable it has set to get these health exchanges up and running by October  when enrollment is set to begin The delay has disappointed some backers of the law A major selling point of the small business exchange is that small business owners will be able to simply select a particular level of coverage that they want their employees to have and then their employees will have the ability to choose from multiple plans within that level of coverage says John Arensmeyer CEO of the advocacy group   Without a menu that includes multiple plans he says the exchanges will be less attractive The change wont affect the options for individuals in the health exchanges While most people refer to the exchanges as a single entity   one for individuals and another one for employees of small firms Individuals will have a choice of plans from the start But   about not having enough time to set up competing plans for the small business exchange formally known as the   As a result the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday We have proposed that in  a SHOP may elect to have businesses choose one plan to offer employees and in  employees will be able to choose from the full range of plans in the Marketplace Thats basically the way most small business health insurance works now  the boss chooses a health plan for all the employees But the delay is not necessarily a bad thing says   Hes a former Obama health official and Missouri Insurance Commissioner now back in the   He says   the exchanges begin offering multiple plans is less important than   they do what they were designed for Angoff says hes all for giving the government more time to make sure that the plans compete to offer the best coverage at the lowest possible price And I do think if it results in the exchanges using their bargaining power establishing a competitive bidding process that its a good thing not a bad thing he says Because it will give the exchanges more time to set up a process which will force insurance companies either to charge reasonable rates or not sell through the exchanges at all Joel Ario who helped set up the health exchange program at HHS and has also since returned to the   says he wont be surprised if opponents of the law see the delay as the first indication that the Department of Health and Human Services   But he doesnt think thats the case I think it shows that the agency is going to focus on the mustdos he says and the nicetohaves will have to in some cases wait And this is one of those it wouldbenicetohavebutnotessential for  Small businesses that support the law will still have a reason to join when the exchanges first go live next year If they do they could be eligible for   that can lower the cost of providing coverage And there is already a push for the administration to try to   to delay the choice feature But this definitely represents another bump for a law that has already seen some rough roads
