Last month the United States made two promises to Liberia On Sept  Obama pledged that the US would construct a bed hospital outside Monrovia the capital to treat health care workers Theyve been bearing the brunt of the outbreak In Liberia alone at least  health workers have been infected and  have died Then on Sept  Obama announced a massive response to the outbreak involving thousands of US troops on the ground to train health care workers deliver relief supplies and build  Ebola treatment centers for the general public At the time of the announcement Obama stressed that time is of the essence Its spiraling out of control It is getting worse Its spreading faster and exponentially he   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Today thousands of people in West Africa are infected That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands Yet progress on the hospitals has been slow As NPRs Jason Beaubien reports from Liberia a month later workers are still spreading gravel on the construction site of the bed hospital Standing on the side are dozens of locals looking for work Without health care workers the hospital wont be able to open its doors NPRs Nurith Aizenman is in Anniston Ala where officers from the US Public Health Services who will run the hospital are supposed to get trained by CDC Right now she tells   Steve Inskeep only eight of the  people needed are there Quite a number of officers are being delayed for all sorts of reasons she says Im told not all of them have passports they have to get all the vaccinations that you need to work in West Africa  so theyre not scheduled to get this training for another two weeks And this round of training is just the preliminary threeday course Theres more training to come she says At this rate the earliest the hospital can open its doors for business is possibly around the end of October  about seven weeks after the hospital was promised Maybe that is a reasonable amount of time to staff up a hospital from scratch Aizenman says but reasonable amounts of time are a luxury that we dont really have in this outbreak The  other treatment units that Obama promised are also under construction though Beaubien reports that the US military expects those to be fully operational in  to  days Our photo gallery checks in on the progress of these projects
