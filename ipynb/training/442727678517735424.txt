A blood test that can predict who is about to develop Alzheimers or related early memory loss up to two years before the first symptoms may be in early stages of development researchers believe Many scientists have tried and failed to come up with a test that can predict Alzheimers But this one developed by teams at Georgetown University and the University of Rochester seems especially accurate This is the first time a highly sensitive and specific test has been able to predict who will become demented says Dr Howard Federoff of Georgetown who helped lead the research published in the journal Nature Medicine Sensitive and specific means the test misses very few people who did go on to develop Alzheimers or the memory loss that precedes it And there were no false negatives We did not find any individual that didnt test positive that became demented Federoff said The need is urgent Alzheimers affects more than  million Americans and its projected to  over the next  years A study published earlier this month suggested its a big killer taking down  Americans every year Theres no cure and not even a good treatment Many different approaches have been unsuccessful Its frustrating Federoff says But Federoff and other experts think if people could be treated before they develop symptoms before the brain damage is so bad it might be possible to slow the onset of Alzheimers They tried the therapies too late We need to find people earlier Federoff said The first step would be a test that predicts who needs early treatment Federoff and colleagues looked at the blood of  people aged  or over who had no symptoms of Alzheimers at the start They were all living on their own and generally healthy They gave blood at the beginning of the fiveyear study and once a year after that Over the five years  of the volunteers developed either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers which can be diagnosed with psychological tests brain scans or a spinal fluid test Federoffs team analyzed their blood samples to see if there was any pattern at all of compounds that might change predictably in those who developed memory problems There was It was a pattern of  lipids  fatlike compounds  that changed in the people who went on to develop memory loss or Alzheimers Were finding these lipids  of them that are highly predictive of who in the next two years will become cognitively impaired Federoff said in an interview The team is not exactly sure what the lipids mean They may come from the debris caused when brain cells die Brain cells dont die quietly says Heather Snyder of the Chicagobased Alzheimers Association And there is a lot going on in Alzheimers disease buildups of protein called amyloid beta tangles of nerves and also inflamed cells releasing signaling chemicals called cytokines chemokines and destructive chemicals called reactive oxygen species Its also known that Alzheimers is somehow associated with blood fats Studies link Alzheimers risk with   and a gene mutation that affects cholesterol one called APOE also affects Alzheimers risk However this particular blood test seemed to have nothing to do with APOE Federoff says As with any test it will have to be tried out in a much larger group of people before anyone could think about developing it commercially This study addresses a critical need in the field that of finding a relatively inexpensive and noninvasive biomarker to allow us to screen large groups of people said Dr Ronald Petersen director of the Mayo Clinics Alzheimers Disease Research Center This study is an important step in that direction but needs to be validated on a larger group of subjects more representative of a more general aging population Federoffs team is also looking to see if they can predict memory loss even sooner than the two to three years this test did it The test itself wouldnt be hard to do he says Its an easy approach he said The technology exists in almost any clinical lab Many people have tried to develop tests for Alzheimers including blood tests Many of those studies and those panels that are being identified are still very much in the early phases says the Alzheimers Association Snyder They need to be validated and confirmed in much larger populations Snyder added in a telephone interview Part of the problem is that scientists dont even agree on what causes Alzheimers There is so much that we dont understand about what is happening and one is what are those earliest changes and why she said Its not even that easy to diagnose Alzheimers in people with symptoms Current biological markers for early disease including levels of abnormal proteins in cerebrospinal fluid structural and functional MRI of the brain and brain PET amyloid imaging are limited by their inability to specifically diagnose rule in the disease or because they are invasive and can be expensive notes Maria Carrillo Alzheimers Association vice president of medical and scientific relations Currently  they might be developing Alzheimers are often just left to fret without knowing if they really ought to be getting their affairs in order
