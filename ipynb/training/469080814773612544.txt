One recent study found that adults with the lowest blood vitamin D levels were about twice as likely to die from any cause compared to those with the highest levels Other studies have linked adequate intakes to lower rates of obesity type  diabetes heart disease high blood pressure osteoporosis depression certain cancers and brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease  This key nutrient is also tied to enhanced immunity muscle functioning and injury prevention pretty impressive huh Vitamin Ds nickname is the sunshine vitamin because exposure to the suns ultraviolet rays triggers its production in the body but you cant rely on the sun as your sole source Your location cloud cover smog time of day and year and sunscreen use all affect your UV exposure and vitamin D production  Some of the best natural food sources include wild salmon whole eggs the D is in the yolk and mushrooms and its in fortified foods like dairy but it can be difficult to eat enough of these foods to meet your needs so a supplement may be your best bet   To identify the right amount to take get your blood level tested Based on the results your doctor can recommend the proper daily dose  Bone density declines more rapidly after  and one in three women over this age will experience a bone fracture Research shows that in the first years after menopause women may lose  to  of their bone mass annually and increases in calcium intakes generally dont offset the losses  Calcium is also required for muscle contractions so this mineral allows you to get the most from every workout Its also needed for nerve function and helps maintain your bodys acidbase balance so there are plenty of reasons to strive to hit the suggested mark  While dairy may be your first thought there are also several plantbased sources including dark leafy greens beans and lentils nuts and dried figs  If you choose to use a supplement just be sure not to go overboard The recommended daily calcium intake for women over  is  mg per day but the maximum advised limit from both food and supplements combined from age  on is  mg per day  Ive seen plenty of women exceed that amount sometimes unknowingly sometimes because they mistakenly believe more is better and getting too much can be risky with potential side effects including kidney problems kidney stones and calcium deposits in soft tissues  High calcium intakes can also lead to constipation and interfere with the absorption of iron and zinc and recently excess calcium has been linked to a higher risk of heart disease Talk to your doctor or dietitian to be sure youre striking the right balance  Probiotics have been shown to boost immunity improve digestive and skin health lower bad LDL cholesterol fight gum disease and enhance weight control so theres plenty to benefit from for women over   While foods like yogurt kefir kimchi and sauerkraut contain probiotics it may be difficult to consume enough of these friendly bacteria on a daily basis through food alone  If you opt for a supplement ask your doc or dietitian for a recommended brand and amount Theres currently no standard dose for probiotics like those that have been established for vitamins and minerals and while probiotics are generally considered to be safe your personal medical history should be taken into account before you pop a pill  The omegas DHA docosahexaenoic acid and EPA eicosapentaenoic acid are essential fatty acids that have been tied to vision and brain protection healthy hair and skin improved circulation reduced muscle soreness a lower risk of heart disease and depression and a reduction in inflammation which is a known trigger of aging and disease This remarkable list of benefits makes getting sufficient amounts of these good fats particularly important in your s Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich sources but a dislike of seafood or concerns about mercury may interfere with getting enough And while plantbased foods like flaxseeds and walnuts contain a type of omega called alphalinolenic acid or ALA your body only converts a small percentage of this form into EPA and DHA  the two types that the vast majority of the research has focused on If you choose to take a supplement that provides DHA and EPA vegan options are available its important to note that theres currently no standard daily dose for healthy adults Many experts recommend  mg of DHAEPA combined the amount advised for those with heart disease and like some of the other nutrients Ive mentioned its important not to go overboard  Emerging research shows that too much omega may weaken immunity and excess intakes have been linked to bleeding especially when combined with medications or supplements that like omegas also have a blood thinning effect Once again to pinpoint the amount thats right for you rely on advice from your personal health care providers Why you need it Getting enough of this key maintenance mineral which is involved in more than  bodily reactions can keep your energy soaring and allow you to look and feel like youve turned back the clock  Magnesium helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function keeps heart rhythm steady supports a healthy immune system preserves strong bones and slashes stroke and heart disease risk It also helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure but many women fall short of the recommended intake  Good food sources include spinach almonds cashews black beans quinoa and pumpkin sesame and sunflower seeds  If you opt for a supplement look for one with no more than  of the daily value  mg unless your doctor or dietician has advised differently Too much magnesium can trigger nausea diarrhea appetite loss muscle weakness breathing problems irregular heartbeat and dangerously low blood pressure Fiberrich meals result in a steadier rise in blood sugar and a lower insulin response as well as a slower rate of digestion and absorption which keeps you fuller longer and delays the return of hunger  It also keeps you regular by helping your digestive system stay in tip top shape and getting enough fiber is also a smart weight control strategy Research has shown that for every gram of fiber we eat we eliminate about seven calories That means if you eat  grams a day youll essentially cancel out  calories  a savings that could effectively stave off agerelated weight gain To bolster your intake rely on foods that are naturally fiberrich like fruits and vegetables especially those with an edible skin andor seeds or tough stalk beans and lentils and small portions of nuts and whole grains including oats whole grain rice quinoa and barley Water your bodys most important nutrient is required for every bodily process and you lose water from your body each minute of the day Replacing those losses adequately can help you reap the benefits of water including optimized mood and metabolism as well as better digestive health especially if youre stepping up your fiber game and glowing skin  Good old HO is also linked to weight control A recent study found that when middleaged and older adults drank two cups of water prior to eating a meal they ate between  and  fewer calories  Another week study found that adults who gulped extra water lost about  more weight following the same diet compared to those who drank less And a small German study found that drinking two liters of water a day could result in burning up to  extra calories an effect that could help fend off agerelated weight gain  According to the Institute of Medicine IOM women ages  and over need  liters of total fluid per day more than  cups About  of your fluid needs are met by food but that still leaves nearly nine cups based on the IOMs guidelines While other beverages may count as fluid water is the best way to meet your daily needs so strive for at least  ounces four times a day
