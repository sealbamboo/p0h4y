A lot of medicines direst emergencies come down to one problem lack of oxygen Cardiologist John Kheir   when a little girl in his care drowning from lung hemorrhages died before she could be hooked up to a heartlung machine that would have kept her blood oxygenated while the damage was repaired That was in  Now Kheir and his colleagues at Childrens Hospital in Boston think theyve   a way to inject oxygen directly into the bloodstream  a route that could save the lives of many patients who cant get enough oxygen fast enough through their airways Currently injecting oxygen or any gas directly into the bloodstream is a big nono because it can form a large bubble called an embolism  an obstruction that can be fatal The new method  not yet tried in humans  encapsulates pure oxygen in microbubbles made of fat molecules Its a foam a lot like shaving cream Kheir told Shots The purpose is to carry oxygen gas in an injectable way The bubbles release the oxygen in milliseconds in oxygenstarved tissues That happens because of the natural affinity of hemoglobin the business molecule within red blood cells for oxygen If theres any oxygen in the vicinity hemoglobin immediately soaks it up Kheir says his injectable oxygen foam could buy crucial time in a number of medical scenarios such as This would help us stabilize patients for a few minutes and that could be immensely valuable Kheir says So far the injectable oxygen has been tested only in rabbits with experimentally blocked windpipes The researchers have been able to keep rabbits alive for up to  minutes   All but one of the animals that got the oxygen foam avoided the cardiac arrest that follows oxygen deprivation within  to  minutes The next step is to give the oxygen injections to healthy volunteers to test its safety Then comes the difficult part  identifying those patients who could be given the oxygen foam during reallife instances of oxygen deprivation Thats a complicated question Kheir says because we really want to have a patient population we can not only study effectively but who can consent ahead of time and these are emergency situations The research has been funded up to now by a  million grant from the Department of Defense The work is   published in
