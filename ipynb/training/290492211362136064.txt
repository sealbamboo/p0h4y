Bob Harper seems to be the epitome of   perfection His svelte physique is the Olympic ideal and it draws countless people to his   videos motivational speeches and hit television show Harper a trainer on the The Biggest Loser admits being selfreliant to a fault and wants to do everything right His perfectionism even translates to his own fitness routine Even on the days when he thinks he is doing a CrossFit workout particularly well hell notice someone else who he feels is working out better than he is That drive for perfection masks his own feelings of inadequacy Harper admitted during a recent interview with former Biggest Loser costar Jillian Michaels on her new YouTube show Daily Dose With Jillian Michaels The hardest thing for me to overcome in my life is that need for perfection Harper said Its impossibleI want to be able to do everything right Oddly its the recognition that others can do things better than him that helps Harper deal with his perfectionism It is the realization that he isnt going to always be the best at everything makes me face my demons he says Harper explains that his feelings of inadequacy stem from a childhood of not quite fitting in not feeling loved Harper the youngest and the only boy in a family of three children grew up on a farm in Tennessee He lived in the basement of the family home earning him the nickname Basement Bobby When Harper was in seventh grade his parents divorced and his father who had been carrying on an affair married his mistress who had three kids It was his fathers leaving that really made Harper believe he had to fend for himself He went and got a whole other family he says Talk about being inadequate being not enough It taught me to be very selfreliant I have always had to make sure that like I was okay in a situation If you grow up in a world when you have to always have your own back  thats kind of what my childhood taught me for better or for worse It was those childhood struggles that give him a lot of empathy for the underdog It allows him to feel the pain and suffering of the Biggest Loser contestants  something that was difficult for him to deal with when the show first started Biggest Loser really did a number on me in the beginning because I didnt have the tools to take care of myself and keep a boundary I remember getting on the boat with those contestants I remember getting on the boat with all their pain and all their suffering and I felt it too he told Michaels Its like Oh my God Im with you Youre  pounds Your parents didnt love you enough You have all this selfloathing and selfdoubt  Harper says as their coach he has to find that one little light in that soul of the contestant and just nurture that light Thats what I had to do for myself My light was and continues to be that empathy I always knew who I was and I always knew what I wanted to do and I wasnt going to let this game beat me he continues I could have fallen by the wayside I could have been a statistic I could have just been this guy that just had a bad childhood and lived a life as a result of that or I could have turned it around And I knew that in my head I wasnt going to let that get the best of me Like Harper many people struggle with ideals of perfectionism They dont feel good enough pretty enough smart enough etc Dr Judith Orloff author of The New York Times bestseller Emotional Freedom Liberate Yourself From Negative Emotions and Transform Your Life says that while striving to be better is a commendable trait people have to be careful not to let it become an obsession Perfectionists can suffer from depression anxiety insomnia and excessive worry she says They get very obsessed with being perfect because they feel like they have done something wrong and are not good enough Below she shares her tips for how to overcome perfectionism  Once or twice a week write down five things you are thankful for These can be simple things such as   great friends and a gorgeous day Otherwise your mind will run away with negative thoughts  Keep your expectations realistic If you have  things to do in a day and there is no way to complete all of them focus on two tasks and make that enough  Perfectionists are incredibly hard on themselves I have a patient who got a B on a test and thought she was a failure Imperfection is part of being human When you love someone you love them for who they are  not because they are perfect  Give yourself positive feedback for what you have done well Its like being your own best friend And the other side of that is to be very compassionate if you made a mistake You want to see that glass as half full  not half empty People who are perfectionists focus on the half empty part and they are miserable  When you start to criticize yourself pause take a breath and immediately replace that thought with something more positive Do not give those thoughts any mileage If it helps write down perfectionist thoughts in a journal and a rational response to them  Comparing yourself to others contributes to the torment of perfectionism Realize that there is enough abundance for everybody Also keep in mind that you are comparing yourself to an illusion You dont know who that person is No one has the perfect life  If someone makes a mistake are you going to berate them No youre going to be positive When one of my patients makes a mistake such as a relapse with alcohol or drugs I dont criticize them Its their process Go easy on yourself like others would go easy on you  Find people you want to emulate people who are leading happy lives and not beating themselves up They can serve as positive role models  Take time to relax Meditate Exercise You want to do something that gets the   flowing and decreases the stress hormones If you are a perfectionist your stress hormones are aging you and negatively affecting your immune system
