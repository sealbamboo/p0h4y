A man whose mother died at a scandalhit care home has said a serious case review has not gone far enough and the private care home sector has failed Russell Tucker  whose mother Margaret Tucker died at Orchid View has called for government action to prevent other similar cases The West Sussex home saw  unexplained deaths  five cases involved neglect The review has made  recommendations The Care Quality Commission CQC has also admitted a series of failings Orchid View which was run by Southern Cross in Copthorne closed in  The care home has since reopened under a new name and new management After the serious case review   were published on Monday Mr Tucker from Oswestry Shropshire said It doesnt go far enough We know the remit was tight Useful information has come out on a local basis but equally issues have come out that impact nationally that is outside the remit Given that is the case we think it does warrant a full public inquiry He added The government needs to step up to the mark and behave responsibly The private sector is not the place for the care of the most vulnerable in society and it has failed An inquest last year found all  people whose deaths were unexplained had received suboptimal care Residents were left soiled and unattended and one night shift saw staff make  drug errors The five whose deaths involved neglect were Wilfred Gardner  Margaret Tucker  Enid Trodden  John Holmes  and Jean Halfpenny  Earlier lawyers representing the families of those who died called for a   of the care industry and a public and independent inquiry to find out how standards dropped to such a catastrophic level Solicitor Laura Barlow also said questions remained over who was ultimately accountable and added What is clear is that the independent sector needs to be subject to the same level of scrutiny that the NHS expects The serious case review commissioned by the West Sussex Adults Safeguarding Board made  recommendations They included that care operators must prove they can recruit and keep trained and skilled staff relatives should always have a named point of contact concerns should be escalated outside homes if not dealt with properly open meetings should be held with relatives and there should be a threshold for informing the public about significant safeguarding issues Independent chairman and author of the report Nick Georgiou wrote A sign of a good service is how they rectify things that go wrong What happened at Orchid View was more an avoidance of positive action to rectify problems and a series of ineffectual action plans that were not acted on He said he believed a public inquiry looking at the national care industry could have merit and called for a new law of wilful neglect to provide accountability Following publication of the serious case review findings the CQC issued its own   Andrea Sutcliffe chief inspector of adult social care said Southern Cross and Orchid View staff were primarily responsible for failings but the CQC had looked at its own role and knew it did not fulfil its purpose The way we worked when these serious incidents happened meant we did not respond to early warning signs we were too easily reassured by the responses of Southern Cross and the people who worked there  and we did not take appropriate enforcement action quickly or strongly enough she said Ms Sutcliffe said action had been taken to make the CQC more responsive to risks and to improve inspections and further improvements would be made Some of the recommendations were local to West Sussex and others were applicable more widely West Sussex councillor Peter Catchpole said What happened at Orchid View was harrowing Nothing will help ease the pain of the families who were affected by these terrible events and who lost loved ones But he added We do believe that acting on the recommendations contained in this report will go a long way towards preventing this happening again
