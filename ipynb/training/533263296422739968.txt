And so, another working week is coming to a close. Just in time, yes? This is, as you may recall, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans. Our agenda is rather modest, as usual. We plan to tidy up around the castle, run some errands, take a few naps and escort Mrs. Pharmalot to yet .  in our never-ending ‘Let’s-see-them-before-they-die’ concert series. And what about you? The time is fast approaching to boost the economy with some holiday shopping. Suburbanites can get some fresh air and exercise by raking leaves (leaf blowers create noise and pollution, you know). Or you could simply contemplate the rest of your life. Whatever you do, have fun, but be safe. See you soon…. The Competition Commission of India has asked Sun Pharmaceutical to rework its planned $3.2 billion acquisition of Ranbaxy Laboratories, because the regulator is concerned the combined company would hold a dominant position in pricing generic drugs in India; Pfizer appears unlikely to make a fresh bid for AstraZeneca in 12 days time, when an enforced cooling-off period ends, and the U.S. drugmaker is now weighing other less risky targets; and doctors are testing seniors for drugs such as heroin, cocaine and “angel dust” at soaring rates, and Medicare is paying the bill.
