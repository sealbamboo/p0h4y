The virus spreads quietly in China before being carried around the world by travel and commerce It infects people through bites and seemingly changes the brain and behavior of victims Society is disrupted as panic spreads and millions succumb OK so no one really thinks that a virus could turn half the world population into zombies And the  World War Z is far from realistic But some of its details do bring up reallife issues from the political and diplomatic fights about countries trying to cover up disease outbreaks to the very real possibility of a pandemic that could wipe out millions within the space of a few months Its no mistake the film suggests the zombiefying virus starts in China Something similar really happened in  with the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS virus which eventually spread to the rest of the world killed more than  people and infecting close to  before it was stopped Chinese officials were accused of being less than honest about the outbreak which was doubly worrying because scientists were already twitchy at the time about HN bird flu Perhaps due to years of public health diplomacy Chinese officials have been widely praised for sharing information about the   of HN bird flu which the World Health Organization says has   and killed at least  of them Similarly there was some suspicion that Saudi Arabia wasnt being completely open about an ongoing outbreak of a   for Middle East associated respiratory syndrome But again after some careful health diplomacy Saudi officials invited an international team of scientists to investigate MERS which has infected  people and  Any of these viruses could cause a pandemic Flu viruses often do  in  the HN flu killed or helped kill anywhere between  million and  million people Its descendant the HN swine flu  people in   and that was a mild pandemic WHO and other health experts caution that a more deadly pandemic could disrupt international trade and cause shortages in food fuel and medicines if countries closed borders or had to shut down critical operations to prevent spread Of course plenty of scary diseases already exist In both the book and the movie World War Z experts at first believe the zombie virus is rabies  which is indeed transmitted through bites or and which can make some animals highly aggressive and sensitive to sound But while the movie depicts infection taking hold in an unrealistic  seconds rabies can be scarier because it can take months to show symptoms Infected bats can bite people who are sleeping or otherwise unaware and victims and their doctors may not suspect rabies when they eventually do become ill because the time between the bite and symptoms can be so long And once symptoms appear its almost always too late to vaccinate Theres no treatment and rabies is almost  percent fatal Rabies usually makes victims sleepy and disoriented but it spreads in the animal kingdom because it can make animals aggressive Raccoons which normally prowl after dark will boldly walk down streets and mad dogs are notorious for chasing down other animals and people Even cattle can become aggressive when rabid But usually its not a virus that changes behavior Parasites are far more likely to do that  most notoriously the  parasite that   Its evolution in action because the parasite needs to be inside a cat to reproduce so making mice unafraid of cats helps the parasite survive and propagate There would be no obvious evolutionary reason for the parasite to affect people mentally but a study last year showed that women infected with T gondii were  times more likely to   than uninfected women  Another study suggests it might sometimes    And the parasite is common  a third of the worlds population is infected by eating undercooked meat touching infected cat feces and sometimes by eating unwashed vegetables Most successful parasites alter behavior just slightly says Janice Moore a biologist at Colorado State University who studies parasites If you are a sexually transmitted disease the chances are you are not going to kill somebody overnight she says No You are going to wait But they get nastier if you are a bug There are fly larvae that actually live inside caterpillars and eat their insides Moore says As the larvae crawl out of the caterpillar they actually cause the caterpillar to defend them from predators There are scarier infections even than these Hemorrhagic fevers including Ebola but also yellow fever and severe cases of dengue are painful incurable and cause frightening bleeding out of the eyes mouth under the skin and internally Just last year researchers identified that was related to rabies but causes Ebolalike symptoms The virus named BasCongo virus killed two teenagers in  Even though films rarely portray disease outbreaks accurately they are nonetheless a great excuse for communicating important messages about disease A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a stir with a   that won national attention for what can be a boring if worthy message  If you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse you will be prepared for a hurricane pandemic earthquake or terrorist attack the CDCs Dr Ali Khan said at the time Some government public health experts have sniffed at the campaign although the CDC team that came up with the idea won a   from the Health and Human Services Department in  and wide praise from communications experts In Laos where I just finished working on health emergency communication there is a very serious dengue outbreak The Health Ministry lists radio TV and puppet shows as media for pushing dengue knowledge and precautions says risk communications specialist Jody Lanard I suspect zombie puppets wouldnt work in Laos but zombies are hot in the US So for heavens sake let zombie movies carry the message  A movie about a disaster is a good teachable moment  a surrogate for a real disaster which is an even better teachable moment If the movie is gripping the audience imagines itself in the scary situation and temporarily becomes very interested in what they can do about it if it happened to them in real life
