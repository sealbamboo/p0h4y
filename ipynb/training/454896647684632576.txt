A new treatment for hepatitis C cured  of patients with the infection in  weeks scientists said  The study is a major breakthrough and marks a turning point in hepatitis C treatment said experts More than  people are infected with hepatitis in the UK and deaths from the infection have increased threefold since  Only  of patients in the UK currently opt for the existing treatment which only works half of the time  Hepatitis C is a    It is passed on by the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person and can be transferred through tattoo needles or people taking drugs and sharing needles  Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Centre tested the new oral drug in  patients at  centres in Spain Germany England and the US in   Two studies were carried out one in patients for  weeks and another for  weeks  The patients had liver cirrhosis indicating an advanced form of the virus After  weeks  of  patients no longer had hepatitis C which increased to  of  patients or  after  weeks Lead researcher Dr Fred Poordad said It is fantastic I am so excited for the patients There is finally hope for their future  He said the drug worked by targeting the protein that makes hepatitis C and stopping it from replicating Eventually the virus is extinguished he said  The study worked for patients with genotype  infections which account for  of infections in the UK The other  are a genotype  Genotype  is less common  The side affects were fatigue headaches and nausea Current treatment for hepatitis C can include a years worth of injections and involve sideeffects such as depression tiredness and feeling sick It also is not safe for many people with cirrhosis said Dr Poordad  Gkikas Magiorkinis consultant physician in medical virology at the University of Oxford said treating the patients with cirrhosis was a major breakthrough  Concerns over the high toxicity and low efficiency of current treatment had meant it was not widely been applied  It remains to evidence the benefit of the treatment in patients with advanced liver disease Mr Magiorkinis said However the study did not show if the probability of cancer dropped in the long term if cirrhosis was reversed or progression to total liver failure slowed  Whether or not the treatment prevented further transmission in the public was also yet to be seen he added  Charles Gore chief executive at the Hepatitis C Trust said This is a turning point I think it is incredibly exciting We suddenly have the opportunity to eliminate the virus in the UK  even without a vaccine Mr Gore said whether or not the disease could be eliminated would be down to political will which he said was lacking in the UK  He said although the study involved genotype  treatments for genotypes  and  were close behind he said  Mr Gore said treatment could reach the UK later this year
