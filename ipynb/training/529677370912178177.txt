nyone with access to Google will be able to tell you that doctors are among the most wellpaid professionals The first results that pop up tell you how many GPs are earning more than  per year or that David Cameron is less wellremunerated than doctors in the   I have just started my second year as a qualified doctor and the reality is quite different Theres no questioning that we are wellpaid an annual salary for someone at my stage would normally be  to   but its what do we have to do to earn our money I live with two of my friends who I went to secondary school with neither of whom work in a medical specialty They both work in the City with jobs that allow them to be home to watch Pointless and they both earn a similar amount of money to me Whats the difference then Why is it that the majority of doctors dont leave on time Simply because medicine is unpredictable and there is no telling if today will be a busy day or not Theres no way of knowing if your patients are all going to stay stable or if there is an imminent major disaster with all casualties needing immediate medical assessment and treatment  and I wouldnt have it any other way The lack of predictability is what makes being a doctor exciting and challenging and I suspect this is the thing that the majority of doctors enjoy most about their jobs However there is a big but to this I do not think there has been one day when I have worked my contracted hours I have spent entire fourmonth rotations working  hour days and if I leave by pm then Ive done well I am so engrossed in how much there is to do I forget about the hours I am working whether Ive eaten or even had a glass of water Recently one of my patients wives asked me Do you ever leave Well I thought I suppose to you it seems that I dont I arrive at am well before visiting time starts Im around on the wards all day and leave after visiting time ends at pm But my sugarstarved brain couldnt muster such a cohesive answer I will I reply Have you eaten Actually no I havent eaten since yesterday I think I will I reply again Ill bring you some food tomorrow I make nice pakoras youll like those Apart from this being a wonderful demonstration of genuine kindness it was a moment of realisation Maybe it isnt okay to stay late every day maybe I am being taken advantage of Throughout my admittedly so far short career I see examples of this every day nurses staying one to two hours late to complete their documentation doctors staying late to take care of their sick patients  it seems to be ingrained in the culture of the NHS With tuition fees of  and a possible total university debt of  for medical students its obvious to me that if youre an intelligent prospective student and want to make money medicine isnt the way forward However if you want the unpredictability the highs and the lows then apply  but when you get here dont expect to be paid for all the hours that you work
