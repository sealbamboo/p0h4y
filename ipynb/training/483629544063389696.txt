Moving with a partner to the musical beat may make people more cooperative  even babies as young as  months Researchers worked with  toddlers each held by an assistant and gently bounced for about two minutes to the rhythm of the Beatles version of Twist and Shout They faced an experimenter who  bounced in the same rhythm or off the beat Then the scientists tested whether the babies would help out when an experimenter accidentally dropped an object or tried to pick up an object just out of hands reach The  After controlling for other behaviors such as smiling or approaching the experimenter they found that babies who were bounced in a synchronous rhythm were slightly but significantly more likely to help than those who were bounced off beat Although the effect was moderate the authors say it was still impressive given the quite short duration of the interaction We tend to think that music is a frill that doesnt matter said the lead author Laurel J Trainor a professor of psychology at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario But in fact these social binds that we form early in development affect everything that happens later including our ability to learn and how we view others and ourselves
