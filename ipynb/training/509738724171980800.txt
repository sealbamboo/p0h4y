A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows strong support for congressional action to keep American companies from moving overseas for tax reasons.. The results suggest that voters both are aware of the tactic – known as “inversion” – and actually care about it. That could help elevate its importance as both a policy and a political issue, as Congress and the Obama administration debate what to do.. About 59% of registered voters said they believe Congress should take action to “penalize and discourage companies” from inverting because it results in lost tax revenues in the U.S. About 32% disagreed, saying companies “have a duty to their shareholders to lower costs and grow their business.”
