Research shows a common antidepressant may cut production of one of the chief suspects behind Alzheimers a new avenue in the hunt for drugs to prevent the devastating brain disease Its far too early for anyone worried about dementia to try the drug citalopram which sells as the brand Celexa  and comes with side effects This is not the great new hope This is a small step cautioned Dr Yvette Sheline of the University of Pennsylvania who is leading the research with Dr John Cirrito of Washington University in St Louis Alzheimers is characterized by sticky plaques that form in patients brains  to  years before the first memory symptoms are noticed Scientists have tried treatments to clear away those plaques made of a protein named betaamyloid that somehow goes awry and starts clumping together but with no success yet Wednesdays study is a somewhat different approach beginning to explore if its possible to slow the plaque from building up by altering the bodys production of amyloid First researchers gave citalopram to older mice with Alzheimerslike brain damage The animals existing plaques didnt go away but they quit growing  and dramatically fewer new plaques formed compared to mice given sugar water the research team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine Next researchers gave a single dose of citalopram or a placebo to  healthy young adults people who neither were depressed nor old enough to have brain plaques Tests of the volunteers spinal fluid over the next day and a half showed their normal amyloid production dropped by  percent the researchers reported It will take years of additional research to tell if that translates into any protective effect Citalopram and similar drugs called SSRIs alleviate depression by affecting levels of the brain chemical serotonin Sheline said citalopram probably alters amyloid production in a completely different way In fact the next question is whether its even possible to tamp amyloid production down for long periods or if the body would just get used to the drug and adjust Sheline has begun enrolling healthy older adults into a study to see if using citalopram for two weeks has the same effect
