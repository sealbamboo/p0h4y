In an advice column originally published on   Everyday Health founding editor Steven Petrow offers tips for getting past your partners pleas to opt out of using a condom  Let me start today by noting that its   which is held on December  each year and  as the official site in the UK proclaims  is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV show their support for people living with   and to commemorate people who have died That being said theres no better way to observe this day than to pledge to   and your prospective partners from HIV And if theres any tool we have to prevent the continued spread of the virus its the muchmaligned lowtech but lifesaving condom I know youve heard this before I certainly hope that you have but latex and plastic rubbers when used properly and yes thats key with a waterbased lubricant provide a high degree of protection to each partner But sometimes information alone doesnt do the trick If only Instead of going to the experts as Mr Manners often does I decided to ask a friend of mine who recently became infected why his knowledge of safer sex didnt safeguard him So how do I suggest you respond to these periodic ploys and thats what they are to have unprotected sex It would be facile for me to suggest that you just say no Still you cant make sound judgments if youre stoned high drunk tweaked or toasted  and theres no question that drug and alcohol use are closely linked with new HIV infections For now though lets take each of the objections to using a condom and do a little roleplaying    Its true that in a fair number of instances guys may lose their erections after suiting up But there are a number of things you can do like try different brands of rubbers  especially those that might not be as tight or as thick More often than not though what youre hearing and seeing is a selffulfilling prophecy based on a psychological response I dont like to wear a condom To counter that try making the unveiling and capture playfully sexy and fun If your buddy loses his erection as soon as the glove goes on go back to first or second base for a while to help him get restimulated while gloved    Condoms come in all sizes my friend Unless your partner is superhuman theres a condom for him He doesnt go shoeless because hes a big guy does he He shouldnt go without a glove either Among the jumbosized options are Trojan Magnum XL Lubricated Durex XXL and Kimono MAXX Keep shopping for options until you find one that satisfies    Indeed some men are but there are condoms made out of plastic polyurethane that provide protection against HIV and other STDs Be sure to use a waterbased lubricant with either latex or plastic gloves And remember Dont use lambskin condoms since they dont protect against HIV and other STDs    First of all a casual sex partner may not be  percent honest about his status if hes eager to get you into the sack But even an Honest John can put you at risk  he may think hes negative but he may be wrong which is a one of the primary scenarios for new infections Generally you must wait at least three months since your last risk of exposure to HIV to be reasonably sure that youre HIVnegative Even if your guy really is HIVnegative remember there are all too many other STDs to be concerned about  condoms protect you from more than just HIV By the way whens the last time you were tested If youre sexually active be sure to   on a regular basis  at least annually  if not more frequently depending on your risk factors    Possibly but be creative If you plan ahead a condom can be whipped out without losing your focus  or your state of mind And given the choice Ill take a mood killer over the alternative But if this were all so easy we wouldnt have more than  new infections occurring each year here in the US Its not easy at all  especially when youre really turned on or on a high from drugs or alcohol Again my recently infected friend cautions Compared with friends who knowingly slipped up in terms of safe sex I always thought I was a model in terms of precautions But it only takes once And the people you meet out and about or online for casual sex are all sleeping with other people where the same risk applies In other words knowledge alone isnt power Vigilance is a necessary part of the equation One last word Theres a new documentary called   just nominated for an Oscar that is a mustsee for anyone who lived through the darkest years of what was then called the gay plague and especially for those who didnt Kudos to directorfilmmaker David Weissman
