The stereotype of caring for a family member is that its so stressful it harms the caregivers health But thats not necessarily so Studies are conflicted finding that caregiving can harm or help the caregiver Heres one on the plus side A study finds that people who care for a family member live longer than similar people who arent caregiving The scientists didnt ask the caregivers why they might be healthier and presumably happier than similar people who werent caring for someone But the  people who participated represented a broad swath of the American public and may be a better representation of the caregiving experience overall Just  percent of the people surveyed said they had high levels of caregiving strain and the majority put in fewer than  hours of care a week The burden of caregiving certainly can be overwhelming and negative to health says   director of the Center on Aging and Health at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the   which was published in the   But those are not necessarily the typical experience The study data was originally gathered for a big multiyear study on stroke risk but the people being cared for in this study had a broad range of health problems The caregivers themselves were age  on average more likely to be female and either white or AfricanAmerican Family caregivers were  percent less likely to die than noncaregivers over six years the researchers found Something must have made life better for the caregivers But what To help find out we called up Leah Eskinazi director of operations for the   in San Francisco There are people who find caregiving very rewarding Eskinazi told Shots They feel really good that they can give back to Mom for example because Mom was really there for them when they were growing up Maybe they werent the best kid but as theyve aged they can have a more balanced healthier relationship and heal some of those wounds Context is everything Eskinazi says Caring for someone with dementia can be more stressful and depressing because the person is facing a long inevitable decline Youre caring for someone who cant voice their preferences she says Youre making decisions for another person and for yourself and that can last for a long time Its tough But only about  percent of family caregivers are tending someone with dementia other studies have found Caring for someone after a stroke by contrast can be very positive Theres a lot of energy going into helping that person recover Eskinazi says And in many cases the person being cared for is in a position to be grateful To have someone stick by you or a group of people stick by you thats pretty cool Eskinazi says It gives you an opportunity to say thank you Spouses typically expect to be taking care of their mate in old age but adult children dont always prepare for that possibility  or try not to think about it People tend to avoid the Family Caregiver Alliances booth at health fairs Eskinazi admits People dont really want to think about it Its time its emotion and it takes energy But this latest study points out that caregiving isnt all a big minus for the caregiver  something to prepare for perhaps but a normal often rewarding part of life
