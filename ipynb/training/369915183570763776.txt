How risky are psychedelic drugs to mental health Not nearly as much as you might have imagined People who had taken LSD psilocybin the brainbending chemical in magic mushrooms or mescaline at any time in their lives were no more likely than those who hadnt to wind up in mental health treatment or to have symptoms of mental illness according to an analysis by some Norwegian researchers And there was some evidence that people who had taken the drugs at some point were less likely to have had recent mental health treatment There seems to be no evidence of overall negative impact  and even some hints of benefit  associated with the use of psychedelics says   a psychologist in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Johnson wasnt involved in the study but had read the work which was   by   In separate human experiments Johnson and his colleagues at Hopkins have given psilocybin to cancer patients under carefully controlled conditions to help them cope with anxiety and depression The latest study comes from researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology who analyzed data from the   sponsored by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration Previously the Norwegian researchers looked back at old data on   and concluded that it wasnt a bad idea at all In this study the researchers looked at survey data collected from more than  randomly selected Americans between  and  Nearly  or about  percent said they had taken hallucinogenic drugs at some point About   aged  have tried psychedelics The lack of association between the use of psychedelics and indicators of mental health problems in this large population survey is consistent with clinical studies in which LSD or other psychedelics have been   the researchers wrote This study has limitations Its possible that healthier people are more likely to take psychedelics than those already struggling with mental illness for instance The study also didnt take the dose of drugs into account The researchers also didnt have any information about family history of mental illness which could be an important factor The design of our study does not allow conclusions about causality Teri S Krebs the lead author of the study wrote in an email to Shots However there is a lack of evidence that psychedelics cause lasting mental health problems While the findings are broadly reassuring about the safety of hallucinogenic drugs they dont guarantee a good trip This should not be taken to state that there are never individual cases of harm We know that there are Johnson says Its a question of how frequent they are and under what circumstances they happen
