But this bad biological baggage may come in handy  The unwelcome distinction of being home to over one fifth of the worlds SARS cases and   of the  fatalities from SARS meant Hong Kong quickly developed and implemented a very sophisticated disease control and epidemiology infrastructure  At its most visible any visitor arriving in Hong Kong must pass through heat sensor monitors checking for high temperatures This knowhow very probably limited the spread of both HN and avian influenza The lessons learned from SARS and other outbreaks has real application helping epidemiologists fight the spread of infectious diseases worldwide  And now the lessons learned from SARS are being put to the test The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERSCoV was first reported to cause human infection in September  and since then has caused over  fatalities  Despite the death toll it is not yet a global concern on the scale of SARS says Marc Sprenger Director of the European Centre for Disease Control ECDC   Even though our understanding of MERS is only a slowly evolving one we can see important differences between it and SARS he told CNN via email Perhaps the most important one is that MERS is spreading much slower than SARS  we have not yet seen sustained human to human transmission  A similarity with SARS is that both SARS and MERS are zoonotic when the virus can jump from animal to human viruses MERS appears to be a zoonotic virus resulting from multiple introductions and reintroductions into the human community Singlehump dromedary camels have been identified as the animal from which the zoonisis occurred Other species may also be carriers It is important to draw a distinction between SARS and this newer respiratory disease not least in terms of efficacy and humantohuman transmission But a   has seen dozens of new MERS cases  and several deaths reported this week alone  which could indicate a change in the virus behavior  The ECDC   that its April figures   cases  were greater than the past two years combined A lot of times these viruses will start in a certain part of the world like SARS in Asia CNNs Sanjay Gupta    They dont know exactly how its getting from camels to humans and while theyve found the virus in camels there could be other animals as well as part of this whole mix  It could be camel meat it could be drinking unpasteurized camel milk  both those things are common in Saudi Arabia It could be some fluids from the camel Researchers have shown MERS can transmit from human to human as well but it is very difficult for that to happen adds Gupta  While the vast majority of the cases have been confined to the Arabian Gulf there are recorded deaths attributable to MERS in Malaysia and The Philippines Two cases have been reported in Egypt  All reported cases originated in the Middle East  Given the connectedness of the modern world humantohuman transmission means  the spread of the virus could potentially be geographically unlimited  An infected person traveling overseas is a real concern says Gupta  There is an incubation period you could be exposed you could have the virus Youre not yet sick and you get on a plane That could happen and in fact it has already happened  It is the protocols honed in Hong Kong and around the world following SARS that offer the best way of limiting the spread of coronaviruses  Knowledge is seen as key with public education  from hygiene such as handwashing to preventative measures such as maskwearing  key to arresting the spread of coronaviruses  Saudi Arabia is learning transparency is of key importance   Abdullah AlRabeeah its secretive health minister with Adel Fakieh a proponent of public education and openness Professor Malik Peiris Director of Hong Kong Universitys School of Public Health says SARS not only took everyone by surprise it marked the reemergence of infectious diseases as a major concern  He says in the wake of SARS not only were resources  like isolation wards in hospitals  reallocated to combat infectious diseases like SARS but as a result Hong Kong has now become a center for infectious disease epidemiology and virology  There was also HN bird flu which happened on our doorstep and this expertise was heavily utilized he says The HKU group have contributed very significantly to that event and to understanding whats going on there We have been working on MERS since almost the time it emerged We have a greater awareness of the emergence of coronoaviruses  not only in Hong Kong but internationally  Publicly education about hygiene and disease containment in Asia and around the world are also much better following SARS The consciousness of hygiene issues of coughing and sneezing in public the use of hand wipes and alcohol wipes  and people wearing masks when they have respiration infection  importantly that is not to protect themselves but to protect others from infection says Peiris These are direct results of SARS Hong Kong and Chinese expertise is not limited to epidemiology and disease control but also in developing a cure  A team of researchers from Hong Kong and the mainland have developed two antibodies which they say are promising candidates to develop a treatment for the syndrome  As   the research into antibodies developed at the time of SARS has been invaluable in this case and models of virus behavior developed during the  outbreak have added to the urgency to develop an antidote for MERS before it becomes even more communicable  The MERS coronavirus may undergo further genetic changes and one day become as transmissible as the SARS coronavirus Professor Yuen Kwokyung a Hong Kongbased member of the research team and an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong told the newspaper Therefore we must prepare for this scenario before it happens  Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing and dispose of used tissues in a covered bin  Wash hands frequently using soap and water or use alcoholbased hand sanitizer  Seek medical advice if you exhibit symptoms such as low grade fever sore throat or running nose or diarrhea   If exhibiting symptoms wear a surgical mask to limit the spread of the virus  Avoid contact with livestock uncooked meat unwashed fruits and vegetables or unpasteurized milk  Travelers who develop symptoms up to  days after their return from affected areas should put on surgical masks seek medical attention and inform their doctor of their travel history
