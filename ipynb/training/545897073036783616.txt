 I am a senior consultant gynaecologist and lead consultant for reproductive medicine services at St Georges Hospital London and founder and medical director of Create Fertility the leading fertility clinics for natural and mild   Healthcare has a critical role to play in achieving social equality I realised early on that helping women with their fertility needs plays a fundamental part in the broader campaign for gender and health equality  I would like to see IVF treatments become more physiological safer and accessible with no   OHSS and fewer multiple births  founding the International scientific society on mild approaches in assisted reproduction Ismaar and developing successful IVF clinics focused solely on delivering natural and mild IVF convincing other healthcare professionals that OHSS can be eradicated and conventional high stimulation IVF should become a thing of the past there is a lack of attention to preventative care and too little involvement from the voluntary sector and local governments The   continues to be the national sickness service Unless we adopt a degree approach to healthcare alongside adequate resources for prevention of disease we will never achieve a healthy nation inspiring Quite simply I couldnt do it without them I want to make a difference and protect the longterm health and safety of women and children in IVF and contribute to making IVF treatment accessible globally dont have enough hours in the day to do all the roles I do Sleep is overrated convince parliament that the HFE Act must be widened in scope to include the welfare of women in addition to the welfare of children health equality is fundamental to social mobility patients come first stick to your principles still working to drive safety equality and advances in fertility treatment  When a patient finds out that she is pregnant  there is not a happier moment A patient failing to conceive and knowing that achieving closure is very difficult Being an intimate part of this very personal grief never becomes any easier Babies Deadlines and not saying no to projects that I love
