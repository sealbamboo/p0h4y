Staples are faster but sutures are safer researchers have concluded in a new study of how incisions are closed after a cesarean section The scientists randomly assigned   women undergoing a Csection to either suture or staple closure They excluded women with diabetes those with chronic steroid use lupus or HIV infection a history of radiation to the abdomen or pelvis and those with known sensitivity to the materials used in closing the incision The study which received funding from Ethicon a maker of sutures was    It found that   percent of women in the staples  group had wound complications mostly infections and separations compared with  percent of the women with stitches After controlling for age race number of previous Csections and other factors they found that sewing was associated with a   percent reduced risk of wound complications A woman undergoing a Csection should ask the doctor what theyre going to use said one of the authors Dr Vincenzo Berghella a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College in Philadelphia If they hear staples they should question that Its clear that sutures are going to cause fewer wound complications Stitching takes about nine minutes longer than stapling But in a Csection Dr Berghella said where local anesthesia is generally used that time difference is unimportant
