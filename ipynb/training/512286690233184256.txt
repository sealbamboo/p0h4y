Colorados new campaign to deter teen marijuana use tries to make the case that weed is bad for your brain One   shows a group of teens lighting up inside a dark car as moody music plays in the background The commercial cites a Duke University   that found a link between regular marijuana use and a lower IQ Some dispute the study the PSA admits But what if years from now you learn those scientists were right The kicker comes as the scene fades to black Dont be a lab rat The campaign which launched last month is designed to target kids in the  to  age group It also includes a website with links to news stories about the negative effects of marijuana including a few on NPRorg To further reinforce the message the agency has installed huge humansized   near libraries and skate parks in Denver and at concert venues like Red Rocks Amphitheater Its like a big art installation says   who runs Sukle the ad agency the state hired to design the   Its the coolest thing that weve ever gotten to work on Sukle says But its a huge challenge Ever since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado in January public health officials have faced an unprecedented challenge explaining to teens why they shouldnt smoke weed even though its legal for their parents to do so Surveys and focus groups the state conducted prior to launching the campaign suggest that some teens didnt have a clue that smoking marijuana could hurt them Sukle says Because of medical marijuana a lot of kids thought it cured cancer They really started thinking there was no harm to it Campaigns against teen drinking and tobacco use have generally focused on the health risks But while theres no dearth of research that shows tobacco is bad for us the research on marijuanas effects is still in the preliminary stages Since marijuana isnt legal in most states its been hard for researchers to get federal funding for studies as well as access to large amounts of the substance The Colorado campaign depends on small studies that are hardly bulletproof The brains of teen marijuana users show significant abnormalities the website says Thats technically true  researchers from Northwestern University observed differences in the brains of  casual pot users as compared to  nonusers However the researchers cant say that these differences are caused by marijuana use and there isnt any evidence to show that these differences are associated with any harm Plus the number of people in the study is so small its not reliable A lot of the facts are from studies that are preliminary And we wanted to be honest with the kids about that Sukle says Hence the lab rat theme Maybe marijuana isnt going to be as bad as it looks he says but it could be really damaging The campaign asks teens whether they want to take that risk To be sure there is a growing body of evidence that shows that marijuana isnt good for the developing brain says   who directs the Division on Substance Abuse at Columbia University The adolescent brain is still maturing he says and teens who use marijuana are more likely to become dependent on it than adults Plus these days marijuana contains more of the psychoactive ingredient THC than the stuff that John Lennon used to smoke back in the s Kleber says The trouble is those messages arent quite as specific or compelling as the ones in Colorados campaign Thats part of the challenge in developing a public health campaign says   the director of the Center for Marketing and Social Issues at Colorado State University who is not involved in the lab rat campaign What you have to be very careful about is that your message is credible and its believable Kelly says Dont be a lab rat is a far cry from scare campaigns like   the  antimarijuana film that has become a camp classic Theyre not positioning the message as this is absolutely fact Colorados approach seems promising Kelly says Colorado is trying to use a strategy thats somewhat similar to what they do with the Truth campaign against cigarettes she says That   which is funded by the nonprofit American Legacy Foundation aims to expose Big Tobaccos lies and manipulation and show kids how the industry tries to trick them into smoking The underlying message is dont be made a fool Kelly says Dont let them convince you that this is safe In Colorado Sukles firm and thirdparty evaluators are tracking how teenagers are responding to the message Still while the campaign may discourage some teens from trying marijuana it doesnt teach those who are going to use it anyway how to reduce risk The first message we need to get out there is Dont use marijuana  says   chief of the Adolescent Medicine division at Seattle Childrens Hospital But if you do dont get behind the wheel Researchers and public health officials are still trying to figure out the best ways to talk to teens about the drug Walker says I think we have some more work to do
