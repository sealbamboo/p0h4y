Her laidback sense of humor belies an ambitious drive A year ago Bastidas didnt even know how to swim But on March  she finished swimming  miles in the Caribbean to complete that leg of her triathlon challenge On April  she crossed the USMexico border averaging about  miles a day on her bike  In  Australian David Holleran completed a triathlon consisting of a mile swim mile bike ride and a mile run He holds the record for the longest triathlon according to Guinness World Records  Bastidas will more than double that distance swimming  miles biking  miles and running  miles for   before reaching Washington near the end of April Its a grueling journey even for someone used to tackling ultra races But theres something driving Bastidas other than the desire to break a world record Shes determined to raise awareness about human trafficking and stop it  Im prepared to do whatever it takes Bastidas said after a particularly rough patch of riding in Mexico If you dont risk everything thats not courage Just a few days ago the triathlete hopped off her bike and laced up her sneakers to begin her run into the US capital    Her triathlon route covered major human trafficking routes team member Alexis Rhyner said when I asked why Bastidas was traveling so far It was also important to her that the route pass through both countries and both capitals to unify both nations to fight the issue together and take responsibility for what is happening in and between our two borders Thousands of children are sold for sex every day in Mexico and the United States according to   a child advocacy group Bastidas has teamed with to film a documentary of her journey  We all know its wrong Bastidas said Its still happening And its preventable She was sexually abused first by a family member she said then again later in life At  she said she was kidnapped in Mexico City by men who intended to sell her into slavery She escaped only with the help of the brother of one of her captors Some days when Bastidas finishes her mileage survivors wait to thank her  You cant meet someone whos said Ive been raped too and go home and not care about it she said What I do is that just remind people its not just a cause Were your family your sisters your daughters your mothers  She tells anyone who will listen that what shes doing is a metaphor for life If she can do this  break the world record for the longest triathlon  then human trafficking can be eradicated forever  This is the best way I can illustrate that nothing is impossible she said Bastidas first started running in  when her oldest son Karl was diagnosed with an incurable eye condition called   Soon after she signed up for the Canadian Death Race  and made it  miles before having to pull out due to hypothermia  Since then shes run hundreds of races and even climbed the worlds   to raise money to find a cure for genetic blindness    With this triathlon shes supporting a new cause Anywhere from   are trafficked across international borders each year according to a  report from the US State Department Those lucky enough to be rescued are left with permanent physical and emotional scars  Bastidas wants the Be Relentless documentary to change peoples perceptions of true strength Its not the strength its taken her to attempt the worlds longest triathlon Its the inner strength found in women and children who survive years of unimaginable abuse    Its only  miles she told me emphatically at the beginning of her journey in Cancun Its so worth it Think about it Its a childs life Its a human beings life This is nothing  its nothing compared to that
