Barbara Neff of Santa Monica is one of the roughly  million Californians who recently got word that their health insurance coverage would be expiring soon The canceled plans   as people realized President Obamas promise  If you like your plan you can keep it  didnt apply to everyone But Neff a yearold selfemployed writer isnt outraged Shes relieved Even though she makes too much money to receive a subsidy to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act the policy cancellation was good news for her Shes not the only one Other Californians are also finding that having their plans canceled allows them to sign up for better coverage Neff says she has been stuck in a bad plan because treatment for a back problem years ago redflagged her with a   The deductible has ranged anywhere from  to as high as  which means I have to spend that much each year before the insurance even kicks in she says I was rejected from a more affordable policy because Id had a bout of sciatica five years previously that has never returned Starting Jan  the federal health law will prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more for such preexisting problems That has opened an array of options for Neff who has enrolled in a new plan through Californias staterun insurance marketplace   On Thursday the state health exchange board voted unanimously that it   canceled policies rejecting the presidents   for the problem Neffs new policy has a  deductible and her premium will go up by  a month Under the federal law shell no longer have to pay for preventive care and she figures that alone will more than make up for the additional premium costs Ive been paying for my mammograms out of pocket and thats  to  per year Neff says That type of care is  percent covered under this new policy Huge deductibles have been the norm for Tim Wilsbach a yearold TV editor who lives in Culver City with his family Like Neff Wilsbach makes too much to qualify for federal subsidies so when he received his cancellation notice a few weeks ago he was worried that his premium would go up Wilsbach has two plans for his family The one being canceled is a barebones policy with an  deductible that he has for himself and his yearold son It was not a great policy he says which is essentially why we had a second plan for my wife which we paid a little more for Wilsbach and his wife are planning to have a second baby so they bought a policy for her with better coverage and a  deductible After getting the cancellation notice Wilsbach checked out plans on the Covered California website and he was pleasantly surprised He found a plan for the whole family that offers broader coverage a  deductible and a more affordable monthly premium Our premium went down not quite  bucks and just looking through what the plan covers versus what used to be covered yeah Im quite happy about it Wilsbach says Jane Bradford  is a stayathome mom in Pasadena Shes losing the HMO insurance she has for herself and her three kids who are   and  Her policy offers low copays for doctor visits and a relatively low  family deductible but shell shed no tears to see it go Bradford says thats because she has found several plans that will cost hundreds less in monthly premiums  even though her husbands income is too high for the family to qualify for a federal subsidy Saving possibly  or more a month is awesome so Im not sad at all Bradford says None of this comes as a surprise to   a senior researcher at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute in San Francisco A lot of the anecdotes about people having policies canceled and gigantic increases are real  but not representative of whats happening more broadly in the marketplace he says Weinberg predicts many people who are losing their policies will come out ahead  even if their premiums go up  because of lower deductibles full coverage of preventive care and no penalties for preexisting conditions Whats more he says health insurance will almost certainly be cheaper for those who qualify for subsidies In California thats an estimated  million people  NPR
