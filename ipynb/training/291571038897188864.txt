Last summer we learned about fake poop made from soybeans that The Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation used to test   at their toilet fair Now weve come across another type of artificial poop and its being created to help people with really bad cases of diarrhea This synthetic stool isnt made of soybeans but instead its a mixture containing  different types of bacteria And oh yeah doctors create the stuff in something called the    a mechanical device that mimics the conditions in your colon Doctors in Ontario Canada developed the synthetic stool  which they call RePOOPulate  to treat people sick with infections from  a   that can cause serious persistent bouts of diarrhea The germ can take hold after people are treated with antibiotics for other infections The researchers   in the current issue of  that the treatment with synthetic poop successfully cured two people of their infections Normal bacteria in your gut help protect against toxic pathogens says   an infectious disease specialist at Kingston General Hospital who led the study When youre sick and take antibiotics you knock out the innocent bystanders too That messes up the ecosystem in your gut Most people can repopulate the good bacteria naturally but in some cases  which is resistant to many antibiotics takes over The bacteria make a nasty toxin that can make people get really sick Taking more antibiotics usually wipes out   But in some cases Petrof says the pathogen just keeps coming back It becomes a vicious cycle because the antibiotics keep killing the good bacteria Thats where the RePOOPulate could be helpful The idea is to load up the patients GI tract with a bunch of the good bacteria so they push   out of the way To do that Petrof and her team took a stool sample from a healthy yearold woman who hadnt taken antibiotics in  years Microbiologist   who invented the Robogut grew the bacteria from her stool and then sequenced the bugs DNA to figure which species were present Using her clinical experience Petrof selected  bacteria that she knew were healthy The result was an opaque mixture of bacteria which AllenVercoe describes as a vanilla milkshake Really Petrof then put the bacterial cocktail into the intestines of the two patients during colonoscopies The new bacteria slowly grew in the patients guts and pushed out the toxic   Both patients eventually stopped having diarrhea and the transplanted bacteria were still present six months after the procedure Petrof refers to the bacteria elixir as a probiotic but she says its far from the kind you pick up at Whole Foods Most probiotics are labextracted strains of bacteria which are used in the dairy industry she says They arent built to live in your gut so they tend to just pass right through you after you take them she says In contrast the bacteria in the RePOOPulate mixture have evolved to thrive in our gastrointestinal tracts Thats where they normally live she says Plus the mixture is a whole community of bacteria that live together in an ecosystem When you take antibiotics its kind of like stripping out the Amazon forest in your gut she tells Shots Were putting the whole ecosystem back in Gastroenterologist   who wasnt involved in the study says the treatments is just one of several recent   of doctors trying to develop a cleaner version of a fecal transplant In that procedure doctors take a stool sample from a healthy person and transplant it into the GI tract of a patient with   Fecal transplants arent approved by the Food and Drug Administration and there are only a few reports out there showing how effective they are But theyve gotten quite common in the past few years says Pardi whos studies experimental treatments for   at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota More and more practitioners in the US are doing fecal transplants in both large and small centers he tells Shots Our center has done  since September Our success rate is similar to whats been reported about  to  percent But fecal transplants have a few problems Pardi says Each transplant requires a unique donor so its expensive And doctors really dont know which bacteria are getting moved between people A pure culture of bacteria like RePOOPulate could be safer and more reproducible Pardi says A fecal transplant is like taking a sledgehammer to kill   It puts millions of bacteria into the patient Pardi tells Shots Theres tremendous enthusiasm now for finding what the key components of that hammer are
