Its lunchtime at Oakland High School in Oakland Calif and that means fence hoppers Several kids wear mischievous grins as they speedily scale a foothigh metal perimeter In theory anyway Oakland High is a closed campus Thats done in the interest of safety and security and to cut down on schoolskipping It means kids cant leave during school hours without parental consent especially at lunchtime But it doesnt stop several students from breaking out Inside the cafeteria the lines are long and complaints about the food are as plentiful as the fence jumpers Todays lunch is popcorn chicken potatoes and tamales A plastic bowl with little packets of carrot sticks looks lonely The food is dry and burned says freshman Mary Thomas Its just nasty And junior Olivia Moore says the lines leave little time to actually eat and socialize I need more time because I eat slow and then theres not enough free time Moore says The school lunch   in America is a longgone relic At many public schools today kids are lucky to get more than  minutes to eat Some get even less time And parents and administrators are concerned that a lack of time to eat is unhealthful especially given that about onethird of American kids are overweight or obese The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that students get at least  minutes for lunch But that means  minutes to actually sit down and eat  excluding time waiting in line or walking from class to cafeteria At Oakland High over  percent of the students qualify for free or reducedprice lunch And officially students get about  minutes for the meal But Jennifer LeBarre Oakland Unified School Districts nutrition services director admits that the actual table time is far shorter At times its just  minutes I think its a legitimate complaint that theres not enough time to eat LeBarre says If we are being asked to eat our lunch in  minutes thats not enough for us So I really think we need to really work more for the minute table time Oakland High is hardly alone In a wideranging   by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health  percent of parents of students from kindergarten through fifth grade surveyed said their child only gets  minutes or less to eat Ironically relatively new federal schoolnutrition guideline changes may be making the situation worse Under federal rules schools have to increase the availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables  among other changes Its part of an effort to improve nutrition and combat childhood obesity But eating more healthful foods can take more time LeBarre says Its going to take longer to eat a salad than it will to eat french fries At many schools lunch schedules arent changing Julia Bauscher who is president of a national advocacy group called the   says administrators are under intense pressure to increase instruction time and boost standardized test scores The lunch period is often the first place they look to steal time Theyve got to get in this many instructional minutes and this is our expected annual yearly progress on the test she says Youve got two important and competing priorities there Exacerbating the time crunch nationally is the reality that more students are taking part in the free or reducedcost school lunch programs Many schools are now adding free dinners as well under a new USDA dinner program launched this year Bauscher is also the nutrition services director for Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky She says in her area  percent of the students are participating in meals programs  including free dinners for some Weve got a higher number of students eligible for free and reduced meals than ever So as more of them take advantage of those programs you get longer food lines she says Some possible solutions  such as adding lunch periods more food stations or service workers or lengthening lunchtimes  can be costly And many budgetstrapped schools today simply dont want to risk the added price Nicola Edwards of   says parents need to be central to any solution Parents cant effectively preach to kids about healthful food and quality lunchtime she says and then model grabbing something unhealthful on the go Parents need to be modeling good eating behaviors and not shoving food through the window in the back of the car as theyre on their way to work or to school Edwards says Part of helping people is really making them understand the importance of eating and taking the time to eat
