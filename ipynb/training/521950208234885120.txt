BERLIN - A United Nations medical worker who was infected with Ebola in Liberia has died despite "intensive medical procedures," authorities said Tuesday. The St. Georg hospital in Leipzig said the 56-year-old man, whose name has not been released, died overnight of the infection. It released no further details.. The man tested positive for Ebola on Oct. 6, prompting Liberia's UN peacekeeping mission to place 41 staff members who had possibly been in contact with him under "close medical observation." He arrived in Leipzig for treatment on Oct. 9 where he was put into a special isolation unit.
