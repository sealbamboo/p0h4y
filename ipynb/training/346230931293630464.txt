Stevens father had been diagnosed with cancer The doctors didnt think he would make it Pale and bald he didnt look himself Steven wanted to take a picture made a video just in case Dad refused I got so mad Steven remembers I regret not just coming up to him and saying Dad five minutes  Stevens dad died on June   The only time I can hear his voice is on our answering machine for two seconds Steven says Hi Heinz family leave a message Teens whove lost a dad to cancer are a lonely bunch this Fathers Day I met many of them while researching the    They werent shy about sharing their pain  and their philosophy about coping with the loss of a parent They really did bare their teenage souls These kids have learned lessons that make them wise beyond their years Theyve learned that life isnt fair that prayers dont always get answered that losing a loved one is a true test At my dads rosary service they read something he wrote when he was really sick says Alison of Idaho It was one word Why He wasnt asking Why me she reflects He just wanted to know Why did this have to happen She adds And so thats a question I have Bianca remembers her dad when he was dying telling her hed be there for her graduation for her wedding day And then he died two weeks before Christmas she says The therapists I interviewed for the book said a dying parent shouldnt make promises that cant be kept Five years after her dads death Bianca has a different perspective Im glad he made those promises If he hadnt I would feel like he didnt love me When I met Bianca she said that she and her mom were going to take a hike the next week and spread some of her fathers ashes in a beautiful Virginia park But she didnt want to spread all of them A lot of teens feel that way if their parent has been cremated  the idea of letting all of the ashes scatter to the wind kind of freaks them out Those ashes are a tangible symbol of their missing parent On Fathers Day and every day these kids take solace in last moments spent with Dad Reilly remembers his seemingly invincible dad a former Navy SEAL now lying in a hospital bed and heavily medicated I kept telling him I loved him Reilly says He opened his eyes and looked over It was hard for him to talk I would keep talking being all gooey I knew he was still around I knew he heard me As for Steven hes had ups and downs At school some administrators have suggested that its time to get over it to buckle down and pay attention in class But teen grief like adult grief isnt confined to a few weeks It can linger for months years It can fade away and then roar back  maybe when baseball season starts if Dad used to take the kids to the game maybe on the anniversary of Dads death maybe on Fathers Day Slowly but surely things do get better says Bianca But she adds Dont get me wrong I have my days when I feel like its just awful As child life specialist Kathleen McCue of the cancer support group   in Cleveland put it There is no wrong way to grieve other than not to grieve Even without a father whos there to hug and love them these kids find ways to feel close to their departed dad Morgans dad taught her to play tennis to snow and water ski Every time she raises a racket or puts on skis she remembers her dad Theres not a day that I dont think about him she says And for those teens who this Fathers Day face the possibility of losing their dad Bianca has this advice Spend as much time with him as you can And say whatever you need to say I regret that so many times I didnt say Dad I love you
