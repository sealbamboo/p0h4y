The daily commute to work is something to be put up with rather than enjoyed yet how we get there and how long it takes has an impact on how we feel  Thats hardly surprising when you consider that the average worker in Britain spends  minutes commuting each day This important and everincreasing chunk of the working week doesnt come without its costs  and they are not just financial  feelings of happiness life satisfaction and the sense that ones activities are worthwhile all decrease with every successive minute of travel to work This is what constitutes personal wellbeing and in general the longer the commute the more it shrinks Lengthy commutes between an hour and an hourandahalf long have the most negative effect on personal wellbeing the ONS research found while taking the bus to work on a journey lasting more than  minutes was the commuting option most likely to give us the grumps The  census tells us that  of working people in England and Wales travel by bus or coach to work compared to  by train and  by underground or tram The large majority  drive or get a lift in a car or van In an ideal world commuting should not affect psychological health because it is a choice Commuting journeys increase because people move out of towns and cities to find better housing more green space and a higher standard of living Professor Jenny Roberts from the University of Sheffield has researched how wellbeing is affected by changes in commuting times by tracking  men and  women over  years In contrast the ONS report is based on a oneoff survey of more than  people in employment between  and  She discovered in her paper published in the   that women were adversely affected by commuting while men were not despite the fact that women in general commute less and work shorter hours This was after accounting for income job satisfaction and housing quality So why are women more sensitive to time spent commuting The only reason we could come up with was tripchaining Prof Roberts explains Women tend to make more interim stops on their journey via the nursery or the school or the shops so they have less flexibility and do more multiple activities This adds stress to commuting Commuting affects wellbeing because of the link between stress and mental health which is well established The stress is caused by a lack of control during commuting caused by delayed trains traffic jams and unpredictable weather for example Research also shows that boredom and social isolation among commuters can lead to unhappiness However some commuters do find positives in the daily commute because it gives them time to work and read or simply wind down  and the ONS research suggests that a commute time of three hours of more is often a happier experience than shorter journeys This may be because these extralong journeys are a positive lifestyle choice for   who tend to have a higher average income and are able to use their travel time more productively as a result Those who cycle or walk to work have the advantage of knowing that physical activity improves wellbeing but the ONS research says that cycling to work can also be a stressful experience This is particularly true if commuters cycle because of a lack of other options or on a route through heavy traffic In the end the psychological health of commuters is important because everybody commutes but we are often reluctant to analyse how we do it says Prof Rogers Do people really make that calculation when moving out to a suburban house of how much time how much income its going to cost and how its going to affect their mental health
