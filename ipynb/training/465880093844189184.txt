BELHAVEN, N.C.—Last year, 12 people here, including the pastor of the town's Methodist church, were treated for heart attacks at Vidant Pungo Hospital, a local landmark that is a quick walk from the town's main traffic light.. And in the middle of one recent night, Arthur Bonner, a 63-year-old retired salesman, drove himself to the emergency room with a debilitating attack of gout. "I was in serious pain that you can't even imagine," he said.
