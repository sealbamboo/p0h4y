Scientists implanted thin sheets of scaffoldinglike material from pigs into a few young men with disabling leg injuries  and say the experimental treatment coaxed the mens own stem cells to regrow new muscle The research funded by the Defense Department included just five patients a small first step in the complex quest for regenerative medicine But the researchers described some of the men improving enough to no longer need canes or to ride a bicycle again after years of living with injuries that today have no good treatment The real rush for someone like myself is to see this patient being able to do these things and not struggle and have a smile on his face said Dr Stephen Badylak of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine He led the study which was reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine Muscles have some natural ability to regenerate after small injuries But if too much is lost  from a car accident a sports injury or for soldiers a bomb blast  the body cant heal properly Hard scar tissue fills the gap instead Called volumetric muscle loss a severe enough injury can leave an arm or leg essentially useless The new experiment combines bioengineering with a heavy dose of physical therapy to spur stem cells that are roaming the body to settle on the injury and turn into the right kind of tissue to repair it First surgeons remove the scar tissue Then they implant something called an extracellular matrix derived from pigs Its the connective scaffolding that remains after cells are removed from a tissue Without cells the immune system doesnt reject it Such material has been used for many years as a kind of mesh in treatments for skin ulcers and in hernia repair Whats new here The matrix temporarily fills in the injury between edges of remaining muscle As the scaffolding slowly degrades it releases chemical signals that attract stem cells to the site Badylak said Then physical therapy puts tension on the spot in turn signaling the stem cells that they need to form strong stretchy muscle tissue he said Without the exercise Badylak cautioned those cells wont get the message to boost muscle mass and scar tissue could return The treatment was tested on three military veterans and two civilians Each had lost between  percent and  percent of an affected leg muscle  two from the thigh the rest from the lower leg  anywhere from about a year to seven years earlier The men in their s and s underwent a few months of customized physical therapy to get their muscle function to its maximum capacity Then they received the implants followed by more physical therapy that began within  hours after surgery Six months later biopsies and medical scans showed some new muscle grew in all the men The Pittsburgh study is continuing and Badylak would like to test as many as  more patients
