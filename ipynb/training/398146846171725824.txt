Inspectors have found evidence of cancer records at an Essex hospital being tampered with potentially putting patients at risk A detailed report listing what was happening has been produced by the Care Quality Commission after inspectors went in at the end of August and start of September The case has now been passed on to the police to investigate and the trust  Colchester General  faces being put into special measures and further investigations by the authorities in the NHS In the weeks and months that come there are many questions that need to be answered Inspectors looked at just over  cases and found the care of  may have been compromised All but two of these case were chosen at random That suggests this practice could have been pretty widespread NHS England has set up a specialist team to look at the care given to patients since  The hospital sees about  cancer patients a year although the tampering with records seems so far to be centred around the specialities that deal with cancers such as kidney bladder prostate and colon Senior management of the trust was alerted to what was happening early last year  An internal review was carried out by two members of the trusts executive team but it did not result in the practice being stopped The trust now concedes the investigation was not carried out properly and has apologised for that Colchester has yet to release details of that investigation or even said much about how it was carried out But senior bosses  including the current chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts who has been in post since September   will have to explain themselves soon The trust said a review of what went wrong with this investigation will be carried out Colchester was one of  hospital trusts inspected as part of the Keogh Review into centres with high mortality rates Eleven were subsequently put into special measures but Colchester was one of three that escaped the sanction A whistleblower alerted the Keogh team towards the end of the programme abut the tampering with records and this was passed on to the CQC for follow up Those involved in the Keogh process say there was not sufficient concerns about the leadership of the trust to warrant it being placed in special measures But the fact such a shocking practice was not dealt with by the Keogh inspection process  which has after all formed the basis of the new CQC hospital inspection regime that got under way in September  is a cause for concern One of the elements of the Stafford Hospital scandal was that there was evidence out there about the poor care that patients were receiving  Patient surveys and complaints all pointed to the fact that something was not right The problem was that the people with the power to act either ignored the warning signs or missed them Did the same happen here  It is too early to tell But what we do know is that the trust had a much higher than expected number of complaints being made against it according to the CQC Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing also say they were trying to raise the alarm but managers dismissed their concerns Prof Sir Mike Richards the chief inspector of hospitals says he has never before heard of anything like this happening anywhere else But what this case proves is that problems of this nature are very difficult to spot The CQC inspection team only found evidence of tampering after being told exactly where to look That raises the prospect that it could be going on undetected elsewhere  However as the new hospital inspection regime is rolled out  by the end of  all hospital trusts will have been visited  inspectors are bound to be keeping an eye out for this sort of practice
