Think a shorter workweek will make you happier Maybe not a new study suggests South Korea changed its labor regulations in  reducing the work week to five days a week and  hours from the previous sixday hour week providing a natural experiment to test whether working fewer hours would increase happiness Robert Rudolf an assistant professor of economics at Korea University in Seoul studied the period  to  when average working hours gradually declined by about  percent His results   Using data from an annual survey of  Korean households Dr Rudolf analyzed overall job satisfaction and overall satisfaction with life before and after the changes in working hours Using a fivepoint scale ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied he found that for both sexes a reduction in hours had no effect on job or life satisfaction So should we still aim to reduce working hours Probably not Dr Rudolf said but I am a big fan of flexible working solutions with flextime parttime options etc In my opinion higher personal freedom about their work flanked with welldesigned performance targets will make workers both happier and more productive
