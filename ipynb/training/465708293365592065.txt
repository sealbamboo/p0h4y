They asked the teens about how often their parents smoked and also about whether the kids themselves smoked and if so, how much.. Not surprisingly, teens whose parents were regular smokers were more likely to smoke. But teens whose parents had quit were not any more likely to smoke than the children of nonsmokers.. And for every year that the parents smoked, the odds the teenager would take up the habit increased, Mays and colleagues report in the journal Pediatrics.. “Research also suggests that offspring of parents who quit smoking are less likely to begin smoking and those who already smoke are more likely to quit,” they wrote..
