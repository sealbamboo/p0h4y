Were growing accustomed to mixologist mavericks vaporizing freezing and whipping our cocktails So why not turn a margarita or cosmopolitan into a powder Now its been done And the federal government approved the first powderized alcohol a law firm   Saturday on its blog Bevlog The firm which specializes in alcoholic beverage regulation dug up  from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau confirming the approval of seven varieties of   But then on Monday Tom Hogue the agencys director of congressional and public affairs told CNN the approval was in error Either way the   making the powdered quaff has months maybe years of legal hurdles ahead before the product reaches liquor stores Bevlog notes The idea behind Palcohol is simple dehydrated vodka or rum inside a little airtight package Tear open the package sprinkle the powder into tonic water and voila Youve got a vodka tonic with an alcohol concentration about the same as a regular cocktail about  proof but the exact alcohol concentration will depend on how much liquid you add In other words its like an adult version of Kool Aid or Country Time Lemonade The company   on its website its also planning to sell flavored cocktail versions So you can carry in your purse purse pulverized cosmopolitans mojitos or lemon drops for that impromptu party or picnic And of course the company is working on a margarita mix called Powderita The team has even sprinkled the concoction on food Weve been experimenting with it like adding Powderita powder to guacamole  It gives the food a kick the company writes The idea of powdered alcohol is not new Similar products are already available in Japan Germany and the Netherlands But lawyers at Lehrman Beverage Law are skeptical that Powderita will ever make it into your guacamole I am not astonished that this is a real product a lawyer from the firm wrote on the blog But I am absolutely astonished that this is approved  The product seems highly likely to raise a large number of legal issues and controversies For starters each state has to set regulations for the sales and distribution of the powdered alcohol It could take some states a while to get all the rules and laws on the books although California is well prepared for such innovations It already has   laid out for powdered distilled spirits And some in the business are unlikely to welcome the competition Most of this stuff would need to go through licensed wholesalers with a strong stake in the status quo the lawyer writes So dont assume they will be eager to carry this And then theres the question about safety and the potential for abuse Palcohols inventor   says he has developed the highproof product because he wanted an easy way to carry mixed drinks on hiking and kayaking trips But dehydrated alcohol could be used for more devious  and illegal  activities such as sneaking liquor into concerts and sporting events If you dissolve Palcohol in enough water then the resulting drink has a proof similar to that of regular vodka or rum But in theory a person could use too little water and create a shot with a dangerous concentrations of alcohol Palcohol company had better get some really really good liability insurance the lawyer adds
