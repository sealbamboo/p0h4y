Like more than 48 million other Americans, the Wisconsin stay-at-home mom does not have insurance to pay for doctor bills if she gets sick.  It's particularly disconcerting when she thinks about her husband, Chris, who runs a tree-cutting business. Being an arborist is physically demanding. He has fallen out of trees., "You know something as simple as a sprained ankle, none of that is covered right now, none of it," Braun-Gross said. "To add the cost of that to the debt we already have, we'd basically be up a creek.", Braun-Gross and her husband have tried to get insurance before, but they don't qualify. They both work hard, and they're college educated. But because of some pre-existing conditions, including Braun-Gross' weight, insurance companies haven't wanted their business.,  will change all that.  The law forbids insurance companies from rejecting people like Braun-Gross because of their , . To make that affordable, though, one of the most controversial parts of the Affordable Care Act is about to go into effect: , every American, with some very few exceptions, will have to have some form of health insurance or be fined.  , The idea is that more healthy people will buy insurance, and the money the insurance companies save on them will cover the costs of insuring the older and sicker people who will now be in the insurance system.,  , Employers will provide insurance for three out of every five Americans in 2014, according to the ,   Another 12% get it through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.  , But for those Americans without insurance, a central feature of Obamacare --   , , also known as exchanges -- can make a big difference in helping them find a plan.  Many are eligible for government help to pay for those plans., With so many politicians fighting over this controversial legislation, and with all the computer glitches, the details about how to sign up may have gotten a little lost. So, here is what Braun-Gross and the other millions of Americans like her need to know., Open enrollment runs between October 1 and March 31.  Plans bought through the exchanges this year , until January 1., In most of the country December 24 is the cutoff date if you want your plan to start on January 1.

If you sign up after that in January or February your coverage will start the following month.  The enrollment period closes March 31 and won't re-open until October 15., When Massachusetts rolled out a similar health insurance mandate in 2007, the biggest spike in enrollments came in the two months before people would be charged a penalty for not having coverage, according to , , who ran the state's health benefit exchange then.

The government site lets you plug in your ZIP code and it will give you the closest location to get help.

All offer free preventive care.  , cap out-of-pocket costs to $6,350 and $12,700 per family.  No one can be turned away. No one will be penalized because of their gender (women often paid more in the old insurance system).

"In Massachusetts we had people flooding in to sign up.  You know Americans are almost uniquely law-abiding people, we massively overpay our taxes in terms of what people do in the rest of the world.  When you say it is the law to have health insurance I think people will get health insurance.", Enroll America, a nonpartisan nonprofit that is helping educate Americans about the program, said it has had a positive response once people have an explanation of what's coming.  , "For the most part, the people we encounter are thrilled that they will finally have health care," said , 's Jessica Barbara Brown. "For many people this will be the first time they have ever had access to care. This can be life-changing.", Brown cautions that really this enrollment process has been a "marathon," not a sprint, and people should take as much time as they need to figure out which plan is best for them.

"I will be getting quotes online and making some phone calls to get the ball rolling for my husband and me."
