For decades the annual Pap test was womens chief protection against cervical cancer That all changed when a test for human papillomavirus the cause of most cervical cancer was approved in  With the HPV test women dont need to get Pap tests as often But that message hasnt gotten through to many doctors Just  percent of clinicians ordered HPV tests for women when they went in for a checkup in five Michigan clinics researchers found Other doctors were ordering the HPV test too often Many still performed annual Pap tests even though women can wait for five years if they tested free of HPV And some doctors were prescribing annual Pap tests and HPV tests That is really excessive says   a cancer prevention researcher at the University of Michigan He is a coauthor of the   which was published Thursday in the   Most people are infected with HPV at some point in their lives its sexually transmitted In most cases our bodies clear the virus but some women can have infections that linger for years That puts them at much higher risk of cervical cancer The   looks for precancerous cells on the cervix and is recommended for women starting at age  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But the Pap returns a lot of false positives a simple bacterial infection can make cells look abnormal So women with an abnormal Pap have to go through a lot of retesting and anxiety over whether they might have cancer before finding out theyre fine Adding in the   to   helps reduce the number of false positives If a woman over age  tests negative for HPV shes much less likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer So she can wait five years until the next round of combined HPV and Pap testing according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups That saves time money and the risks of false positives Sounds good But is it working Sort of This study looked at the experiences of  women between the ages of  and  who went to five Michigan family medicine clinics from  to  The good news is that the clinicians requests for HPV tests increased over time going up  percent They were getting the message about the new protocol But the fact that less than half of clinicians were ordering HPV tests suggests that either word hasnt gotten out or its gotten garbled Others ordered that women repeat both the Pap and HPV test annually Pap tests are currently   every three years for women in their s Women ages  and above who dont do the HPVPap combo should get a Pap test every three years too according to the guidelines Mack and his colleagues figured that the younger clinicians would be better at this since they wouldnt be stuck in their ways But they were wrong Older and younger clinicians were equally indifferent when it came to ordering HPV tests The real stars of the show were women Female doctors were twice as likely as their male peers to properly prescribe the HPV test Female physicians may just be paying more attention to womens health issues Ruffin says Or they may be better at discussing a sensitive issue like testing for a sexually transmitted virus They may be more aware more attuned he tells Shots Ruffin doesnt blame his fellow doctors for doing a less than stellar job at cervical cancer screening Were in transition he says This is just one step Five years from now he says we might be talking about women being able to do HPV tests at home popping a swab in an envelope and mailing in their results That method is already being explored in other countries and may someday be expanded to include tests for other common STDs such as chlamydia or gonorrhea Ruffin says The best way to screen for cervical cancer is really going to change
