Once again theres proof that using your noggin to work hard pays handsome dividends  this time in protecting brainpower as you age And once again research is underscoring that for brains too you either use it or lose it In a large group of yearold Scots people who worked intellectually demanding jobswhich required flexibility focus problemsolving and lots of interaction with otherswere smarter and had better memories than those whose jobs were less cognitively demanding That finding held up even after researchers accounted for early differences in intelligence education and childhood circumstances Among men and women whose job description entailed the regular manipulation of complex data not only did general intelligence hold up nicely at age  but so did the speed at which incoming stimuli were processed For those whose jobs entailed complex interactions with people general intelligence memory and IQ were higher at age  than for those who worked at less complex jobs The latest findings are   in the journal Neurology The existence of a large Scottish study of children born in  dubbed the Lothian Birth Cohort allowed researchers to discern how much of a yearolds mental function is a result of early intelligence and how much may represent mental musculature developed in the workplace The study participants all had been IQtested around the age of  Of those  men and  women were tracked down around the time they turned  and administered a battery of cognitive tests including IQ Virtually all of the subjects were retired by then But their work histories were taken and using a svintage coding system developed for the US census the jobs they held were assessed for their general level of complexity in dealing with data with people and with things In line with many other studies the latest research finds that intelligenceor at least that measured by IQ teststends not only to be stable across a persons lifetime but to powerfully influence the type of work an individual undertakesÂ  So its no great surprise that a child with a high IQ after a lifetime of academic and professional challenge will become an older person with a high IQ But the new research suggests that whereas a child with more modest cognitive abilities has grown up and been drawn into complex work he or she is more likely to become an older adult with betterthanusual mental function And to the extent that bright children are funneled into menial occupations theyre likely to lose some of the mental horsepower they started out with That makes the effect of occupational complexity pretty small the researchers acknowledged It may explain the  to  of the cognitive variation seen in older adults But that is on a par with a variable such as smoking which also marginally erodes mental performance later in life Interestingly given the fact that mens and womens occupational paths were dramatically different in the generation examined researchers found no major differences between the sexes in cognitive powers at age  Clearly occupational complexity does not rise and fall with pay and many of the jobs overwhelmingly held by womenincluding teachinghad high levels of complex human interaction
