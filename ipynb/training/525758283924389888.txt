 Can Ebola be transmitted through semen Could a man infect a woman through sex before he overtly falls ill In particular could Dr Craig Spencer who spent several days with his fiance after his return from Africa and before his infection was detected on Oct  have infected her through sexual contact  Were not supposed to say never in public health but Id say its extremely extremely extremely extremely unlikely said Dr   of the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine who has studied levels of virus in Ebola victims and survivors Ebola virus has been found in the semen of male survivors for up to  days after the onset of symptoms according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention So health authorities  being cautious  usually recommend that men who recover use condoms or abstain from sex including oral sex for three months However there have been  outbreaks of Ebola since the disease was first discovered in  and sex has never emerged as a major risk factor Though multiple studies have shown that Ebola virus can persist in semen for longer than in blood or other body fluids sexual transmission of Ebola has not been definitively established the agency concludes on   The highest levels of virus are consistently found in blood vomit and feces and the virus is usually detectable in them from the moment the patient tests positive Virus levels in blood vomit and feces are low when symptoms first appear then rise rapidly to a peak at Day  or so then start to go down and are low again by Day   if the patient survives that long The virus starts to rise later in other fluids including saliva and tears but never to such intense concentrations as it does in blood vomit and feces Its unclear whether theres ever whole virus in sweat The number of men whose semen levels have been measured in studies is small When the virus was found in semen in studies it was usually at levels so low that it was not detected by standard viral culture tests but only by polymerase chain reaction or PCR testing Also Dr Bausch explained the testicles are one of several parts of the body along with the eyes and the brain that are immunologically protected It is harder for pathogens to enter them and harder for the immune system to clear those pathogens if they do get in For that reason he said it is extremely unlikely that Dr Spencer or any man has infectious levels of Ebola virus in his semen before the peak of his infection The salivary glands in contrast Dr Bausch said are not protected So if there was any danger in intimate contact with Dr Spencer kissing was probably the greater risk Dr Bausch said But because viral loads begin to rise in saliva days later than they do in blood the risk was probably near zero he added
