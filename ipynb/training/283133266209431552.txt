When Sarah Gardner was  she started getting really worried about whether shed ever have kids I bought this kit online that said that they could tell you your ovarian reserve Gardner now  says These kits claim they can tell women how long their ovaries will continue producing eggs and how much time they have left to get pregnant Well mine said we advise really you have a baby now Well sadly that letter arrived three weeks after I just split up with my longterm partner So yeah it opened a massive can of worms really she says That can of worms eventually led Gardner to   a surgeon at the Infertility Center of St Louis Silber offers women a procedure that he claims will basically put their biological clocks on ice It stops the clock which is an incredible power to have Gardner says You know the biological clock is every womans demon really What Silber offers is a surgical procedure that removes part or all of an ovary so it can be frozen and then transplanted back when a woman is ready to try to have children We can take the ovary out of a young woman or part of an ovary  and we can freeze it Silber says And when shes yearsold we can transplant that tissue thats been frozen for the last  or  years and loandbehold shes got a yearold ovary and itll last for another  years But no one hoping to stop their biological clock has actually gotten pregnant with the help of Silbers procedure And using ovarian transplant this way is controversial It was developed for women with medical problems that would damage their ovaries mostly cancer patients getting chemotherapy   It is not a procedure that should be done electively for women to preserve fertility just to reduce  the decline in fertility as women age says   president of the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology It really should be reserved for patients that are at imminent risk of losing their fertility in the very near shortterm Cancer patients really have no other options Schattman says No one really knows how well it works for other women especially years or even decades later We know there are  pregnancies that have been achieved in the world after the procedure We dont know what the denominator is how many procedures have been done to achieve those  pregnancies Schattman says The only women who have gotten pregnant with an ovarian transplant are cancer patients And Silber is one of just a handful of doctors doing this for patients just trying to beat their biological clocks The surgical procedures and the freezing and thawing are relatively safe and easy But any procedure carries some risks And Schattman says some eggs are inevitably lost When you transplant the tissue back into somebody you are going to lose some of the eggs in the ovarian tissue And so you are aging the ovarian tissue Schattman says For all these reasons Schattman and other infertility experts recommend women worried about preserving their fertility do something else just freeze some of their eggs We have a known success rate with eggfreezing We do not have a known success rate with ovariantissue freezing Schattman says Other infertility experts agree If we convince ourselves that we this procedure guarantees our fertility for the future we may say Well OK then let me just take the next eight years and take this degree and finish this project open up a new business because I have this guarantee says   of the New York Medical College And then in the end it turns out that actually that guarantee was not there But Silber says the success for cancer patients makes it clear the procedure would work for other women as well If you say that we dont have evidence for ovaryfreezing working and thats experimental thats kind of baloney Silber says It is not experimental anymore It really is a very robust procedure In fact Silber argues it avoids the risks of eggfreezing like having to inject women with lots of powerful hormones For her part Sarah Gardner tried egg freezing but it didnt work out for her So shes happy she had the opportunity to pay  to freeze one of her ovaries It took a lot of pressure off you know that whole having to find the guy and get it done you know and get to have children There is no time limit for me now They can defrost it at any point and put it back in Gardner says Gardner knows there are no guarantees That after all this it may not end up working But for now shes just grateful for the hope that it will
