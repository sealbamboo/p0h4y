I have often felt sorry for people whose cruise ship vacations were marred by a nasty gastrointestinal virus that kept them quarantined in their cabins and sometimes cut short the trip But now that Ive endured two separate bouts of this bug formerly called   and now known as   my empathy has skyrocketed Norovirus is to put it mildly misery incarnate One minute youre fine and the next you think youre dying  or that dying would be preferable My first infection was almost certainly acquired at a   party several years ago at least  attendees became ill The next evening at a school event with my grandsons I abruptly abandoned them to race to the restroom I sweated through my clothes and could not stand unaided I spent the night on my bathroom floor with frequent intermissions on the toilet Fast forward to this February The symptoms were virtually identical but this time I could only guess at the source of my discomfort a salmonavocado sushi roll I had eaten for lunch  hours earlier Noroviruses have the dubious distinction of being the leading cause of gastrointestinal infections in the United States where they account for an estimated half of all such ailments The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that each year noroviruses cause an estimated  million illnesses and  deaths About  percent of infections occur from November to April when people tend to congregate in enclosed spaces with little fresh air circulating The current strain first identified in Sydney in  has been responsible for several outbreaks on cruise ships where the highly contagious and difficulttokill virus can easily infect hundreds of passengers It has been nicknamed the Ferrari of viruses for the speed at which it can spread through groups An outbreak on the Queen Mary  in December  sickened   One infected traveler on the Royal Caribbeans Vision of the Seas among  guests and three crew members  last March reported being confined to his cabin for two days during which time he counted  trips to the bathroom  vomiting and   are the usual symptoms Others include stomach cramps   lowgrade     and fatigue that can persist for days after the main symptoms abate Although usually lasting just one to three days a norovirus infection can be hazardous particularly for infants the elderly and people with compromised immunity The greatest risk is   stemming from vomiting and watery diarrhea The virus spreads readily in confined spaces like day care and retirement centers schools hotels and   as well as on cruise ships Most ships try hard to prevent outbreaks providing alcoholbased hand sanitizers for passengers and crew but the virus often persists despite such deterrents A case or capsid that surrounds the virus makes it especially hard to kill It can even survive hand and sometimes machine dishwashing and laundering And when a toilet with contaminated excretions is flushed the virus can become airborne unless the lid is shut first Contaminated clothing linens and towels should be handled carefully preferably with gloves machinewashed separately in hot water and machinedried Contaminated toilets and other hard surfaces should be washed with a  percent   solution one part bleach to nine parts water hydrogen peroxide Lysol or a commercial bleachbased cleaning product Carpets and upholstered furniture need steam cleaning No vaccine is yet available One developed by LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals is being tested In a randomized trial financed by the manufacturer it   The existence of at least five genetic groups and  subgroups of norovirus makes developing an effective vaccine difficult Meanwhile frequent hand washing with soap and hot water for at least  seconds especially after using the toilet is the best preventive Failing to do so risks transferring the virus to foods drinks or utensils used by others It takes only a small inoculation of norovirus to cause illness Furthermore the virus can persist for days or weeks on hard surfaces which speaks to the importance of thoroughly washing your hands before eating preparing food and drinks or serving others You can also infect yourself by touching your nose or mouth with viruscontaminated hands Anyone who becomes infected should refrain from handling food or drink to be consumed by others during the course of symptoms and for at least three days after Occasionally an infected person can spread the virus for a week or two after recovering so diligent handwashing after using the toilet is a must Restaurant workers most of whom do not get paid sick leave are a major concern those who come in sick or too soon thereafter can spread the virus to hundreds of diners Affected customers may label the ailment   which it is in a sense but the real source is the handler Foods most often linked to norovirus outbreaks include raw shellfish leafy greens fresh fruits and readytoeat foods Vegetables and fruits should be washed and shellfish are safest when thoroughly cooked Symptoms usually occur within  to  hours of ingesting norovirus As I experienced the illness comes on suddenly Youre fine one minute then very sick the next as if hit by a Mack truck There is no treatment other than replacing lost fluids If vomiting is severe medications can reduce it but experts advise against taking an antidiarrheal drug like Lomotil or Imodium which can prolong the infection It is best to avoid sugary drinks which can aggravate diarrhea My doctor advised me to follow a socalled BRAT diet  bananas rice applesauce and toast  for a day or so supplemented by plain fluids broth or diluted juice Drink a cup of liquid to compensate for each large loose stool A rehydration drink like   is suitable for adults as well as babies and children But avoid foods high in fat and sugar as well as spicy foods alcohol and coffee for about two days after symptoms are gone
