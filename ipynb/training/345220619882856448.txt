Starting next month changes are afoot for Medicare beneficiaries who order diabetes supplies  testing strips and lancets  by mail  About  percent to  percent of diabetics on Medicare prefer to receive supplies in their mailboxes a cheaper and often more convenient alternative to local pharmacies and storefronts Yet mailorder diabetes supplies have caused Medicare headaches for years  A Department of Health and Human Services inspector generals report last year for instance reported that  percent of suppliers sent beneficiaries strips by mail which costs less but billed Medicare at the more expensive retail rate Its been an area where theres been a lot of fraud a lot of overutilization and a lot of studies saying Medicare pays too much the taxpayer pays too much and beneficiaries with a  percent copay pay too much too Laurence Wilson director of Medicares chronic care policy group said in an interview Now after a successful experiment in nine metropolitan areas Medicare has instituted competitive bidding for mailorder firms that want to sell strips it has signed contracts with just  carefully vetted companies nationwide  Thats a big shift from the hundreds of suppliers who used to sell strips to Medicare recipients  The process has cut prices sharply  Medicare previously paid  for  mailordered strips now it will pay   That means copayments plummet too from  to   The large mailorder suppliers recognized this was a huge market and they could afford to accept a lower price to reach that volume of customers Mr Wilson said The taxpayer wins This you may recall was the argument for allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to lower prices when Part D was introduced an argument the Bush administration successfully resisted Another piece of good news The tax relief bill that Congress passed last year mandated that Medicare pay retailers the same amount as mailorder companies  So  strips will cost  this year wherever you buy them so long as your pharmacy accepts Medicares reimbursement as full payment  Dont say Congress never did anything for you or for your secondary Medigap insurer if thats who picks up your copays The downside though is that unless the mailorder company you already use made the cut and has become one of the  suppliers that won contracts youll have to change suppliers If you skip mail order and buy supplies locally you dont have to do anything   Medicare has worked to alert beneficiaries state health departments physicians hospital discharge planners and state health insurance assistance programs to this change which takes effect July  You can find a supplier online go to   and enter your ZIP code call MEDICARE or ask your doctors for a referral The folks at the American Diabetes Association are understandably concerned about this process  Last year  million Medicare beneficiaries filed claims for mailorder diabetes supplies  That means hundreds of thousands of people at least probably have to switch to new suppliers   Some have poor vision or impaired cognition or cant use computers  They may have trouble reading the materials Medicare sent or understanding them or remembering whats required The transition could be bumpy This could look to consumers like Medicare isnt covering things said Krista Maier the associations director of public policy  Moreover we have heard anecdotally that some beneficiaries had trouble finding a mailorder supplier that sold their brand of strips  Other Medicare beneficiaries will feel the effects of the competitive bidding process too by the way  In  metropolitan areas those who use certain categories of durable medical equipment  including wheelchairs and walkers oxygen hospital beds and CPAP devices for sleep apnea  may also have to switch suppliers after July  On the whole diabetics should fare well under the new system  They will pay less and gain new protections against fraud  And Medicares monitoring of the first nine test markets shows no negative impact on health   The bottom line is were there any adverse patient outcomes  No Mr Wilson said  We didnt see people go to doctors or hospitals more or to emergency rooms We didnt see more mortality But if an elderly friend or relative gets strips by mail it makes sense to check in and see whether he or she needs to select a new supplier and to help make that happen
