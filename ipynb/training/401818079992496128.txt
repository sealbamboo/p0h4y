Imagine a tiny computer embedded under your scalp thats constantly tracking your brain activity and zapping you when it senses something awry That might sound like science fiction but a medical device that does that was   by the Food and Drug Administration as an option for people with epilepsy thats resistant to treatment with drugs Seizures happen when groups of neurons fire abnormally The new device called the   is able to detect these problems in the brain and fire electrical signals through implanted wires to stop a seizure from happening Implants to treat neurological problems arent completely new Theyre already being used to treat illnesses such as Parkinsons disease and a condition called dystonia Neurologists also use another electronic approach called   to treat some forms of epilepsy But unlike VNS devices the RNS Stimulator senses when seizures are about to occur and nips them at the source The most common problems in clinical tests of the device were infections at the implant site and batteries that ran down too soon The device is made   based in Mountain View Calif The company says each RNS Stimulation system will cost between  and  We spoke with   a neurologist at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville about the approach Here are highlights from the interview edited for length and clarity I think this is substantial This is the first FDAapproved brain implant for epilepsy And its also the first implant of any kind that is responsive to brain activity Epilepsy medications are very effective in a large portion of the population who have epilepsy But when those medications fail particularly if you fail two or more of these medications the recommendation is then to seek surgery or at least seek evaluation There remains a significant population where we do these evaluations and we find that seizure is coming from several different spots or that its coming from a place that is just necessary  for language or for motor activity  and you cant take it out safely What weve had available to us thus far is vagal nerve stimulation The NeuroPace device is like that but it seems to be better Your typical VNS devices dont know what your brain is doing They dont record or respond to any of the changes that are taking place that represent the disease were trying to treat What the new device does is that its simultaneously recording from a particular part of the brain and its sensing when changes occur It still is not a cure to epilepsy Theres a percentage of patients who are seizurefree with the device but its not a large percentage For the majority of patients it simply reduces seizure numbers We have several patients actually And we have several patients who have undergone testing to indentify where they have seizures Weve been waiting for the opportunity to treat them with this device
