Parents arent the only ones fretting about vaccines for young children Trepidation about these routine immunizations has made doctors upset too a new survey shows Fully  of pediatricians and family medicine physicians agree that it is important for kids to get vaccinated against measles diphtheria pertussis and a host of other diseases and to get their immunizations on time according to a   published Monday by the journal Pediatrics In addition  of the doctors agreed that when parents delay some or all of these vaccines they are putting their children at risk of being sickened by a preventable disease Yet  of the doctors who took the survey said they always or often comply with parent requests to delay vaccination and another  said that they sometimes do Only  of the pediatricians and family medicine doctors said they rarely go along with these requests These figures are based on the responses of  doctors who were recruited by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians to share their feelings about vaccine issues in  These doctors work all over the country in a variety of practice settings and their survey answers are thought to be representative of their peers nationwide If parents follow all of the   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the   their children would get roughly two dozen vaccines by the time they are  years old For a growing number of parents of children under  that just seems like too many vaccines too soon So they are asking their childrens doctors to spread out these immunizations which the study authors defined as postponing one or more vaccines with the intent of receiving them later The survey revealed that  of doctors got at least one such request from a parent in a typical month and  of doctors fielded such requests from at least  of the parents in their practices Whats more  of doctors said the number of these inquiries had increased in the previous year compared with only  who said they had become less common during that time These requests are putting real strain on doctors researchers found Four in  of those surveyed said their job satisfaction had decreased as a result of having to deal with parents who dont want to follow the official vaccine schedule Slightly more than onethird of the doctors fretted that by acquiescing to these parents desires they would send a mixed message about the value of these vaccines Such parents could be quite timeconsuming   of the doctors said they spent at least  minutes discussing vaccines with parents who were skeptical about the CDC advice Those conversations would take up more than half of a typical wellchild visit since these last an average of  minutes the study authors noted Managing these parents also created extra work for  of pediatric practices and  of family medicine practices according to the study Doctors gave several reasons for being bothered by the idea of delaying some or all vaccines In addition to the widely shared fear that their patients would become more vulnerable to diseases  many of which can be lifethreatening or result in permanent disability   felt it was more painful for kids to make extra trips to the doctor for separate shots and  worried that the delays would wind up causing unnecessary outbreaks of preventable diseases But its clear that doctors feel they are caught between a rock and a hard place Eight in   survey takers said they thought vaccinewary parents would leave their practice if doctors didnt agree to spread out the immunizations and  felt they needed to comply with the requests in order to build trust with families The survey results also make plain that doctors dont know how to use that trust to persuade dubious parents to follow the advice of the medical establishment Researchers who have been testing messages that might assuage such parents have not had much luck Indeed a   published last year in Pediatrics found that when doctors tried to correct parents false impressions about vaccines these parents actually became less likely to get their children immunized Still  of pediatricians and  of family medicine doctors said they would drop some or all of their patients whose parents insisted on delaying vaccines
