Sodas candy bars and sweet breakfast cereals are entwined in modern life  along with a lot of other questionable choices and bad habits Its hard to know exactly what all of that sugar is doing to our bodies but scientists are making headway Some notsosweet findings  In an unusual  and revealing  experiment from  researchers at UC Davis fed  young adults a sugary but carefully controlled diet In just two weeks subjects who got  of their calories from either fructose or highfructose corn syrup saw a jump in their cholesterol levels A similar study from  found that sugary drinks decreased insulin sensitivity and increased visceral fat in overweight subjects A study that followed more than  men for  years published in March found a correlation between sugary drink consumption and heart attacks  men who drank a single ounce sugary soda every day were about  more likely to have a heart attack during the study period Its not clear if the extra sugar was directly to blame though since people who drink sodas may do other things that put them at risk A  study of nearly  people found a correlation between sugary beverages and blood pressure Specifically a daily ounce serving seemed to raise blood pressure by one or two points A  Spanish study of  healthy adult men found that consuming  grams of fructose a day for two weeks was enough to temporarily raise blood levels of insulin and triglycerides and elevate blood pressure The Nurses Health Study II  which tracked more than  women for eight years  found that women who drank a sugary soft drink every day were  more likely to develop Type  diabetes than women who hardly ever had a sugary drink The  report also found that women who started drinking more soft drinks during the study tended to put on the most weight An eightyear government study of more than  adults found that added sugar seemed to raise the risk of cholesterol trouble Notably the  report found that people with the sweetest diets were  to  times more likely than people who ate relatively little sugar to have low levels of good HDL cholesterol
