I thought I was hurting myself and my family and felt it was better to take my own life rather than endure this any more That is how a French academic currently living and working in Northern Ireland explained the burden of living with a secret addiction He became dependent on prescription drugs without even being aware of it  Alex Bunting head of Corporate Services at   Forum for Action on Substance Abuse in Northern Ireland said that such experiences are not uncommon The whole stigma attached to substance misuse still exists and that is a key element in people remaining silent regarding their addictions  For all the positive work we see on highprofile TV campaigns about removing the stigma of alcohol and substance addiction we have many people coming in to FASA who dont want to tell anyone about their addiction FASA the subject of a BBC Northern Ireland series   was the first communitybased charity in Northern Ireland to offer support for substance abuse suicide selfharm and mental health under one roof Stevie Millar a youth engagement worker with the charity said that there were a number of reasons for people wishing to not tell anyone about their addictions In my experience people can be concerned that knowledge of their addiction could put their job in jeopardy Others are concerned about the effect it will have on their relationship or that it could break up their family he said When people hide their addictions from loved ones they can also at times be trying to convince themselves they dont have a problem Such secret addictions can emerge for a variety of reasons Our anonymous source explained why he doesnt want people to know about his addiction There are many people who may feel they wouldnt like an addict to be teaching their kids So how did he reach such a low point in his life In  my mother was diagnosed with cancer and my father was also unwell Returning to France temporarily to care for my parents and feeling under a lot of pressure I went to see a GP who prescribed me benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines include diazepam and temazepam and are prescribed for a range of conditions such as anxiety and insomnia He said he could not have foreseen the difficulty of the journey he was about to embark on My doctor in France didnt explain that there could be an issue with dependency on the benzodiazepines After several months I stopped taking them but a couple of weeks later I became very sick and suffered physical and mental problems as a result of not taking the medication His father eventually died and struggling to cope he was put on a further course of benzodiazepines  I was also taking antiacid tablets When I stopped taking all my medication it was like a mininuclear explosion in my head I lost over two stones in weight It all led to a mental and physical collapse I couldnt see a way out and thought I was useless and that I would never work again That is when I considered suicide  At this point he began to seek help and was eventually led to FASA He is unequivocal about the importance of the role FASA played in his recovery When youre going through all that you feel alone and that you dont want to burden your family  You need someone who will listen and will help you I wouldnt be here now without FASA they helped me piece my life back together and kept my family together There isnt a pill for every problem He went through a drug reduction course and received counselling and acupuncture all of which he found extremely helpful For him the future is now positive For two years I wasnt myself But Im   back to my old self now FASA helped me continue with my work and Im very lucky it didnt destroy my family he said He only realised he had a dependence on medication when he initially stopped taking it I felt like someone was drilling my stomach I suffered vertigo and anxiety I thought I was maybe going mad or that I had cancer or an ulcer with all my stomach problems  FASAs Alex Bunting said that it is common for people to be unaware they have an addiction Often the person doesnt realise they have a problem until it creeps up on them and impacts their life he said Mr Bunting highlighted some symptoms that may act as possible indicators of an addiction Someone may experience irritability paranoia and anxiety when not taking the medication or substance I would encourage anyone in that position to seek help He said that longterm prescriptions can be dangerous  In the case of cocodamol codeine converts to morphine in the liver and so a lot of people become addicted to morphine he said People can have developed a dependency without realising it for example an older person who has been on codeine for seven years because of a bad hip Mr Bunting is very concerned by the number of people on this type of medication At FASA misuse of prescription medication is the second biggest issue we deal with after alcohol abuse Its important to guard against the perception there is a pharmaceutical answer to lifestyle issues While medication can be very useful it isnt always the answer Dr Alan Stout deputy chair of the   British Medical Association NI GP Committee has seen how helpful a role medication can play in tackling issues such as depression and anxiety but acknowledges other solutions are often required Northern Ireland is facing an epidemic of unhappiness at the moment and there is a challenge to developing community services including counselling further he said Dr Stout said many precautionary steps are taken around prescribing medication  A number of medications are well known to be addictive benzodiazepines are a good example he said  GPs try to reduce their use and prescribing and limit the number issued to patients This is evidenced by the reduction in the number prescribed over the past number of years  If a patient is started on them they will be given a short supply and a review arranged to ensure they do not become dependent on them It is much rarer now to initiate these drugs but some are still recommended through hospital clinics  Dr Stout believes the use of medications that have not been prescribed by the GP and have been obtained illegally is a huge challenge facing society Quite often this is not known to the GP These are often the cases that become a crisis he said Alex Bunting said it is important to remember that an addiction can have farreaching consequences with hidden harm a significant concern The stigma from the addiction filters out and it can affect many people within families with children at times being deeply impacted by being exposed to a parents addiction he said  An addiction can also have as much or more impact on the carer than the person themselves FASA is keen to highlight that substance abuse mental health issues and suicide know no boundaries in terms of class age or gender So what advice does FASA offer people suffering addictions in secret Stevie Millar while understanding people can at times feel vulnerable if their addiction is widely knows considers it vital to speak to someone Being open and honest is not only very important for the person to build support in FASA but its important for them to build support on the outside So its vital to have that support for people to be able to express how they are feeling Episode three of   Tuesday  February
