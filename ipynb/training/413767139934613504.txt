Every year approximately  cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States according to the   but the actual number of infections may be much higher The majority of outbreaks over the last two decades have been linked to live poultry  Pew researchers specifically looked at two recent outbreaks that were connected to chicken produced by Foster Farms in California  Between    people became infected with Salmonella Heidelberg  mostly in Oregon and Washington according to the CDC Tests identified the outbreak strain in four samples of chicken that were traced back to two Foster Farms slaughterhouses Then in the summer and fall of    became sickened with varying strains of Salmonella Heidelberg CDC investigators determined consumption of Foster Farms chicken was the likely source of the outbreak In neither instance did FSIS ask Foster Farms to institute a recall or stop shipping potentially contaminated chicken to market the Pew report authors wrote  No deaths were reported in either outbreak The second outbreak is ongoing according to the CDC which updated its numbers Thursday An additional  people have fallen ill since November  The FSIS acted as aggressively as possible under the authority they had during the Foster Farms outbreaks said Brian Ronholm USDAs deputy undersecretary for food safety He said the USDA appreciates Pews report since it supports the efforts we already have under way  The government agency has a proposal under department review now that would require all poultry slaughterhouses to prevent contamination by conducting microbial testing at two points Ronholm said It would also authorize inspectors to suspend operations in slaughter facilities that cannot demonstrate they are controlling salmonella In a separate paper   it found worrisome levels of bacteria in tests conducted on  chicken breasts including  from brands that use no antibiotics in raising chickens and  organic samples Every one of the four major brands we tested contained worrisome amounts of bacteria even the chicken breasts labeled no antibiotics or organic  Consumer Reports said The most common bacteria found was enterococcus a fecal contaminant in  Next was E coli in  Campylobacter salmonella and staphylococcus aureus were also present according to the report  In response to Consumer Reports the National Chicken Council said poultry producers spend tens of millions of dollars each year researching food safety which has helped significantly decrease foodborne pathogens  Americans eat about  million servings of chicken every single day the council said in a statement and  of those servings are consumed safely The USDA does not require poultry plants to treat the presence of salmonella as a significant risk according to   and has no standards for chicken parts which are purchased more widely than whole chickens FSIS notifies facilities before conducting an investigation Even if tests show unsafe amounts of salmonella the authors wrote FSIS cannot close down the facility  Salmonella is estimated to cause more than  million foodborne illnesses every year according to the Pew Report and healthrelated costs run as high as  billion yearly  The Pew report makes several recommendations for improving USDAs   which the agency posted earlier this month  Change salmonella performance standards so they are updated regularly enforceable and tied to public health outcomes  Consider establishing limits on the amount of salmonella that can be present in chickens as they enter slaughterhouses  Conduct unannounced testing in poultry producing facilities  Close plants that are under investigation and keep them closed until adequate control measures are in place The contaminated product isnt supposed to reach consumers  thats the point Eskin said You see this is a very complicated bacteria Its a challenge and we havent gotten it right yet Ronholm could not offer a time frame for when the FSIS food safety proposal may go into effect He said its important for consumers to remain diligent about food safety practices including washing their hands and cooking food to the right temperatures
