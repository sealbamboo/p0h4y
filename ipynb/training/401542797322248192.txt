The rules that govern how GPs work have been amended yet again after negotiations between doctors leaders and the government  What changes have family doctors seen over the past  years  and how do they think patients have been affected My work has changed dramatically since I started as a GP in   I used to practise from a midterrace house I did a morning afternoon and evening surgery was on call two nights a week and occasionally did weekends too Now I work in purposebuilt premises I dont do outofhours work any more but my surgeries are longer and we are open all day from am till pm I try to finish my paperwork by  then do home visits and then more paperwork before the afternoon surgery which starts at  and usually doesnt finish before  or pm In some respects the changes have been for the good There is much more job satisfaction now We are working longer hours but not working impossible hours  When I started GPs didnt take responsibility for the allround care of patients Now I see my role as close to that of the general consultant physician dealing with more and more complex patients with multiple problems Going back to the Eighties much of that care was done in secondary care in hospitals But patients are in hospital much less often now and we are expected to pick up the pieces when they come out of hospital  In my practice no one works fulltime Everyone does five or six surgeries a week rather than eight We can maintain our sanity that way  Another major change is that we dont do outofhours care any more That was the right thing to do for the vast majority of GPs but the way outofhours care was subsequently organised wasnt good If Im honest the goodwill went out of the system in the Nineties Our work became targetdriven and we were being measured on doing things which some bureaucrat thought was important but GPs didnt Some of the questions I had to ask patients were just stupid Patients attitudes have changed too They tend to come in now with their own idea of whats wrong with them and because they know more about whats available they expect more now But at the same time patients are also taking less responsibility for their own care They want prescriptions even for tablets that can be bought in a chemist and Ive known people to go to walkin centres then come and see me just to check they are getting the right treatment Overall I think GPs are paid well for what they do Its a responsible and difficult job and we were underpaid in the Eighties and Nineties  The pressure and demands on GPs are greater now The number of decisions we make every hour is quite phenomenal As a singlehanded GP the main issue for me is the bureaucracy Weve got to get rid of it Meaningless paperwork has been introduced over the years and it is such a waste of time I have to ask patients impertinent questions and it doesnt play well None of the targets that were introduced were good Getting rid of all that would be welcome Over the years technology has made GPs jobs easier  but the issue of access to medical records is risky What happens if that information is passed onto other people like employers or insurers Thats a concern Getting your prescriptions online is a great idea Booking appointments online is great too if you are internetsavvy but not so good for elderly people who dont have PCs and we need to cater for them too I am the named doctor for all my patients I have always been responsible for them because I work on my own so the latest changes dont affect me My patients can contact me round the clock and get hold of me whenever they like Theres about a weeks waiting time for a nonurgent appointment The government is always talking about a crisis in AE caused by waiting times at doctors surgeries but the only way to keep people out of hospitals is to lie down across the door of AEs People regularly go to AE because they dont try to see their GP first We need to be more blunt about telling people who go to AE that they dont need to be there And we dont emphasise enough how patients can help themselves before running to us But in the end the GP is the ultimate backstop for everyone What we need is better social care alongside GPs to help care for people in the community I started as a GP in  and Ive seen lots of changes in that time I work fewer hours than before when I worked weekends and nights too but that wasnt sustainable Being a fulltime GP still isnt good for general health Instead the work is now incredibly intense and were looking after a different kind of patient who was previously looked after in hospital For example we care for patients with diabetes and other chronic disease although nurses help with much of this work too It is normal to see one complicated patient after another now The way GPs have been micromanaged over in recent years isnt good I want to be allowed to structure my practice the way I want to rather than justifying my time to someone else That has created a huge morale problem among GPs Most still enjoy the job but they feel they are doing a job someone else is telling them to do Patients arent one homogenous group Theyre a variety of groups and its impossible to design a service that is everything to everyone Some people want a named doctor and value seeing the family doctor but others want instant access and they dont care which doctor they see Patients getting appointments when they want is a huge issue There is a large proportion of the population that doesnt have regular contact with their GP and when they do call up they find they cant get an appointment But the public has to realise its difficult I have never had a free appointment in  years as a GP
