Its a bunch of guys sitting around talking About the benefits of birth control About how a woman should take care of herself when shes pregnant About breastfeeding You know the kind of things guys never talk about There are  of them sitting in a circle under a tin roof Some wear long colorful tunics Their flipflops are scattered around the outer edge of the carpet Theyre part of the School for Husbands program in the village of Chadakori in the West African nation of Niger the country with the highest birth rate in the world Niger definitely has a population problem The average woman will have seven children in her lifetime The country is struggling to feed its  million citizens And that number is expected to double over the next two decades Thats where School for Husbands comes in But convincing people to have smaller families is not easy In our culture in the past having a large family was seen as a gift of God a great thing says yearold Maidanda Saidou the sultan or local chief of the region of Dosso Convincing people to have fewer kids runs counter to tradition If you had many kids you are among the gifted ones So a large family is seen as something positive and thats in contrast to what is needed for development The fastgrowing population really hampers the development of the country And theres a long road ahead Niger is one of the poorest leastdeveloped nations on Earth Most people survive off subsistence agriculture in a country primarily covered by desert Standing in a dusty field of millet Ali Hassan the assistant country representative for the United Nations Population Fund in Niger says the population boom is a huge threat to the countrys future Now people are just looking to survive And the governments only priority is to slow down population growth for people to just survive Hassan says Tall green stalks of millet sway above Hassans head Elsewhere in the field other plants barely reach his knees In some spots theres nothing but bare dry dirt Hassan says the countrys conundrum is that it has run out of arable land and yet the population continues to go up In the past they would use a specific place and when the productivity of the soil went down theyd move to another place Now they dont have that possibility and the productivity is just going down and down and down Hassan says In  years of trying to control its population Niger has made little progress Unlike China which cut its birth rate with a highly controversial onechild policy Niger has tried a softdiplomacy approach The government and advocacy groups have launched campaigns centered around delaying marriage for teenage girls and encouraging the use of contraception In a patriarchal society like Nigers the primary roadblocks to social change come from men So in  the UN and the Ministry of Health launched the School for Husbands in Niger At the health clinic in Chadakori the lone doctor Rabo Sleymane says the school is having an impact Six months after the school began he says more women are asking about family planning There are now Schools for Husbands in villages across Niger While overall rates of birth control use are still quite low government officials say the schools have made contraception more acceptable When the schools started only  percent of women in Niger reported using contraception Now that figure is up to  percent And there are signs that the message is starting to get across Asked if hed want  children one man in one school session says Thats ridiculous So how many would he want Thats up to God he answers
