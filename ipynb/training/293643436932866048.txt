Jan   marks the th anniversary of   the landmark Supreme Court decision that   But the conventional wisdom that the courts    marked the beginning of a contentious battle that still rages today is not the case according to those on both sides of the dispute Michael Taylor executive director of the   has been involved in the antiabortion effort since the late s He says the present fight dates back to the   when some groups began urging the overturn or modification of existing laws banning abortion Linda Greenhouse agrees Its important to understand how we got to where we are and not to misunderstand the various lessons of   says   who spent  years covering the Supreme Court for the   and now lectures at Yale Law School But not surprisingly not everyone agrees on what those lessons are Abortion foes like Taylor say the courts   decision by nationalizing the debate set the nation on its current path toward making the issue a seemingly intractable one Im not sure if youd have as much black and white in politics as you do today if the court had not taken this very aggressive position he says As another scholar said the court has made legislators and citizens mute on this issue But Greenhouse along with Yale Law professor   disagrees In both a recent     and the   article   the authors suggest that factors other than the court decision may have had much more to do with the state of todays debate One important thing most people dont realize says Greenhouse is that the move to relax state abortion laws came not from womens rights groups but from the   and a prominent apolitical group of judges and lawyers called the   These were heavily heavily maledominated professional organizations that looked at the regime of criminal abortion laws that were driving women to back alleys and were putting doctors in legal jeopardy if they acted in what they considered to be the best interests of their patients Greenhouse says And thats where the impetus really began Even those on the other side of the abortion debate dont dispute that the debate began well before the Supreme Court entered the fray David OSteen executive director of the   notes that the American Law Institutes model law called for allowing abortions in cases of rape incest and fetal abnormality and to preserve the physical health of the pregnant woman And that law was passed in a   he says Between  and  a total of  states had legalized abortion for reasons other than to save the life of the mother Its the next part of Greenhouses and Siegels argument thats more controversial They say one of the things that really politicized the abortion issue was the efforts of those working to reelect President Richard Nixon in  His aides including future Republican presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan wanted to lure Northern Catholic voters who had traditionally voted Democratic over to the Republican Party Nixon was strongly advised by his strategists  to make a play for a Northern urban Catholic Democratic vote says Greenhouse A kind of Northern strategy that mirrored the   In fact up until then   tended to be more in favor of abortion rights than Democrats including for much of his first term Nixon himself Its upsidedown says Greenhouse Its like going through the looking glass into another world So taking his aides advice Nixon switched sides on abortion even   Meanwhile his staff painted his  Democratic opponent George McGovern as a radical describing him as the candidate of   with amnesty referring to those who dodged the draft for the Vietnam War Although McGovern tried to deny the charges the campaign worked Nixon went on to   that November But it wasnt just the doctors and lawyers or the politicians who propelled the abortion debate before the Supreme Court got involved The Catholic Church also played a role During Vatican II in the mid s the pope instructed the US bishops to make abortion a priority And they did says Jon OBrien president of the abortionrights group   Keeping abortion illegal that is But OBrien says the church didnt necessarily want to be seen as the leader of that movement because most of its flock didnt agree A majority of Catholics even back in the s believed that the abortion decision should be between a woman and her doctor OBrien says So the church created groups that were not overtly church sponsored And what they wanted to do was give the appearance of having a grassroots movement when really this was the Catholic hierarchy at work to make abortion illegal in the United States of America and to keep it so he says Taylor of the Committee for a Human Life Amendment is a living example of that move As a graduate student then working for the   he was asked by the church to   which the church had set up I was asked would I temporarily shepherd this thing until it could get on its feet independently Taylor says And I did that I started that in  I went full time in  The National Right to Life Committee was spun off into an independent organization in  And both current Executive Director OSteen  who is not Catholic  and Taylor insist that the antiabortion movement is both nonsectarian and very grassroots Nobody runs a grassroots movement Taylor says I think the prolife movement is one of the strongest grassroots movements in the history of this country But the fact remains that the th anniversary of   is anything but the th anniversary of the nations abortion debate And despite all the years of strife it seems that not that many minds have been changed A   released last week found that over the past two decades opinion on whether or not   should be overturned has barely changed In   percent of those asked said the court should not overturn the ruling Today thats up to  percent Perhaps more troubling for those on both sides of the debate however is that the older the ruling gets the less young people appear to know about it Among those younger than  only  percent polled knew the case was about abortion  percent thought it had to do with school desegregation
