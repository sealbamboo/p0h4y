The Affordable Care Act requires that most health plans offer birth control to women Around the country Catholic employers have been arguing in court that having anything to do with insurance coverage of contraceptives violates their freedom of religion But when the insurance companies themselves are Catholic contraceptive coverage comes without a hitch Several Catholic insurance companies have been quietly arranging for contraceptive coverage for many years often making it available to their policyholders through thirdparty providers according to Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News a partner of NPR For example the secondmost popular insurance plan on New Yorks health exchange this year is a Catholic plan called Fidelis she told NPRs Wade Goodwyn It doesnt provide contraceptive coverage directly but it has arranged coverage through an outside provider in Michigan The number of Catholic insurance companies is expected to grow as many Catholic hospital systems start their own plans Rovner says so she went on to explain the contradiction You might remember that purely religious employers  churches or places where everyone is of the same religion  theyre exempt from the requirement that their insurance cover most birth control without any additional cost to the woman But the administration has made several attempts to help religious organizations that hire people of all faiths to arrange coverage from sort of an armslength distance These are mostly hospitals and universities Theyve claimed that even filing a form to the government saying they object to offering such coverage makes them complicit in the sin of artificial birth control Both the insurers and the hospitals and universities say theyre interpreting a document that lays out the rules for Catholic health care But the insurers at least if they want to sell to the public in more than half the states are required to offer contraceptive coverage And those laws long predated the Affordable Care Act or the fights over it now Thats the big question I think a lot of this was kind of going on under the radar A lot of Catholic hospitals and universities were also providing contraceptive coverage as part of their health insurance until this whole issue blew up in  and now at least one bishop is wondering whether what the insurers are doing is OK or not
