Those early birds may think theyre morally superior but a new study supports the idea that how long you sleep may be encoded in your DNA Researchers looked at the DNA of more than  people taking part in a variety of health studies who had all reported how much sleep they get every night They found that people who habitually undersleep or oversleep have mutations in their DNA that may be associated with thyroid hormones The mutations were in an area of the genome that may control a gene called PAX thats associated with thyroid development Doctors know that people with overactive thyroids often suffer from insomnia while underactive thyroid function can make people sleepy or sluggish In this case the associations were not quite so clearcut and now itll be up to researchers to see how the mutation may or may not affect peoples thyroids These findings suggest a role for thyroid hormone in sleepwake regulation and thus a plausible role for PAX effects on sleep duration Dr Daniel Gottlieb of the VA Boston Healthcare System and Brigham  Womens Hospital and colleagues wrote in the journal Nature Molecular Psychiatry Its more than just academic Too much or too little sleep are associated with mental illness high blood pressure diabetes and other diseases  Maggie Fox
