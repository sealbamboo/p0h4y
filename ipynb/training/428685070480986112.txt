LONDON  An experimental therapy that fed children with peanut allergies small amounts of peanut flour has helped more than  percent of them safely eat a handful of the previously worrisome nuts Although experts say the results of the carefully monitored study are encouraging they warn it isnt something that parents should try at home  Peanut allergies are on the rise globally and affect about  in  children mostly in highincome countries The consequences can be lifethreatening  peanuts are the most common cause of fatal food allergy reactions There is no way to avoid a reaction other than just avoiding peanuts Allergy shots used for environmental triggers like pollen are too risky  Doctors at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge started by giving  children aged  to  with severe peanut allergies a tiny milligram dose of a special peanut flour mixed into their food Slowly they increased that amount to  milligrams The dose increases were given at a research facility where the children were observed for any dangerous side effects  the most frequent were itchiness in the mouth stomach pains or nausea  After six months of treatment more than  percent of the children can now safely eat five peanuts at a time  This made a dramatic difference to their lives said Dr Andrew Clark of the University of Cambridge in Britain who led the research Before the study they could not even tolerate tiny bits of peanuts and their parents had to read food labels continuously  The intention of the treatment isnt to help kids eat large amounts of peanuts but to prevent a lifethreatening allergic reaction in case they accidentally eat trace amounts  Clark said the treatment works by retraining the patients immune systems so they can gradually build up a tolerance to peanuts though he guessed they might need to keep taking it for several years He and colleagues plan to offer the treatment soon in a special peanut allergy clinic as well as beginning larger studies  The study was paid for by Britains Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research It was published online Thursday in the journal Lancet  In an accompanying commentary Matthew Greenhawt of the University of Michigan described the studys results as exceptionally promising but predicted the treatment was still years away from routine clinical use He noted that previous research which used a similar approach for milk allergies had failed and said it was unknown if the peanut therapy could produce lasting tolerance  Unlike other childhood food allergies children rarely outgrow a nut allergy Schools across Canada and the United States have taken a host of measures to combat the problem some airlines have stopped serving packaged nuts and theres been a fierce debate over whether peanut butter should be banned from schools  Lena Barden  used to suffer serious swelling and breathing problems after eating just a trace amounts of nuts But since she joined the study more than two years ago Bardens tolerance has grown and she now eats five peanuts a day While Barden says she still hates peanuts the trial has allowed her to indulge in previously forbidden treats  Id never tried a doughnut before I was  because they could contain traces of nuts she said  Then a friend bought a pack and offered her one  It was amazing she said I ate the entire packetÂ
