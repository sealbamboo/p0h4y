 Regular consumption of berries such as blueberries or strawberries may help keep your brain functioning well as you   new research suggests The study found that   with the highest intake of berries appeared to delay cognitive aging by up to  years Cognition refers to brain activities such as thinking remembering and reasoning Given that we know that fruits and vegetables are good for our health in general our findings add to the idea that we should be consuming more especially berries as a way to help maintain memory in older ages said the studys lead author Elizabeth Devore an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston Berries are a simple dietary intervention that may be helpful to the brain Devore added Results of the study were published online April  in the   Berries and other fruits and vegetables are rich in substances known as   Flavonoids help protect the bodys cells from damage and reduce inflammation Flavonoids which are antioxidants found in berries apples citrus fruits tea red wine and onions have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease diabetes and cancers explained nutritionist Nancy Copperman director of public health initiatives at the North ShoreLIJ Health System in Great Neck NY Berries contain a particular flavonoid called anthocyanidin Devore said anthocyanidin helps give berries their rich colors and its found in fruits such as raspberries blueberries strawberries cherries elderberries and red and concord grapes Devore explained that one of the things thats special about anthocyanidins is that they can cross the bloodbrain barrier and that these flavonoids tend to locate in the areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning Another recent study also from Harvard but from a different group of researchers recently found that berries might help reduce a mans risk of Parkinsons disease The current study included data on food consumption from the US Nurses Health Study which began in  and collected dietary information every four years In the period between  and  the researchers began measuring cognitive function in just over  female volunteers At the time the researchers started measuring cognitive function all of the study participants were older than  Cognitive function was measured twice with a twoyear interval between each assessment The investigators found that women who had the highest intake of blueberries more than one serving a week and strawberries more than twice a week appeared to delay cognitive aging by as much as  years Devore said other berries may also contribute to a reduction in cognitive aging but there wasnt enough consumption of other berries cherries or grapes to be able to study the effects of these fruits A serving of blueberries or strawberries is a halfcup she noted Commenting on the study Dr Robert Graham an internist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said Large epidemiological studies such as this one add to the basic science research that the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of berries have a beneficial role in agerelated cognitive decline I would advise all my patients at any age to eat more berries Berries are an easy nutritious and delicious way preserve brain function Copperman the nutritionist said that the current study demonstrates that women who consumed the most flavonoids especially berries had a slower cognitive decline over time than women with lower intakes Increasing our intakes of fruits and vegetables is one of the best ways to live a healthy life While the study found an association between eating berries and maintaining mental function it did not prove a causeandeffect relationship
