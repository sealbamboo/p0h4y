Just in time for Thanksgiving Will Lautzenheiser expressed gratitude Tuesday for an extraordinary gift two new arms The year old standup comic and former film teacher received a doublearm transplant from an anonymous donor and can already move his thumb and wrist He appeared at a press conference with his arms in splints and is expected to continue to gain function and sensation over the next several years I hope to be able to live up to the memory of this man and make this worthwhile he said This person who is anonymous to me will always be as close to me as my own skin now and its really an incredible gift Lautzenheiser lost both arms and legs after an aggressive streptococcus A infection led to sepsis and required quadruple amputation in  Earlier this year he was approved for a rare bilateral arm transplant There were so many things that I didnt even realize I missed doing and now the capacity for doing those things is within reach literally within reach he told NBC News Wills twin brother Tom described him as steadfast and said that since the amputation Will has been clear about one thing Whatever it takes he wants to live he said Im hoping and I believe that his procedure that his new arms will help him get his life back on track It took a team of  clinicians including  surgeons to complete the surgery at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston that lasted close to nine hours You could not wish for a better patient said Dr Bohdan Pomahac Director of Plastic Surgery Transplantation Hes got the right attitude and he is incredibly diligent in everything he does Lautzenheiser became one of the first Americans on a national waiting list for arm transplants in July when the United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS and the Organ Transplant Procurement Network OPTN announced a change in regulation UNOSOPTN classified limbs and faces considered vascularized composite allografts or VCAs as other organs like kidneys lungs and hearts These sorts of transplants are becoming more common although they are still relatively rare said Dr David Klassen Chief Medical Officer for UNOS Its still very early since the establishment of a formal waiting list and UNOS gathering data to learn more about how its working but Dr Klassen sees potential for growth The whole community that is involved in this is sort of gradually expanding he told NBC News Since  more than  handarm transplants and twenty partial or full face transplants have been performed worldwide Brigham and Womens Hospital is the only center in the US to have performed both Theyve completed three bilateral handarm transplants and seven face transplants Brigham and Womens Hospital is among an elite group of  centers in the US approved to perform these specialized VCA transplants According to UNOS ten patients are currently on the waiting list for VCA transplants and three transplants have been done since July More than  million people in the US are signed up to be organ donors but the very personal decision to check that box on your drivers license can be a struggle for many At this point checking that box and thereby registering through the Department of Motor Vehicles does not include authorizing face and limb transplants UNOS has been clear that donation requests for faces and limbs must be explicit and specific and should be separate from considering organ donation The decision to donate is a very emotional especially for limbs and faces because they are recognizable unlike internal organs said Art Caplan a medical ethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center and an NBC News contributor It comes at a terrible time almost always the unexpected death of a loved one and sometimes you dont know what the person would have wanted and emotionally people have different views of organs than doctors do he said Lautzenheiser called the gift of donation extraordinary His brother said Its a wondrous thing that this procedure is possible and it wouldnt be possible without the generosity of the donors and the donors loved ones The surgical team said they expect the function of Lautzenheisers limbs to continue to improve over the course of the next several years as nerves regrow Lautzenheiser will also need to remain on immunosuppression drugs to prevent rejection of his new limbs It may be possible to consider leg transplants in the future but for now Lautzenheiser is focused on rehabilitating his arms I think it will be at least a year or maybe two years before I start thinking about another major surgery that would require two years of rehab I dont know how much of my s I want to spend doing rehab he joked with a room full of reporters Tom Lautzenhauser said its been remarkable to watch his brother share his story and make the best of a bad situation Will is not unique in having challenges but its how we respond to challenges that defines our character and shapes our world he said
