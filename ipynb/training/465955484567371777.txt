Why dont you join the st century Annette Rapoports friends used to grump at her They would send around Evites to parties but they would have to mail Ms Rapoport a paper invitation She didnt know how to use a computer But that was before CyberSeniors a program that connects young people with digital skills to older ones who ask questions like What is this thing called Spacebook Ms Rapoport  one of about  Toronto seniors who signed up for instruction learned the basics from a yearold named Henri Pelletier   Now she keeps up with her grandchildren and nieces on Facebook  When she visited Australia and New Zealand family and friends followed her adventures via email dispatches Now she told me her friends say Welcome to the new world  Shes one of the stars of a documentary about the program also called   intended to encourage teenagers to help ease older adults online  A recent Pew Research study found that   now a sixpercentagepoint jump in just a year But that leaves more than  percent who dont Were hoping for a million more seniors online the kind who never used a computer before said Saffron Cassaday the yearold who directed and edited the documentary You can see CyberSeniors in Los Angeles this week in New York May  through  then in Salt Lake City on May   After its hometown premiere in Toronto on May  it will travel to Oregon Pennsylvania and Colorado  AARP Foundation which also recruits young digital coaches through its volunteer program   will sponsor additional screenings around the United States   People will like it I think Its delightful to see initially daunted seniors laughing with their young mentors at computer keyboards And the programs intergenerational nature probably pays the kind of benefits that are hard to measure but real  I learned tons from speaking with seniors said Mr Pelletier who in high school spent hours each week patiently pointing out what a mouse was and how to double click  I was really having a good time  As for his elderly students they get to learn a little about the younger generation he said Seniors see kids on their phones all the time  Now they know and understand more about what were doing You cant really call CyberSeniors a penetrating documentary  It tends toward adorableness  I cringed when a teenage mentor led her yearold student to post a rap video complete with backward baseball cap and chains for a YouTube contest  A bigger issue Aside from the anxiety or forgetfulness that troubled some participants the film barely nods at the other obstacles older people face in using technology Its expense for instance The Pew study points out that among those over age  roughly  percent of college graduates and those with annual household incomes over  use the Internet  No problem there  But in a senior digital divide only about  percent of those with high school educations or less or household incomes under  are online   About  percent of older people report a physical condition that makes reading difficult Pew researchers found  And Internet use drops off after age  Moreover if we really think being connected benefits older people in important ways we need to lower their dropout rate Only about half of the initial group of seniors in the movie still use computers Ms Cassaday estimated Though they had a good time with the kids they didnt find enough use for the digital skills they were acquiring or they grew frustrated with the process and withdrew Still the idea sounds promising The CyberSenior organizers have created a downloadable manual to help other young people teach older ones Mentor Up offers training materials too It may be simpler to find recruits in Ontario where public high school students must log  hours of community service in order to graduate In the United States only Maryland and the District of Columbia make service mandatory but lots of teenagers might enlist voluntarily  As Ive written before a number of longestablished nonprofit groups and community organizations   including   in New York City   with about  learning centers around the country and the   operating in almost  metropolitan areas  But with so many older people to reach recruiting digitally savvy  but patient  teenagers could help fill the gap  Lots of seniors want to learn from them Ms Cassaday said The farther away their families lived she added the more eager they were to go online
