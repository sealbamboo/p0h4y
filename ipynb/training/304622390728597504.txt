Antioxidants in foods are good for you so more should be better right Evidently not In a new study people who ate more antioxidants overall didnt lower their risk of stroke and dementia in old age That flies in the face of earlier research that found that the antioxidants in fruits and vegetables reduce stroke and dementia risk Were seeing strong and clear benefits with specific antioxidants but not overall says   an epidemiologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital who led the new study which was   online in the journal   Last year Devore found that eating lots of berries   among women in the big ongoing   Berries have lots of chemicals called flavonoids which researchers think probably have protective powers much like those of betterknown antioxidants like betacarotene vitamin C and vitamin E Before that Devore had looked at data from a longterm study of more than  people ages  and older in Rotterdam Netherlands The people were followed for about  years She found that people who ate foods with more vitamin E were less likely to suffer dementia and people who ate foods with   were less likely to have a stroke But now shes looking at the same people and finds that having lots of antioxidants in the diet overall doesnt help with stroke and dementia What gives Devore tells The Salt that she reran the numbers from the earlier Rotterdam study just to make sure she hadnt made a mistake and it still showed that vitamins C and E were doing good things for the brain In the new study the people with the highest levels of antioxidant intake were getting most of those antioxidants from coffee and tea Evidently the Dutch drink a lot of coffee Coffee and tea are actually chockfull of antioxidants Devore says in the form of flavonoids And other   on people in Europe have found that drinking a lot of coffee say five cups a day does help protect against Alzheimers But similar benefits didnt appear in the coffeeloving Dutch group in Devores study which leads her to suspect that the total level of antioxidant intake isnt the whole story Its nuance she says An Italian   from  also showed less stroke risk in people who had a highantioxidant diet overall But in that case the people were getting their antioxidants from wine fruits and vegetables Devore says Thats very different from the diet of the Dutch study participants who ate a lot of meat and dairy and fewer vegetables and fruit Scientists have just started to really dig into the relationship between   thanks to a big new USDA database on the still largely mysterious chemicals That should help resolve the confusion over the merits of antioxidants Devore says As were able to move into these more nontraditional antioxidant foods well be able to tease out more specific information for people
