Highspeed online access has radically changed consumer shopping habits and transformed the economics of industries like banking and retail Could something similar be about to happen in healthcare  It sounds farfetched but senior NHS chiefs are thinking hard about how consumer technology might be used to make life a lot easier for patients In an interview for BBC Radio s World at One Sir Bruce Keogh the medical director of NHS England explained how mobile phones could be used for patient monitoring  He demonstrated on his smart phone an app to measure his pulse and heart rate using the camera  This could either be transmitted to GPs or hospital clinicians or in theory stored in a cloudbased memory for future consultation In this new technology driven world monitoring of patients with heart conditions and certain longterm ailments could be carried out remotely   They would not need to be in and out of hospitals for checkups   Doctors could contact people if their readings showed any cause for concern  Consultations could happen via Skype with patients free to remain at home But its not just consumer technology   There are ways of monitoring patients remotely One telehealth company which includes a practising GP as a director  serves  patients with conditions such as heart failure across the UK  Users answer a series of health questions each day using a tablet computer before having their conditions remotely monitored Sounds too good to be true  Many issues need to be resolved  including data protection   Smart phones and tablets tend to be accessible only to a relatively affluent section of the population   Patients may become frustrated if broadband and mobile phone signals in their area are unreliable  The  Royal College of GPs has welcomed any initiative which makes life easier for patients but has urged caution with any rush down the consumer technology route   Sir Bruce is quick to emphasize that there will always be a role for hospitals in local communities   He wants to quash any suspicion of a hidden hospital closure agenda    And its fascinating that at the highest levels of the NHS there is serious consideration being given to what could become a healthcare revolution
