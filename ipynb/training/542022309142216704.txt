Forget Ebola In Liberia style is everything Even if poor even if without a job Liberians still spend money on clothes They value appearance over everything says Muhammed Trawally The yearold driver is wearing tightly fitted black jeans sharp Italianstyle leather shoes a crisp orangeandwhite striped polo shirt browntinted aviator glasses in a goldandwhite frame and a black Casio watch Looking good is business he says  a phrase that keeps popping up Looking good is business says Demah Bee an unemployed teacher Shes in a currycolored Indianstyle tunic over leggings Looking good is business says Angie Kolanta  holding her yearold daughter Philomena on her hip Philomenas hair is braided and pulled into a side ponytail Kolanta is in bright pink sequined leggings a matching stretch top and leopard print flats They stopped to talk along busy Tubman Boulevard one of the main drags in Liberias capital Monrovia Vendors were walking by hawking everything from childrens clothes to smoked fish to large wall clocks Ebola has been a blow to an already weak economy Before the outbreak nearly half of all Liberians were unemployed Ebola has forced businesses to shut and put even more people out of work But it hasnt dented the national sense of style We put a lot of money in our appearance says journalist Siatta Scott Johnson  Even we dont eat because youre not looking at my full stomach Youre looking at me We prefer to look good She says the phrase Looking good is business might have originated with a radio DJ years ago but its hard to know Whats certain is that its now ingrained in the Liberian psyche At some level its existential My appearance speaks a lot about my character and who I am and how I look If I look a little sluggish you would be awwww shes not a decent woman says Johnson whos dressed in fashionable dark jeans a peplum top and a skyblue jacket Her hair has been extended with lustrous thick dark braids But if am really well dressed good looking you see me as decent Dao M Fahnbulleh Jr agrees When you look good people respect you a lot he says The yearold student wants to become a fashion designer Hes particularly keen on African fabrics On this day hes wearing a green patterned batik tunic top over short pants made of a different African print He says the deliberate mismatch is his style I feel proud every time I wear this dress code because people admire me So Ive just chosen to be an African stylish icon in my neighborhood Ebola has closed schools however so his future currently is on hold I feel my time is being wasted I feel my friends and I should be out of college But with this Ebola issue everything is shut down he says Already one of the worlds poorest nations and still recovering from  years of civil conflict Liberia was hit hard by the outbreak But Zoe Kiadi says neither unemployment nor the presence of Ebola has dimmed her desire to look nice Fashion over food says the trim unemployed yearold Shes speaking on a sidewalk along the main street to Monrovias Freeport Its expensive to look good Times are hard To find money is very hard But I think I always need to look good Ebola or not Kiadis wearing coordinated green cotton Africanpatterned pants vest and goldtoned flats But what really sets her apart is her hairstyle Twentyseven thick blonde braids pulled together in a ponytail cascade down her back falling just below her buttocks They flow from exquisitely small and intricately patterned cornrow braids swirling atop her head Shes stopped to talk in front of an auto parts store called Globe X which sells tires batteries and Sea Horse motor oil Its orange exterior is getting a fresh coat of paint because theres also a municipal angle to appearances Monrovia is a lowslung city of  million people Ramshackle houses and shops crawl over hilly ground crammed between the Mesurado River and the Atlantic Ocean Traders spill off sidewalks Colorful umbrellacovered stands pour down toward the ocean Its unclear whether war or poverty stopped construction on the many unfinished buildings around the city Some of them are still pocked by artillery and mortar fire that devastated Monrovia during the civil war that ended in  And now Ebola means that tubs filled with chlorine stand sentry at every entrance to every building so people can disinfect before entering Nevertheless Christmas is around the corner Theres a longstanding municipal order that Monrovians must paint the front of their homes businesses signs and curbs so that the city looks good in time for the holiday before a Dec  deadline So all around Monrovia people are on ladders trying to freshen up sometimes bedraggled store fronts churches sidewalks and homes The ordinance aims at encouraging citizens to give their homes a facelift says Isaac Jackson Liberias deputy minister for information If they dont do that the city will fine you and people want to avoid being fined he says We are decent people here And the decency cant only be in the clothes you wear As long as you are not Ebolainfected you should be able to clean your environment he says Dont fall in trouble with the city police Please do it Because really looking good is business
