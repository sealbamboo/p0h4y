If primary care doctors build intensive counseling programs to help their obese patients exercise lose weight and get healthy will they work A new study finds that for half the population at least they will For men and women alike results will be modest And for women they wont last    The authors of the   published Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine concluded that physicians efforts to improve their obese patients health by promoting lifestyle change might do better to embrace a more realistic expectation a modest reduction of patients waist circumference and the prevention of further weight gain    That discouraging picture comes just three months after Medicare the nations healthcare safety net for seniors   it would reimburse primary care physicians for providing obese patients intensive behavioral therapy to lose weight and improve their health Increasingly physicians who have been told they can be a powerful prod to healthy behavior change in their patients are devising ways to play that role they are incorporating nutritional and weightloss counselors into their practices and honing their own roles as motivational agents for increased exercise and weight loss    But   including the current one suggest that expectations for these efforts are impossibly high For patients who already have entered obese territory even interventions far more intensive than those that most physicians are equipped to provide will fall short of hopes  if those hopes focus on bringing a patients bodymass index BMI under  Weight loss  for men and women  is hard enough and maintaining weight loss an even tougher challenge    But does that mean that lifestyle interventions cannot improve patients health Sometimes that depends on how you define and measure improvements  and     A growing body of research  including the current study  is focusing on measures of fatness that may be more amenable to lifestyle changes and which might reflect meaningful improvements in a patients health prospects One of those focuses on fat deposits that girdle the waist and visceral organs where they can play havoc on metabolic function    Easily measured with a tape measure for instance the circumference of a patients waist appears to be a better measure of risk for developing type  diabetes than is BMI For men a waist circumference greater than  inches and for women greater than  inches has been linked consistently to higher risk of cardiovascular disease type  diabetes and early mortality    In this study and others researchers have found that waist circumference tends to respond most to changes in exercise with more physical activity fat is less likely to cling to the middle where its most dangerous While that may not translate directly into pounds lost it may well bring health benefits that will drive down patients disease risk    Waist circumference as a measure of health may not be the  is  yet But its making inroads A quick search of the nations clinical trials shows that some  studies using human subjects make use of BMI as a measure   barely seen in clinical trials a decade ago is now used in some  today
