I dont know how or why   has gotten so much wrong about the Affordable Care Act But as someone who worked on health reform for the Obama administration Id like to clear up a few things  was not as many claim the architect of the healthcare law He is an MIT economist who as a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services modeled the impact of various subsidy levels and rules He did not make policy nor did he work for the White House HHS or any congressional committee Earlier he advised the Massachusetts legislature when it created the healthcare reforms that were a model for the ACA
