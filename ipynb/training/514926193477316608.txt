Eye surgeons in Mali travel long distances in extreme heat on motorbikes visiting remote villages to try and eliminate one of the leading causes of preventable blindness They go from village to village and treat anyone with the advanced stages of trachoma a bacterial infection before it causes irreversible blindness Trachoma is common in children and the women who care for them It is infectious and is spread by coming into direct contact with the discharge produced from the eyes or nose of an infected person through contaminated objects such as towels Flies also transfer the bacteria from the discharge  The locally trained health workers upload their findings by mobile phone to a central system They report the number of people they screen for the disease the surgeries they carry out and the number of followup consultations they provide Here in the remote village of NKorobougou in the western region of Koulikoro Boubacar Fomba diagnoses a yearold woman with trichiasis the advanced stage of trachoma where the infection has become so bad that the eyelashes have turned inwards painfully scratching the eyeball with every blink I started having pain and itching there about  years ago says Kany Doumbia who earns a living through agriculture and gardening  Mr Fomba is part of a team working on a Sightsavers project to tackle a backlog of advanced cases in Mali It is hoped that the disease can be eliminated in the West African nation by the end of next year  an aim made possible largely thanks to a multimillion dollar donation by the Conrad N Hilton Foundation The  surgeons in the team work across  different districts each covering between km  miles and km a day and conducting at least three operations each day Poor communities in hot and dusty climates  where access to water is poor  are most affected by the disease  During surgery the eyelid is rotated outwards directing the eyelashes away from the eyeball  a procedure that takes as little as  minutes Globally an estimated  million people suffer from the advanced stages of the disease and require surgery to prevent them from going blind In Mali an estimated  people need surgery before elimination is reached The prevalence of the disease amongst children under nine has dropped to below  After the surgery Ms Doumbia said she felt a real change because the pain she used to have had gone  and she was relieved that she would be able to continue to sell her garden produce in the nearest city Ouelessebougou I had started to fear losing my sight because the pain became frequent and often my vision was blurred she said We consult dozens of people per day Mr Fomba says And people come to us because they were recommended by other patients That makes us feel proud Antibiotics are also prescribed to treat the infections  and the surgeons explain that facial cleanliness is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the bacteria In the afternoon each motorbike surgeon sets off for the next village where they will spend the night  so that another day of examinations and operations can begin early the next morning
