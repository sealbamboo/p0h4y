You know the mind trick where someone says to you Dont think about elephants And the harder you try to resist it all you can think about is of course  elephants Some sports psychologists who work with Olympic athletes say thats a pretty appropriate analogy to describe both the old way of motivating athletes  Dont think even for a minute about losing  and the reason it often didnt work Because within the last decade some experts say that theres been a sea change in the way they work with prospective Olympians Instead of keeping athletes eyes laserfocused on WINWINWIN and GOLDGOLDGOLD theyre now preparing them to withstand a variety of outcomes  even the possibility of defeat When athletes prepare they want to win obviously says Peter Haberl a senior sports psychologist for the United States Olympic Committee But its almost unavoidable for thoughts to come up like What if I dont win So for the longest time the approach was  dont have those thoughts Now the research shows the more youre trying not to have the thought the more likely the thought will appear at the most inappropriate time says Haberl who has worked with Olympians for more than  years and says he started to see this shift around  Over the last   psychological research has demonstrated the zombielike effect of thought suppression We try with all our mental might to kill an unwanted thought and back it comes undead and more powerful than ever Smokers who   about smoking for example end up having more intense cravings than smokers who didnt try to suppress thoughts of smoking And   have shown that highly emotional thoughts  like oh the fear of   are perhaps the most stubborn The funny thing is that this infinite thought suppression loop is actually your brains attempt at helping according to   by Harvard psychologist Daniel Wegner Our minds try to chase away an unwanted thought so one part of our brain hunts around for any hint of the banned content But this hall patrol process actually ends up keeps the thought around  if part of your brain is watching out for thoughts about losing part of your brain is essentially thinking about losing So instead of suppressing thoughts and fears of Olympic defeat many sports psychologists now encourage their athletes to let the thought in Acknowledge it And then let it go If that sounds like something a yoga teacher might say its no accident Part of this trend is to incorporate mindfulness practices  to notice the fear but then come right back into the present says Lauren Loberg a sports psychologist who is in Sochi working with the US Ski and Snowboard team With Alpine its these gorgeous amazing venues all over the world says Loberg She says that she tells her athletes when their inner Debbie Downer pipes up to take a second and look out at the scenery  look out at the vista Just remember  what an opportunity How cool is this that I get to do this today Nicole Detling a sports psychologist who is in Sochi working with US aerial skiiers says shell sometimes have her athletes follow their What if thoughts of defeat to their logical endings Whats so bad about failure I mean whats the worst case scenario What if you   get the medal Whats going to happen then Sometimes I have the athletes go through that Detling says Before Sochi aerial skier Emily Cook went through this odd imagination exercise under Detlings guidance Cook envisioned the way each of her friends and family members would react if she came away from her last Olympic Games emptyhanded  no gold silver or bronze medal She wrote a short paragraph imagining each of her loved ones reactions And she discovered something that surprised her Deep down she knew theyd all be fine with it Their love their relationships wouldnt change if her results were disappointing Because Olympians are under an enormous amount of pressure  many feel the gold medal dreams of their family their town their entire country Athletes have this sense that theyll let everyone down  with the Olympic games itsIm going to let the country down But in the end thats an illusion of the mind Haberl says I dont remember a single incident where an athlete didnt do well at the Games where the headline was Nation In Mourning Or the flags were at halfmast Thats something I tell athletes because then when I burst that bubble of illusion its easier to go for it rather than to hold back and worry about something that could go wrong says Haberl who most recently worked with the Summer Olympics water polo team One of the first steps to harness the idea of failure before it becomes allconsuming is to define what failure means for the individual athlete Within the Olympic culture not medaling is failure Detling says When they find out someones an Olympian the first question is Did you medal In December Paralympic skier Caitlin Sarubbi had to rework her own definition of success and failure during four major qualifiying events for the  Paralympic Games During a training run right before the first race Sarubbi crashed suffered a concussion and wasnt able to compete in those qualifiers When you build something up so much in your mind and you feel so confident and ready to perform well it is hard when you dont get the chance because of an injury said Sarubbi who is blind and skis with her sister who is her guide Detling who does not work with Sarubbi encourages her athletes to be mindful of all of their accomplishments even the smallest ones But what did you achieve I tell them to look for those small victories those small successes along the way Detling says Those can be just as important for an individual Its not as important for our culture unfortunately For Sarubbi a conversation with her parents helped her identify those accomplishments My parents understood my frustration and knew how hard I worked to get there but their main goal and my goal as well was to heal and get better Sarubbi said For them a successful race is that we are safe and did the best we could and not about how well we finished Detling often uses the John Candy quote from Cool Runnings to motivate her athletes If youre not enough without the medal youll never be enough with the medal At the end of the day a medal is a chunk of metal Detling says You are not a different person with or without a metal Who are you What do you bring to the world Thats not going to change
