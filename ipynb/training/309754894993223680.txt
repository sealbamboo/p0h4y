What were hoping is that as the tools develop  and they will continue to develop  we have additional insights that will lead to better medical devices  Donoghue and his colleagues are eagerly waiting to see if the federal government will approve new money to pump into the project the recent spending cuts known as the   could affect that prospect But the scientists proposal states that the project should be funded by a partnership between federal and private organizations and theyre already beginning to ramp up their collective efforts according to George Church professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who is one of the key minds behind the project   There are already indications of federal interest President Barack Obama in his   in February said If we want to make the best products we also have to invest in the best ideas and alluded to scientists mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimers Along with talking about drug development and materials science Obama stated Now is not the time to gut these jobcreating investments in science and innovation  A big goal of the initiative is to create ways of stimulating neurons that are less invasive than whats currently available said Church There is already research being done on brain implants Parkinsons disease for example is being treated with deep brain stimulators electrical devices in the brain that restimulate specific circuits of neurons that have become faulty  Donoghue is working on a project called   where scientists are developing technologies to reconnect the brain to the body in patients with paralysis Researchers implant a small sensor  about the size of a baby aspirin  in the motor area of the brain The sensor picks up a persons thoughts about moving and transforms brain signals into movement signals  Through this technology researchers have demonstrated that patients can move a computer cursor by thinking and manipulate a robotic arm as if it were their own  A next step will be to connect to the persons own arm or  if a person has an amputated limb  to a prosthetic limb that they could control with thoughts  So far the movements of the robotic arm dont seem as natural coordinated or quick as a real arm Thats because scientists do not yet understand the precise brain processes involved The Brain Activity Map project could help for instance look at the neural connections involved in brushing teeth  If we truly understand the code of how the brain does that we could reproduce it Donoghue said  Further into the future if scientists better understand the neural bases of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia it could be possible to also develop treatments by targeting groups of neurons with electrical impulses  If you understood how thinking emerges from the interaction of many neurons then you would have ideas about what a disordered thought would look like Donoghue said  Another set of tools in the project that looks promising is called optogenetics Ed Boyden of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is wellknown for this technique It involves using proteins that are sensitive to light derived from other organisms such as algae and putting them into neurons Researchers can then use optic fibers to manipulate those neurons Highdensity optical fiber arrays would offer more and thinner probes for neuronal exploration than bulky electrodes  About a thousand groups are using these right now to study the brain because it lets you turn on one cell or one kind of cell and figure out what it does Boyden said Although we dont have a complete list of the parts of the brain we know that some cells are different than others and people can turn on and off those cells to figure out how they work The intention of the Brain Activity Map project is to study the human brain but there is also a lot of work going on in animal models as they allow opportunities for testing devices before they are deemed safe for human trials Worms flies and leeches are good invertebrate candidates and zebra fish mice and rats provide another level of depth  Within  years it should be possible to monitor andor to control tens of thousands of neurons and by year  that number will increase at least fold Donoghue and colleagues wrote in the Science article By year  observing  million neurons with markedly reduced invasiveness should be possible  Donoghue anticipates that there will be insights that come out of the Brain Activity Map project that go beyond the human brain After all as a result of the space program we have GPS We have the Web because a primitive version of it was developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research so that particle physicists could communicate better  In the case of this project nextgeneration sensors that work in the brain could also be used to make cars smarter Donoghue said For instance a car could automatically slow down if a soccer ball is detected in the road anticipating that a child may dart out next  Researchers compare the economic benefits of brain mapping to the Human Genome Project which generated  billion in economic impact as a result of a  billion investment according to the Science Express article  The genome project for which Church was a key leader was another one of the best ideas Obama mentioned in his State of the Union The Human Genome Project started out in  with  million in funding a year and was ramped up to  million a year Church said  But Church and his colleagues involved in the brain project have a vision that is akin to what happened after that project ended in  Between  and  Church said there was a millionfold reduction in the cost of genome sequencing and its still happening  Every person who does molecular biology now is a million times more effective because of the cost drop that came after the genome project was over he said  Cost reduction of brain mapping is also a big aim of the Brain Activity Map project As technology gets better it will also get cheaper Church said  Rather than have some monolithic juggernaut goal where were compulsively going to get this neuron and this neuron and this neuron I think its more we want to enable all the creativity and maybe even jostle the creativity a little bit because people can dream different dreams he said
