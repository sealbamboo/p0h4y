When that Olympic gold medal for judo is hung around your neck you know youre the best in the world Sometimes Kayla Harrison  hated the endless training missing movie nights and even the prom but having the ability to visualize her success coupled with a clear objective to be the champion allowed her to persevere in London  and perhaps again in Rio de Janeiro in  I started when I was  because my mother had taken judo in college and she wanted me to learn selfdefense She enrolled me in the local dojo and I just really enjoyed it Before that I played a little bit of Tball and did a lot of dance but from  years old onward judo was my passion The better I got the more I had to sacrifice other parts of my life I started doing school online when I was  and moved to Boston to train with the Olympic coaches I never went to prom and most nights when my friends were going to the movies Id be working out at the club It is allconsuming Its something that doesnt just take up your whole life but other peoples lives There are townspeople who helped me along my journey While the gold medal didnt go around their neck there is definitely a piece of it that belongs to each of them  I was fortunate to be able to work oneonone with a strength and conditioning coach three to five days a week We also run sprints and intervals three to five days a week and we do judo every single day Judo doesnt have a season per se but there are down times when I really need to focus on building my strength but before competition I need to focus on conditioning and getting in as good shape as possible Sometimes I do Olympicstyle lifts and others I do a lot of circuit training It depends where I am in the year and what Im peaking for Every athlete goes through that period of hating what they do and not knowing if its going to be worth it but if you dont have days like that then the ones that are really good arent sweet I do a lot of visualization and positive thinking as part of my routine Even when Im not physically training Im training my mind to believe that I am a winner and believe that Im the best I visualize myself winning tournaments and winning the Olympics And at night I go home and cry because its been such a bad day and I feel like I cant do it anymore but then I go through my little mantra and I visualize and listen to the right song and then I feel a little bit better Im going for one more in  The training is even more intense than it was before I have a big target on my back now I think  is going to be my last Olympics There are other things and goals that I want to accomplish with my life so one more and Im done Ill be ready to start a new chapter
