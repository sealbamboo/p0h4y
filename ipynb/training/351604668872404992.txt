The biggest changes in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act are set to begin less than three months from now Oct  is when people can start signing up for coverage in new state health exchanges The policies would kick in on Jan   It can all be   we agree So two weeks ago we asked what you wanted to know about the health law You werent shy our inbox was stuffed Here are some answers If you dont see your question or one like it dont despair Well be doing this again periodically throughout the summer and fall You can email more questions to   This is one of the biggest misconceptions about the exchanges  that theyre only for people who dont have insurance The   are aimed mostly at the uninsured but the exchanges are most definitely also open to people who already buy their own insurance In fact there are about   That includes people like Ms Harman who work part time and dont qualify for benefits people who are selfemployed or people who may have retired early and dont yet qualify for Medicare There are a couple of questions here First who gets financial help paying for coverage Within the exchanges theres a   The smaller your income the more help you get paying your premium And Mr Salgado is correct that for an individual the subsidies start for people whose   is the equivalent of the poverty level  or above The help is reduced for people who make more money and is cut off altogether at  percent of the poverty level which is   Bottom line If youre an individual making up to  you should be eligible for at least a bit of a subsidy Now there may be cases where someone doesnt qualify for help or does qualify for help but still cant afford the premium And those people wont be required to have insurance The law says if you would have to spend more than   you are excused from having to pay any penalty for not buying insurance There are   And you can always seek a hardship exception if you think you truly cant afford coverage How much will the premiums be That information is just starting to come in from some of the states It will depend on a lot of factors  where you live how old you are whether you want to pay a higher premium and have a lower deductible or pay a lower premium and have a higher deductible And of course whether youre eligible for a subsidy But from what weve seen so far premiums for the standard silver plan seem to be averaging   for an individual without subsidies Not at all The health law lays out several categories of what it considers    that satisfies the requirement to have insurance Its the coverage that about  percent of the population already has employer coverage including COBRA and retiree coverage or a government program like Medicare Medicaid the Childrens Health Insurance Program VA benefits or Tricare If you have any of those kinds of health insurance you dont have to do anything and you will have satisfied the requirement to have coverage Probably not You know how President Obama has been saying   That was shorthand for saying that the law was intended to maintain the existing system where people get insurance through a job or through a family members job And to make sure that didnt change  for the first several years at least  people who are offered health insurance through an employer or a family members employer   to get insurance except in very limited cases Or they can go to an exchange but they wont be eligible for any help paying their premiums Heres the tricky part If the premium offered by the employer costs more than  percent of a persons household income  for coverage of an individual not a family  or if the employers plan pays less than  percent of the cost of covered benefits then the employee is allowed to opt out of employer coverage and go to an exchange for health insurance In a word no Starting Jan     wont be allowed You cant be turned down and you cant be charged more This will mean some healthy people will pay higher premiums to offset the cost of those sicker people paying less But the whole idea of requiring most people to have coverage is to get more healthy people into the insurance pool to spread the risk more broadly It is true that people who are members of   from the requirement to have health insurance Examples include the Amish and some Mennonite sects because they dont pay into Social Security But they are not getting a free ride Some members of such groups have a form of insurance through   or health care sharing ministries where members of a group pool together to pay each others medical bills Others may remain uninsured Not to worry Bill You and the estimated   were not forgotten by those who wrote the health law And   The law stipulates that anyone who lives outside the US for at least  days in a month period is treated as having minimum essential coverage for the year or period and thus meets the requirement to have health insurance
