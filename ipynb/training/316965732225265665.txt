The largest geneprobing study ever done has fished out dozens of new genetic markers that flag a persons susceptibility to breast ovarian and prostate cancer The  newly discovered genetic variants double the previously known number for these malignancies all of which are driven by sex hormones Underscoring the sheer magnitude of the findings theyre contained in  scientific papers published simultaneously by five different journals The Nature group of journals has collected them all  But while the discovery is a landmark in cancer genetics knowing these susceptibility markers wont translate into much for patients for now The nearest hope is that the growing catalog of markers will allow researchers to finetune screening tests for these cancers They might be able to identify which people to screen using existing tools such as     blood tests or   And a patients genetic profile could help determine what to do when a screening test comes back positive For instance one paper suggests that if a womans genes contain one of four newly discovered variants shes at risk for a more aggressive type of breast cancer called   which accounts for about one in four cases So she might be advised to have earlier or more frequent mammograms But   of Cambridge University an author of one new paper cautions that there are many hurdles before these genetic signals can be incorporated into breast cancer screening If youre yearsold I think it would be in your lifetime Easton told reporters on a conference call It will take some time The same is true for men with prostate cancer who are currently bedeviled by the   of a screening test called PSA Right now a test that finds an elevated PSA doesnt indicate if a man actually has prostate cancer or whether its a slowgrowing or aggressive type Encouragingly researchers are reporting  new genetic markers for prostate cancer Sixteen of them are associated with more aggressive disease  of Britains Institute of Cancer Research says men with many of these susceptibility markers in their genes have a nearly  percent chance of developing prostate cancer versus about  percent for the average man So someday if a man with one of these markers has an elevated PSA his doctor might feel more urgency about doing a biopsy And if the biopsy shows cancer that might argue for treatment rather than watchful waiting If your risk is over  percent of getting prostate cancer in your lifetime we dont know if we should just PSAscreen you whether we should do a biopsy whether we should do an MRI scan Eeles says So its very early days But Eeles says studies are beginning to reveal whether a mans genetic profile should trigger more aggressive screening or diagnostic testing The picture for   is murkier   of Cambridge University says the new research identifies three more markers that put women at higher risk bringing the total number for ovarian cancer to  Among women with many of these markers three out of  will develop ovarian cancer at some point  almost double the average risk Pharoah guesses it might take five to  years before genetic profiling will be commonly used to identify women with a higher risk of ovarian cancer The hurdles are more than technological A commentary in   notes ethical legal and public health issues A big one is how to ensure that poor and uninsured people have an equal chance of benefiting from a cancer screening program that requires genetic profiling Translating the genetic risk markers into more effective treatment is even further down the road It will require a deep understanding of how the genetic variations give rise to cancer and what might be done to block their effects The cornucopia of new cancer markers comes from a megaconsortium of  research centers around the world called   Researchers drew on data from more than  individuals most of them from Europe North America and Australia Some had cancer others were used for comparison Scientists first identified genetic variations in these individuals called   sometimes called spelling errors in the genetic code This technology is called genomewide association studies or   The researchers sorted out the SNPs they thought would shed the most light on the risk of the three hormonedriven cancers They put more than  of these tiny variations on a socalled   or microarray When DNA from a specific individual is washed over this plate pieces that match will latch onto the SNPs Researchers can read these signals and correlate them with the individuals disease  or lack of disease The  new markers are those that correlate most strongly with cancer and sometimes with more aggressive subtypes As impressive as the new list of markers is they explain only about a third of all breast prostate or ovarian cancers It varies a lot The markers account for about  percent of breast and prostate cancers but only  percent of ovarian cancers Easton the Cambridge University scientist says part of the reason is that there are probably thousands more markers yet to be discovered Some of them may be associated with only rare cases of cancer He says finding them all will require even bigger studies
