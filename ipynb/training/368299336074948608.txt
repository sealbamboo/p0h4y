A month after delivering a pound ounce baby girl Pennsylvania mom Michelle Cessna is reveling in the healthy arrival of her little blessing while also scrambling to restock her diaper supply We had to exchange all our little diapers for bigger ones Cessna  says with a laugh And baby Addyson shot right past newborn clothes and left the hospital dressed in an outfit meant for a monthold  Addyson Cessna joins a small but growing club of giant babies making headlines So far this summer a   weighed in at nearly  and a half pounds   had a pound ounce girl and just last week   to a pound ounce daughter  And back in March a British mom gave birth  naturally  to a  All these whopping newborns are starting to leave momstobe a tad nervous  and some doctors concerned  For many moms around the world the risk of having a big baby has increased along with rising rates of obesity and the higher rates of gestational diabetes that come with delaying childbearing And while everyone loves a chubby newborn a baby who is too large at birth can face a constellation of health issues ranging from a difficult birth to an increased risk of obesity later in life Overall theres been a  percent to  percent increase in babies weighing  pounds  ounces or more or  grams the weight where a baby is considered oversized in the past two to three decades in developed countries according to a February report in the medical journal The Lancet Most surprisingly the developing world has also started seeing an increase in big babies The Lancet study found that nearly  percent of babies born in Algeria  where maternal obesity is almost  percent  fit that category In China which has been coping with rapidly rising obesity rates  percent were big By comparison in India where maternal obesity is only  percent a scant  percent of newborns were very large In the US where maternal obesity has been an issue for longer doctors have become more aggressive intervening before babies get eyepoppingly large Those efforts seemed to have flipped the big baby trend around and the average birth weight has actually started to decline Rates of Csections   and labor inductions are also on the rise according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Thats partly due to the dangers associated with preeclampsia and other blood pressure problems sparked by pregnancy in obese women Its also partly due to the rise in the number of largeforgestation fetuses  In the past say the s women often werent considered for induction unless they didnt go into labor on their own by  to  weeks Now its between  and  So babies dont have a chance to get bigger in those later gestational weeks Dr Robert Barbieri a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Harvard Medical School and chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvards Brigham and Womens Hospital Harvard research showed that by  there was an almost  percent drop in the number of births that went beyond  weeks Big babies can pose risk to both the mother and child at birth They are at risk for shoulder dystocia  which means that the shoulders have grown so big that they can get stuck under the moms pubic bone during delivery Normally the head is the largest part of a baby but when babies grow so big the shoulders can become larger than the head  When babies get stuck they can end up with fractured bones and the moms can end up with trauma and tearing Barbieri says  Along with the risk of a difficult birth there is the impact on the health of the babies once they are born says Dr Irina Burd an assistant professor of gynecology and obstetrics and neurology and director of the integrated research center for fetal medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine  Its not uncommon for overweight moms to have diabetes or to develop it during pregnancy And some of the high blood sugar in the mom flows through the placenta to the baby That in turn forces the babys pancreas to pump up insulin production which can leave babies with low blood sugar after they are born Burd says Another problem is that sugar acts like a growth factor and not all the growth is in sync says Dr Hyagriv Simhan chief of maternal fetal medicine and vice chair for obstetrics at MageeWomens Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center In some ways very large babies look more mature because of their size Simhan adds But in terms of their lungs they may be immature Even more concerning are the effects felt by big babies as they grow up So theyre not just obese at delivery but there are epigenetic changes that program them for the rest of their lives Burd says And those include a heightened risk for obesity and cancer she says  Thats why doctors have tried to encourage pregnant patients who are obese to gain very little weight during pregnancy For women who cant seem to keep their weight down there may eventually be another solution An ongoing clinical trial is looking at the impact of a drug that helps keep blood sugar low in pregnant women who are obese  In some cases such as Michelle Cessnas new daughter big babies may just run in the family She said she had no health issues during her pregnancy and safely delivered Addyson who measured  inches by Csection at  weeks Her two older sons weighed roughly  and  pounds when they were born I think it runs in my husbands family she said He was pounds something He had an uncle who was  pounds She said she still gets quizzed about Addyson when she heads into the community she lives in near Pittsburgh People ask the usual How much was she at birth They hear the number and typically offer the same remark Oh thats the baby that was on local TV She doesnt look as big as she did on TV She doesnt look big  for a month old Cessna says of her monthold girl
