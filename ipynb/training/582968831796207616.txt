Depression and heartdisease drugs are to be tested in a trial to find treatments for Multiple Sclerosis MS from existing medicines There are currently no treatments in the secondary progressive stage of the debilitating disease Doctors hope the necessary drugs are already out there but have never been tested on MS  More than  people will take part in the trial at University College London and the University of Edinburgh Walking balance speech and vision become impaired in the later stages of the disease There are treatments in the early phases of MS to prevent the frequency or severity of relapses But there is nothing once the disease progresses The MSSmart trial will test the safety and effectiveness of three drugs used in other conditions They were identified after a review of previously published research into drugs that appear to protect the nerves from damage  Researchers believe these treatments could slow down the progress of MS and the trial will be the first time they have been tested on such a large number of patients Dr Jeremy Chataway a consultant neurologist and lead researcher on the trial based at UCL said there was huge unmet need He told the BBC It may be the case that we have already invented the drugs we need to treat MS In the same way that aspirin was developed as a painkiller and is now used to treat stroke patients we may well have invented the drugs that we need we just dont know that they work in different situations than what they were invented for  One of the advantages is they are very cheap and we know a great deal about them as they have been tested on millions of people around the world in their original indication So its much more of a running start when we use drugs that we aim to repurpose Prof Siddharthan Chandran a clinical neurologist at the University of Edinburgh said This is a landmark study that seeks to not only test three potential treatments but also showcase a new approach to clinical trials for progressive neurological conditions MSSmart is a phase two trial making sure the drugs are safe and demonstrate sufficient effectiveness before they are tested in a larger number of people  If successful it could lead to new ways of using the existing drugs to modify the way the disease develops It is the first time Sanjay Chadha  has had any real hope for his condition  He has lived with progressively worsening MS for  years and is now a wheelchairuser with roundtheclock care He said In recent years as my MS has progressed into secondary progressive MS those treatments arent available to help stop the accumulation of disability which just seems to weaken the whole body Its very dispiriting and  I hate to use the word  depressing that theres very little that can stop the symptoms and give me some kind of control and some kind of certainty for the future To have even some kind of hope that there is some kind of possibility of something that might help  its that word hope  Its so meaningful for somebody in my situation Living is hard enough but to live with no hope is even harder
