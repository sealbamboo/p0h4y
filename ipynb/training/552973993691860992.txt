This is your heart on an energy drink and its contracting significantly faster than it was before you opened that can full of liquid stimulant So says a team of cardiac radiologists who were concerned about adverse side effects from energy drinks especially on heart function Energy drinks like Red Bull Monster Hour Energy and Rockstar are involved in tens of thousands of emergency room visits each year In the US alone   went to ERs after consuming energy drinks in  according to a  report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration A typical energy drink can have up to three times as much caffeine as coffee or soda according to Dr Jonas Drner a resident at the University of Bonn in Germany and member of the research team High caffeine consumption can cause rapid heart rate palpitations a spike in blood pressure and even seizures or death he said in   Taurine is also a major ingredient in energy drinks Drner said To get more detail on exactly how energy drinks may affect the heart Drner and his colleagues imaged the hearts of  men and three women with a Tesla MRI scanner Then the volunteers drank a beverage containing high amounts of caffeine and taurine and had their hearts scanned again One hour after consuming the experimental energy drink the researchers found that radiologic measurements of heart strain were significantly higher than at baseline Specifically the team measured the peak strain and peak systolic strain rate of the hearts left ventricle which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the lungs to the aorta and then on to the rest of the body Both showed changes that were too big to be due to chance In addition the team found a small change in peak diastolic strain rate but it wasnt large enough to be statistically significant In the language of   the systolic measurement quantifies the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle contracts and diastolic measurement quantifies pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is relaxed between heartbeats The researchers also looked for changes in heart rate and blood pressure before and after volunteers consumed the energy drink but the readings in both cases were essentially the same according to   The experimental energy drink contained  milligrams of taurine and  milligrams of caffeine per  milliliters of beverage and the precise amount given to volunteers varied according to their size Each got  milliliters per square meter of their body surface area A typical man has a body surface area of  square meters and a typical woman has a BSA of about  square meters according to studies of   You can look up your BSA online   The results were presented Monday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America The researchers noted that their study is ongoing We dont know exactly how or if this greater contractility of the heart impacts daily activities or athletic performance Drner said We need additional studies to understand this mechanism and to determine how long the effect of the energy drink lasts  Monster Beverage Corp maker of the Monster Energy drinks issued a statement Monday calling the study alarmist and misleading The company said the paper confirms that the popular energy drink ingredient taurine helps the heart function more efficiently by improving the pumping force of the heart without any changes in blood pressure or heart rate In fact the company said this effect is widely considered to be beneficial Monster also noted that some energy drinks contain less caffeine than coffee when measured on an ounce per ounce basis An ounce serving of Starbucks Pike Place Roast brewed coffee has   according to the company The same amount of the classic Monster Energy drink contains  milligrams of caffeine according to   by Consumer Reports That same study from December  also said that a ounce serving of a product called Monster Xpresso had  milligrams of caffeine The American Beverage Assn a trade group based in Washington DC weighed in on the study findings as well The fact remains that most mainstream energy drinks contain only about half the caffeine of a similarsize cup of coffeehouse coffee the group said in a statement Caffeine is a safe ingredient and is consumed every day in a wide variety of foods and beverages An earlier version of this post suggested the radiologists study was conducted in response to the report on emergency room visits The post also previously stated that energy drinks caused medical problems Epidemiological studies have linked the drinks to health problems but they cant prove that the drinks were responsible    and like   on Facebook
