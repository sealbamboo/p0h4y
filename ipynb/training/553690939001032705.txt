Its been a turbulent week for the NHS  and the new year has barely begun   Few could have predicted  in the finals days of   the tidal wave of patients that would flow into almost every accident and emergency unit once the new year holiday had ended  And news that Circle the poster boy for private involvement in the NHS was throwing in the towel before the week was out came as a genuine shock The buildup of pressures in the weeks before Christmas had become increasingly obvious Health infrastructure was looking stretched especially ambulance services   NHS chiefs went off for Christmas with fingers crossed knowing that an unexpected gust of wind could shake the foundations of the system   They could hardly have anticipated the gale which blew up on Monday It could have been the fact that GP surgeries were opening up after the weekend and referring more patients to hospital or that people were holding off with their health problems till after the holiday season   With social care scaled down because of staff holidays difficulties discharging patients into the community intensified   There was no obvious factor But hospital managers were shocked by the surge in patients throughout Monday and Tuesday  One boss of a trust which has prided itself on meeting the fourhour AE targets told me he had considered declaring a major incident to focus on clearing the backlog   Trolleys with patients delivered by ambulance were lined up down corridors For many AE and ambulance staff it was the busiestever shift It was no surprise that about a dozen hospitals had announced major incidents by Tuesday  a mechanism for focussing all staff on discharging patients who were fit enough to leave in order to clear beds for incoming casualties   The backlog at some hospitals was starting to clear over the next couple of days and some could relax their high alert warnings   But what worried bed managers was that the system had creaked so much without any severely cold weather or obvious rise in flu cases This weeks wave of pressure on AE wont show up in the official figures till next Friday   The numbers for the week ending  January had shown another fall and a fouryear low in the percentage of patients treated within four hours   Things could stabilise or improve  But equally NHS managers are concerned that weather or viruses could take their toll in January and February Unprecedented patient numbers was a factor quoted by Circle in their decision to pull out of the Hinchingbrooke contract  The health landscape had changed considerably since the contract was first drawn up the company said  and it was no longer viable   More light on Circles motives was shed with the publication of a damning Care Quality Commission report rating Hinchingbrooke as inadequate and recommending the hospital was put into a special measures monitoring regime   Circle criticised the regulator and said it disputed the findings but its hard to see how the company could have continued at Hinchingbrooke under special measures The conclusion at the end of a dramatic week in the health world   Theres even more uncertainty over two of the key issues facing the NHS  whether it can cope with winter pressures before spring arrives and just how the role of private providers in the health service will develop Welcome to
