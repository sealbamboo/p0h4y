The world has witnessed the largestever epidemic of Ebola claim thousands of lives in West Africa in   Since the first case   there have been more than  deaths Outbreaks such as Ebola have an ability to spread fear around the world often through the prism of sensationalist media reporting  So how does Ebola actually compare to previous outbreaks and other diseases And while the world focuses on Ebola are we guilty of ignoring much bigger killers Analysing the death rates from different viruses shows Ebola is certainly one of the most deadly infections ever encountered David Mabey a professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said The mortality rate from previous outbreaks is generally over  in Africa Very few other viruses approach that apart from rabies which is  and Marburg which is in the same ballpark as Ebola But just because a virus is deadly does not mean it will cause a large number of deaths It also has to infect new people  This outbreak has shown Ebola does not spread as quickly as other infectious diseases  The basic reproduction value represents how many other people an infected person passes their disease onto The value must be greater than one for a virus to spread otherwise an outbreak will peter out The Merscoronavirus which keeps jumping from animals to people in Saudi Arabia is an example of a virus unable to spread effectively in people Measles meanwhile is rampant and can explode through unprotected communities  The total death toll of a disease depends on the combination of how rapidly a virus spreads and how deadly it is It sounds slightly perverse but a virus can cause less severe disease but be a much bigger problem said Prof Jonathan Ball a virologist at the University of Nottingham Looking at other headlinegrabbing outbreaks it is those that emerge and then spread with ease that pose global threats  Eleven years ago another deadly virus  Severe acute respiratory syndrome known by its acronym Sars     Western countries introduced screening at airports    Fewer than  people died from Sars out of  infected Nearly  have died in this Ebola outbreak which has infected  people  But the big killer in the global epidemics is influenza flu viruses  Swine flu infected   when it rapidly spread around the world in  It killed a tiny percentage of those people but the global death toll may have been around half a million people  But Prof Mabey draws an important distinction between flu and Ebola He told the BBC People who die of flu are mostly elderly people with other comorbidities Thats the really terrifying thing about Ebola you can be a perfectly fit  yearold and be dead within  days Even at the height of this epidemic Ebola is far from a major killer in Africa It takes HIVAids just two days to kill as many people as have died in the whole Ebola outbreak so far  In previous years Ebola has caused even fewer deaths which goes some way towards explaining why there is no cure or vaccine as there are bigger targets to aim for Huge progress has been made in HIV which is almost a manageable condition with the right drugs Similarly malaria is now killing   thanks to improved interventions But Prof Ball argues it is right that Ebola is getting so much aid and research attention now I think the reality is that were not giving it disproportionate attention as this is something we know we can stamp out The effort we expend now is preventing something bigger on a panAfrican or even a global scale This is a problem we can actually sort out not doing so would be tantamount to stupidity really
