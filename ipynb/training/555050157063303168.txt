Imagine for a moment that all of the nations fastfood establishmentsall the striped awnings and golden arches the drivethru windows the beckoning dollar deals and wafting odor of French frieswere to vanish overnight Would the number of our kids who carry an unhealthful amount of extra weight plummet The answer is very likely no says a   published Thursday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition Because if you shut off the supply of ounce fountain drinks bacon cheeseburgers fried chicken and stuffed tacos the children who frequently eat at fastfood restaurants will go home and do what they generally do when not eating at a fastfood restaurant Theyll snarf cookies and chips chug sugarsweetened soda from a bottle and heat up frozen pizzas In a new study researchers from the University of North Carolina led by nutrition professor Barry Popkin have found that even when they are not eating at fastfood restaurants children who frequent them tend to eat food that would probably make many of them overweight or obese anyway The authors of the latest research combed through a national database of Americans health and nutrition behaviors and grouped  American kidsfrom ages  to according to what they ate when they were not eating food purchased at a fastfood restaurant Participants were designated Western diet consumers if their consumption from nonfastfood sources was relatively high in saturated fats and added sugars Those classified as following a prudent diet ate more fruits and vegetables leaner proteins and less added sugar and saturated fat After doing so they went back to the childrens detailed food consumption records and categorized them as nonconsumers of fast food those whose food tracking records indicated no calories consumed from a restaurant or eating establishment without servers low consumers whose food tracking records indicated that no more than  of their calories came from such an establishment and high consumers for whom more than  of calories consumed came from a fastfood restaurant The result Those who followed the Western dietary pattern when not dining at fastfood restaurantseven those who were considered nonconsumers of fast foodhad the highest rates of being overweight or obese Those who followed a prudent diet when not dining on fast foodeven those who were considered high consumers of fast foodwere significantly less likely to be overweight or obese On average low consumers of fast food were  times as likely to follow a Western diet pattern of consumption than people who were considered nonconsumers of fast food High consumers of fast food were  times as likely to do so Our findings suggest that the location where foods are obtained may not be as important as the nutritional quality of the foods consumed the authors wrote They also suggest that the effect of public health efforts targeted at fast food restaurants may also be overestimated such that these efforts may be necessary but not sufficient to reduce child obesity if the remainder of the diet is not addressed The study was sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the authorsJennifer M Poti Kiyah J Duffy and Popkindeclared they had no financial conflicts of interest with respect to the article
