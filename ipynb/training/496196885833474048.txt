If theres a single invention that helped shape New York City literally it might be the elevator Along with steel frame construction the elevator allowed New York City to grow up But according to architect   former New York City commissioner of the Department of Design and Construction its time to celebrate the steps There was a time before the elevator when the staircase was a huge opportunity for architects  threedimensional space the sculptural quality of the stair Burney says So wed like to bring the staircase back Why the enthusiasm for the stairs The answer is more medical than architectural This is a public health campaign As architects and planners weve been part of the problem in terms of making our lives so sedentary making things so easy And there are ways that we can and should correct that Burney says The city wants more steps and more people to climb them because of the research showing health benefits to taking the stairs Its a vigorous activity It burns more calories per minute than jogging says   who advises governments around the world on public health issues related to the built environment and is a special adviser to the World Health Organization Lee cites a   of  men Men who climbed  to  floors of stairs per week  thats about  to  floors a day  had a  percent reduction of their risk of stroke Lee says That  percent reduction was independent of whether people exercised in leisure time Heres another   Researchers calculated how many calories stairclimbing burns If the average American adult was to climb just two more minutes of stairs per day Lee explains we could burn enough calories to offset the average annual weight gains we see in American adults US adults on average gain about a pound a year And just two additional minutes of stair climbing per day should prevent that gain New Yorkers confront steps often whether they like it or not  walking through the city and getting in and out of the subway But how do you get people to climb by choice   has been hanging   Our stair prompts are neon green really eye catching says   assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention and Tobacco Control at NYCs Department of Health The posters tap into two classic New York motivators guilt and vanity They read Burn Calories Not Electricity Take the Stairs We have distributed  stair prompts in over  buildings Johnson says Of course not everyone can take the steps  there are people with disabilities or who are carrying packages or pushing strollers But the campaign isnt just about stairs Its part of a bigger movement called active design The term was coined when New York City agencies came together a few years ago and created  for architects and planners The idea is to build an environment that can help us expend energy and use architecture to promote health Now all new city buildings must consider active design strategies And the idea has caught on around the country We always say that this is not rocket science says Joanna Frank Shes the executive director of the   a cityfunded nonprofit that promotes the guidelines The actual individual strategies that were advocating for are simple Frank says  planting street trees putting in a bench closing off a small piece of street to create a plaza Theres good evidence that improvements like that entice people to walk more David Burney says its one more way of using design to promote health If you think about the history of disease like typhoid tuberculosis and cholera a lot of them were solved by changes in the built environment  improved water supply better sanitation says Burney who leads the Center for Active Designs governing board So actually theres a strong relationship between architects and planners and public health Of course unlike with pipes in order for stairs to improve health people have to play along Building the stairs is not enough you have to get people to use them Were not asking people to go to the gym every day Burney says Were trying to do this in a way that is seamless A good example of attractive stairs can be found at   home to some of the most iconic steps in New York City Theyre prominent Theyre marble Tourists stop to take pictures of them And most importantly people climb them
