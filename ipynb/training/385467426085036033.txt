Pop psychology holds that to connect with someone you should look deep into their eyes The more you look the more persuasive youll be But that may work only when your audience already agrees with you Researchers in Germany tested the power of the eye lock by polling university students about their opinions on controversial issues like assisted suicide nuclear energy and affirmative action in the workplace They then had the students watch twominute Internet videos of people expounding on the controversies Eyetracking machinery was used to measure where the students looked The students spent more time looking into the eyes of the speakers when they agreed with their point of view and avoided eye contact when they disagreed or were neutral Persuaders may misattribute returned gaze to their persuasion skills the researchers concluded The students were also less likely to change their opinions as measured in a second poll when they looked directly in the speakers eyes This was particularly true when the person in the video looked directly at viewers rather than to the side of the frame Interesting sure but this was a small study with just  students And there could be other factors other than eye gaze at play Maybe they just didnt like the speakers looks To try to reduce those factors the researchers did a second experiment with scripted videos they recorded They made sure the  students saw videos expressing opinions they disagreed with And the participants were asked to focus either on the speakers eyes or speakers mouths The students who looked at the speakers eyes changed their attitudes less than the people who looked at the speakers mouths They also said they were less interested in hearing more about the views presented Eye contact is clearly used in many situations to signal attraction love and even agreement   an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia and lead author of the study told Shots But forcing someone to look into your eyes could backfire if youre trying to change their opinion Chen says Think about parents saying Look at me when Im talking to you  The   was published online in   This conclusion probably doesnt come as a huge surprise to anyone who has a dog Theres abundant research showing that animals interpret a direct eye gaze as dominance or aggression No less an authority than TV dog whisperer Cesar Millan preaches no touch no talk no eye contact as the way to get a misbehaving dog to   And when it comes to humans what parent hasnt watched a child shift their eyes away when theyre being cornered about chores undone It might be helpful to think about a listeners emotional state Chen says before going for the eye lock That averted gaze may be more powerful than that persuasive stare If theyre already avoiding eye contact with you especially if youre saying something potentially threatening to them maybe think twice before insisting that they make eye contact with you
