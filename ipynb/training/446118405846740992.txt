Almost one in three hospital patients in Scotland will die within a year and nearly one in  will die during their time in hospital a study has found  The Glasgow University report says the findings suggest that part of the core business of hospitals is people who are nearing the end of their lives   The research team studied  people who were in  Scottish hospitals on one day   March     In total  patients almost  died within  months    The study found that  died during their admission   Older patients were more likely to die and men were more likely to die than women   Just over half of all male patients over the age of  died within the year Lead author Professor David Clark said I think what this paper really shows us is that what we call acute hospitals really have as part of their core business the care of people who are coming to the end of their lives The key message for me is how as organisations hospitals start to think more widely about the implications of that The likelihood of dying in hospital has been rising despite the fact that surveys suggest most people would like to die at home   A recent international comparison of  countries by the University of Auckland found that  of all Scottish deaths occur in hospital and a similar number in England and Wales   It means British hospitals rank among the top  countries with the greatest number of deaths in a hospital setting Professor Clark who is based at Glasgow Universitys Dumfries campus said the next step was to work out how to identify those who were most likely to be nearing the end of their lives   A study like this is looking retrospectively he said The key challenge is how to identify people prospectively on admission to hospital or when theyre first being assessed in the initial ward round I think thats now where we should focus our energy Thats very tricky of course Starting those difficult conversations about end of life needs and wants is challenging work for family members and for professionals but I think the study shows there is an opportunity in hospital to start that conversation The report was published in the journal Palliative Medicine
