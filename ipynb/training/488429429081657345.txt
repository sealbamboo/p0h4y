As hearing aid technology has improved so has health reporter Kathleen Ravens confidence When she was  years old she found out she had a hearing problem Complications during her birth led to damage in her inner ear I couldnt hear water dripping from a faucet I couldnt hear crickets on a summer night she tells NPRs Kelly McEvers I couldnt hear sirens couldnt hear fire alarms in our school fire drills so I did a lot of watching other people The diagnosis was moderate to severe loss of high and lowfrequency hearing When it comes to speech certain sounds are out of range for her Sounds like ch sh and th blend together Raven says she reads lips religiously but when she cant see a persons lips she can understand maybe every third word  that is without a hearing aid She got her first hearing aids  a large clunky set  back when she was  in  They were about  inches long and very thick and they connected to a very large ear mold inside my ear she says They call them fleshcolored but theyre not the color of anyones flesh Her young classmates teased her But the technology kept changing Every few years her parents would shell out  to  on each new device By the time she got to high school she had her first completely insidetheear hearing aid That changed everything I just became more confident walking into crowds I didnt try to hide I didnt arrange my hair to cover my ears I started being more talkative going out with my friends more says Raven I didnt realize how much that fear had impacted me until I got completely intheear hearing aids She went on to college and started pursuing her dream of reporting I encountered a few raised eyebrows along the way she says Why do you want to make a living of hearing people when thats a challenge for you She pushed past the skeptics and became a reporter Today she writes about oncology for  As years passed and the technology progressed Raven thought her hearing had maxed out But with each upgrade she discovered more sounds Two years ago she received her latest pair which cost  When her audiologist put them in her ears she heard an unfamiliar noise I just happened to smack my lips together like youre tasting something she recalls Its just such a simple sound but it was earthshattering Her audiologist put on Beethoven and she heard new instruments and trills It was like seeing the world in D or hearing the world in D for the first time Raven says These latest hearing aids are basically invisible Even still now she tells people about her hearing loss Five years ago I still was not ever telling people unless it was absolutely necessary And now I do work it into conversation in the first five minutes or so she says If she needs to ask someone to repeat something shell just add I have a hearing problem That phrase was impossible for me to say for the first  years of my life Raven says Now I think its very important for hearing loss to be accepted for younger people of course and also for older people
