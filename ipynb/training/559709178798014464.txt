Whether we like it or not polls say most of us do its time to start saving daylight again Depending on whom you ask our March Madness of the spring forward variety was invented to conserve energy or to make pleasant summer evenings a little longer or if the person you ask happens to be humorist Dave Barry to annoy Dave Barry Every year officials tell us to turn all our clocks ahead one hour he once griped only to turn around a few months later and tell us to turn them BACK Make up your minds officials Any effects the time change might have on our health and wellbeing were pretty much discounted as minimal at the beginning  and for many continue to be today According to Yvonne Harrison a sleep specialist at Liverpool John Moores University The start of daylight saving time in the spring is thought to lead to the relatively inconsequential loss of one hour of sleep on the night of the transition but data suggest  a cumulative effect of sleep loss at least across the following week perhaps longer In fact its possible to make a number of evidencebased predictions about what to expect after daylight saving time or DST begins early Sunday morning  We all have nights when we cant get to sleep or if we do it doesnt last for long On those nights we might say we didnt sleep very well but scientists would say we didnt sleep very efficiently Sleep efficiency is defined as the ratio of time we spend actually sleeping to the total amount of time we spend in bed presumably trying to sleep and research shows that in general sleep efficiency goes downhill after the switch to daylight saving time for as much as a week or more In one  study efficiency was reduced by  on average over the five days after the shift with sleep time reduced by almost exactly one hour per night Other studies have found that adjusting to the time change is especially hard for night owls  A  study in the journal Sleep Medicine examined the effects of the clock shift specifically in adolescents finding that overall the kids were sleepier than usual during the day for three weeks after the time change In a move that just might make this the favorite scientific study ever on high school campuses the study authors suggested that no tests should be given during the first week  or perhaps weeks  after the time change  Research shows that traffic accidents go up during DST or else they go down or else the numbers dont change at all Make up your minds scientists Actually the inconsistent results are not terribly mysterious Overall more driving is done in daylight during DST than during standard time and accidents are less likely in daylight because drivers can see better On the other hand in the first days after the change to DST drivers are apt to be sleepier than usual and that makes accidents more likely More than one study has found that driving while sleepy is no different from driving while drunk So depending on its design any particular study could find either fewer or more accidents  or the two opposite effects could even cancel each other out  A number of studies have found that the risk of heart attacks goes up in the first few days after DST begins especially on that Monday with the increase ranging from  to  and even more No one knows for sure why but heart specialists have suggested possible culprits Sleep deprivation can increase inflammation which is associated with heart attacks Also our cells have their own clocks and expect certain things to happen at certain times Unfortunately when we set our clocks ahead an hour the cells dont know theyre supposed to jump their clocks ahead too They gradually adjust but until they do they can be caught off guard and react poorly to stresses they might ordinarily cope with just fine  DST makes like Robin Hood stealing an hour of daylight away from the morning and giving it to the evening  when it is often assumed people can take better advantage of it A study published in the Australian New Zealand Journal of Public Health in  found that many people try to take advantage of the extra evening hour by exercising When researchers asked more than  adults in western Australia about their exercise habits nearly half of them said they changed their routines during DST with fewer exercising in the morning and more exercising in the evening A less predictable result Overall daily exercise sessions were less frequent during DST with  of those surveyed seemingly taking advantage of the extra daylight hour to veg out  In a  survey by Salarycom only  of workers claimed that when theyre at work they never go to any websites that are not workrelated Meaning that at least  of workers are not so noble Theres a word for that cyberloafing and a  study in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that they do more of it than usual right after the shift to DST Researchers used Google searches for YouTube videos music and ESPN and calculated that for the years  to  the proportion of such searches was higher on the first Monday of DST than on the Mondays immediately preceding and following it The study authors hypothesized that the rise was because of loss of sleep after the time
