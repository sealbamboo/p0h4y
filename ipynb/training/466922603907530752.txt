Scene The happyhour office party Your boss is relaxed drink in hand A little liquid courage of your own and you approach her taking a shot at an opportunity to impress You open with a quip She chuckles But does she really mean it Or is she faking Only onethird of people can tell the difference between a fake laugh and the real deal according to a   by   a professor of communication at University of California Los Angeles The evolution of human laughter tracks back to the monkeys in the trees and other animals he says  sounds that can be identified as chuckles appear in primates and potentially other animals Bryant shared this   about tickling rats and dolphins The only fakers People Over the course of his research Bryant played a series of laughingperson clips and asked subjects to pick out the fake laugh In his study the laughs were slowed down and sped up to see if that made a difference Can you tell them apart Hint Theres more breath and rhythm in the real thing than the fakers The difference between the real and the fake may matter more than you think Its not just about impressing the boss but about avoiding manipulation yourself Because it turns out that our hormones respond to laughter in ways we dont even realize If were sharing in the laughter were bonding But if one persons faking and youre not  youre technically speaking a little bit evolutionarily vulnerable When people are laughing socially in a genuine way they experience the release of oxytocin in their brains and that can promote emotional bonding with others who share the experience Bryant says Oxytocin is a pleasure hormone and it could make us more attuned and sympathetic to the person laughing Potentially Bryant says that could give the faker an unfair advantage and open you up to manipulation So if the boss fakes her chortle and then requests a favor and you cant tell that shes not feeling honestly charmed by you you might be more likely to agree to her ask Hopefully its one you wouldnt mind doing
