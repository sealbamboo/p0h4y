Men can be forgiven for being confused over screening for prostate cancer Doctors are confused too When it comes to figuring out if the benefits are worth the risks the simplest solutions may not be best a study of the options finds Last spring the US Preventive Services Task Force   that the test most commonly used to check for prostate cancer the PSA test is so unreliable it   That was followed by a study in the   that found that as many as twothirds of men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer are at low risk and would be better off   especially since the treatment often leaves men incontinent impotent or both So skip the PSA right Thats too simple an answer says biostatistician   an author of the latest   published in   Instead she says its better to look at prostate cancer screening in its full complicated glory and say There are so many ways to do this  Her team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle was trying to weigh when it makes sense to screen and how So they ran computer models on  different variations in prostate cancer screening shuffling ages to stop and start screening PSA levels screening frequency and other variables They found that doing PSA tests less often in men at low risk of prostate cancer would substantially reduce the harm of overtreatment while increasing the risk of death only slightly Setting a higher threshold for PSA levels for older men would accomplish the same thing Here are the numbers Screening men ages  to  with low PSA levels every other year instead of annually would increase the lifetime death risk by  percent from  percent to  percent the study found At the same time it would reduce number of PSA tests by  percent and false positives which often lead to painful biopsies by almost half In older men screening up to age  but recommending biopsies only in men with PSA levels in the top  percent for their age increased the probability of lives saved more than it increased overdiagnoses The PSA test has been unfairly vilified Etzioni thinks and can be useful when its used right Its often cast as this is a bad screening test and its not its really the screening endeavor Screening for cancer whether with PSA tests for prostate cancer or mammograms for breast cancer is an expensive way prevent deaths from cancer she says Thats because screening requires that a large group of people gets tested even though a very small percentage of men will die of prostate cancer if not screened This study has quite a few limitations It didnt look at family history and race or at gradations in disease stage It also didnt measure quality of life issues that can be huge in prostate cancer treatment including incontinence and impotence after surgery We didnt want to add uncertainty to the outcomes Etzioni told Shots Still this study is the sort of sophisticated thinking that needs to be done about cancer screening says   a professor of medicine at Dartmouth University who studies cancer screening Theres a tradeoff between trying to find every last case and dragging everyone else through the mud  and hurting them along the way The idea that you have one rule for screening that everybody gets screened at the same rate using the same threshold for the same period of time doesnt make sense So this latest data bite doesnt give a simple yes or no Instead it suggests that prostate cancer screening will move to a more tailored approach matched to a mans age and cancer risk Men should have a realistic idea of the danger of dying from prostate cancer Etzioni says Its  percent If theyre still worried she says they can use this to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes
