If you want to know whether the bread youre about to buy was sweetened with corn syrup you can check the label The same is true if youre concerned about preservatives caramel coloring or artificial flavoring By law all of these ingredients must be listed on food labels But not genetically modified organisms or GMOs The Food and Drug Administration does not require clear identification and labeling of food products made with genetically engineered plants Most consumers want that to change Some  percent of respondents to a New York Times survey in January  said they wanted genetically modified ingredients identified even though only about half said they would avoid GMO products More than  million people have signed the Center for  s  urging the federal agency to require GMO labeling Last weekend marches were held in dozens of cities to protest the introduction of genetically engineered products by Monsanto and other developers Vermont this month   to require labeling of GMO foods and Connecticut and Maine have passed similar laws though they are contingent on other states enacting legislation Food producers and developers of genetically modified plants and seeds poured millions of dollars into advertising in    a California initiative requiring GMO labeling and they are pushing a federal bill that would bar states from requiring labeling They insist the ingredients are safe and say there is no need for labels Labeling space is very limited and mandatory labeling would create an unnecessary stigma said Claire Parker spokeswoman for the   which represents businesses and organizations opposed to GMO labeling She and other industry representatives point to the FDAs determination in  that   for mandatory labeling of   because there were no material or meaningful differences between bioengineered and nonbioengineered foods Genetically engineered plants contain DNA from other animal or plant species that is intended to give them traits that are considered desirable by the manufacturers One of the more recent innovations is an apple that does not turn brown after it is sliced Another is a strawberry that withstands freezing Many of the plants have been engineered to survive being sprayed with weed killers some even produce their own   Advocates of labeling point out that the FDA has elaborate disclosure requirements for all kinds of foods Labels on orange juice for instance must inform customers whether it is fresh or made from concentrate and producers are barred from using the term juice if the drink is not  percent juice Products containing less must be called a beverage cocktail or drink The agency even regulates the use of terms like fresh frozen fresh frozen frozen fresh and quickly frozen on   The FDA decided that the difference between fresh peas and frozen peas was a material difference to the consumer said Jean Halloran director of food policy initiatives at   which supports labeling of genetically modified foods This stuff is as different as frozen peas and nonfrozen peas if not more so Agency scientists have expressed concerns about new genetically engineered plant products wondering whether the new plants have the same levels of important nutrients as nonengineered varieties for instance and whether they might contain toxins new allergens or unapproved   But unlike the approval process required for new drugs and even many food additives like artificial sweeteners the review process for new GMO plant foods is voluntary Producers are asked only to consult with the FDA The agency does not conduct a comprehensive scientific review of data generated by the developer according to FDA documents Officials rely on producers to do their own safety and nutritional assessments and   We recognize and appreciate the interest that some consumers have expressed in knowing whether a food was produced using genetic engineering said Theresa Eisenman an FDA spokeswoman Food from genetically engineered plants must meet the same requirements including safety requirements as foods from traditionally bred plants It is not clear whether genetically engineered salmon which is going through a different review process than GMO plants will be labeled when it gets to market An agency official said special labeling would only be required if the FDA determines the food differs materially from comparable foods  for example if it has a different nutritional profile Shoppers who want to know whether theyre purchasing genetically engineered foods do have a few options For starters there is a good chance that any product with soybeans corn sugar beets often used for sweetening and canola or canola oil has GMOs since genetically modified versions of these crops are   in the United States On the other hand certified organic produce carrying the green and white circular   seal   While processed foods with multiple ingredients can be labeled organic if at least  percent of the content is organic none of the nonorganic  percent can be GMO And a growing number of food producers that dont use genetically modified ingredients in their products are seeking certification by the   They carry a NonGMO label with a logo of a red butterfly on a blade of grass
