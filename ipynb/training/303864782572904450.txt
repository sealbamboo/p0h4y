 Overall the vast majority of total   surgeries are successful but according to the results of a new study women are at greater risk than men for implant failure after this procedure Researchers noted this was true even after taking other individual   into account They said their findings could help doctors better manage the anatomical differences between men and women The role of sex in relationship to implant failure after total hip replacement is important for patient management and device innovation the study authors wrote in the report published online Feb  in   The researchers led by Maria Inacio of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group in San Diego tracked more than  hip replacements that were performed at  different hospitals over an average followup period of three years Of the patients followed  percent were women who were an average age of about  years old Women more often received millimeter mm femoral heads while men had a higher proportion of mm or larger heads The femoral head is the ballshaped top of the thigh bone that fits into the hip socket creating the hips ballandsocket joint Todays artificial hips are made of a variety of materials including metal and newer types of plastics or polyethylene The investigators noted that nearly  percent of women had metal on highly crosslinked polyethylenebearing surfaces compared with just under  percent of men Meanwhile  percent of men had metalonmetalbearing surfaces compared with just under  percent of women After five years the study showed that  percent of the implants survived The researchers pointed out however device survival for men  percent was deemed significantly higher than that of women  percent In response to the studys findings Diana Zuckerman from the National Research Center for Women  Families in Washington DC commented in a journal news release Sexspecific analyses are especially important in orthopedics because of substantial anatomical sex differences Zuckerman added the study provides an important first step in understanding higher risk of hip implant failure in women but longer followup is necessary to help   What is urgently needed is longterm comparative effectiveness research based on larger sample sizes indicating which total hip replacement devices are less likely to fail in women and in men with subgroup analyses based on age and other key patient traits as well as key surgeon and hospital factors concluded Zuckerman Such data would enable patients and their physicians to choose the hip devices and surgical techniques that are most likely to be successful for a longer period Health news Copyright     All rights reserved
