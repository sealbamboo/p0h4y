When we first heard about researchers using tiny freely floating tools to grab tissue samples deep inside the body we were scared But our fears quickly turned to fascination Johns Hopkins engineers are testing out what they call untethered microgrippers as a better way to investigate hardtoreach places They have launched hundreds of these things which look like miniature ninja throwing stars inside the body of animal to retrieve tiny pieces of tissue for biopsies The microgrippers are as small as a speck of dust And they work completely on their own  no strings attached no electricity required Its like a springloaded system or latch bioengineer   who developed the devices tells Shots When it reaches the right temperature in the body the microtool folds up And theyre magnetic So doctors can  in theory  get them all back In the bile duct of a pig we could retrieve  percent of them Gracias says But there were one or two left behind That is one of our concerns Clearly the microgrippers arent ready for use in humans But Gracias and his team have started testing them out on animals In January the team   hundreds of them into a pigs bile duct the tiny channels that connect the liver to the intestine Standard forceps for biopsies cant reach these narrow channels because of their size But the microgrippers easily make the trip We released the tools in the bile duct and then waited  minutes he explains The microgrippers move around the tortuous channels grab pieces of tissue and then we could do standard pathology and genetic analysis on the tissue The results arent comparable to a regular biopsy Gracias admits because the samples are much smaller But the microgrippers can take many more samples he says and they arent as destructive Its less invasive less scarring More recently his team   the fleet in a pigs colon  a place where Gracias thinks the microgrippers could really shine For some diseases in the gut tumors can be too small to see Gracias says The common practice is take  samples with large biopsies from different regions of the colon he says But the colon is so large youre sampling only  percent of it A better way to is to take many smaller samples Besides leaving a few microgrippers behind isnt such a big problem in the colon Gracias says Theyd just pass out naturally Gracias and his team came up with the idea for the microtools while building   that automatically fold up into a particular shape like a box or polyhedron He designed the grippers to look like hands Theres a polymer material at the base of each finger which softens when it warms up This makes the fingers fold over Whatever is near them gets grabbed and torn off Gracias and his team are just starting to get money for safety tests in people And they hope to make the devices biodegradable so they dont have to worry about retrieval But still theres a long way to go before youll see microgrippers at your next biopsy The big dream in medicine is to build very small tools that could access tiny places in the body in a noninvasive way he tells Shots There are a lot of surgical robots like toy cars But typically these robots need batteries  so they are very hard to make small This is a completely new area of surgery and medicine he says There are a lot of challenges but if they are overcome biopsies would less invasive less traumatic Thered be less scarring It would be amazing
