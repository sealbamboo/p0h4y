Normally Melissa Lane keeps her exercise regimen steady and moderate a little CrossFit a little jogging Slow jogging Then in February Lane had a fun idea She would add interval training on the weekends with her boys ages  and  Theyd walk a minute then sprint a minute doing  cycles of each up and down the sidewalk outside their Culver City home To give each boy private time with her Lane walked and ran with them separately getting in  cycles each weekend The kids loved it After a couple of weekends of this Lanes shins did not She had developed shin splints the bane of many an athlete who has taken up a new pursuit too enthusiastically too quickly It feels like an ache in your shins said Lane  When you take any kind of springy step you feel an ache that makes you want to stop running and walk again A minor case of shin splints can ache for days at a time more serious injuries may take up to six months to heal The key to managing shin splints experts say is care and moderation In other words ignore those twinges at your peril I tell people if you are feeling pain stop what you are doing said Fred Azar a Memphis Tenn orthopedist and president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons When you get home ice it and take an antiinflammatory such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen Afterward dont cease all activity Azar said but decrease your intensity and crosstrain with other sports while you allow your injury to heal The technical name is medial tibial stress syndrome though doctors as well as patients call them shin splints Azar said The injury itself is caused by stress on the soft tissue surrounding the tibia bone which is the large bone in the lower leg The tissue called the periosteum gets inflamed and thats what causes the ache Stress fractures unlike shin splints generally are limited to one leg at a time If pain is intense in one shin on one spot its worth a visit to the doctor said Heather Gillespie a sports medicine physician at UCLA As in Lanes case the typical shin splint sufferer is someone whos recently changed up her running routine They often occur if you increase your training start running on harder surfaces or if you change your shoes and that changes the way you are running Gillespie said Other risky activities include dancing all that bouncing or basic military training the stress of introducing a sudden intense workout regimen Also people with flat arches are more likely to experience shin splints because they lack strength in their feet Lanes boys did not suffer the same fate she did  active kids who run around all day every day their shins felt fine after the weekend sprints But Lane was lucky too after about a month she returned to interval training with her boys  only now she leaves the sprinting to her younger competitors
