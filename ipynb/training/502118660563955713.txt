When the residents of Liberias West Point slum woke up Wednesday morning to learn their neighborhood had been completely sealed off by the government a riot broke out People screamed and hurled rocks at the police who retaliated with gunshots and batons Late last night in a bid to curb the spread of Ebola Liberias president announced a  pm curfew in the capital Monrovia She also ordered a quarantine of the citys overcrowded West Point neighborhood where some  of Liberias poorest people live Liberia has been overwhelmed by the Ebola outbreak with the number of cases nearing  The country has seen almost  death  the highest among the three Ebolastricken countries in West Africa So when residents raided an Ebola holding center in West Point on Saturday Liberian officials were alarmed Seventeen patients suspected of harboring the virus were dragged out or forced to flee into the neighborhood and may have spread the disease to others NPRs Nurith Aizenman was in West Point and witnessed the violence Joining NPRs Morning Edition from Monrovia she tells Steve Inskeep that the riot began when police escorted the family of a government minister out of the neighborhood Here is an edited excerpt of the interview What exactly did you see I along with the rest of NPRs team here were in West Point We had made it past several blockades that security forces had set up sealing off the neighborhood I should say this is one of the capitals poorest neighborhoods A lot of people there feel very disenfranchised Theyve had very little support as this outbreak has been raging in their midst Its an area that basically consists of a finger of land jutting out from central Monrovia into the Atlantic Ocean Its quite small with only two very narrow roads in So as we were walking up one of those roads we saw a contingent of police escorting this local official and her family including several children out Following very close behind them was a throng of furious people just very angry They were shouting They started throwing chunks of concrete and smaller rocks and things escalated very quickly from there Everyone started racing toward us and security forces around us started firing shots in rapid succession We saw them holding their assault rifles leveled at the crowd not in the air And at least one person was shot  a boy of about  Do you know what happened to that boy We dont know Tommy Trenchard the NPR photographer were working with witnessed it and tried to call for an ambulance We heard someone had picked him up but we havent confirmed that Is there anything specific that you feel sparked this mornings riot Well its been a growing situation Late last night the government announced that West Point was going to be quarantined and they say theyre not letting anyone enter or leave for at least  days Thats how long it takes to know if someone who was exposed to another person with Ebola may have become infected So the people in West Point woke up this morning to find out that their community is being completely blocked off Theyre being told You have this deadly and highly infectious disease running through your neighborhood and you cannot leave Why did the government choose to quarantine West Point Ebola has been spreading in West Point with particular speed As you mentioned on Saturday an angry mob stormed a holding facility that the government had set up in the neighborhood for people suspected of having Ebola People were very upset because the government had not explained why it was setting up that facility You know when an aid group like Doctors Without Borders opens a center they spend a lot of time laying the groundwork with the community getting peoples consent That was not done with this government holding facility They were also bringing in people with suspected Ebola from other neighborhoods and they werent offering supportive care there The center essentially just became a dumping ground for people with Ebola So when it was raided on Saturday  patients who were there were either carried off or forced to flee into the neighborhood where its likely that they came into contact with many others And Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluid including not just blood and vomit but the sweat of an infected person So theres no knowing how many more people have now been infected If the neighborhood is literally sealed off how are people getting food and other supplies I spoke with the minister of the interior this morning and he said that the government will be supplying food rations But by late morning people were already starting to panic over whether this was going to happen They were shouting We need to get out We need food So when police arrived to escort this local officials family out I think it was just the last straw Now government officials say that they were bringing out that family because their home was threatened
