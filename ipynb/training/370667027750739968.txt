How well will a particular patient withstand the stresses of surgery To make that determination surgeons typically order cardiovascular tests Is his heart pumping efficiently Are her lungs providing enough oxygen But Dr Mark Katlic never found that sufficient for older patients  They undergo lots of operations because almost all the conditions that require surgery increase with increasing age Dr Katlic a thoracic surgeon who has published several textbooks on geriatric surgery told me But surgery is also riskier for the elderly he said Longer length of stay More complications Higher risk of death For years Dr Katlic wanted a more specialized surgical approach for older people Last fall he persuaded executives at the nonprofit health organization LifeBridge in Baltimore to take that step The Sinai Center for Geriatric Surgery which he directs is one of the first to focus on elderly surgical patients and it is already collecting information on what improves their experiences in the operating room and afterward Here every prospective patient over age  undergoes a preoperative screening much more thorough than those normally used in hospitals At the Sinai Center for instance nurse practitioners administer tests of frailty including assessments of grip strength and walking speed that have been shown to predict how older patients will withstand surgery They test for cognitive decline depression and hearing loss and review all the medications that patients take  and since nearly all have several chronic illnesses they typically take a lot of them Separately the center gives caregivers a questionnaire to determine how they will handle the stresses of caring for an older person after surgery These are fairly simple tests that any welltrained nurse could do Dr Katlic said They add only about  minutes to preoperative screening he said and the added cost is negligible Armed with this information the staff can work to prevent a patient from becoming delirious in the hospital or call in a social worker to arrange support for an overburdened caregiver We hope that well shorten length of stay and reduce costs and prevent complications Dr Katlic said Its too soon to know if that will happen The center opened late last September and so far its affiliated surgeons have seen about  older patients and performed a wide range of procedures from cardiac surgery to cataract removal and knee replacements Researchers are still collecting data on how the patients  many in their s and s one   fared afterward Several geriatricians and surgeons I asked about this approach none of them involved with the Sinai Center thought it made sense When it comes to medical treatment age really is just a number they said Research shows that   even from fairly extensive procedures if they have in doctor speak the physiologic reserve to rebound from surgery and hospitalization Others may never regain their previous ability to function even if doctors fix the problem they came in with The socalled eyeball test  the ability to look at someones strength muscle mass and walking speed  is a better test than any echocardiogram and all the other fancy technology we use to try to see who will do well after surgery said Dr Martin A Makary a pancreatic surgeon at the Johns Hopkins Hospital who has done extensive research on frailty One of his studies found that with careful screening   after surgery for pancreatic cancer Yet because   you would expect that after all this screening surgeons at a geriatric center would sometimes counsel their patients that the risks of a given procedure outweigh the possible benefits Dr Makary for instance likes to escort his older patients on a walk down the hall and around the corner in his office When he sees someone struggling to maintain balance walking very slowly or becoming short of breath he may say something like This surgery has an extremely high risk and given the  to  percent chance of a cure we can do it But if it were me Id choose not to This doesnt seem to be happening at the Sinai Center where so far very few patients have decided against surgery This probably wont lower the number of operations a surgeon is doing Dr Katlic said But it might modify or change the operations to be less invasive more focused on quality of life than length of life Amen to that But if my parent were confronting this decision Id like to know that a surgeon was also prepared to warn us away from the operating room altogether Still because a growing number of people will face latelife decisions about surgery it will be useful to have results from a specialized geriatric surgical center Dr Katlic is already fielding inquiries from hospitals in other cities that are interested in starting their own
