
 The start this month of high school and college football seasons across the country renews concerns about the issue of repeated head impacts and how to manage or preferably avoid concussions Unfortunately the resources to deal with the problem remain limited Newly released stateoftheart football helmets for instance may measure how much force each players head is absorbing and relay that data via telemetry to trainers on the sidelines but at  or so per helmet they are unattainable for most teams  Which is why a   is so appealing Eminently practical it offers a means by which any team no matter how small or cashstrapped can assess the likelihood of one of its players having sustained an onfield concussion It also celebrates a nifty DIY MacGyverish sensibility rarely seen in our technologyobsessed times  The studys authors began with the simple idea that to manage sportsrelated concussions you need to be able to quickly and easily assess whether a given player has actually sustained one said Steven P Broglio director of the University of Michigans NeuroSport Research Laboratory and coauthor of the study Not every head impact results in a concussion  One means of assessing concussion status Dr Broglio continued is to look at a players reaction time since it is known to increase immediately after a concussion A variety of scientifically validated tools exist to measure players reaction times but most require a computer and sophisticated software and are not practicable on the sidelines or in the budgets of many teams  So Dr Broglio and his colleague Dr James Eckner an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Michigan set out to develop an inexpensive means of measuring reaction time After some noodling Dr Eckner came up with the idea of attaching a hockey puck via adhesive to a long wooden dowel and marking centimeters in ink along the length of the dowel To use the device an evaluator simply holds it in front of an athlete who is seated at a table with one arm resting on the surface and his hand at the tables edge The evaluator aligns the puck with the bottom of the athletes hand and lets go The athlete catches the falling stick The evaluator marks where his hand lands and voila a coach or trainer has a baseline measure of someones reaction time Theoretically should a player later be suspected of having sustained a concussion the trainer could pull out the dowelpuck repeat the test and if the players reaction time were slower conclude that he or she likely was concussed  But that idea required validation So last year Dr Eckner Dr Broglio and their colleagues rigorously tested the reliability of their homemade reactiontime tool They first used the dowel to measure preseason reaction times of collegiate and high school football soccer and hockey players The researchers determined actual reaction times by plugging the centimeter measures into mathematical formulas  Then they waited slightly ghoulishly for the same athletes to become injured The athletes obliged During the season after baseline measurements were collected  male and female athletes were diagnosed with concussions Knowing that these athletes had sustained concussions the scientists asked them to retake the dowel test in each case within at least  hours of the head injury  They also asked another  of the originally tested athletes to retake the test as controls The dowelpuck turned out to be a remarkably reliable indicator of a concussion Those athletes who had sustained the injury were significantly slower now to grasp the dowel often requiring a full second more The unconcussed athletes on the other hand displayed equivalent or in many cases faster reaction times on their retest  The outcome of the testing was so consistent that even its developers seemed a bit taken aback This single fiveminute test requiring equipment costing less than five US dollars had comparable test characteristics to other concussion assessment tools including lengthier computerized neuropsychological test batteries  The practical implications of this finding are obvious Even the least handy of coaches or trainers can cobble together a makeshift ruler using a puck and dowel use it to determine athletes baseline reaction times and retest any player who is suspected of sustaining a concussion The test reliably can be administered on the sidelines immediately after a hard hit Dr Broglio said and if a player shows a longer reaction time no matter how slight the increase the player should almost certainly be removed from play and seen by a doctor  Were not saying that the dowel test is definitive Dr Broglio said Concussions remain highly individualized differing in severity and presentation from player to player The more tests that are used to assess a players brain health he said the better But the dowel measurement has the advantage of being readily available to any team he points out no matter how small their resources if their will to protect their players is sufficiently ample
