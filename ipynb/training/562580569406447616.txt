As a doctor I have become a keen observer of the healthcare I receive since my diagnosis of cancer nearly three years ago In August  I became unwell with an infection following some routine surgery to replace the stents that drain my kidneys This necessitated a trip to the emergency department and a subsequent short admission to hospital One of the starkest observations I made during this particular episode was the absence of introductions from the staff delivering my care It wasnt just the occasional slip but something that seemed to permeate through the professional groups and support staff When someone did offer a friendly introduction however it made all the difference It began a relationship helped to put me at ease relieving my anxieties and humanised what can in many circumstances be an extremely dehumanising experience When introductions were missing I was left wondering who the person was and feeling that I was just another body with a disease in a hospital bed At medical school we were taught on day one of our clinical training to introduce ourselves to a patient before proceeding with anything There were even marks in our exams for completing this task I dont think however that we really focus on why a friendly introduction is so vital and not just a common courtesy As a patient you are in a vulnerable position The healthcare team knows so much personal information about you yet you often know nothing about them This results in a very onesided power imbalance A simple introduction can help to redress this imbalance I also believe it is the first rung on the ladder to providing compassionate care by establishing a human connection and building trust with a person I discussed the absence of introductions with my husband during visiting time one evening Instead of pursuing a complaint which in my experience rarely leads to a tangible improvement in the   we decided to do something positive to remind and encourage healthcare staff about the importance of introductions The result was the social media campaign I launched using the hashtag   I began to tweet frequently about the topic and   for the campaign on my blog The idea was to reinforce the valuable nature of introductions and to ask people throughout the care sector to pledge their commitment to introducing themselves properly to each patient they meet We even designed a logo to give the campaign a visual identity It soon became clear that my experience was not a unique one with scores of other patients and carers taking the opportunity to tell me about their dislike of absent introductions and what a huge impact a welcoming introduction can make to the confidence they had in their healthcare team The campaign seemed to strike a chord and soon I was inundated with messages of support from people across health and social care interested in promoting the idea in their own workplaces The whole spectrum of people from all corners of the NHS was represented from chief executives and medical directors to healthcare assistants student nurses and porters The idea became the focus of many trust board meetings lanyards and badges with the logo were produced reminders popped up in clinics on computer screensavers and trust intranets chief executives began to blog about the campaign and it was a frequent topic of conversation at many healthcare conferences It has made more than m Twitter impressions with more than  individual tweets and nearly  visitors to my blogpost The ingenuity of this idea is its simplicity It costs nothing and takes only seconds but it improves patient experience It is the first step to discovering what matters to that individual and to putting their concerns first I am proud of the care I provide and want my patients to know my name As a patient I believe that it is the little things like this that make the biggest difference Monday  February marks an important date in the campaigns history One hundred NHS organisations will come together in collaborative launch to boost events across the country This has the potential to represent approximately  staff members Today I will be embarking on my own new challenges as I begin further palliative chemotherapy to treat a recent progression in my cancer But I will be watching the events as they unfold on Twitter as Im hooked up to my drip at the hospital  My ultimate ambition for the campaign is that I would be able to walk into any NHS organisation and speak to any member of staff and them to know about hellomynameis and why introductions are so vital Legacy is a powerful motivator for me I would so love to be remembered not as that poor young doctor who died of cancer before her time but as someone who inspired a change towards truly person centred healthcare for everyone
