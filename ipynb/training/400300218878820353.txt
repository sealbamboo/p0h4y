The federal health law gave a huge boost to insurance coverage for preventive care, mandating that nearly all health plans provide cancer screenings, checkups and, more controversially, contraceptives to people without an extra charge..

The Colorectal Cancer Control Program is smaller, operating in half the states.. A .  published by researchers at George Washington University and the Lewin Group estimated that if every state expanded Medicaid under the federal law, 1.7 million low-income uninsured women would still be eligible for that breast cancer screening in 2014 and 4.5 million women would be eligible for cervical cancer screening. An additional 1.6 million men and women would be eligible for the colorectal cancer screening program, says Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy who co-authored the study.. Patient advocates are working to ensure the screening programs aren't cut back..
