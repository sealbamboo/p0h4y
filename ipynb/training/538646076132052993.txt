When people hear that Im an emergency physician they often ask Whats the craziest thing youve ever seen TV shows frequently show ER doctors and nurses heroically saving people on the verge of death Then there are news reports about people abusing the health care system by seeking emergency care for minor problems that could be better handled in a doctors office I see those things But the extremes dont paint a full picture of the urban ER that is the center of my working life So allow me to introduce you to some of the people I saw in the ER on a recent day A middleaged woman complains about stomach pain She tells me that she has had pain for years We talk about why shes there that day and she starts crying She lost her job and shes estranged from her teenage son Her sister died the month before I ask her about weapons at home She tells me shes thinking about killing herself with her husbands gun An yearold woman brings in her yearold brother who is coughing and wheezing While she goes out for a cigarette he tells me that everyone at home  three cousins an aunt his mom and the sister  all smoke They live on a busy road next to an interstate He opens his backpack to show me empty pill bottles and expired asthma inhalers I also see his lunch half a package of Twizzlers two bags of chips and a large soda Paramedics wheel in a yearold man covered in sweat His blood pressure and pulse rate are skyhigh His wife the doctors and the nurses are all worried about a heart attack But an electrocardiogram chest Xray and lab tests turn out to be normal I ask him about drug and alcohol use He tells me hes a daily drinker and uses narcotic painkillers to help him relax Hed been trying to quit Hes not having a heart attack Hes in withdrawal Two trauma patients arrive next First theres an yearold woman whose neighbors called the police after she hadnt been seen for days They found her on the floor of her bathroom mumbling and lying in her own feces Shes emaciated covered in bedsores has four fractured ribs and a broken hip I ask the paramedics about her family They are nowhere to be found Then there is a yearold man who has been shot in the chest and abdomen We stabilize him and get him to the operating room where the surgeons are able to stop his hemorrhage and repair his woundsThis is his third ER visit this year The first time he had been stabbed in the arm and received stitches The second time he had punched a wall and broke his right hand Theres nothing in his record about his home environment I wonder what his life is like and whether well see him again with another injury I see two young women both in their s like me One is unconscious and we rush her to the CT scanner where shes found to have bleeding in her brain Her mother says that shes had a bad headache for a week but didnt want to come in earlier because she was afraid of losing her two parttime jobs The other woman sprained her ankle She looks fine But she shakes her head when I ask if she has been taking the HIV medicine that the medical records tell me she has been prescribed Her boyfriend took all her money she tells me Shes hungry and says she would be grateful if we could get her a sandwich Some would argue that the ER isnt the right place to deal with peoples personal problems But even now many of our patients dont see another doctor These ER visits give us a chance to help them regain their health and also put them on the way toward addressing the underlying issues that affect their wellbeing Sometime were able to   with people who can help them find safe housing affordable medications and nutritious food Often were able to identify those at risk for abuse and selfharm But there are limits to what we can do I wish we had good tools to interrupt the cycle of violence curb the epidemic of   and ensure equitable access to care If you could spend a day in the ER hearing patients like I do I think youd see in a way that you might not have before that health doesnt exist in a vacuum Doctors and nurses need to understand where our patients live work and play We need to connect with and really   Its these deeply personal conversations that allow us to diagnose and treat the real causes of our patients ills
