Because of his palate problems Lentil was unable to eat or drink on his own and he had to be fed through a tube every couple of hours He needed constant care so Lindsay Condefer a volunteer with the French Bull Dog Rescue Network of Philadelphia stepped in to help  She began a  feeding program making sure Lentil was getting nutrition properly and frequently His palate was so deformed that food and liquid going up Lentils nose and into his lungs was a danger The first three months of Lentils life were touchandgo Condefer says she was constantly on edge  In the beginning he ate every two hours throughout over a hour period and then as he got older we were able to stretch it to three hours she explains  It was obvious Lentil would eventually need surgery so she sought the help of doctors at the University of Pennsylvanias veterinary school   She also started to blog about her experiences with Lentil and created a   figuring it would be a good way to create awareness of the problems cleft lips and palates cause in animals including dogs She never thought Lentil would become so popular  I started the blog first just to sit and write and get all my thoughts out to like let people know what I was feeling and going through says Condefer And then the blog turned into his Facebook page and I remember looking at him and thinking  Wait he has  people following him Oh my gosh he has up to   Because Lentil was so young doctors had to wait a few months before performing his surgery Drs Alexander Reiter and John Lewis both with the vet schools Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery had worked on animals with cleft palates before but Lentils case was special because he also had the cleft lip   The two consulted with Dr Jesse Taylor a plastic surgeon at the   on the best way to treat the puppy Because Lentils lip was only a cosmetic problem that did not interfere with his eating and drinking the surgeons agreed to fix just his palate   The cleft lip itself is more of a cosmetic surgery Reiter notes Its not really a necessity for patients that are not fully aware of what they look like Because Lentil would still have his cleft lip the vet school wanted the pup to become part of a program it was developing where kids with certain conditions met animals with the same conditions  Lentil the doctors felt would be the perfect ambassodog for children with craniofacial issues  We started to talk about how it may be beneficial to be able to allow some of our veterinary patients who were having some pretty complex craniofacial surgeries and some changes in appearance to be able to meet some children and even adults who are going through some pretty similar procedures and having to deal with some similar problems Lewis says  Its sort of a pet therapy where people can relate a little bit more with those pets that have gone through things that theyve gone through as well Its that need to relate to others that pediatric plastic surgeons such as Taylor say is important because kids with with facial differences need to feel as normal as possible  Our passion is to help these children and their families become normal parts of society Taylor says They need to be able to interact with other people on a very human level SInce that time Lentil has visited hundreds of patients at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Hes enormously popular there and children such as hospital patient Danny Pfeiffer have bonded with him  Pfeiffer  has a genetic condition called   in which the skull bones fuse prematurely preventing the skull from growing normally and affecting the shape of the head and face He says Lentil has helped him deal with the many complications that come with facial surgeries  He doesnt look like you know a regular dog says Pfeiffer So that kind of makes him special so it probably makes kids who have something that I have makes them feel special Since his successful surgery in May Lentil has been able to eat and drink without help  Hes already been the mascot for the Lentil Festival in Philadelphia to raise money for craniofacial awareness and he just returned from a   kids camp in Orlando Florida a gathering place for children nationwide with craniofacial conditions Pop star Cher serves as a national spokeswoman for the group  When he isnt traveling Lentil greets fans at Condefers Philadelphia pet shop They come to thank him for his work in raising awareness Fans call him the Bean and themselves Beanstalkers Meanwhile Lentils Facebook page just keeps growing  Condefer still cant get over her pets impact Seeing him meet these children  and he would just go up to them sleep on their lap and you could see how they related to him and how he related to these children  it was wonderful she says Hes here for a reason and hes made it for a reason and thats what makes him special
