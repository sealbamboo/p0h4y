Scientists say they have uncovered a basic process that may help explain why some peoples thinking skills decline with age  Research indicates as individuals begin to have difficulties interpreting simple images their overall intelligence falls too   Psychologists suggest this ability to glean information at a glance may play a critical role in how we deal with more complex tasks The study appears in Current Biology Psychologists from the University of Edinburgh studied  healthy yearolds for six years  Each took a series of tests designed to check complex thinking skills and compare these with how accurately they could process simple visual information Intelligence tests included memorising lists of numbers and then repeating them backwards and sorting words into alphabetical order before reciting them   To measure visual processing participants watched a computer screen as two different sized shapes flashed up  Some images appeared for as few as six milliseconds while others were present for up to  milliseconds  They were asked to correctly identify the shape with the longest edge  As people got older their ability to do well in this task decreased   And the worse their scores on the visual processing tests the worse they did in more complex intelligence tasks Dr Stuart Ritchie a lead researcher in the study said The results suggest the brains ability to make correct decisions based on brief visual impressions limits the efficiency of more complex mental functions Since the declines are so strongly related it might be easier under some circumstances to use the shape test to chart a participants cognitive decline than it would be to sit them down and give them a full complicated battery of IQ tests Dr James Thompson of University College London who was not involved in the research told the BBC This is important work  We know older peoples mental processes start to slow over time But we dont know exactly why this happens This research makes us question whether the reason we start to slow up in old age is because the speed at which we apprehend the world slows down Scientists say these types of cognitive skills are important in everyday activities such as making decisions regarding money  As our population ages it is will be increasingly important to understand the basic mechanisms behind these changes in intelligence Dr Ritchie told the BBC
