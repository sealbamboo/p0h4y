We like to think that if we eat our recommended daily allowance of fruits and vegetables were doing right by our bodies Think again says health writer Jo Robinson In her     Robinson argues that our prehistoric ancestors picked and gathered wild plants that were in many ways far more healthful than the stuff we buy today at farmers markets But this change she says isnt the result of the muchbemoaned modern industrial food system It has been thousands of years in the making  ever since humans first took up farming some   more or less and decided to cultivate the wild plants that were the most pleasurable to eat she writes More pleasurable generally meant less bitter and higher in sugar starch or oil Basically Robinson tells  s Dave Davies we looked around at all this wild food that we had been eating for millennia forever and we kind of said to each other Were getting tired of eating this bitter chewy fibrous lowsugar food and we can do better than that And over the centuries Robinson says those choices in human agriculture led to a dramatic loss in the nutrient value of the plants we eat most commonly  something she says we had no way of knowing until recently when modern technology made it possible to do so But Robinson isnt arguing that we should all go back to foraging for our dinner Rather she calls her book a field guide to nutritious food Drawing on hundreds of scientific studies she uses her book to lay out which commonly available foods offer the best nutritional bang for the bite We learn for example that longer cooking can boost tomatoes health benefits And that broccoli begins to lose cancerfighting compounds within  hours of harvest  thats why its one of the foods that Robinson suggests people eat as fresh as possible To peel them you had to get a machete or something similar to that to take off the skins so we looked around and one of our remote ancestors came upon a mutant banana This was natures mutant  nature is making mutations all the time  and thats how we get all of the varieties that we have in our fruits and vegetables Well this particular mutation did away with the seeds so that the seeds had been diminished to tiny black dots and if you look at the bananas in our supermarket thats what youll see no viable seeds but just these little dots   These are molecular nutrients theyre not macronutrients and the reason that Im focusing on them is that were just beginning to realize that these plant compounds  the technical name for them is polyphenols but I call them phytonutrients  they play a role in every cell and system of our bodies and every month new information is published showing these phytonutrients are really essential for optimum health  These are the things weve reduced more than any of the other nutrients   Go out and find a dandelion leaf rinse it well and take a bite and pay attention to your senses For the first  seconds you wont sense much at all except youll notice that the leaf is hairy and quite dense quite chewy Then this bloom of bitterness will come at the roof of your mouth and go down your throat and its going to stay there for about  minutes And many of the wild plants that we used to eat had levels of bitterness similar to that dandelion  Compared to spinach which we consider a superfood a dandelion has twice as much calcium and three times as much vitamin A five times more vitamins K and E and eight times more antioxidants   If you take your lettuce right from the store and rinse it and dry it and then if you rip it into bitesized pieces before you store it youre going to increase the antioxidant activity  fourfold The next time you eat it its going to have four times as many antioxidants   There are fruits and vegetables that also burn up their antioxidants and their sugar at a really rapid rate and they happen to be those superstars of nutrition that were all encouraged to eat So Im just going to give you a list of things you should get as fresh as possible perhaps from a farmers market which  is going to be probably fresher than from the supermarket and eat as soon as possible So it would be artichokes arugula asparagus broccoli Brussels sprouts kale lettuce parsley mushrooms and spinach   I think you should have an Eat Me First list on your refrigerator of those foods that you should eat the day you bring them home or the next day It could make a measurable difference in your health
