Nobody wants to think that he or she has bad breath, medically known as halitosis. But according to Jonathan B. Levine, DMD, an associate professor at the NYU School of Dentistry, more than half of us suffer from it. "Most people do have bad breath and just do not know it," he says.. Walking around with bad breath is obviously something that most people would prefer to avoid. But before you can cure bad breath, you need to be able to tell if you have it.. Actually, Dr. Levine and other .  experts believe there is quite a lot that can be done about bad breath, and most of the tips to halt halitosis are quite simple. It all starts with looking out for the subtle (and not-so-subtle) signs of bad breath:. Now that you know the signs, there's a simple trick to test your breath for yourself. "Take a minute and try this easy Bad Breath Self Awareness Test," suggests Levine. "Wipe the surface of your mouth with a piece of cotton gauze and smell that. If you notice a yellowish stain on the cotton, that's a likely sign that you have an elevated sulfide production level. Now, lick the back of your hand. Let it dry for about 10 seconds, then smell. If you notice an odor, you have a breath disorder because the sulfur salts from your tongue have been transferred to your hand.". Another approach is to get an unbiased opinion. "Ask someone you trust who will give you an honest answer," says Dan Marut, DMD, a dentist based in Ashland, Ore., who's the president and founder of Quality Dental Plan. "You can always ask a dental professional as well. Many times people are embarrassed to ask, and others are afraid to tell them. Your mouth is a very personal space — talking about it is not always easy."
