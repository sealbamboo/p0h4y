The two scientists who won this years   in Physiology or Medicine discovered that cells in our body have the remarkable ability to reinvent themselves They found that every cell in the human body from our skin and bones to our heart and brain can be coaxed into forming any other cell The process is called reprogramming and its potential for new drugs and therapies is vast If neurons or heart cells are damaged by disease or aging then cells from the skin or blood potentially could be induced to reprogram themselves and repair the damaged tissue The winners    of the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge England and   of Kyoto University in Japan and the Gladstone Institute in San Francisco  made their discoveries more than  years apart In  Gurdon proved that a cell from a frogs stomach contained the entire blueprint to make a whole frog When he took the cells nucleus and popped it into a frog egg the egg developed into a normal frog This method eventually was used to clone all sorts of animals including cats dogs horses and most famously    the first mammal cloned from an adult cell Gurdon  continues to study reprogramming and was working in his lab when he received the call from the Nobel committee But a major obstacle stood in the way of further development of these stem cells Getting the frogs stomach cell to strip away its specialization and turn into one of the  or so cell types known to exist in animals always required the use of an egg A question hung over the field for decades Could a specialized cell reprogram itself all on its own In  Yamanaka and graduate student Kazutoshi Takahashi   the answer and it sent shockwaves through biology and medicine They demonstrated that any cell could be reset and induced to develop into another cell type And even more remarkably that it took little to get the job done Yamanaka and Takahashi took some cells from the skin of a mouse and then switched on four specific genes After a few weeks the cells stopped looking like skin cells and starting looking more like embryonic stem cells That meant the cells could then be manipulated to develop into just about any cell Yamanaka wanted He could even get the cells to form heart muscle that beat inside a Petri dish Yamanaka  had essentially unlocked a cellular genie in the bottle The discovery meant that a cell wasnt necessarily trapped in its fate to be say a skin liver or heart cell Rather with the right instructions a cell had the ability to strip away its specialization and become whatever cell the scientists chose They called these new cells   The landmark finding triggered thousands of studies Researchers quickly wanted to learn how these new stem cells could be used to treat a vast array of diseases such as Alzheimers muscular dystrophy and diabetes Although stem cell treatments for these diseases are still quite far away the induced pluriopotent stem cells are turning out to be invaluable tools for studying hundreds of diseases They can serve as a platform for screening drugs or for even simply testing how a patient will respond to a particular medicine The discoveries by Gurdon and Yamanaka have opened up a new era in personalized medicine where each persons own cells may one day serve not only as a reservoir for fixing damaged tissue but also as research tools for deciphering how diseases work inside each persons unique body Induced pluripotent stem cells also offer a possible alternative to human embryonic stem cells which are controversial because they are obtained from embryos
