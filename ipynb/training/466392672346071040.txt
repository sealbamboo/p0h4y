Old age is associated with moving into a care home or struggling on in your own home But is there an alternative The residents of the Denham Garden Village retirement complex think so For those who were at the November auditions for Britains Got Talent at Arsenals Emirates Stadium in London it will live long in the memory The strong band who sang the Elvis Presley hit The Wonder of You were quite different from the normal wannabes The group was entirely made up of pensioners  Among them that day was yearold widow Irene Griffiths She has always loved singing and was one of the prime movers behind the attempt to get on the TV show She runs a singing group Voices at Denham Garden Village a retirement centre in Uxbridge on the outskirts of London Most of the band came from the group Irene says It was a fantastic experience and by all accounts we almost made it through It was good to show what us old people can do I have always loved singing  its good socially good for your breathing and memory It is important to keep active like this as you get older I have always tried to do that Irene is lucky in many ways She remains in good health and that has allowed her to make the most of the opportunities her life at Denham has presented her with She organises trips for other residents and has helped run a film club Last year she was even chair of the residents association She has lived in the village for fiveandahalf years and is one of a growing band of pensioners opting to spend their final years at such complexes  Denham which is run by the notforprofit housing group   is typical of many of the retirement villages that have opened across the country It is built around a central hub containing a health club swimming pool GP surgery village hall and cafebar  The  homes  both houses and apartments  can either be bought or rented and have been designed to accommodate the needs of older people Lifts can be installed and they come equipped with floorlevel showers and grabs rails There are also domiciliary care services that can be bought in if and when necessary The cost is  an hour which is broadly in line with what local authorities charge The aim is to keep people living independent lives rather than having to turn to care homes and other intensive support as they get older However while it has been designed to be part of the wider community you cannot get away from the sense that it remains a selfcontained community  a kind of university campus for pensioners Residents could easily never leave the site Irene moved to Denham with her late husband after the upkeep of their threebedroom bungalow in the nearby village of Ickenham became too much My husband had emphysema and was struggling to help with the garden and around the house and it was just too much for me on my own so we decided to move somewhere smaller Denham was perfect I knew it because I used to drive past here So we sold our house and bought a twobedroom apartment She says one consideration was that by purchasing a property  it cost just under   less than they sold the bungalow for  she knew there would be something that she could pass on to her two daughters This is something that not everybody is able to do Increases in life expectancy have meant there has been a rise in the numbers of people going into care homes  and many do not qualify for any state help towards the cost so find themselves having to sell their family homes to pay for their places  The great thing here is that there is independent living but you do have that safety net if you need it says Irene Soon after moving in to Denham her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer It came too late It had spread and three months later he died We always thought there was something else wrong and it was very hard to cope with just after the move But he was positive and stayed strong I know it was a comfort to him that he saw where we had moved to and could see that I would be happy here But Irene is not the only person who has kept busy since moving to Denham Garden Village Also present at the Britains Got Talent audition that day was yearold widow Joan Emms  She moved to the village four years ago and has since found love with yearold expublican Fred Miller They enjoy their Saturday nights out  We go to the cafebar says Joan They often have live acts and we enjoy a dance  well I do I have a vodka and soda and Fred likes his gin and tonics Theyre nice clean drinks  thats important at our age But not everybody is as lucky as Joan and Irene Wendy Prosser  cares fulltime for her husband Neil  at Denham This is not a unique situation   estimate m people over the age of  are providing care to loved ones filling a vital gap as councilrun social care has had to start to ration the amount of help it can provide amid rising demands from an ageing population and squeezes on its budgets Neil was left with limited mobility after having brain surgery to remove a tumour eight years ago It means he can only walk short distances with the help of a walking frame  The couple sold their house in Dorset for  and invested the proceeds which allows them to pay the amonth rent For me as a carer it works really well says Wendy I go to the gym four times a week where I get to mix with young people That is important you must never lose that I have a joke with them about the music they play I tell them Thats not music The problem is when your life changes like it did for us you can end up very isolated We were keen golfers and our social life revolved around that But after Neils operation that went We didnt blame our friends They had their own lives  But its no good feeling sorry for yourselves I say to Neil Weve got our memories We will sit there and say Do you remember that holiday or that day It is terribly important to cling to the positives It can be very testing at times Neil has memory problems and can be quite forgetful so I find myself having to repeat myself a lot Now weve run three businesses together so when that person you have done all that with has lost some of those capabilities it can be hard This is what I have got to do The NHS saved Neils life  It gave us eight years we would not have had otherwise so it is my responsibility to look after him Im never going to let or expect anyone to help us That wouldnt be right You have to remember that it s not the end of life Its the beginning of another phase If you can embrace it it can be really good But not everyone has got someone to look after them Freda Shand was working as an actress when she was diagnosed with a narrowing of the spinal canal  nearly  years ago  Now in her s she is confined to a wheelchair but does not have family close by to look after her She pays for oneandahalf hours of care a day from Denhams domiciliary care team  I have been gradually losing mobility as I get older When I came here I could walk with a frame and I could get into the pool but not any more  Realising there are things you can no longer do gets harder You are always having to readapt Take driving for instance I can no longer drive so I catch the bus into town I have a friend who has MS and is in a wheelchair too But as buses can only take one person in a wheelchair at a time we dont go into town together There are times when I feel trapped but you have to get on with it You can still live an independent life I have lovely friends here  that is important and gives me strength
