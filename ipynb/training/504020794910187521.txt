Researchers have identified a new culprit in the epidemic of childhood obesity parents who cant even tell that their pudgy kids are overweight A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that American parents are significantly less likely to make an accurate assessment of their childrens weight compared with parents from an earlier generation If moms and dads dont see the problem they arent likely to be part of the solution the researchers say Crucial to parental involvement in weight reduction or maintenance efforts among children is parental recognition of their childs overweight status the team wrote in the   which was published Monday This recognition and the associated health risks are the main driving force motivating parents to take action The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define   not according to   as it   but according to how a childs BMI compares with that of other kids of the same age and gender Children who have a BMI at or above the th percentile are considered obese and those with a BMI between the th and th percentiles are considered overweight In  fully  of children between the ages of  and  were considered obese up from  in  the study authors wrote Previous studies have documented that parents arent always attuned to the fact that their kids are carrying around more pounds than they ought to Indeed researchers have found that some lowincome mothers reject the CDCs growth charts as ethnically biased and therefore invalid the study authors wrote Kids are   too CDC researchers say The new study is believed to be the first aimed at determining whether parental misperceptions of childrens weight is getting worse As the prevalence of pediatric obesity has tripled within decades the socially accepted ideal body weight may also be shifting accordingly wrote the researchers who are from Georgia Southern University in Statesboro New York University and Fudan University in Shanghai So they looked at data on children between the ages of  and  that were collected as part of the CDCs   which has been tracking the health of Americans since the s They pulled records on  kids who participated in NHANES between  and  as well as  kids who were tracked between  and  In both instances their parents usually their moms were asked whether they thought the childrens weight was too high too low or just about right In the more recent survey  of the overweight boys and  of the overweight girls were judged to be about the right weight by their parents according to the study Those figures were higher than in the earlier survey when the parents of  of overweight boys and of  of overweight girls thought their childrens weight was fine Additionally the proportion of parents who recognized that their children were overweight fell from  to  for parents of boys and from  to  for parents of girls the researchers found The trend was more pronounced for kids who were obese In the late s and early s  of obese boys were described by their parents as being about the right weight by the s that figure rose to  For obese girls the proportion of parents who thought their daughters weight was fine jumped to  from  according to the study Over the years kids have had to get heavier before their parents noticed that they are overweight In the earlier survey period parents would say that their kids were overweight if they were at or above the th percentile for BMI By the later study that threshold had risen to the st percentile the researchers reported Overall parents ability to tell that their overweight kids were indeed overweight declined by  the researchers concluded This suggests a generational shift in social norms related to childrens body weight they wrote In the wake of the obesity pandemic more and more parents may compare their child to peers or friends of their child to maintain a positive image of their own child the researchers added These firsthand observations are probably more meaningful to parents than the growth charts displayed in in the offices of pediatricians they concluded
