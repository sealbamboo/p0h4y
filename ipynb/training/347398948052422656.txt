Infections with the human papillomavirus tied to cervical cancer fell by more than half in US teen girls after the HPV vaccine was introduced in  despite highprofile controversy  and low rates of uptake a new study shows  Government health officials said Wednesday that the new data should encourage wider acceptance of the vaccine which became a lighting rod for political controversy almost from the moment it was implemented Texas Gov Rick Perry issued a  executive order mandating that all sixthgrade girls be required to get HPV vaccinations a move he later disavowed and in  Rep Michele Bachmann ignited a firestorm by raising questions about the safety of the vaccine and whether it could cause mental retardation Even now only about a third of US teen girls ages  to  have had the full series of shots that prevent HPV infection despite repeated studies that show the vaccine is safe and effective said Dr Tom Frieden director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Other countries including places such as Rwanda have higher HPV vaccination rates than the US he added  The report should be a wakeup call to our nation to protect the next generation by increasing HPV vaccination rates said Frieden These are striking results because we can protect the next generation of adolescents and girls against cancer Rates of HPV infection targeted by the vaccine fell from  percent in  to  to  percent from  to  in girls and women ages  to  a decline of  percent according to new data published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases The effectiveness of getting at least  shot in the threedose series was  percent the study concluded  That proves that the HPV vaccine works well in that target group Frieden added If the US had reached a rate of  percent vaccination some  lifetime cases of cervical cancer could be prevented Frieden said  For every year we delay in doing so another  girls will develop cervical cancer in their lifetimes he added About  million Americans most in their late teens and early s are infected with HPV Each year about  million people become newly infected the CDC says About  million doses of HPV vaccine have been administered in the US since  Frieden noted  About  cancers caused by HPV infections occur in women in the US each year according to the CDC with cervical cancers being the most common About  cancers caused by HPV occur each year in US men throat cancers are most common  The new study led by CDC medical epidemiologist Dr Lauri Markowitz used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or NHANES to compare prevalence of certain types of HPV infection in girls and women ages  to  before and after the  launch of the HPV vaccine  Results showed the vaccine actually worked better than expected to cut overall HPV rates in girls and women aged  to  There was no difference in other age groups over the time periods the study found  The decline in vaccinetype prevalence is even better than we hoped for Frieden said That could be in part because girls and women who are sexually active sought out the vaccine more often contributing to the lower prevalence Markowitz said  There are two HPV vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil Gardasil targets HPV strains    and  to protect against cervical vaginal vulvar and anal cancer and genital warts Cervarix targets HPV strains  and  and protects girls and women against cervical cancer Only Gardasil is available for males Routine vaccination is recommended starting at age  or  for both boys and girls but recent national immunization surveys show that only about half of all girls in the US  and far fewer boys  have gotten even first dose of HPV vaccine the CDC said  Vaccination rates remain low in part because providers dont recommend them strongly enough and because some parents are reluctant to administer them Frieden said Parents worry about the safety of the vaccine and about immunizing children who are not sexually active  He noted that the vaccine must be administered early before sexual activity starts for best effect and that repeated studies have shown HPV vaccines are as safe as other vaccines recommended for that age group Most common side effects are minor and include fainting dizziness and redness and pain at the injection site CDC has not been able to link serious adverse events or deaths to the HPV vaccine said Dr Cindy Weinbaum a medical epidemiologist I think we owe it to the next generation  our sisters our daughters and our patients  to protect them against cancer Frieden said
