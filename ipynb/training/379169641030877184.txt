Seattle Seahawks fans like to boast that theirs is the noisiest stadium in the world On Sunday theyll get their chance to prove it A Guinness World Records representative will be at CenturyLink to measure the decibel level of Seahawks fans as their team plays rivals San Francisco ers Its the end result of a showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs who have also long claimed bragging rights for their Arrowhead Stadium as the worlds loudest sports facility   While the goal of a roaring crowd may be about whipping fans into a greater frenzy and intimidating the opposing teams and players as a   its not only a bad idea for fans hearing  it doesnt really help the home team experts say  Seattle is going to have to beat the current world record of  decibels set by fans at a  soccer match in Istanbul Turkey But if Seahawks fans are named Worlds Loudest on Sunday  what even is the point Decades of research have looked at the effect of a noisy crowd on athletic performance and theres never been any conclusive scientific evidence that a boisterous crowd does indeed help the home team win social and sport psychologists say  So the Seattle Seahawks are trying for this crowd record  is that going to help their players win or play better I would put a big question mark on that says Robert Weinberg who specializes in sport psychology at Miami University in Oxford Ohio Maybe it will maybe it wont Thats what the research would say  A lot of fans think that just because there is a home court advantage or you have loud vociferous fans its going to help your team perform better Weinberg says Thats not necessarily  it can be  but its not necessarily the case Besides that  what about your poor ears What it is most certainly doing is damaging the hearing of every person in attendance People dont recognize how much damage they can do to their hearing says Alison Grimes an assistant clinical professor of headneck surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and director of audiology at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center People will say Oh it was just for  minutes Grimes says And what I tell my patients is that noise is cumulative over the lifetime Each time you use a chain saw or ride a motorcycle or go to a stadium to make the sound meter reach the top it accumulates Before the Sunday game every Seattle fan should at the very least buy the overthecounter ear plugs says Dr Anil Lalwani professor and vice chair for research director of the division of otology neurotology and skull base surgery at NewYorkPresbyterian HospitalColumbia University Medical Center Those will lower the sound level by about  to  decibels Wearing those with headphones can bring it down by a total of  decibels The thing to keep in mind is that there is a reciprocal relationship between the intensity of the sound and the duration you can be exposed to it Grimes said If youre literally talking about  decibels  nobody should ever be exposed to that Grimes said There isnt a safe amount of time for  decibels Its physically painful as well as acoustically damaging Remember hair cells in your ear dont grow back There is no Rogaine for your inner ear warns Grimes While hearing aids work really well there is no substitute for natural hearing Thats why parents should be especially careful about bringing their children to the Sunday game or any other loud stadium without ear protection Already tens of millions of kids ages  to  are showing signs of hearing loss     largely because of portable music devices Hours in a very loud environment  a sports event or rock concert  can create a cumulative effect on fragile ears experts say   Not everyones ears will be hurt the same amount Some may leave the game unscathed while others may experience significant hearing loss Lalwani said  If the noise is sustained at  decibels or louder there are going to be some unhappy people leaving that stadium Lalwani said They may have ringing in their ears a loss of clarity for a day or so  some may have permanent damage So while the Seahawks and Chiefs fans battle it out for the loudest stadium title during the  season they should keep in mind that winning that title might not help them clinch the real championship prize  In the end while a loud environment can increase physical arousal  psychologically speaking that means a player might be more alert and very reactive to external stimulation  increased physical arousal has also been shown to negatively effect fine motor skills  like the skills a quarterback might depend on Weinberg says Thats one of the reasons behind the hush at golf tournaments as the players try to sink a sixfoot putt  And what about the impact of all that noise on peoples emotional and physical wellbeing Loud noises can make people irritable says Lalwani So if the Seahawks lose the game against San Francisco and fail to clinch the Guinness record there may be some very cranky Seattle fans Sunday night
