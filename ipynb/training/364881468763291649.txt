LONDON  The first scientific analysis of probable humantohuman transmission of a deadly new strain of bird flu that emerged in China this year gives the strongest evidence yet that the HN virus can pass between people scientists said on Wednesday  Research published in the British Medical Journal BMJ analyzing a family cluster of cases of HN infection in eastern China found it was very likely the virus transmitted directly from the index patient a yearold man to his daughter  Experts commenting on the research said while it did not necessarily mean HN is any closer to becoming the next flu pandemic it does provide a timely reminder of the need to remain extremely vigilant  The threat posed by HN has by no means passed James Rudge and Richard Coker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said in a commentary in the same journal  The scientists who led the study stressed however that the virus has not yet gained the ability to transmit from person to person efficiently  meaning the risk is very low that it could cause a human pandemic in its current form  The new bird flu virus which was unknown in humans until February has so far infected at least  people in China and Taiwan killing  of them according to the latest World Health Organization WHO data  Most cases have been in people who had visited live poultry markets or had close contact with live poultry in seven to  days before falling ill  The BMJ study lead by Changjun Bao at the Jiangsu Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed a family cluster of two HN patients  a father and daughter  in Eastern China in March   The first index patient  a yearold man  regularly went to a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last exposure to poultry  He was admitted to hospital on March  When his symptoms became worse he was transferred to an intensive care unit ICU on March  but died of multiorgan failure on May  the study reported  The second patient his healthy yearold daughter had no known exposure to live poultry but provided direct bedside care for her father in the hospital before he went to intensive care  She developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and went into hospital on March  She was moved to the ICU on March  and died of multiorgan failure on April   Strains of the virus isolated from samples taken from each patient were almost genetically identical  a strong suggestion that the virus was transmitted directly from father to daughter the researchers said  To our best knowledge this is the first report of probable transmissibility of the novel virus persontoperson with detailed epidemiological clinical and virological data they wrote  Peter Horby of the Oxford University clinical research unit in Hanoi Vietnam who was not involved in this research said the study raised the level of concern about HN and reinforced the need for intensive surveillance
