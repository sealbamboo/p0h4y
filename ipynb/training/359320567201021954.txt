Banning abortions after a specific point in pregnancy has been a popular trend in the states this year Last week   made Texas the th state to ban most abortions after  weeks But how states define the starting point for that  weeks may cause headaches for women and their doctors  and ultimately affect whether these laws pass constitutional muster Like all but one of the   the Texas law starts its week calendar at fertilization But thats not the same as saying  weeks of pregnancy because thats not how doctors measure pregnancy When we refer to the weeks of pregnancy weeks of gestation we measure pregnancy from the date of the last normal menstrual period says   Hes an assistant professor of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco and a vice president of   a reproductive rights advocacy group For a woman who has a normal menstrual period ovulation or fertilization would generally occur two weeks later after that start of that normal menstrual period Grossman says The age of the embryo or the fetus is essentially two weeks less than the number of weeks measured from the last menstrual period  or LMP is generally how doctors refer to the weeks of pregnancy   is considered full term for a normal pregnancy even though at that point fertilization occurred only  weeks before So why do doctors use a measurement thats so imprecise That standard developed in the old days before ultrasound was widely used Grossman says The last menstrual period was something that was knowable and was measurable whereas it wasnt always known when fertilization took place With few exceptions however thats not how the state laws  and a bill that    are being written What were seeing with these laws is that they are pegging the beginning of pregnancy to fertilization says Elizabeth Nash who tracks state issues for the   an abortion rights think tank So when we talk about a law that bans abortion at  weeks postfertilization were really talking about a law that bans abortion at  weeks of pregnancy she says Why is it then that people keep referring to these as  week laws Nash says its not that hard to figure out Thats the term that is used in the bill and oftentimes when you see a term used in the bill it becomes the headline she says But whether the laws seek to ban abortion at  weeks or  weeks one thing is clear says Daniel Grossman The ban they would impose is earlier than whats currently considered   or when a fetus can survive outside the womb I think theres definitely consensus that viability doesnt happen before  menstrual weeks he says So when were talking about banning abortion at  or  weeks even thats clearly at least two weeks before the earliest point in pregnancy where viability would be a concern Thats important because current Supreme Court precedent says states   But those pushing these laws clearly hope that by the time one of these laws makes its way to the justices they might change their minds Similar doubts were raised about about the   few thought would survive court scrutiny according to Douglas Johnson of the   The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was struck down by every lower fed court that considered it Johnson said last week at a press conference on the federal version of the week ban Three US District Courts three US Courts of Appeals all ruled it was in clear violation of US Supreme Court precedent But when it reached the US Supreme Court they said otherwise And they upheld it So whether you count to  or  the ultimate number that will matter most is five  the number of Supreme Court justices needed for a majority
