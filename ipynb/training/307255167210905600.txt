                  One reason it works is that you cant breathe deeply and be anxious at the same time To do the  breath exhale completely through your mouth then inhale through your nose for a count of four Hold your breath for a count of seven Now let it out slowly through your mouth for a count of eight Repeat at least twice a day Almost universally people get more anxious and irritable when they are hungry says Dr Ramsey coauthor of   When you get an anxiety attack it may mean your blood sugar is dropping The best thing to do is to have a quick sustaining snack like a handful of walnuts or a piece of dark chocolate along with a glass of water or a nice cup of hot tea 
                   
                  In the long term diet is key to reducing anxiety says Dr Ramsey His advice Eat a wholefoods plantbased diet with carefully selected meat and seafood plenty of leafy greens such as kale to get folate and a wide variety of phytonutrients to help reduce anxiety Stop starving yourself advises Dr Ramsey Many people with anxiety disorders skip breakfast I recommend that people eat things like eggs which are a satiating and filling protein and are natures top source of choline Low levels of choline are associated with increased anxiety You know fish oils are good for the heart and perhaps they protect against depression Add anxiety to the list In one   students who took  milligrams a day of mixed omega fatty acids for  weeks had less anxiety before an exam than students taking placebo

                  Other good choices anchovies sardines and mussels When youre attacked by anxiety its easy to get into a mind set known as catastrophic thinking or catastrophizing Your mind goes to the bad terrible really horrible just unbearable things and what if they really do happen You think This could really ruin my life says Dr Ramsey

                  Chances are a catastrophic outcome is a lot less likely than you think when youre consumed with anxiety Very few events really change the trajectory of your life says Dr Ramsey Ever wonder why you feel so relaxed after a spell in the sauna or a steam room Heating up your body reduces muscle tension and anxiety research finds Sensations of warmth may   including those that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin Warming up may be one of the ways that exercisenot to mention curling up by a fire with a cozy cup of teaboosts mood 
                   
                  As one group of researchers   Whether lying on the beach in the midday sun on a Caribbean island grabbing a few minutes in the sauna or spa after work or sitting in a hot bath or Jacuzzi in the evening we often associate feeling warm with a sense of relaxation and wellbeing The Japanese call it   literally forest bath You and I know it as a walk in the woods Japanese researchers   in people who walked for about  minutes in a beautiful forest with the woodsy smells and the sounds of a running stream 
                   
                  The forest bathers had lower stress hormone levels after their walk than they did after a comparable walk in an urban area Mindfulness meditation originally a Buddhist practice but now a mainstream therapy is particularly effective in treating anxiety says Teresa M Edenfield PhD a clinical psychologist in the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Durham NC who often uses it to treat anxiety patients The act of practicing mindful awareness allows one to experience the true essence of each moment as it really occurs rather than what is expected or feared she says 
                   
                  How to begin You can start by simply paying attention to the present moment intentionally with curiosity and with an effort to attend nonjudgmentally Edenfield says To stay mindful ask yourself simple questions while practicing breathing exercises Edenfield suggests Sit in a comfortable place close your eyes and focus on how your breath feels coming in and out of your body Now ask yourself silent questions while focusing on the breath 
                   
                  What is the temperature of the air as it enters your nose How does your breath feel different as it leaves your body How does the air feel as it fills your lungs Are you having anxious thoughts Congratulations Youre aware of your emotional state and that awareness is the first step in reducing anxiety says Edenfield 
                   
                  Remember to give yourself credit for being aware that you are having anxious thoughts and probably body changes This is truly a skill of mindfulness that must be learned and is essential in making the next steps of intervening through strategies such as positive selftalk cognitive reframing or the use of mindfulness or relaxation strategies
