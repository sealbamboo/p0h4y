So youre thinking you might like to check out one of those inexpensive new tests that would give you some insight into say the health implications of your ethnic heritage It may incidentally turn up findings you may or may not want  say on your Alzheimers disease risk or your risk of developing lung breast or skin cancer And lets say in the next year or two that when you apply for life insurance or longterm care or disability insurance the insurance company demands to know whether youve had any genetic testing done and if so wants to see it Or requires some genetic testing done as a condition of providing coverage Didnt see that coming did you The insurance companies have  and fortunately for us so has a group of bioethicists from Columbia University who in a commentary in this weeks Journal of the American Medical Assn pondered the notatall distant future in which insurers will seek access to applicants genetic test findings before making their underwriting decisions Now that it can cost as little as  to have a fullgenome scan  and that more than  Americans have done it  the future is now Although the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of  bars the use of genetic information for health insurance coverage decisions it does not do so when it comes to life insurance disability insurance or longterm care insurance A few US states have adopted some protections against such use by insurance companies but most have none Only Vermont outright bars its use by insurers And some insurance companies have already started asking For starters the authors of the commentary  Robert Klitzman Paul S Appelbaum and Wendy K Chung all of Columbia Universitys Medical Center  acknowledge that having ones genetic information scrutinized by an insurer opens an individual to being denied coverage  or offered coverage at inflated rates  for having acted in ones own best health Afterall aside from a few untreatable or unpreventable genetic diseases that could be turned up many of the genetic variants currently being found interact with other factors in the environment and with behaviors Knowing what those risks are an individual can take steps to lower her risk of developing whatever disease she carries an elevated risk for developing And clearly our society is not bettered if knowing  and acting on that knowledge  is discouraged The conundrum is that people who suspect they carry a genetic variant that could affect their life span or their ability to care for themselves are  at least now  the ones who are most likely to get genetic testing performed Those whose fears of premature death or disability are confirmed will disproportionately apply for health or disability insurance If insurers are kept in the dark about applicants genetic risks they respond to their increasingly sick pool of claimants by hiking their premiums to everybody Insurance for people of average risk or at least for people who dont know of any outsized genetic vulnerabilities they may have may be priced out of the market And thats not good either The commentators suggest there may be ways to thread this bioethical needle Give all people access to a certain level of insurance without any requirement to ante up genetic information to get layers of coverage beyond that minimum insurance companies may require genetic information Scholars physicians and policymakers need to consider these rapidly evolving issues or insurers will make decisions on their own the group wrote And life and disability insurance companies should align their reading of genetic risk with scientific findings and to make their assumptions transparent As scientists deepen their understanding of the power of specific genetic variants and of the interaction between genes and behavior insurance companies will need to underwrite accordingly Either that or insurers could be told as they are in Vermont that theyre not entitled to consumers genetic information whatever it says
