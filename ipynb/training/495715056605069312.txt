  As West African nations try to stop the deadly Ebola virus from spreading people living in the affected countries are nervous In Sierra Leone communities are keeping a close eye on the exact locations where the disease has emerged The posters are crudely drawn and graphic Theres one pasted to the wall of the squat concrete community centre in Kroo Bay a slum in the centre of the capital Freetown the kind of place where you can imagine disease spreading fast  The houses are built of breeze block and have battered rusting roofs The spaces between them are piled with garbage small children with no shoes tote yellow plastic jerry cans of water through the narrow lanes  A pig lolls in the mud while her offspring snuffle in the filth  Many Sierra Leoneans cant read so public information is often presented on large posters  People in Freetown are nervous They are desperate to keep the virus at bay to keep it out in the provinces They keep track of the numbers in the way they keep track of football scores  Ive been making radio programmes there and a couple of weeks ago we recorded one in Port Loko a province north of Freetown  Ah Port Loko said someone when I got back Four cases Id know from my colleagues immediately if they were talking about Ebola It was in the tone of voice the roll of the eyes the uneasy laughter  Then they would tell me that so and so had died and I would feel that rush of adrenaline triggered by sudden fear One of my colleagues spent the whole day last week wearing a pair of blue rubber gloves People are frightened for two reasons First and most importantly because theres no known vaccine no cure second because of the ghastly physical reality of the disease as portrayed in those lurid posters  Yet these are people inured to disease Consider for example their attitude to malaria which kills thousands in Sierra Leone every year  Not infrequently in the last few weeks Ive encountered people complaining of a headache or a night of intense sweating  They slide off to the hospital and reappear a day or two later with a bag full of drugs They laugh it off  Oh yeah there are so many mosquitoes at this time of year they say  But you sleep under a net right Well actually no they dont even though sleeping under a treated net is the single most effective way to avoid getting bitten by a mosquito and being infected with malaria  They see malaria as an occupational hazard but they see Ebola as a death sentence  I spent an instructive couple of hours at the weekend with a woman from Finland Eeva was once a midwife but shes just finished a fiveweek stint with a Red Cross team that has been going door to door in Kailahun province the border region where Ebola first arrived in Sierra Leone  She was on whats known as a sensitisation mission explaining to people exactly how the virus spreads and how to avoid it  There are three simple rules she told me Rule one If youve got a headache or a fever go to the health centre for a test You can recover from Ebola if the infection is spotted early enough  Rule two If someone dies dont touch the body Its highly infectious Dont wipe the mouth dont close the eyes  Rule three Dont eat bushmeat the meat of wild animals   The underlying message was this  Ebola is manageable Its deadly and frightening but if you follow the three rules and use a lot of soap and water you probably wont get sick And if you do even though the death rate is high there are survivors  I told Eeva she was a brave woman but she shrugged the compliment off  She said shed had the opportunity to take two different jobs  one in Sierra Leone the other in South Sudan where theres continuing fighting I told myself Im not going to South Sudan  Ive got a family she said   As I left Freetown on Sunday morning there was a last reminder of the Ebola spectre Outside the airport building was a table and a couple of buckets We all had to wash our hands in water that carried a strong whiff of chlorine My friend in the blue rubber gloves had jokingly asked me if I might have space for him in my suitcase  I sympathise with his powerlessness I had a plane ticket he can only sit and wait I hope the message that Ebola is both manageable and survivable gets through  Saturdays at    or   Short editions MondayFriday  see World Service
