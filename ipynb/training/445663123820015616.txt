A randomized trial of a common probiotic has shown that a daily dose substantially reduced episodes of   and respiratory tract infections among children at day care centers Researchers tested  healthy children ages  months to  years who were attending day care centers in Mexico City Half received a daily dose of Lactobacillus reuteri a beneficial gut bacterium naturally present in many foods and in most people the other half got an identical placebo The intervention lasted three months and the children were followed for another three months without supplements The study   and was supported by a grant from a manufacturer of probiotic supplements During the study there were  episodes of diarrhea in the placebo group and  in the supplement group The placebo group had  respiratory tract infections compared with  in those taking L reuteri And the placebo takers spent an average of  days on   while the supplement users averaged  days The differences persisted during the week followup Whats notable here is that they used a specific probiotic in a good design and they also did followup said Stephen S Morse an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study This strengthens the evidence for the value of probiotics but we still have a lot to learn
