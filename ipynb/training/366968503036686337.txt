When Chris Ategeka was  his younger brother died while Ategeka was helping to carry him to the nearest hospital   miles from their village in Fort Portal Uganda There was no quicker way to get his sick brother who was coughing and had a bloody stool to medical care I did not understand the concept of lack of mobility being the biggest factor until it got later in life I realized how that could have helped so much he tells Shots Ategeka and his five siblings became orphans after their mother and father died of AIDS But Ategeka now  considers himself lucky A US aid organization   helped AIDS orphans like him attend school Ategeka did well He impressed the California family that sponsored him so much that they invited him to come live with them in  Since then he has earned engineering degrees at University of California Berkeley where hell begin a doctorate in mechanical engineering this fall And hes been using what he learned already to solve the problem that contributed to the death of his brother nearly  years ago Ategeka founded   a nonprofit that teaches villagers how to build bike ambulances and wheelchairs from scrap metal I teach you how to make it and I teach you how to fix it he says If it breaks you know what to do and if you want to build something you think outside the box and you do it So far he estimates the group has helped support the fabrication at centralized workshops in local villages and distribution of more than  bikes and bike ambulances throughout Uganda Just  bike ambulances can transport about  people a month according to Ategeka One ambulance costs an equivalent of  to make The groups goal is to connect rural communities in Uganda with clinics in cities The nonprofit has caught the eyes of major funders like US Embassy in Uganda and the   I wanted to do something about the effects of lack of health care in rural villages so I combined my life experience and engineering Ategeka says The groups bikes are used for many purposes Of course theyre able to transport patients to hospitals But they also serve as delivery vehicles picking up HIV medications and basic medicines for local villagers When you talk about HIVAIDS or TB the issue is delivering medicine to patients who need to take it on a regular basis Dr Arthur L Reingold a professor at Berkeleys school of public health tells Shots The organization also provides bikes for kids to go to school A survey conducted by CA Bikes found school attendance and performance increased by about  percent after boys and girls got bikes When I got my bike life became much easier Ategeka says recalling his youth Hours of walking became minutes of riding Still the are some limitations In mountainous areas it can be extremely difficult to pedal great distances Reingold says A goal for CA Bikes is to create jobs and to be selfsustaining Funding for the project is constant challenge The demand for the bicycle ambulances is outstripping the supply Ategeka keeps at it He marvels at the villagers ability to make things work The human spirit is really really strong says Ategeka
