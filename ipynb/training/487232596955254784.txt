Many of us tend to align ourselves with either numbers or words Were either math brains or were reading brains In college my fellow English majors joked about how none of us could longdivide to save our lives while our friends in engineering groaned about the fact that Lit  was a graduation requirement But it turns out that about half the genes that influence a childs math ability also seem to influence reading ability according to a   published Tuesday in the journal   Youd think that cognitively whats going on with math and reading is very different says   a behavioral geneticist at Kings College London and one of the authors of the study Actually people who are good at reading you can bet are pretty good at math too The researchers looked at  pairs of yearold British twins who were part of the larger   Some pairs were very nearly genetically identical the other pairs were fraternal twins meaning they are the same age and shared a quite similar early environment but are no more genetically similar than other siblings The scientists assessed each childs math and reading skills based on standardized tests To gauge how genes influenced the students aptitude the researchers compared the test results of twin siblings as well as the results of unrelated children The researchers also analyzed the participants DNA in hopes of turning up a particular gene or set of genes shared by people with high math or reading ability  genes that were perhaps missing in people with low abilities Some earlier smaller studies had suggested such highly influential gene variants might exist But no particular gene or sets of genes emerged That may be because a lot  maybe thousands  of genes may be involved in helping to shape these abilities Plomin says What the study did find was that childrens reading ability and math ability seem to be related  and much of that relationship can be explained by genetics The research also showed that genes cant explain everything about our abilities Plomin says These genetic propensities are like little nudges he says Slight variations in your genes may nudge you to read more for pleasure And that can snowball Plomin says These kids who like reading may spend more time at the library or may ask their parents to buy them more books  and all of that practice reading will push their skills even further Other kids may find reading to be a bit harder due to genetics Plomin says Its not that the child just isnt motivated or that hes just not trying hard enough But with some extra encouragement and support these children can become good readers as well Environmental factors may also explain why among genetically identical twins one may prefer math while the other prefers reading Plomin says One twin may end up with a really good math teacher while the other doesnt Or one may fall ill and that may set her back Right now we dont have all the answers Plomin says I wish I knew what some of the genes are he says That would allow scientists to learn more about how we each learn best Whats going to be needed is very large samples of people to be able to isolate these genes says   an emeritus professor of psychology at Case Western Reserve University and editor of the journal   Detterman who wasnt involved in this study says scientists would likely have to look at the DNA of millions of people in order to start figuring out which genes affect our academic aptitudes Its a daunting task he says but I think itll happen faster than we expect As we learn more about the influence of genetics on learning well be able to more easily figure out which learning environment works best for each child Here teachers are a bit like farmers Detterman says And children are a bit like corn You have corn plants that do well in certain environments and dont in others And the farmers job is to get the corn plants into the right soil
