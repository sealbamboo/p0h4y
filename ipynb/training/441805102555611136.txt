Bones should be jarred for their own good Past experiments have definitively established that subjecting bones to abrupt stress prompts them to add mass or at least reduces their loss of mass as people age What has been in dispute however is how much force is needed to stimulate bone  and how to apply that force in daily life Recently   gathered male and female adolescents  the body accumulates bone mass rapidly at this time of life  and had them go about their daily routines while they wore activity monitors The bone density of the volunteers hips was also measured A week later the scientists reclaimed the monitors to check each teenagers exposure to G forces a measure of impact Those who experienced impacts of  Gs or greater  though these were infrequent  had notably sturdier hipbones Additional work done by the same researchers showed that running a minute mile or jumping up onto and down from a box at least  inches high was needed to produce forces that great The significance of these findings is that people should probably run pretty fast or jump high to generate forces great enough to help build bone Unfortunately few older adults are likely to be doing so In followup experiments the same researchers equipped  women older than  with activity monitors and ran them through an aerobics class several brief and increasingly brisk walks and a session of stepping onto and off a foothigh box None of the women reached the G threshold  none in fact generated more than  Gs of force at any point during the various exercises The implications are somewhat concerning Dr Jon Tobias a professor of rheumatology at the University of Bristol who led the experiments says that while impacts that produce fewer than  Gs of force may help adults maintain bone mass  a possibility that he and his colleagues are exploring in ongoing experiments  its unclear what level of force below  Gs is needed So Dr Tobias says young people and healthy adults should probably pound the ground at least sometimes Sprint Jump off a box  inches or higher at your gym and jump back up Hop in place   published in January found that women between  and  who hopped at least  times twice a day with  seconds between each hop significantly increased their hipbone density after four months Another group of subjects who hopped  times daily showed even greater gains Alas a kind of Catch confronts older individuals who have not been engaging in highimpact exercise Their bodies and bones may not be capable of handling the types of activity most likely to improve bone health Dr Tobias and his colleagues hope to better understand what level of impact will benefit these people In the meantime anyone uncertain about the state of his or her bones should consult a physician before undertaking highimpact exercise a caveat that also applies to those with a history of joint problems including arthritis For his part Dr Tobias says I plan to keep running until my joints wear out
