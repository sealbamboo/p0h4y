  Pfizer Inc. said a federal court has invalidated a patent that would have offered an additional 18 months of U.S. exclusivity—and monopoly sales—for its blockbuster painkiller Celebrex.. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Pfizer a "reissue patent" a year ago covering methods of treating osteoarthritis and other approved conditions with celecoxib, the active ingredient in Celebrex. These methods were claimed by a prior patent that was invalidated by a federal appeals court in 2008.
