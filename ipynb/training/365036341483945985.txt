In hindsight Greacian Goeke can see that there were warnings Her father Joseph had never fully recovered from surgery to repair a heart valve and feared he would soon need a wheelchair as his own father had He had developed cataracts and had to stop driving Along with his increasing physical disability he had a history of depression that included hospitalizations and electroconvulsive therapy For years he had struggled with alcohol abuse Yet Ms Goeke who was starting graduate school across the country in California in  was only vaguely conscious of those problems The culture in our home was not to talk about things in an upfront personal way she told me I didnt put it together So it came as an utter shock when her mother called from New Jersey to say that her father had killed himself using an old shotgun intended to keep groundhogs from destroying his garden Just  he had still been working parttime as an opinion research executive I cant imagine wanting to do that his daughter remembers shouting into the phone How could you hate life that much For most people psychological wellbeing increases later in life following a wellknown Ushaped curve people report less satisfaction in midlife and more at either end of the age spectrum Paradoxically though   Older white men like Joseph Goeke are particularly at risk Among Americans of all ages  per  take their own lives each year according to  statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But among those over  the official number is  and suicide may be underreported Because of the stigma coroners will go to great lengths to call it something else said Patrick Arbore founder and director of the   in San Francisco If its an overdose they can call it an accident Though suicides among older people have declined in recent decades most likely as a result of improved screening and treatment for depression they remain disturbingly high among men Suicides by women decline after age  but the rate among men keeps climbing Elderly white men have the highest rate  per  over all and more than  per  among those over age  Why are suicide rates so high among seniors We know that while older people make fewer suicide attempts than the young they are far more likely to die from them in part because they rely primarily on guns Younger people have more physical resilience and use less lethal means said Dr Yeates Conwell a psychiatrist at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has studied latelife suicide Moreover depression is behind a majority of suicide attempts and a lot of older people have problems asking for help Mr Arbore said Depression   and men are good at masking it because weve been conditioned to believe its not OK to express emotional pain Beyond mental illness researchers have identified a cluster of other   including physical illness and pain the inability to function in daily life fear of becoming a burden and social disconnection Things that remove older people from their social groups  bereavement retirement isolation  leave them vulnerable Dr Conwell said Knowing that some readers here have announced that they want to end their lives if or before they are suffering seeing that as an exercise of personal autonomy rather than mental illness I asked both experts if they thought suicide could ever be a rational act If life loses pleasure and meaning with or without a terminal disease can suicide be a legitimate response Both said cautiously that in certain situations after a great deal of discussion and consideration it could be  but thats rarely what occurs The proportion of older people who take their lives without a diagnosable mental illness is very very small Dr Conwell said Because elderly suicide is generally a result of multiple factors  physical illness and depression and a recent loss say  if you change one of those parameters it may tip the balance in favor of finding solutions that help you want to live At the Center for Elderly Suicide Prevention staff and volunteers handle  calls a month to the friendship line a name deemed more acceptable to seniors than suicide hotline They also place  outgoing calls to people considered isolated or otherwise at risk We believe connections are what bind us to life Mr Arbore said Just having the opportunity to talk might shift their view of the end temporarily It might not have to happen today Such opportunities to talk in ways tailored to older adults should be more widely available than they are One resource is the Veterans Affairs Departments   Instead the task of trying to recognize elderly depression and encourage treatment falls largely to primary care physicians and of course to family members who should always take suicidal talk seriously When a depressed and hopeless relative commits suicide the family must cope not only with grief but often with guilt and unanswered questions Ive gone through years of being angry  He chickened out he bailed  Ms Goeke said Im someone who needs information to feel better What did I miss What was really going on She joined the first eightweek support group for suicide survivors that Mr Arbores center established I understand it better now she said of her fathers death but it makes me both furious and agonized that he was in such despair It also makes her determined to go forward and really really live Now  and teaching music and movement in the Bay Area Ms Goeke takes particular pleasure in working with students in their s s and s They tell me theyre happier now she said Its exciting to be around older adults who are growing and healing
