 Patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA undergoing treatment with agents such as Enbrel etanercept Remicade infliximab or Humira adalimumab appear to have a significantly increased risk for developing   The incidence of shingles among patients on antitumor necrosis factor TNF treatment was  per  patientyears compared with an incidence of  per  patientyears among those receiving traditional diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs DMARDs according to Kimme L Hyrich MD of the University of Manchester in England and colleagues Because this was an observational study cause and effect could not be established with certainty the authors cautioned Still after adjustment for potential confounders such as age sex disease severity and duration and comorbidities the hazard ratio for shingles among RA patients on antiTNF therapy was  they reported in the February  Patients with RA are at elevated risk of many types of infection both because of their underlying disease and their immune modulating therapies But there has been little focus to date on infections of the skin and soft tissues the authors stated So Hyrich and colleagues analyzed data from the British Society for Rheumatologys biologics register which began enrolling patients in  and included  recipients of antiTNF therapy This analysis included only the original three antiTNF agents etanercept Enbrel infliximab Remicade and adalimumab Humira and infections occurring during the first  years of treatment A cohort of  patients treated with conventional DMARDs served as controls in comparisons of rates of serious soft tissue infections all cases of shingles and cases of severe shingles Serious infections were those necessitating hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics or that resulted in death Severe shingles were cases that were multidermatomal and those requiring hospitalization or parenteral antiviral treatment Patients receiving antiTNF therapy were younger than those taking DMARDs and had more joint involvement worse disability and longer disease duration A total of  serious skin and soft tissue infections were reported in the antiTNF group along with  in the DMARD group The majority of episodes were   and staphylococci were most often involved but four cases of necrotizing fasciitis occurred in the antiTNF group The median duration of hospitalization was  days for antiTNF patients and  days for DMARD patients However risks for these skin and soft tissue infections cannot be completely ruled out the researchers noted They also looked at risks for serious skin and soft tissue infections in association with the individual antiTNF agents and found a lower risk for adalimumab Among the  cases of shingles overall  were severe with  being in the antiTNF cohort These severe cases included five that were multidermatomal and six with ocular involvement in the antiTNF group while the sole severe case among patients receiving DMARDs was ocular The risk of both serious skin and soft tissue infections and shingles was higher during the early months of treatment During the first  months of treatment  skin and soft tissue infections occurred in the antiTNF group compared with three in the DMARD group The findings of this study should encourage clinicians to be vigilant for skin infections in patients starting antiTNF therapy the researchers observed The CDC has recommended the antishingles vaccine Zostavax for individuals over  but not for patients taking antiTNF therapy so physicians should consider administering the vaccine before initiating this treatment according to Hyrich and colleagues Limitations of the study included its observational design minimal information about corticosteroid exposure and the possibility of additional confounders While the observational design has important limitations the data presented here reflect realworld experience of antiTNF therapy in RA in the UK without patients having to fit the strict selection criteria often applied by randomized controlled trials the researchers concluded Source
