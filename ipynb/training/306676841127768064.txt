Most families know that their kids need to exercise In a   that NPR recently conducted with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health practically all of the parents surveyed said its important for their kids to exercise But about onethird of them said that can be difficult Take Yvonne Condes of Los Angeles It falls on her like many parents across the country to make sure her kids get enough exercise every day Federal health officials recommend at least one hour of daily exercise for children and teens But many public schools have reduced or completely cut physical education classes because of budget constraints On a typical day Condes picks up her two boys  Alec  and Henry   from school then begins her daily trek to sports practices Alec plays baseball and Henry plays basketball And because Condes lives in Los Angeles where traffic is a huge problem shuttling her kids back and forth can take five minutes or  Some days Condes spends  minutes just to go a mile Condes is a runner and recognizes the importance of daily exercise She and her boys walk to school two days a week but she knows thats not nearly enough physical activity As for just going outside to play in the neighborhood well thats not really an option she says Like many parents in our poll Condes says its just not safe My younger son just started to ride his bike a lot He doesnt have a huge area to ride in because we live between two major streets she says Its not just traffic that concerns Condes Theres a homeless guy lives down the street and sometimes hell start yelling he walks into the busy street yelling at cars she says She doesnt want him to scare her son or cause any other problems for him And thats why most days of the week Condes finds herself in the car driving her boys to club sports All the driving can be frustrating she says in large part because theres so much time where were not actually doing anything just traveling from one place to the other Condes is a freelance writer and cofounder of the blog   I work when the kids are at school Sometimes I can get work done when they come home but if were not home till  or  then Ill be up till  pm trying to catch up But she says its all for the kids Lots of parents across the country have similar hectic schedules with many spending more time in their cars to ensure their kids get enough exercise But some are trying a different approach Martina Fahrner of Portland Ore is coowner of   You wont find any Lycra in her shop the bikes there are designed for everyday living One of her favorites is a Bakfiets frontloader from the Netherlands It looks a bit like a wheelbarrow with a bicycle attached You can literally put eight bags of groceries in there and the kids and its just so much fun to ride she says Fahrner and her family bike walk or take public transportation everywhere For them exercise is something that happens as they live their daily lives not something they schedule Fahrner doesnt even own a car We basically mapped out where the schools are where hospitals are where places to shop are and so we very conscientiously picked a neighborhood where we can walk to all these things she says So when Fahrner is scheduling activities for her yearold son she looks at whats available in her neighborhood choosing sports at local parks and community centers She and her husband used to work hour weeks in the hightech industry in California but when their son was born they decided to simplify their lives and moved to Portland Its a choice you have to make and yes its hard obviously she says You need to look where your job is But if you cut down your commute from two hours to one hour you are much happier because you have more time for yourself  and your kids Janelle McAvoy and her family are making the same kind of choices She bikes to the grocery store with her yearold daughter Clover in a trailer and sons Jack  and Everett  on their bikes The McAvoys own two cars but rarely use them Janelle is a stayathome mom Her husband Mike works from home Like Fahrner they wanted to live in a neighborhood where they could get around by foot or bike The main street is probably a  to minute walk and theres grocery stores shopping boutiques wine shop movie theater restaurants book store  pretty much anything you could or would want on a daily basis she says Theres a bus stop at the bottom of the street and the elementary school is just a few blocks away The children ride their bikes back and forth and they dont schedule many afterschool activities that would require getting in the car And while she acknowledges that Portland is particularly pedestrian and bikerfriendly McAvoy believes its because of the choices people here are making If people drive more theres going to be the bigger parking lot and more space on the roads If people walk more and ride their bikes more there will be more bike racks because thats what the people want she says
