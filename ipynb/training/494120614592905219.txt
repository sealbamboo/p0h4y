They are seven girls in their teens and early s awake at the ungodly for them hour of  am With sleepy smiles the young women slip into a windowless conference room in a Washington DC hotel to talk to a reporter whos curious to find out Whats it like to be a global girl activist And theyre the experts Theyre supporters of the UN Foundation group called   which has the manifesto of uniting girls to change the world Girl Up fights for the rights of the  million adolescent girls of the developing world Many of these rights we take for granted   receiving proper health care living in safety and simply being counted at birth because for example if you dont have official proof of a childs age then how can governments fight against child labor These seven Girl Up activists run clubs in their schools They speak out in public forums and raise money for UN programs that help their cause Since Girl Up began in  the clubs have collected more than  Being involved in Girl Up is a serious commitment of time and energy But the girls want me to know that activism is also fun We get into super girly talk says Alexandra Leone who cofounded a Girl Up club at her Pennsylvania high school We show each other pictures of hot guys teases Gloria Samen of Potomac Md Then they get down to business spreading the word about girls issues Business brought them to the district in June They were lobbying on Capitol Hill Girls just dont get as much resources and opportunities as men do says Aklesiya Dejene who emigrated from Ethiopia to Chicago two years ago I want to represent them In the freewheeling conversation the young women shared their ideas about what the worlds girls need Carolina Lopez whos from Sao Paulo Brazil but goes to school in Pennsylvania wants them to have a chance to express themselves in sports Rocio Ortega a firstgeneration MexicanAmerican who lives in Los Angeles agrees Sports is where girls can find their voice and selfconfidence But boys can get in the way When Lopez was in fourth grade the boys she wanted to play soccer with went to her mom and said Can you please ask her to stop playing with us Shes bothering us Lopez is still indignant I wasnt like catching the ball with my hands or doing something I wasnt supposed to I was just there because I wanted to play I was humiliated Ortega visited girls in an Ethiopian refugee camp and they had similar concerns They told her We want our own space to play sports We want our own basketball court without having to worry about boys playing next to us Girl Up supports programs that provide sports venues for girls As the Americanborn daughter of Cameroonian immigrants Gloria Samen is keenly aware of obstacles girls face in her own culture I grew up watching generations of silent women women who were expected to stay home she says Even now her father thinks she should change the channel on the TV as part of her daughterly duties  even though the remote is by his side She wants girls to fight unfair expectations Samen raised  for Girl Up and is proud that the money makes a difference in the lives of girls in faraway places Were able to change the lives of girls we would never meet she says This womens network is an unbreakable bond I think its so cool Sometimes the goal is to give girls the power to speak out Girls in her country dont always want to stand up and say their name says Thandiwe Diego of Belize She stumbled upon Girl Up on the Internet and started a club with the help of her mom Theyre really shy And they cant always afford high school fees So Diego and her mother encourage reticent girls to apply for scholarships While in DC she got a joyful email from her mom telling her that some girls had applied Its a small but sweet success These seven activists know what its like to face opposition Jinwen Tung of China now a student at Barnard started a feministminded club in China Was it hard I ask Yes she declares Even my male classmates sometimes couldnt understand why women are so obsessed with fighting for equality To them its just not necessary But shes an optimist I think todays boys are more able to put themselves in the shoes of girls she says especially if the girls of Girl Up tell the boys about the problems that girls face As for my curiosity about what it means to be a girl activist I came away with the impression that it means living in two opposite worlds All the girls are keenly aware of what its like to have privileges and what its like to face hardships Gloria Samen sums it up with a story contrasting her life in the wealthy suburb of Potomac Md and her moms girlhood in Cameroon On her first day as a high school senior last September Samen wanted to drive to school My mother was like You cant take the car tomorrow because blah blah blah I was so annoyed I had just got my license She was like Gloria I walked four miles barefoot to get to school Id hold my shoes in my hand because I didnt want my shoes to get ruined in the mud because if your shoes are ruined your uniform is not complete You dont get to complain about not driving to school
