
 Many observational studies have suggested that vitamin D may have benefits for heart health Now a randomized trial has found that vitamin D appears to reduce levels of LDL or bad cholesterol Researchers randomly assigned  postmenopausal women to either a daily dose of  units of vitamin D and  milligrams of calcium or a placebo They followed them for three years By the end of the study   the vitamin D group had significantly higher serum levels of vitamin D and a small but notable drop in LDL The researchers controlled for initial vitamin D level smoking alcohol consumption and more than  other variables They acknowledge that their sample was relatively small and that no conclusions about the effect of vitamin D on cardiovascular health should be drawn from their findings Still they say their randomized doubleblind design and the use of blood tests for vitamin D levels give the study considerable strength We dont have enough here to say that weve figured it all out said the lead author Dr Peter F Schnatz a professor of internal medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia The change in LDL he said is significant and in the right direction but maybe not enough to say that were going to prevent people from getting heart disease
