A new flurry of drug deals shows how the global pharmaceutical industry is reversing course, as companies narrow their focus after decades of diversifying their drug portfolios.. Swiss drug giant Novartis AG and the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline PLC on Tuesday were the latest to illustrate that about-face, announcing more than $20 billion in deals. Novartis will sell its animal-drugs business to Eli Lilly & Co. and most of its vaccine business to Glaxo, and Novartis will buy a portfolio of cancer therapies from Glaxo.
