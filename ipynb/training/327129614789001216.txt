Haughty for heavy Linging for lying Lisa for visa  Area for stress I jotted down Dads word mashups on a scrap of paper I wanted to report faithfully his symptoms when we arrived at the emergency room  At  pm that winter night Mom called and said Come over now Your fathers having a stroke She knew for sure a speech pathologist for  years shed treated many stroke patients  He was confused I cant get the toaster oven to work His vision disobeyed Reaching for his glasses he came up with a handful of air But it was the aphasia the nonsense word substitution that was the real tell  Dad just wanted to stay home and sleep but Mom and I convinced him to go to the ER He and I bundled into my car and talked about what was happening to him as I drove to the hospital He laughed  Im catching up my words he said See I did it again I said catching up I meant mixing up  I was concerned but not really worried This was Dad and we were relating playfully as we always had through language and through talking about language Everything would be all right  Mom had noticed the symptoms right away And there was that drug that if administered within a certain window of time could protect him from the worst Dad was a university librarian He loved good books poetry magazines novels essays  the same things I love As I grew up he bought dictionaries of all kinds to feed his and my obsessions the rhyming one the French one the slang one the twovolume Oxford English with print so small the set came with a magnifying glass For my th birthday he bought me a Websters Third International Unabridged and wrote in it Cindy Darling A good dictionary is like a magical bank account The more you draw from it the richer you get  There were trips from the New Jersey suburbs to the Strand Book Store in the Village There was the family vacation when the running joke was we weeweed in the weeds after one of us stepped off a hiking trail to answer natures call There were the notes to my sister Susan and me that he signed TDO  The Disgusting One  because Susan had called him disgusting during an argument He created Ross Ball the game my thenyearold nephew could never lose He called my mother Swombo  She Who Must Be Obeyed When my twin sons were born prematurely their big eyes peering out from big heads that lolled on their tiny bodies he dubbed them the little aliens When they were  he taught them the phrase quid pro quo  Into my middleaged adulthood the extended family dinner table was a Socratic seminar We talked and challenged one other If we failed to make a cogent case hed call us on it My sister and I had grown up with this And now our sons four young men ages  to  joined in too He was exacting and demanded accountability but he was also decent and gentle adored and respected by the family at work and in the community Kill em with kindness was his credo  In the emergency room he tried his best to charm the charmless young resident who took his case The resident gave us the details on tPA  the medicine that can mitigate a stroke if taken in time The medicine with a  percent chance of causing a catastrophic brain hemorrhage The medicine with a  percent chance of killing you By then my sister had arrived I signed the consent papers and Dad who seemed better than when wed first arrived at the hospital sat blithely on the gurney blinking in the unforgiving fluorescence of the treatment cubicle trusting his daughters trusting the efficient medical staff In went the IV Moments later Susan noticed that Dads lip was bleeding Hed bit it because it was swelling  The ER team swarmed His throat was closing Less than an hour after being administered the tPA he was intubated in a coma and on his way to the ICU I didnt know it at the time but starting that night my deeply simpatico friendship with my father was done My confidant mentor nudge needler teacher audience sage cheerleader would never come back The tPA miracle drug for some was his poison It was supposed to help him Instead it destroyed him and I had signed the papers allowing this to happen This is my burden my betrayal There were so many tubes  to feed him hydrate him medicate him There was the BiPAP that helped his lungs to fill and empty There was the one down his throat because he reflexively kept trying to pull that one out they tied his arm to the bed  He looked like ET after his capture by the feds tented constrained monitored poked prodded dying I thought surely he will die We kneaded his hands and kissed his forehead We read to him and played music  William Blake and Bach his favorites His brother cheerful sturdy Uncle Joe flew in from Arizona Uncle Joe retold the apocryphal stories of their youth leaning in close hoping Dad could hear We all cried  And then Dad started to come back Bit by bit What started as a responsive squeeze of the hand or blink of the eye developed in the coming weeks to breathing and eating on his own using his hands moving his legs smiling and even speaking a few words We were beyond hopeful He would return maybe not to his old self but something close  As it became clear that Dad would not die my sister an experienced geriatric social worker took charge She got him into the best brain injury rehab hospital in the area and they went to work Soon he was talking sitting up watching TV even reading and walking a bit with assistance  When we conversed it was mindless chitchat  wouldnt he like more stew did he like the card Aunt Sally sent did he want to sing Bicycle Built for Two with the music therapist And then there were the family pictures Whos this And this And this It was like talking to a toddler Coaxing cajoling reinforcing Yes Thats right Great As his command of the language returned so it seemed did his awareness of his pitiable condition He became depressed and suicidal He cried saying I used to be a man And then he became paranoid and enraged He excoriated my sister and me 
How can you my loving daughters my seed side with the organization he roared Why are you with them Why wont you help me escape Who is in charge of the company My sister had seen it before in her professional life It was called sundowning when institutionalized people lose track of time and place and seemingly go mad often as evening closes in  He despaired and ranted with no relief It was almost impossible even for those who most loved him to spend time with him and for the first time I actually wanted this raging alien who possessed my fathers mind and body to die He landed back in the hospital with a urinary tract infection Most people dont know it but symptomfree UTIs in the elderly are easily missed and can have serious physical and psychological consequences Antibiotics and antipsychotics were ordered and psychiatrists brought in  clutches of them hovered over him with clipboards and clicking pens  One afternoon a young medical school student lingered when the others left Your father has hospitalinduced delirium he told us softly glancing toward the hallway almost as if he was doing something wrong It happened to my grandfather Get your dad home and it will pass quickly He was right Dad came home The alien left his body but with the alien went most of his language Now two and a half years later Dad lives at home with Mom and his roundtheclock health aides My amazing mother oversees Team Gil at a great cost to herself  physical emotional financial She incorporates therapy into every aspect of his day asking him questions making him do exercises with his arms and legs talking to him about the days news events He can do nothing for himself except eat and brush his teeth His body is heavy and stiff his torso a bag of concrete Dads library of books so lovingly and thoughtfully assembled and curated over decades sits largely neglected although one of us will borrow a book from time to time Mom cut back on delivery of the newspaper and canceled most of his magazine subscriptions He cant read any of it and has little focus and retention when read to  He likes to watch the news as he always did And now oddly he also likes to watch shows about animals This is new for him and I wonder if he feels a kinship with the animals which cannot speak and make themselves understood through gestures grunts howls barks and chirps  We are always on the edge wondering how long Mom can sustain the effort to keep him out of a nursing home where we fear he will die a horrible death enraged or stupefied on sedatives if the ranting alien returns But for now we know hes in there We can read him And thats enough  We know when he says no but means yes when hes tired when hes uncomfortable He still laughs fully when one of us repeats a goofy family story He responds to questions occasionally initiates conversation and once in a great while drops a real zinger For the most part he is cheerful and has good days Things that once haunted him  the Holocaust racism money  no longer do We can read him And as long as we can we want him home One recent evening I sat with Mom and Dad at the kitchen table Mom and I talked about Israel and the Palestinians and the chances of peace Mom turned to Dad and said Gil what do you think He looked her in the eye and swore his message clear Situation normal all fouled up  Yes Exactly
