A whole functional organ has been grown from scratch inside an animal for the first time say researchers in Scotland A group of cells developed into a thymus  a critical part of the immune system  when transplanted into mice  The findings   could pave the way to alternatives to organ transplantation  Experts said the research was promising but still years away from human therapies The thymus is found near the heart and produces a component of the immune system called Tcells which fight infection  Scientists at the Medical Research Council centre for regenerative medicine at the University of Edinburgh started with cells from a mouse embryo These cells were genetically reprogrammed and started to transform into a type of cell found in the thymus These were mixed with other supportrole cells and placed inside mice  Once inside the bunch of cells developed into a functional thymus  It is similar to a feat last year when   reached the same level of development as a nineweekold foetus The thymus is a much simpler organ and in these experiments became fully functional  Structurally it contained the two main regions  the cortex and medulla  and it also produced Tcells Prof Clare Blackburn part of the research team said it was tremendously exciting when the team realised what they had achieved She told the BBC This was a complete surprise to us that we were really being able to generate a fully functional and fully organised organ starting with reprogrammed cells in really a very straightforward way  This is a very exciting advance and its also very tantalising in terms of the wider field of regenerative medicine Patients who need a bone marrow transplant and children who are born without a functioning thymus could all benefit Ways of boosting the thymus could also help elderly people The organ shrinks with age and leads to a weaker immune system  However there are a number of obstacles to overcome before this research moves from animal studies to hospital therapies  The current technique uses embryos This means the developing thymus would not be a tissue match for the patient  Researchers also need to be sure that the transplant cells do not pose a cancer risk by growing uncontrollably  Prof Robin LovellBadge from the National Institute for Medical Research said This appears to be an excellent study This is an important achievement both for demonstrating how to make an organ albeit a relatively simple one and because of the critical role of the thymus in developing a proper functioning immune system   However the methods are unlikely to be easy to translate to human patients The field of regenerative medicine has developed rapidly  There are already patients with labgrown blood vessels windpipes and bladders These have been made by seeding a patients cells into a scaffold which is then implanted   The thymus just required an injection of cells  Dr Paolo de Coppi who pioneers regenerative therapies at Great Ormond Street Hospital said Research such as this demonstrates that organ engineering could in the future be a substitute for transplantation Engineering of relatively simple organs has already been adopted for a small number of patients and it is possible that within the next five years more complex organs will be engineered for patients using specialised cells derived from stem cells in a similar way as outlined in this paper It remains to be seen whether in the long term cells generated using direct reprogramming will be able to maintain their specialised form and avoid problems such as tumour formation
