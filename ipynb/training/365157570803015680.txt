They were born at  weeks  Charlotte weighed  pounds  ounces Paige said They were healthy Everything was normal The twins were  months old when the Figis lives changed forever  Charlotte had just had a bath and Matt was putting on her diaper She was laying on her back on the floor he said and her eyes just started flickering The seizure lasted about  minutes Her parents rushed her to the hospital They werent calling it epilepsy Paige said We just thought it was one random seizure They did a milliondollar workup  the MRI EEG spinal tap  they did the whole workup and found nothing And sent us home A week later Charlotte had another seizure This one was longer and it was only the beginning Over the next few months Charlotte  affectionately called Charlie  had frequent seizures lasting two to four hours and she was hospitalized repeatedly Doctors were stumped Her blood tests were normal Her scans were all normal  They said its probably going to go away Paige recalled It is unusual in that its so severe but its probably something shell grow out of  But she didnt grow out of it The seizures continued The hospital stays got longer One of the doctors treating Charlotte thought there were three possible diagnoses The worsecase scenario Dravet Syndrome also known as myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI Dravet Syndrome is a rare severe form of intractable epilepsy Intractable means the seizures are not controlled by medication The first seizures with Dravet Syndrome usually start before the age of  In the second year other seizures take hold myoclonus or involuntary muscle spasms and status epilepticus seizures that last more than  minutes or come in clusters one after the other At that time the Figis said Charlotte was still developing normally talking and walking the same day as her twin But the seizures continued to get worse The medications were also taking a toll She was on seven drugs  some of them heavyduty addictive ones such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines Theyd work for a while but the seizures always came back with a vengeance At  she really started to decline cognitively Paige said Whether it was the medicines or the seizures it was happening it was obvious  And she was slipping away When Charlotte was  the Figis decided to take her to Childrens Hospital Colorado A neurologist tested her for the SCNA gene mutation which is common in  of Dravet Syndrome cases After two months the test came back positive  I remember to this day it was a relief Paige said Even though it was the worstcase scenario I felt relief just to know Matt a Green Beret decided to leave the military   Every mission every training I was going to do I was called home because she was in the pediatric ICU again or in the hospital again They were quickly running out of options They considered a drug from France Doctors suggested an experimental antiseizure drug being used on dogs   Paige took her daughter to Chicago to see a Dravet specialist who put the child on a ketogenic diet frequently used to treat epilepsy thats high in fat and low in carbohydrates The special diet forces the body to make extra ketones natural chemicals that suppress seizures Its mainly recommended for epileptic patients who dont respond to treatment   The diet helped control Charlottes seizures but had a lot of side effects She suffered from bone loss Her immune system plummeted And new behavioral problems started popping up  At one point she was outside eating pine cones and stuff all kinds of different things Matt said As a parent you have to say lets take a step back and look at this Is this truly beneficial treatment because of these other things Two years into the diet the seizures came back   In November  Colorado voters approved Amendment  which required the state to set up a medical marijuana registry program   There are eight medical conditions for which patients can use cannabis  cancer glaucoma HIVAIDS muscle spasms seizures severe pain severe nausea and cachexia or dramatic weight loss and muscle atrophy The average patient in the program is  years old There are  patients under the age of   Paige had consistently voted against marijuana use That was before Dravet Syndrome entered their lives   Matt now a military contractor spending six months a year overseas used his spare time scouring the Internet looking for anything that would help his little girl   He found a video online of a California boy whose Dravet was being successfully treated with cannabis The strain was low in tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the compound in marijuana thats psychoactive It was also high in cannabidiol or CBD which has medicinal properties but no psychoactivity Scientists think the CBD quiets the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures It had worked in this boy his parents saw a major reduction in the boys seizures  By then Charlotte had lost the ability to walk talk and eat   She was having  grand mal seizures a week   Her heart had stopped a number of times When it happened at home Paige did cardiopulmonary resuscitation until an ambulance arrived When it happened in the hospital where theyd already signed a donotresuscitate order they said their goodbyes Doctors had even suggested putting Charlotte in a medically induced coma to give her small battered body a rest   She was  when the Figis learned there was nothing more the hospital could do  Thats when Paige decided to try medical marijuana But finding two doctors to sign off on a medical marijuana card for Charlotte was no easy feat She was the youngest patient in the state ever to apply    Scientists dont fully understand the longterm effects early marijuana use may have on children Studies that show negative effects such as diminished lung function or increased risk of a heart attack are primarily done on adult marijuana smokers But Charlotte wouldnt be smoking the stuff  Childhood is also a delicate time in brain development Preliminary research shows that early onset marijuana smokers are slower at tasks have lower IQs later in life have a higher risk of stroke and increased incidence of psychotic disorders leaving some scientists concerned     Everyone said no no no no no and I kept calling and calling Paige said  She finally reached Dr Margaret Gedde who agree to meet with the family  Charlottes been close to death so many times shes had so much brain damage from seizure activity and likely the pharmaceutical medication Gedde said When you put the potential risks of the cannabis in context like that its a very easy decision The second doctor to sign on was Alan Shackelford a Harvardtrained physician who had a number of medical marijuana patients in his care He wasnt familiar with Dravet and because of Charlottes age had serious reservations  But they had exhausted all of her treatment options Shackelford said There really werent any steps they could take beyond what they had done Everything had been tried  except cannabis Paige found a Denver dispensary that had a small amount of a type of marijuana called R said to be low in THC and high in CBD She paid about  for  ounces  all that was available  and had a friend extract the oil She had the oil tested at a lab and started Charlotte out on a small dose We were pioneering the whole thing we were guinea pigging Charlotte Paige said This is a federally illegal substance I was terrified to be honest with you But the results were stunning When she didnt have those three four seizures that first hour that was the first sign Paige recalled And I thought well Lets go another hour this has got to be a fluke  The seizures stopped for another hour And for the following seven days  Paige said she couldnt believe it Neither could Matt But their supply was running out  Paige soon heard about the Stanley brothers one of the states largest marijuana growers and dispensary owners These six brothers were crossbreeding a strain of marijuana also high in CBD and low in THC but they didnt know what to do with it No one wanted it they couldnt sell it Still even they had reservations when they heard about Charlottes age But once they met her they were on board  The biggest misconception about treating a child like little Charlotte is most people think that were getting her high most people think shes getting stoned Josh Stanley said stressing his plants low THC levels Charlotte is the most precious little girl in the world to me I will do anything for her The brothers started the   a nonprofit organization that provides cannabis to adults and children suffering from a host of diseases including epilepsy cancer multiple sclerosis and Parkinsons who cannot afford this treatment  People have called them the Robin Hoods of marijuana Josh Stanley said its their calling They use the money they make from medical marijuana patients and get donations from sponsors who believe in their cause They only ask patients such as the Figis to donate what they can   We give cannabis away for next to free Stanley said The state wont allow us to actually give it away so we give it away for pennies really Charlotte gets a dose of the cannabis oil twice a day in her food Gedde found three to four milligrams of oil per pound of the girls body weight stopped the seizures Today Charlotte  is thriving Her seizures only happen two to three times per month almost solely in her sleep Not only is she walking she can ride her bicycle She feeds herself and is talking more and more each day I literally see Charlottes brain making connections that havent been made in years Matt said My thought now is why were we the ones that had to go out and find this cure This natural cure  How come a doctor didnt know about this How come they didnt make me aware of this The marijuana strain Charlotte and now  other patients use to ease painful symptoms of diseases such as epilepsy and cancer has been named after the little girl who is getting her life back one day at a time  Its called Charlottes Web I didnt hear her laugh for six months Paige said I didnt hear her voice at all just her crying I cant imagine that I would be watching her making these gains that shes making doing the things that shes doing without the medical marijuana I dont take it for granted Every day is a blessing Matt added I want to scream it from the rooftops I want other people other parents to know that this is a viable option
