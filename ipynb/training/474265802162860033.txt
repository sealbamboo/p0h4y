Late last month the European Medicines Agency circulated a longawaited draft policy on disclosure of clinical trial data by drug makers Transparency has been a contentious topic following scandals over safety or effectiveness data that was not publicly shared Initially the EMA committed to ensuring data is accessible in ways that are easily analyzed and indicated data would not be considered confidential commercial information which drug makers cite as a key reason for limiting access Now though the EMA is being accused of backtracking The proposed policy which will be voted on June  would not allow anyone to do more than view clinical study reports which collect and summarize trial data on computer screens And some information including details of trial designs and study results can be redacted if a drug maker believes the information is commercially confidential
