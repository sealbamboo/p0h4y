How much are childhood vaccines worth to America Nearly  trillion according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That dollar figure represents the net savings of  years worth of vaccines administered to American children born between  and  over their entire lifetimes according to   in Fridays edition of the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report An estimated  billion worth of that savings comes in the form of direct costs averted and  trillion is the estimated value of savings to society Researchers decided to examine the costs and benefits of vaccinations of the federal   VFC program two decades after it was implemented in  The program helps make sure that kids dont miss recommended vaccines due to an inability to pay It was created after an outbreak of  cases of measles between  and  that was attributed to widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children according to the report When VFC began the program covered immunizations for nine diseases measles mumps rubella polio tetanus diphtheria pertussis also known as whooping cough Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and hepatitis B The program has since expanded to include vaccines for varicella chickenpox hepatitis A flu rotavirus and pneumococcal disease To quantify the benefits of the vaccination effort researchers from the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases compared vaccination rates in the  period as measured by the National Health Interview Survey or NHIS with data from  from the US Immunization Survey and from  from NHIS Over the entire lifetimes of the  million US babies born in the first two decades of VFC routine childhood vaccines will prevent an estimated  premature deaths  million hospitalizations and  million illnesses the researchers calculated That works out to an average of  fewer illnesses per child and  fewer hospitalizations per child The researchers did not include vaccines for hepatitis A seasonal flu or adolescent vaccines in their calculations More than half of the prevented illnesses were of three types  nearly  million fewer cases of measles  million fewer cases of chickenpox and  million fewer cases of whooping cough according to the report The vast majority of premature deaths averted    were deaths that would have been due to diphtheria a bacterial infection in the upper respiratory tract The direct expense of routine vaccinations during the year period amounted to  billion and the societal costs added  billion more the CDC researchers calculated But those figures paled in comparison to the estimated  billion in direct costs and  trillion in societal costs that have been and will be averted over the lifetime of these vaccinated children the report concluded Thanks to the VFC program children in our country are no longer at significant risk from diseases that once killed thousands each year Dr Tom Frieden the CDC director said in a statement But that doesnt mean American parents can afford to be complacent he added Current outbreaks of measles in the US serve as a reminder that these diseases are only a plane ride away Borders cant stop measles but vaccination can    and like   on Facebook
