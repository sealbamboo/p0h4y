hen you ask people why they choose to work in public services you most often hear about wanting to make a difference to others lives One respondent to a   spoke of feeling a need to cleanse my soul after several years in the financial sector Such comments go to the heart of the socalled public service ethos But with a rapidly shrinking public sector an unprecedented squeeze on rewards for public servants and a culture in awe of swashbuckling free enterprise  The Apprentice is after all one of our most popular television programmes  who would today choose a career in furtherance of the common good The answer hearteningly is that many of us would  and do Just look at how many of the best and brightest young people are clamouring for places on   and   the schemes to attract highflying graduates into schools and social work respectively There were   for every place in the first Frontline cohort this year and although TeachFirst was designed as a twoyear scheme with trainees then free to go on to other careers four in  remain in teaching after five years experience So the public service ethos is alive and well what has changed is the nature of public service Increasingly it is something delivered not by traditional public sector agencies but by organisations in the private and voluntary sectors and  as state funding diminishes  by communities themselves  show that the number of UK workers officially classified as public sector has fallen to  million the lowest total since the count began in  About one million have fallen out of the sector since  Fewer than one in five workers are now considered to be in the sector although the proportion ranges from  in the southeast to  in Northern Ireland The figures no longer include employees of the privatised Royal Mail which most people would still consider a public service but do include employees of RBS and Lloyds banks in which the state currently holds a controlling interest Like the post many public services now sit outside the public sector The biggest is surely   which employs an estimated  million people in England alone but is delivered almost entirely by private or voluntary organisations It would be difficult to argue that a care assistant working in a charityrun residential home is any less of a public servant than an NHS nurse or that a refuse collector was no longer a public servant because the service had been outsourced to a contractor Estimates suggest that public services work worth a total   over the past two years doubling the total value of contracts since  and this trend will only continue to grow with the prospect of four more years of austerity Yet wherever public servants hang their hats the job they do remains often uniquely challenging and breeds qualities that make them highly marketable Alexander Stevenson author of   reckons that managing in public services makes you skilled in the art of persuasion dealing with complex decisions and by no means least managing crises Under pressure public sector managers are likely to be good at prioritising making sensible decisions and communicating effectively he says Quoting Tory peer and publishing magnate Michael Heseltine he adds Public sector decisionmaking is infinitely more complex than private sector decisionmaking Thats all very well but do the rewards recognise such skill and responsibility Isnt it a fact that pay in public services lags well behind that in the private sector Its true that public sector pay has been held back since  and that   There has been crude pressure over the past two years to ensure that no public servant earns more than the prime ministers  salary But as the latest   IFS shows overall pay levels are broadly equivalent across the sectors and the defined benefit pension still available to most public sector workers remains a considerable plus Thats well worth thinking about
