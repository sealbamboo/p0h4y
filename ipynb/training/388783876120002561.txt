Alzheimers disease can be tough to diagnose especially early on Doctors can order brain scans and assay spinal fluids But existing tests are imperfect and some can be invasive So you might understand the appeal of an alternative that researchers at the University of Florida in Gainesville tried They had asked patients to sniff a dab of peanut butter during a routine test of cranial nerve function Later the team wondered if it could help them figure of it someone might be in the early stages of Alzheimers In the test a patient sniffs a little peanut butter one nostril at a time The clinicians then measure the distance at which patients can detect the smell After administering the test about  times   a graduate student at the University of Floridas   says that she and her supervisor neurologist   noticed that patients in the early stages of Alzheimers disease werent able to smell as well from their left nostril When we analyzed the data we were blown away Stamps tells Shots Impairment of the left nostril corresponded with a positive Alzheimers diagnosis every time It made sense to the Florida team because with Alzheimers the left part of the brain is usually affected first Smell unlike sight is ipsilateral The side of the body sensing the stimulus and the side of the brain processing the information are the same They published the results of a   in the   Heilmans clinic has now started using the test to verify Alzheimers diagnoses The team is also looking to do a big longterm study to confirm their findings to explore see if the sniff test could be used to actually diagnose Alzheimers Theres some promise there but also a lot of doubt The idea that smell is altered in Alzheimers disease dementia patients is well known and this is nothing new neurologist   from the Mayo Clinic tells Shots Knopman says this study is nothing more than an interesting observation The study itself acknowledges that the findings arent fully verified And the study sample of  patients only  of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimers is too small to be conclusive Even if the researchers do a bigger study Knopman is skeptical that the findings will prove useful People can lose their ability to smell as they get older for many reasons he says And theres another disease   that shares characteristics with both Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease Smell impairment is even more severe in DLS patients Knopman says It would get you into that ballpark of Alzheimers versus Lewy body disease but it wouldnt help you distinguish between those two he says Stamps remains cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the test Its helped us tremendously Stamps says Because if you see someone that doesnt have that asymmetry that you think might have Alzheimers its going to lead you to look more closely for other things But for now Stamps warns Dont try this at home Having slight differences between your left and right nostrils is normal and you might end up freaking out over nothing
