Which medications work best for older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Doctors arent entirely sure Despite the fact that COPD is the thirdleading cause of death there is scant research on the comparative effectiveness of treatment options in seniors But a study recently published in The Journal of the American Medical Association provides valuable new information COPD refers primarily to two conditions that compromise breathing emphysema and chronic bronchitis Nearly four million seniors have been diagnosed with the condition For their new study researchers in Ontario combed through records of all adults ages  and older with COPD who had started taking two types of medications  longacting beta agonists and inhaled corticosteroids     Longacting beta agonists  sold under brand names like Foradil Oxis Serevent help relax muscles around the airways in the lungs allowing air to flow more freely Inhaled corticosteroids Flovent Azmacort Asmanex and others act against inflammation and swelling in airways making breathing easier Clinical guidelines recommend that doctors begin treatment for COPD with longacting beta agonists or another set of medications called longacting anticholinergics not studied in this report then add other medications if necessary But it has never been clear if this is optimal for older adults The Canadian study is the first to focus on seniors in realworld settings who tend to have lots of complications unlike people included in goldstandard clinical trials which tend to exclude patients with multiple medical conditions  The researchers examined administrative health records for  older adults taking longacting beta agonists alone and  adults taking them with corticosteroids documenting how many in each group were hospitalized and died over a period of about two and a half years    They found that seniors taking both medications   compared with those taking longacting beta agonists alone a result they called modest but significant More striking were results for seniors with asthma as well as COPD who made up more than a quarter of the group studied   When they took the two medications instead of one their risk of hospitalization and death was  percent lower compared with people with both conditions who took only longacting beta agonists Previous studies of patients with COPD have tended to exclude people who also have asthma We havent really known how to treat these patients said Dr Andrea Gershon lead author of the study and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto    In an   Peter Calverley a professor of pulmonary and rehabilitation medicine at the University of Liverpool wrote There has been much interest in this asthmaCOPD overlap syndrome The study results suggest that these patients should be treated with both drugs he added   Dr Barry Make codirector of the COPD program at National Jewish Health in Denver speculated that older COPD patients with asthma might experience more inflammation than younger patients The new study confirms that patients with COPD tend to be very different from one another he said We really need to personalize our treatment for patients much better than we do now
