Doctors Without Borders has called the current outbreak of the   in Guinea unprecedented  not because of the number of victims so far at least  have died but because the disease has traveled to various parts of the country The   which includes the capital city of Conakry is at least unusual the World Health Organization agrees and presents more challenges than usual to the medical team seeking to contain the virus To learn more we spoke with Esther Sterk a tropical medicine adviser for   Shes been on the ground during past Ebola outbreaks in Africa and from her base in Geneva is helping coordinate efforts to quash this one Sterk believes the infection may have spread more than usual because its easy for people to travel from place to place in Guinea including from the southern part of the country where the first cases were reported to the capital The conversation has been edited for length and clarity We know from other outbreaks that epidemics can be stopped And the principle is always the same isolating suspected patients to prevent them from giving the disease to people around them Also you follow the people who have been in close contact with patients with Ebola So in the incubation period which is  days we follow them tracking their contacts and distributing information about prevention because Ebola is transmitted by close contact with infected people Its spread via body fluids like the blood and the urine and the saliva the stools  all body fluids are contagious What is also important is to inform the population about the disease This is the first time Ebola is detected in Guinea so the population and the medical staff dont know the disease They need to be told how the disease is spread and how you can protect yourself and what you need to do when you or somebody else has the symptoms meaning that you have to go to an area where you can be isolated We have no clue Researchers will definitely look into that Between human outbreaks the virus hides in certain animals And its thought that certain types of bats are possible reservoirs In the areas where Ebola has occurred the people eat bush meat  sometimes bats monkeys  that is a way the virus may be introduced into the population So the message in Guinea is Dont eat bats dont eat monkeys dont touch sick or dead animals People can infect themselves when they touch the fluids of an infected bat or a monkey while preparing the food and also via eating the meat You can get infected by contact with all body fluids so yes also by sexual intercourse But people get infected and straightaway they get very sick They start to have fever and body pain they start to vomit they have diarrhea So sexual intercourse is definitely not the main way of transmission Id say more people get sick via contact with diarrhea and vomiting for example a man gets sick and his wife starts to clean up his diarrhea and his vomit and she can get infected So its really caretakers of patients that get sick  or medical staff if they are not respecting the precautions for an Ebola case Ebola is not airborne so not contagious like for example the flu Now we know more or less which families are infected so we are following them The expectation is that if the people in the community are better informed about the disease we can detect all possible cases of Ebola and   them We will manage to contain this outbreak in a short amount of time but its difficult to say at the moment
