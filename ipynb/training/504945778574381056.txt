Every Wednesday evening the women sit in a circle of folding chairs in a bungalow at St Cecilia Catholic Church in South LA Theres always a box of tissues in the center it rarely goes unused They come to talk about food They talk about how to make brown rice or cut back on salt They talk about neighborhoods filled with fried chicken barbecue pizza and burger places And they talk about how hard it has been working the overnight shift at Target to dig yourself and six boys out of homelessness Or how to react when two boys get robbed of their phones at gunpoint The fear that youll strike your teenager who seems to be spinning out of control And what it feels like when your kids say their classmates are calling their mother fat They cry with a woman who fears she has cancer and when she learns she does not They cry over parents who are dead over marriages in trouble The women are in the pilot group of a program called Groceryships and they were improbably brought together by a yearold former hedgefund hotshot who once griped that his million bonus was meager Over the course of six months they found common ground Rich and poor had plenty to learn about eating out of emotion not hunger and how to reach for health amid an unhealthful environment Over those six months the women become friends in a room they came to call their safe space You can be you in there says Juana Madera  Its your family Even better than your family sometimes because you can express yourself and they wont tell you youre wrong They just listen to you  Things did not begin well for Groceryships Founder Sam Polk had become a media star with a New York Times essay on his addiction to money his decision to leave Wall Street and his new path For a year he gathered colleagues and experts to plan Groceryships convinced funders of the value of his ideas He had a website and curriculum and finally working with LAs Promise a nonprofit working to improve several South LA schools he had eight families in the pilot group The program provides each participant family  a week on a Food  Less gift card for six months Each family also receives a highend blender for juicing The group watches films gets handouts about nutrition and learns to cook several dozen healthful dishes But at that first meeting the women found it hard to connect to an Ivy League alumnus whose salary easily topped all of theirs combined who used to spend his evenings in the countrys best restaurants To counter that he was humble and open with them about a past that included drinking and drugs He talked about how he and a sibling were teased at school as the Pork Brothers and about a new parents fears of being bad at such a crucial job Still the women spoke just a word or two And he let them go early because he couldnt fill two hours Helen Langley easily the most loquacious member of the group says sure she judged Who are these white people coming to SouthCentral What do they want if theyre not the police or a social worker We had to feel them out It was Langley however who also helped change the tenor in the room when on the third night she told the circle that it was the first time in  years that someone had asked her how she was doing I took a breath and opened up she says I dont have a safe place  We made this a safe place  Langley wasnt much interested when she heard about Groceryships It didnt really appeal to me  I was tired of doing change the yearold says She had just cared for her mother until her death from cancer which came not long after her fathers death But the kids  shes raising six nieces and nephews because their parents she says are troubled  kept harping on me to do it So she filled out the form and at her interview she became intrigued I got these kids and I got to live long she says Langley and the children live in her childhood home a big yellow house filled with family photographs and cozy pillows She was the seventh of  kids her parents were loving but distant When she took to hugging them she says they were like ironing boards She worked for  years for the school board and recently has become a poet and a painter She has dieted plenty She lost more than  pounds with Weight Watchers and that lasted like two damn weeks she says Her familys food she says was unhealthful but they didnt realize it Big pots of rice and beans Fried chicken But her family took enthusiastically to a recipe for a breakfast bowl of brown rice cinnamon nuts and fruit They eat it all day Langley says One Sunday she brought it to her minister brothers congregation replacing the usual bacon and eggs The dish was a hit Langley says she has started to think about what makes her happy This class has helped me put my fears up front and look at them she says She has started to date and now when she feels overwhelmed she goes for a drive and sometimes walks along the beach Her family likes the change they see Its all about me and they know it now she says Im doing a lot to make us happy make me laugh  The women sometimes bring husbands or children but it is clearly their world in that room Each week the first hour focuses on cooking food labels marketing shopping strategies The second hour turns to the intangibles of emotional eating feeding children food addiction But life bubbles over into both hours Eara Pollard  describes walking the aisles of Smart  Final putting cookies or chips in her cart and later taking them back out I kept putting stuff in and taking stuff out I felt like everyone was watching me A few months in Pollard offers this assessment I might not be where I want to be but I looked in the cabinets and we dont eat like we used to No one is considered an expert though Polk and Angela Carrasco Groceryships program director teach One night Polk surprises the room with the idea that crackers often are highfat He says that some foods have a combination of fat salt and sweet that trigger unhealthful eating Its not that they are bad its just that you are powerless against it Like cocaine he says Cinnamon Toast Crunch Thats cocaine Langley chimes in Eventually the women join Polk in his dreams for Groceryships What about a building with room for a garden What about showing a documentary like Fed Up to the community Free weekly yoga classes start despite some digs that yoga is something white people do About half the women quickly are infatuated The program is a bit of Food Inc meets Native American healing circles  a marriage of practical and spiritual inspired by Father Greg Boyle and his Homeboy Industries antigang programs Polk acknowledges that six months is short In a culture thats saying eat this eat this  Its a journey that takes years decades But these first steps have been heard The second group  families has been chosen and a group also is to start through Homeboy Industries Polk is at work to find a way to incorporate farmers market foods rather than just grocery store cards Theres discussion of a group in New York City soon Most people dont have a place to talk about their struggles It was important to have a place to talk with no fear of response or retort Polk says The last thing I want is advice  When this pilot group  the OGs as they call themselves  came to the end of its six months one of eight had dropped out The others promised to keep going to the meetings and be mentors to new groups and to stay in touch as if they were leaving junior high Graduation was held at Manual Arts High School in a room decorated with flowers streamers and framed portraits of each of them Instead of the leggings and Tshirts they wore to meetings they put on makeup and dresses curled their hair and did their nails About  friends and family came Rep Karen Bass DLos Angeles spoke and brought each of them certificates from Congress marking their achievements Groceryships said Yohana Funes  changed her life They have made me feel physically mentally and emotionally beautiful she said this night wearing her long hair down and a lovely bodyhugging black dress Before my children were my circle of life Now I realize its all of us together Before Groceryships food cost  a week for her family of five Funes now buys less processed food no red meat little juice She substitutes avocado for mayonnaise Her bills have dropped We used to have to take stuff out of the cart because we didnt have enough money Now we have extra At the ceremony each woman spoke with lots of tears  and no communal tissue box in sight
