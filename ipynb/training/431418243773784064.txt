A campaign to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer has been criticised for suggesting patients wish they had other forms of the disease The envy campaign by Pancreatic Cancer Action shows patients saying they would rather have breast cervical or testicular cancer The charity said it was making the point other cancers have much better survival rates But breast cancer charities condemned pitting one cancer against another About  people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year though many are diagnosed too late for surgery  the only treatment option Symptoms can be vague Early signs can include It has a fiveyear survival rate of  compared with  for breast cancer  for testicular cancer and  for cervical cancer The average life expectancy for pancreatic cancer patients is four to six months   Ali Stunt the founder of Pancreatic Cancer Action who has survived pancreatic cancer herself said We are sorry if this campaign upsets anyone and our heart goes out to anyone affected by cancer   All types of cancer are horrific and the last thing I would wish on anyone But she added Our advert is not stating that someone wished they had cancer but rather they wish they could swap pancreatic cancer with a cancer that gives them a better chance of survival   We purposely selected cancers for our campaign that have a significantly better survival rate than pancreatic cancer  Macmillan Cancer Support backed the campaign Prof Jane Maher its joint chief medical officer said Survival rates are particularly poor for pancreatic cancer in part because its signs and symptoms are very hard to spot  We must ensure more people are diagnosed at an early stage to give them the best possible chance of recovery But Chris Askew chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer said We strongly dispute any message which suggests that one type of cancer is preferable to another  We believe Pancreatic Cancer Actions recent campaign does just this  Ive yet to meet a man or woman with breast cancer who would consider themselves in any way fortunate to have received a diagnosis We all need to do more to raise awareness of signs and symptoms of many cancers and the importance of early diagnosis And Samia al Qadhi chief executive at Breast Cancer Care said It is unhelpful to pit one cancer against another  Most of us know someone who has been affected by this dreadful lifethreatening disease and know the impact it can have on those affected and their loved ones  Unless you have experienced it yourself its impossible to fully understand the huge challenge faced by women who every day wake up to the brutal reality of breast cancer
