 Fans of   were surprised last month when star Tamra Barney announced that she wanted to have her breast implants removed After all the women on Bravos   series are known for having work   not   But as is often the case with reality TV there was more to the story than the camera caught on film Barney  had claimed that the implants felt too big for her petite frame but as she reveals on an upcoming segment of   her decision wasnt motivated just by vanity I had a little health scare   in a clip from the episode which airs Thursday I had lumps in my breast and I had   that had to be removed Cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer among women affecting more than  individuals a year About twothirds of these cases are caused by   a common sexually transmitted infection but birth control use family history and certain other habits and health conditions may also increase risk Barney  was understandably panicked after being diagnosed  so much so that even after doctors removed the cancer she was afraid to speak publicly about it for fear that doing so might jinx her recovery CANCER is a scary word and for the past year I felt like if I talked about It I would give it life and it would come back she wrote in a post on   earlier this week adding that Dr Oz encouraged her to open up as a way to help others Now I am going in for my second  month check upfingers crossed Judging by her healthy appearance and good spirits on   Barney is over the worst of the ordeal  but it hasnt exactly been easy Going through the experience she says took her from reality TV to well reality I really went through this like What is going on with my body What is going on Im talking to my doctor about  doing a   she tells Dr Oz and I have lumps in my breast and Im thinking Oh my god I needed to take over my body Removing her implants she explains was a way to do that It was also a way to protect herself in the event of a future health scare such as   The lumps Barney had found turned out to be nothing thankfully  but they made her think about her body and her future Feeling lumps in your breast that need to be biopsied is scary and made me wonder if my implants could make it harder to detect breast cancerand why take the chance she wrote on Facebook I love the way I look without my implants and do NOT miss them at all
