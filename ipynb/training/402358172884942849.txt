Could the microbes that inhabit our guts help explain that old idea of gut feelings Theres growing evidence that gut bacteria really might influence our minds Im always by profession a skeptic says   a professor of medicine and psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles But I do believe that our gut microbes affect what goes on in our brains Mayer thinks the bacteria in our digestive systems may help mold brain structure as were growing up and possibly influence our moods behavior and feelings when were adults It opens up a completely new way of looking at brain function and health and disease he says So Mayer is working on just that doing MRI scans to look at the brains of thousands of volunteers and then comparing brain structure to the types of bacteria in their guts He thinks he already has the first clues of a connection from an analysis of about  volunteers Mayer found that the connections between brain regions differed depending on which species of bacteria dominated a persons gut That suggests that the specific mix of microbes in our guts might help determine what kinds of brains we have  how our brain circuits develop and how theyre wired Of course this doesnt mean that the microbes are causing changes in brain structure or in behavior But other researchers have been trying to figure out a possible connection by looking at gut microbes in mice There theyve found changes in both brain chemistry and behavior One experiment involved replacing the gut bacteria of anxious mice with bacteria from fearless mice The mice became less anxious more gregarious says   of McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario who led a team that conducted the   It worked the other way around too  bold mice became timid when they got the microbes of anxious ones And aggressive mice calmed down when the scientists altered their microbes by changing their diet feeding them probiotics or dosing them with antibiotics To find out what might be causing the behavior changes Collins and his colleagues then measured brain chemistry in mice They found changes in a part of the brain involved in emotion and mood including increases in a chemical called   which plays a role in learning and memory Scientists also have been working on a really obvious question  how the gut microbes could   A big nerve known as the vagus nerve which runs all the way from the brain to the abdomen was a prime suspect And when researchers in Ireland cut the vagus nerve in mice they no longer saw the   to changes in the gut The vagus nerve is the highway of communication between whats going on in the gut and whats going on in the brain says   of the University College Cork in Ireland who has collaborated with Collins Gut microbes may also communicate with the brain in other ways scientists say by modulating the immune system or by producing their own versions of neurotransmitters Im actually seeing new neurochemicals that have not been described before being produced by certain bacteria says   of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Abilene who studies how microbes affect the endocrine system These bacteria are in effect mindaltering microorganisms This research raises the possibility that scientists could someday create drugs that mimic the signals being sent from the gut to the brain or just give people the good bacteria  probiotics  to prevent or treat problems involving the brain One group of scientists has tested mice that have behaviors similar to some of the symptoms of autism in humans The idea is that the probiotics might correct problems the animals have with their gastrointestinal systems  problems that many autistic children also have In the mice many of their autism behaviors were no longer present or strongly ameliorated with probiotics says   at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena Calif His research will be   soon in the journal   Experiments to test whether changing gut microbes in humans could affect the brain are only just beginning One team of researchers in Baltimore is testing a probiotic to see if it can help prevent relapses of mania among patients suffering from bipolar disorder The idea is that these probiotic treatments may alter what we call the microbiome and then may contribute to an improvement of psychiatric symptoms says   director of psychology at the Sheppard Pratt Health System It makes perfect sense to me says Leah a study participant who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder She agreed to talk with NPR if we agreed not to use her full name Your brain is just another organ Its definitely affected by what goes on in the rest of your body Its far too soon to know whether the probiotic has any effect but Leah suspects it might Im doing really well she says Im about to graduate college and Im doing everything right Mayer also has been studying the effects of probiotics on the brain in humans Along with his colleague Kirsten Tillisch Mayer gave healthy women yogurt containing a probiotic and then scanned their brains He found subtle signs that the brain circuits involved in anxiety were less reactive according to a   published in the journal   But Mayer and others stress that a lot more work will be needed to know whether that probiotic  or any others  really could help people feel less anxious or help solve other problems involving the brain He says Were really in the early stages
