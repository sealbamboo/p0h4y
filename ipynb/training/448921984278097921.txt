Were just five days away from the March  deadline to sign up for individual health insurance under the Affordable Care Act For weeks administration officials including the president have insisted that there would be no extensions to the scheduled end of the sixmonth open enrollment period But now theres some wiggle room Lets review shall we Yes Next Monday March  is the last day for most individuals to sign up for health insurance for  through the health exchanges or outside of them But there have always been a bunch of exceptions If youre eligible for Medicaid or the childrens health insurance program you can sign up anytime And if you experience a life change  moving getting married or divorced or getting or losing a job then you can sign up at times other than during the open enrollment period They created two more classes of people who can sign up after March  One group is   as of next Monday but havent finished the process Theyve started but for some reason havent completed signup There are a bunch of steps where you can get hung up Exactly And its worth noting that this is also what the administration did back in December when people were scrambling to sign up for coverage that would begin Jan  They didnt extend the deadline itself but they did let people who had begun the process finish it over several days That group includes   They include people who tried and in some cases thought they successfully signed up but something didnt work Their information might not have gotten through to the insurance company or they might have incorrectly been told they were eligible for Medicaid or they were given incorrect information about the plan when they chose it Those people will also get to sign up late or in some cases reenroll in a different plan No most of the deadlines associated with the law have been kind of shall we say fluid Republicans argue that the administration is playing fast and loose  and with limited legal authority  to bend the law to make it work to their maximum advantage But the George W Bush administration also   at the end of the first signup period for the Medicare prescription drug law So this isnt the first time weve seen this sort of thing And its clear the Obama administration thinks it will be better to be criticized for playing with the deadline than for preventing people who are trying to sign up for health insurance from getting it Its still next Monday If you dont have insurance and you can afford it you need to at least start the process by then Then youll be able to get some extra time to finish
