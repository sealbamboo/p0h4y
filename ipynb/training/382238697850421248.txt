In the woods outside Huntsville Texas scientists are trying to determine whether they can use the microbes that live on the human body as microscopic witnesses that could help catch criminals Its a strange scene at the   At first its easy to miss the human bodies scattered among the tall pines wild grass and weeds We hope microbes can tell crime scene investigators how long a person has been dead   of Sam Houston State University explains as she leads a group of researchers and visitors from NPR through a tall chainlink fence surrounding the facility and down a dusty path to her research plot The facility is one of the few places where in the interest of developing new tools for forensic science researchers can leave human bodies out in the open to study what happens as the remains decompose Bucheli is an entomologist who has spent years studying the ways insects on a body can help pinpoint how long a murder victim has been dead Knowing how long it takes a particular species of fly to complete its life cycle from egg to larva to pupa to winged insect for example can help an investigator figure out how long a corpse has been exposed to the insects establishing a minimum time since death That got Bucheli thinking If insects change through time then so do bacteria she says And if insects can be used so can the bacteria Its possible she says that   could improve the accuracy of these timeofdeath estimates The microbes might also be useful when insects arent present she says helping to determine how long a person has been dead when insects arent available to do that Such research is just in the beginning stages but already a scientific team at the University of Colorado has been able to use bacteria alone to narrow down how long a mouse has been dead to within three days Were really pushing the envelope of microbial forensic science says microbial ecologist  f a member of that Colorado team She and her boss microbiome researcher   have come to the forensics facility in southeastern Texas to collaborate with Bucheli hoping to do with human bodies   One of the first tasks the day we visit is placing three fresh bodies in the woods A small tractor pulls up carrying the first body inside a blue plastic body bag Three men lift the body off the tractor and place it on the ground They unzip the bag and carefully unwrap the white sheet that swaddles the cadaver We want to do this as respectfully as possible Bucheli says Its a difficult moment Corpses that have been in the field a little longer look like mummies barely recognizable as human The new remains are from people who have only recently died and donated their bodies for scientific research Bucheli is clearly moved She pauses briefly for what she calls her thankyou moment Im deeply appreciative of the people who make my research possible  all of them she says The scientists mark each bodys position with a metal post and then begin several hours of intense work meticulously gathering dozens of samples of bacteria They carefully scrape the skin in the same spots on each body and methodically scoop up dirt from precise locations near the remains Their plan is to come back day after day month after month to sample these exact spots to figure out if over time the communities of bacteria in these various spots change in predictable ways as time passes and the remains decompose Were looking for a microbial clock Metcalf says A clock like that could be used as a reference tool in forensic investigations Microbes might one day help police in other ways too the scientists say The population of bacteria on a person who died of natural causes for example might look different than the bacteria on someone who was beaten to death And because different varieties of microbes are found in different places the bacterial census of a corpse might show whether a body has been killed in one place and then dumped in another Microbes might also help police who are searching for unmarked graves If you suspected that theres a body buried in a certain field can you just swab little bits of soil and say Oh this particular area has microbial organisms that we usually find associated with a decomposing corpse  Metcalf asks Thats the sort of question she and Bucheli hope their work will help answer And thats not all Knight says he thinks microbes could one day provide for each of us a kind of microbial fingerprint that could help police solve all sorts of crimes while were alive as well as after were dead Back on campus Knight demonstrates how it works He pops open a small plastic vial grabs a cotton swab and pulls out his laptop to test the keyboard You dip the Qtip in the saline solution and you rub it thoroughly on the individual key he explains The swab quickly turns a greasy brown So whats on there is a combination of finger grease dust and bacteria  maybe as many as a billion Knight says Definitely enough to track it back to an individual Knight has been able to use an analysis of these communities of bacteria to match people to objects theyve touched So microbes might be able to do things like link a suspect to a murder weapon or the scene of the crime he says There are a lot of cases where its clear that the suspect touched something but you dont have a print you can use off it Knight says He even thinks that analyzing the different communities of microbes on peoples bodies might eventually prove to be a useful tool for tracking an individuals movements  to see if the person had recently returned from Afghanistan or been in Boston for example All of this Bucheli hopes will one day help answer the most important question for the families of victims Who is responsible Im somebodys mom Bucheli says Im somebodys sister You always think about Who Who did this Now no one yet knows how much of this research will prove useful in forensics Most practical applications are likely years away But its already clear that some of these techniques will likely raise lots of questions  about privacy civil liberties and how much we want our microbes to reveal about ourselves
