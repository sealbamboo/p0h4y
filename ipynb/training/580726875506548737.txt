Ive heard from many people motivated to become vegan by animal welfare issues Health and the environment are other reasons to discuss but this week about halfway through my month chronicling my vegan ways Im going to turn to some practicalities Just how hard is it to become a vegan If youre new to it where do you start Ive gotten some advice from readers and Ive reached out to a few people My friend and neighbor Sarah Newman tried being a vegan many years ago while training for a triathlon It didnt stick then but now she is a healthy vegan and offered me some tips She says cooking vegan motivates her creativity An example Truffles made with ground Medjool dates nut butter cacao powder and nibs salt and cinnamon Mix ingredients roll into balls and refrigerate Yes the good news is that chocolate can be vegan Just read the label Another way to start to change if youre not ready for fullon veganism is the Meatless Monday idea Its a campaign thats been going for years and has grown to include institutions such as the San Diego and Los Angeles unified school districts The campaign recalls those from the World Wars when patriotic Americans were asked to cut back on meat by  which is roughly one day a week Another path is to find a website or an online community for support and ideas said Diana Rice a dietitian and spokeswoman for the Monday Campaigns Meatlessmondaycom has vegetarian and vegan recipes including some that children can cook she said Jennie Cook a Los Angeles caterer told me about a couple of blogs that have vegan recipes including some of hers Ohsheglowscom and maplespicecom For a family try meals that are a bit doityourself such as tacos or burgers  perhaps some vegan some not  or two stir fries one with chicken one with tofu As you get comfortable find new ingredients Reach out try new things said Kristy Turner whose new book speaks to anyone who might be uncertain of the terrain But I Could Never Go Vegan has  recipes with ingredients such as jackfruit  which can be found canned in supermarkets and has a bland taste on its own and can be used instead of shredded meat  or cheese made from nuts The way I see it cheese is a thing in its own right Its not necessarily connected to dairy You can make cheese from nut milk just the way that you make it from dairy milk Its just cultured its the same sort of thing Turner a former restaurant fromagier said in an interview on Wednesday Other examples bacon made from tempeh or black beans tacos with mushrooms rather than meat Some tips from Turner who has been vegan for   years Try to make a vegan version of a familiar dish And dont beat yourself up if you slip and eat cheese Its not about perfection Its about compassion for yourself and the planet and for animals Trying to be the best you can be You dont have to be perfect she said People who are going vegan for good or even for a few weeks should make sure theyre getting their nutritional needs met for such things as iron and vitamin B which Americans typically get from animal foods Rice said If you dont feel well you are less likely to maintain the diet she said She also suggested not relying too much on processed foods even vegan ones Vegan bars are fine in moderation but dont make it the basis of your diet she said When going to friends homes offer to bring a dish Turner said I never expect anything of anyone I dont expect people to cater to me When they do its such a blessing Rice suggests bringing a naturally vegan dish like a salad rather than a vegan meatloaf People might be less inclined to turn up their noses I had dinner on Monday night with friends worried that the host my friend Judy Rudzki would be insulted if I didnt eat what she cooked but I was reluctant to ask her to make anything with me particularly in mind The culinary gods were in my corner however There was hummus and a vegan lentil and squash soup that was fabulous I did as well over the weekend when we went to Sacramento for a family bar mitzvah and the buffet table included a green salad and a lovely casserole of quinoa greens and chickpeas
