Theres a major flaw in many medical research studies that seems so basic that youd think scientists would be smart enough to avoid it It turns out that cells studied in the laboratory often get mixed up A researcher who thinks she is studying breast cancer cells might in fact be using melanoma cells Its a surprisingly common problem  even in some of the top scientific labs Consider the story of Robert Clarkes   at Georgetown University in Washington DC Students and technicians mill about carrying plastic flasks with pinkishorange fluid sloshing gently inside That fluid contains living cells  in some cases lineages of human breast cancer cells that were first isolated almost  years ago These cell lines are a critical component of research They allow scientists to experiment with cancer without actually running experiments on people Some things we can do in cell lines that would be technically or ethically impossible in animals and humans says Clarke who is codirector of the lab and research dean at Georgetown For example if Clarke wants to find out how toxic a potential new drug might be hes not going to put it first into a person or even a mouse We do those experiments first in cell lines and we dont put any person or animal at risk Scientists have been running this kind of experiment for many decades Unfortunately theyve also been mixing up their cells for many decades too Its easy to do A scientist technician or student can accidentally transfer a cell from one flask to another If the contaminant is a fastgrowing cell it will simply take over like weeds crowding out flowers in a backyard garden These days scientists can run simple DNA tests to detect and avoid these cases of mistaken identity We do it routinely because weve made the mistake ourselves in the past Clarke readily acknowledges Some years ago they isolated a cancer cell from a patient and transformed it so it would keep growing indefinitely They published that discovery and offered this new resource to other scientists Unfortunately it turned out that their new cell line had been contaminated with cells from an existing line So then we published a paper saying Oops Sorry guys  Clarke says He told everyone who had asked for a sample of his cells to throw them away That notice presumably nipped that particular problem in the bud There are  crosscontaminated or misidentified cell lines   and some have persisted for many years One of the worst cases involves a breast cancer cell line called MDA or MDAMB After the cell line was identified in  breast cancer scientists eagerly adopted it When injected in animals the cells spread the way breast cancer metastasizes in women and thats not a very common feature of most breast cancer cell lines says   a cancer geneticist at the Medical University of South Carolina So as a result of that people began asking for those cells and so there are many laboratories all over the world who have published hundreds of papers using the MDA cell line as a model for breast cancer metastasis In fact scientists published  papers with this cell line over the years About  years ago scientists using newly developed DNA tests took a close look at these cells And they were shocked to discover that they werent from a breast cancer cell at all The breast cancer cell line had been crowded out by skin cancer cells We now know with certainty that the MDA cell line is identical to a melanoma cell line Ethier says And it turns out that contamination traces back for decades Several scientists published   about this to alert the field but nevertheless there are people out there who havent gotten the memo apparently he says Ethier is associate editor of a medical journal and every so often he still gets whats supposed to be a breast cancer study but one that is based on the melanoma cell line We just reject those papers and explain that the cells theyre working with arent breast cancer cells he says MDA was so pervasive it even ended up in Clarkes lab at Georgetown He and his colleagues published a few breast cancer studies using those cells in the s Whats more it turns out that the new cell line he had developed had been   with MDA cells  rogue melanoma cells A few years later Clarke was one of the scientists who helped expose MDA cells as being melanoma not breast cancer Clarke says early on scientists simply didnt know how to spot these imposters But that has changed We have much better tools now he says Theyre much easier to use theyre much more incisive in their ability to identify what is what It would have been very difficult early on to have spotted that problem So you might wonder How much breast cancer research was set back by having a thousand studies conducted accidentally on melanoma cells Yeah thats a great question but its a very difficult one to answer Clarke says Maybe those cells provided some useful information for people studying the general phenomenon of metastasis he says But when Clarke comes across a study of MDA he generally doesnt give it a second glance Clarke says hes learned his lesson the hard way about misidentifying cells If we get it wrong again thats really our fault and somebody should throw something at us if we do because theres really no excuse for that Still these cell mixups are all too common in academic labs Between  percent and  percent of all cell lines are contaminated according to   Its actually not a difficult problem to fix Ethier says The hard part really is overcoming a mindset in the field on how people work with cell lines Well look into that in our next story
