The disease may not be fatal but the social and economic cost to those left disfigured leaves them in a life of poverty and isolation The largest number globally are in India says Neeraj Mistry managing director of the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases Three in five of the Indian population remains at risk of becoming infected with lymphatic filariasis despite the country having the longestrunning control program in the world Mistry says the national control program reaches  million people  but in a country with more than  billion residents it will take more to bring an end to this disease  In December  the countrys Ministry of Health and Family Welfare MOHFW launched a new public health campaign to provide more than  million people with free medication It is part of Indias ambitious target to eliminate the disease by   five years before the target date set by the rest of the world The main strategy used globally to control lymphatic filariasis is the widespread distribution of the deworming drugs diethylcarbamazine DEC and albendazole which kill the worms found in the blood to prevent people transmitting the disease once infected  known as mass drug administration  The drugs cause a reduction in the parasite so when the mosquito bites the person it doesnt transmit the disease says Mistry The two drugs have a limited impact in terms of killing the adult worms which form nests inside the lymph nodes and vessels but instead kills the young microfilariae larvae released by adult females into the blood which are then picked up by mosquitoes as they feed  The more people we cover the lower the parasite load gets  to the extent that we can actually break the transmission cycle continues Mistry  fewer parasites in the blood of the population mean a lower likelihood of mosquitoes transmitting them  Of the  million people infected worldwide  million of them are disabled or disfigured according to the World Health Organization There is no vaccine and no treatment only these drugs to prevent further transmission of the disease Of all the people in the world in need of this preventative treatment over  of them live in India To go from control to elimination we need to expand drug coverage says Mistry The goal is to provide the drugs for free annually to everyone living in highrisk populations  whether they have the infection or not Pharmaceutical giants EISAS and GSK now donate the drugs for use in global control making this a much cheaper approach than diagnosing individuals The new campaign is targeting  states in India but particularly the states of Uttar Pradesh Jarkhand Bihar and West Bengal where almost twothirds of the countrys disease burden occurs The majority of lymphatic filariasis infections fail to cause symptoms and in those that do symptoms can take  eight to  years to manifest which is where the greatest challenge arises in terms of disease control  People dont know or believe they could be infected making them less inclined to take the drugs provided to them  The MOHFW has launched a series of public service announcements across the country to overcome this and spread the word in communities where the disease is plaguing their population  One of the challenges of the India program has been treatment compliance agrees Simon Brooker professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who also founded the   which maps infections including lymphatic filariasis In  the WHO launched the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis for which mapping of the disease has been crucial When targeting elimination you need to know where transmission occurs says Brooker Many districts in India believed to have stopped transmission of the parasite The challenge remaining is in rural hotspots  By mapping the disease geographically over set periods of time the progress of control programs can be seen directly and hotspots of disease easily identified We can look at the shrinking of the map says Brooker who has seen the improvement since elimination was first targeted both in India and globally Regions that were endemic for disease are no longer endemic  but what India is seeing is more and more hotspots of transmission  Hotspots are thought to arise from people not taking the drugs but also environmental factors aiding mosquito survival and breeding In a country as populous as India factors like overcrowding also come into play and anything that promotes contact with mosquitoes can increase your chance of being infected  The final challenge then lies in catching the last worms In catching those last few cases thats when diagnostics become important says Mistry and the recent development of a rapid diagnostic blood test should enable this faster and cheaper to truly monitor the presence of the parasite in the smallest of communities  Then we can know if the parasite has been completely eliminated from the population
