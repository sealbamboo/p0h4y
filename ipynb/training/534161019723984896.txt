A single second kiss can transfer as many as  million bacteria according to Dutch scientists They monitored the kissing behaviour of  couples and found those who kissed nine times a day were most likely to share salivary bugs  Studies suggest the mouth is home to more than  different types of bacteria  but the report reveals some are exchanged more easily than others  The research is published in the journal Microbiome A team from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO asked  couples a series of questions to assess their kissing habits including how frequently they had kissed in the last year and when they last locked lips  Scientists took bacterial samples from the volunteers tongues and saliva before and after a strictly timed second kiss  One member of the couple then drank a probiotic drink containing an easily identifiable mixture of bugs  On the couples second kiss scientists were able to detect the volume of bacteria transferred to the other partner  on average  million bacteria in a single second kiss  But while bacteria in the saliva seemed to change quickly in response to a kiss bug populations on the tongue remained more stable  Prof Remco Kort who led the research said French kissing is a great example of exposure to a gigantic number of bacteria in a short time But only some bacteria transferred from a kiss seemed to take hold on the tongue  Further research should look at the properties of the bacteria and the tongue that contribute to this sticking power These types of investigations may help us design future bacterial therapies and help people with troublesome bacterial problems The Dutch scientists worked in collaboration with the museum Micropia the worlds first museum of microbes based in Amsterdam  In a newly opened exhibition couples are invited to share a kiss and are provided with an instant analysis of the bugs they have exchanged  A growing number of researchers are looking at the    an ecosystem of some  trillion microorganisms that live in and on our bodies  Scientists say these populations may be essential for health and the prevention of disease
