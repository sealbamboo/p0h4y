Scientists have known for decades that people with Down syndrome were at increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease but they didnt know why Some researchers now believe that understanding the connection between the two conditions might help us unravel the Alzheimers puzzle and point towards therapies that might slow or even halt the dreaded disease  Its a tantalizing and provocative question Do people with Down syndrome hold the key to the mystery of Alzheimers development Dr Brian Skotko codirector of the Down Syndrome Program at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said in a telephone interview And what can we learn from those with Down syndrome that will benefit the rest of the population  Not only do more people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimers but they also develop it at a much younger age By age  a full  percent of people with Down syndrome will develop the disease and by age  that rises to  percent Skotko told TODAYs Maria Shriver  While not everyone with Down syndrome develops dementia all develop changes in their brains that are found in Alzheimers patients  plaques made of a sticky protein called amyloidbeta that gunk up the spaces between nerve cells in the brain Those plaques start to develop in people with Down syndrome at a very early age  As it turns out the precursor protein for amyloidbeta is encoded on the st chromosome which happens to be the very chromosome that people with Down syndrome get an extra copy of says Dr Cindy Lemere an associate professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital One of the interesting questions to be answered is why  percent of those with Down syndrome dont ever develop dementia even though they do develop plaques Skotko said Scientists dont need to know the answer to that question to start looking for therapies to try to treat Alzheimers  Weve learned that prevention and treatment in the earliest stages is probably our best way to battle this disease Lemere told TODAY And we know that everybody with Down syndrome will eventually develop Alzheimers disease  or at least the changes in the brain So we know that this is now another population where we can perhaps go in and test therapies very early in the disease as a prevention Skotko is currently finishing up the last of the paperwork for a clinical trial of an experimental therapy in Down syndrome volunteers The trial will look at the impact of scylloinositol a drug developed by the Elan Corporation that is designed to block plaque formation and to pump up the levels of a compound that appears to nourish cells of all sorts  As a possible side effect  Skotko says The hypothesis is that the amyloidbeta plaques might be the cause of poor memory and learning difficulties experienced by people with Down syndrome  Word has already gotten out about the upcoming trial Skotko said Our phones have been ringing off the hook with parents who are really interested in learning about the clinical trials he told Shriver Some parents say If there is anything I could give my son or daughter that might improve memory improve their cognition Im all for it But other parents as well as people who have Down syndrome arent as enthusiastic about drugs that might not only improve intellectual abilities but might also have unknown and unpredictable effects on personality among other things  Thats something Skotko understands intimately His sister Kristin has Down syndrome and is the one who inspired him to get into research His sister and the rest of the family are currently on the fence about the trials  I think its an individual decision Skotko told Shriver Its going to be a matter of whether or not she wants to be part of the experiments of the clinical trials before its proven to be effective That rings true to Andy Majewski whose son Ben has Down syndrome  and a job meeting and greeting patients and families at the Down Syndrome Program at Massachusetts General Right now Ben Andy and the rest of the family are mulling over the possible impact of the drug  Were struggling with it because quite frankly we think Ben is perfect Andy Majewski told Shriver So we dont look for any changes in him But the prospect of Alzheimers makes you think a bit more about if theres a potential cure and this can unlock the code to Alzheimers we have to think about it a little more carefully Ben is his own selfadvocate Ben has a say in it And so in this case we would have to spend more time together as a family really understanding what are the risks what are the potential rewards At the end of the day its an individual family choice no different than it would be for any other kind of clinical trial Related storiesÂ
