Its perpetuated But when you put it to the test theres no evidence of benefit in the long term It cant prevent mortality stroke or heart attack The editorial Enough is Enough Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements is based on three studies looking at the effects of multivitamins on preventing heart attacks and cancer as well as improving cognitive function in men older than  All three studies were also published in this weeks Annals of Internal Medicine  The first study was a metaanalysis of  studies that covered more than  participants and found that multivitamins had no beneficial effect on preventing cardiovascular disease or cancer  In addition taking vitamins didnt prevent mortality in any way However the analysis did confirm that smokers who took only beta carotene supplements increased their risk of lung cancer   When taking multivitamins to prevent a second heart attack authors again found no beneficial evidence  The second study looked at  patients who previously had heart attacks They were assigned to take three multivitamins or placebos twice a day for five years However with more than  of patients stopping their medications it was difficult for authors to come to any real conclusions about the vitamins effectiveness   With such a high dropout rate interpretation is very difficult said Miller  The final study followed nearly  men older than  who took either a multivitamin or a placebo for  years The men were administered cognitive functioning tests and test results found no differences between the two groups  However Gladys Block a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at University of California Berkeley pointed out that the group of men followed in the cognitive study were all physicians with no health problems  These are very wellnourished very healthconscious people she said  In fact she says none of the studies accurately represents the American population  Block has spent her life studying the role of Vitamin C in particular on disease risk factors and says that most Americans are undernourished  She says that most Americans dont have a healthy diet and therefore dont get the vitamins and minerals they need  Youre not getting any of these micronutrients from Coke and Twinkies said Block Twothirds of us are overweight a quarter over  have two or more chronic conditions so theres a substantial population that one would hesitate to call healthy Block went on to say Theres always a nontrivial minority thats actually getting a questionable level of some micronutrients So multivitamins are a backstop against our poor diet  Cara Welch senior vice president of the Natural Products Association agreed with Block  It is pretty common that in this day and age with the lifestyle many of us lead that we dont always take the time to have a balanced diet and even if you do have a balanced diet you can still have nutritional deficiencies  The Natural Products Association is the largest trade organization representing the manufacturers and retailers of the natural products industry including vitamins  The vitamin and supplement industry rakes in nearly  billion annually according to the researchers with multivitamins its most popular product  Multivitamins address the nutritional deficiencies in people Welch said We dont believe they are the answer to all lifes ailments as the editorial suggests  Miller however disagreed that the studies didnt represent the general public  They didnt select people who eat good diets or bad diets he said You assume that these people selected are the typical American diet Taking a supplement in place of a poor diet doesnt work  Some groups however do need supplements he said For people with deficiencies malabsorption issues and to prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy  there are a small number of conditions where we prescribe them  Miller also said the jury is still out on Vitamin D which can help strengthen bones and omega fatty acids including DHA and EPA  Miller said the studies were unlikely to change any clinical standards and that focusing on diet and exercise remain key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle  Its something with which Block can agree Eat fruits and vegetables she said
