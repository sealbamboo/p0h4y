Its no surprise that how much a person eats determines how full they feel right after a meal But its the memory of that meal and not the meal itself that matters a couple of hours later So does this mean you trick yourself into thinness Probably not But it does tell us something about the role that manipulating memory may play in calorie intake Weve known for a while that people who are   while eating  such as by watching TV or typing  are not really thinking about what theyre eating Theyre not making memories of the food and may be setting themselves up for   This area of research is helping scientists to better understand how our memory for food comes to influence the decisions we make and the amount of food we eat   an experimental psychologist at the University of Bristol in the UK In a new   published in the journal   Brunstrom and his colleagues took a group of  people and just before lunch showed them a picture of a bowl of supermarketbrand creamed tomato soup Half saw a bowl with  ml of soup and half saw a bowl with  ml of soup This is about the difference between a cup and a bowl of soup Each participant was then led into a cubicle where they ate some tomato soup  either the cup or bowl amount But they couldnt tell exactly how much soup they were eating because the scientists had employed a special system that could covertly add or remove soup from the bowl The participants were just told to eat soup until they reached a special line on their bowl After lunch people who ate more soup felt more satiated than those who ate less But two and three hours later it was the picture of the soup they saw earlier that mattered more Those who had seen the bigger bowl of soup felt less hungry whether or not they had eaten more soup At that point Brunstrom says the memory was dominating hunger not the actual number of calories consumed Whats going on inside the brain and body isnt completely clear at this point but there are a lot of changes and feedbacks that take place when we eat food Memory for a recently consumed meal might give further refinement to those signals Brunstrom says Further   that memory matters for satiation comes from amnesiacs who suffer from a condition called hyperphagia in which they cannot remember what theyve eaten In those patients Brunstrom says if they eat lots of meals they tend to feel just bloated but they dont necessarily feel full We think that they cant actually attribute the signals from their bodies to what has taken place This research may not yet provide any radical new strategies for weight loss but Brunstrom says one logical conclusion from this is that anything that we can do to promote the memory of a recent meal is a good thing Last year we brought you an intriguing example Washington DC chef Bryon Browns   to help people remember his meals by reinforcing the ingredients and flavors through acting singing and music Brunstroms advice Stop eating in front of the computer screen
