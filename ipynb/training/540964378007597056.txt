I was in Paris for a week during the month of October and was reminded that it was wild mushroom season every time I sat down to eat Cpes porcinis and chanterelles were on menus everywhere they were stirred into risottos served along side fish and meat and stood alone panseared or stewed as rich comforting starters In one Japanese restaurant I went to a winter squash soup was garnished with cpes The only part of the menu I didnt see them on was desserts  but I didnt go to many modern bistros either who knows Ill bet some hot pastry chef somewhere has infused some wild mushroom umami flavor into ice cream  We have had such a bad drought for so long in California that I knew I would not be finding much in the way of wild mushrooms at the farmers markets so when I got back from France I went to Whole Foods to see what I could find and what was affordable There was plenty Not fresh cpes but chanterelles these however were wildly expensive and less expensive oyster mushrooms and maitakis  Now several wild mushroom varieties are being cultivated including oyster mushrooms and maitakes enokis and shiitakes and a number of mushrooms that have been given proprietary trademarked names by the producers I found mixed mushroom packets that were reasonably priced and played around with mushroom recipes all week It didnt matter to me that these wild mushrooms were not really wild They had the flavors and textures of wild mushrooms I have gathered in the Provenal countryside  and they didnt require the meticulous cleaning that real wild mushrooms require Mushrooms are meaty  it is their juicy chewy texture and the umami element in their flavor profile  and lend themselves to Mediterranean as well as Asian seasonings They are low in calories and an excellent source of B vitamins and many minerals particularly selenium copper potassium phosphorous zinc and manganese Wild mushrooms in particular also contain phytochemicals including Lergothioneine which studies have shown to have antioxidant properties They are used medicinally throughout Asia for their immuneboosting properties
