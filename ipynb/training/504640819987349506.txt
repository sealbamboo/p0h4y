Theres the Ice Bucket Challenge And now theres the Rice Bucket Challenge More than a million people worldwide have poured buckets of ice water over their heads as part of a   or Lou Gehrigs disease But when word of the challenge made its way to India where more than   lack access to clean drinking water locals werent exactly eager to drench themselves with the scarce supply And so a spinoff was born Manju Kalanidhi a yearold journalist from Hyderabad who reports on the global rice market put her own twist on the challenge She calls her version the Rice Bucket Challenge but dont worry no grains of rice went to waste Instead they went to the hungry I personally think the Ice Bucket Challenge is ideal for the American demographic she says But in India we have loads of other causes to promote Kalanidhi came up with a   version  thats a Hindi word to describe something Indian She chose to focus on hunger A third of Indias  billion people   on less than  USD a day and a kilogram of rice or  pounds costs between  cents and a dollar A family of four would go through roughly  pounds of rice a month she says Thats why shes challenging people to give a bucket of rice cooked or uncooked to a person in need Snap a photo share it online and just as with the Ice Bucket Challenge nominate friends to take part she suggests For those who want to help more than one person at a time she recommends donating to a food charity Kalanidhi kicked off the campaign Friday giving nearly  pounds of rice to her yearold neighbor He has a family of five to feed and makes a living selling breakfast to the neighborhood But if he falls sick his business suffers She took a photo with her neighbor along with the rice and posted it on her   Responses poured in by the hundreds prompting her to create   for the campaign on Saturday It received a hundred likes in just five hours As of today the number of likes has topped  in what she calls a social tsunami With  to  billion people in the world depending on rice as a dietary staple the challenge has spread beyond Indias borders People in California Canada and Hong Kong are among the participants Based on the photos Kalanidhi estimates that at least  people have taken part and more than  pounds of rice have been donated Another  pounds were donated Wednesday by  students at Apoorva Degree College in a town near Hyderabad she says The photos have been pouring in Radio hosts police officers doctors and students have all taken part What if a recipient doesnt want to be photographed  or if the donor thinks its not a good idea to take a picture No worries says Kalanidhi A photo of the rice bucket will do
