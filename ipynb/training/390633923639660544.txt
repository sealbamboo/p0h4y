A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning or sepsis at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives say researchers Early studies at Kings College London suggest the condition can be diagnosed in two hours using a simple blood test Current diagnostic methods take up to two days which may delay treatment with lifesaving antibiotics The condition  caused when the bodys immune system overreacts to infection  causes  UK deaths each year In the study published in the journal   researchers identified a biomarker for diagnosing sepsis rapidly in blood samples It is based on detecting nucleotides specific to sepsis to rule out similar conditions that can mimic its symptoms A small study at a London hospital and a larger study in Sweden demonstrated that sepsis could be diagnosed within two hours with an accuracy of   Lead researcher Prof Graham Lord director of the NIHR biomedical research centre at Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College London told BBC News If our early phase result holds up in a large trial it could have significant effects in saving thousands of lives and reducing the use of unnecessary antibiotics If we can prove its value in prospective trials we can quite rapidly translate it into NHS clinical care He said more research was needed to be done but if successful the test could be available for use in the NHS in about two years UK Sepsis Trust chairman Dr Ron Daniels  said the work paved the way for earlier detection of sepsis If we had a simple test that would reliably detect sepsis  particularly in vulnerable groups  it would significantly improve the reliability of the delivery of care he said He added We still need the suspicion of sepsis to be present for someone to give the test In September a report from the health service ombudsman found significant failings in treatment of sepsis and said more had to be done to save the lives of patients The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will produce guidance for GPs and clinicians to help them recognise sepsis at an early stage
