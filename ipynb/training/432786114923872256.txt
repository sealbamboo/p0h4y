A group of medical consultants in Belfast have teamed up with IT specialists to develop a mobile app that can identify where a doctor is going wrong when interpreting Xrays The app helps medics develop their skills It also identifies areas of weakness that can be worked on in training and that could potentially save lives  According to those behind the training tool it is the first of its kind in the world  Dr Tom Lynch is among the founders  He said This is the medical and IT worlds coming together in Northern Ireland and producing something which is really unique  The app provides immediate feedback and the more it is used by a doctor the more targeted and personalised the feedback becomes  Each doctor has particular strengths and weaknesses  this app means that the doctors are highlighted and then targeted  Primarily the device known as Experior will be used in accident and emergency and cancer departments but could eventually be rolled out across all health specialities and even into education industry and financial services Dr Lynch is head of nuclear medicine at the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre in Belfast  In a coffee shop on Belfasts Lisburn Road his iPad allows me to see the app in action Visibly excited by it Dr Lynch says it is a simple tool but with huge potential  On screen there are  different Xray images each displaying a particular condition The doctors task is to identify the diagnosis submit their answer and have it marked  Pointing at the screen Dr Lynch said For instance this Xray shows a fractured jaw This one shows a mass in the upper part of the chest Another a hairline fracture in the skull  Some are obvious some arent But they are typical Xrays that a junior doctor and one whos been qualified a long time would see in an emergency department   Essentially this is a stateoftheart testing and training tool  it will be used to improve the decisions made by junior doctors and lets them know where they have gone wrong immediately and over the longer term   Because it is a mobile application remotely monitored medics right across the globe can use it   Dr Lynch added We already have doctors as far away as Australia and New Zealand using our app Wherever a doctor is in the world Xrays are the same  So doctors can be learning wherever theyre based and can study at home or at the hospital Nearly  doctors are already using the NI developed app   Kevin Donaghy provides the IT expertise  He said When Tom first approached me with the idea of improving the skills of doctors with Xrays I thought how do we build a solution that can be utilised by doctors and training organisations around the globe How can we harness the best medical brains in the world to the benefit of all doctors and ultimately all of their patients Thats the bottom line  we wanted to develop a device that improves diagnosis and health care for everyone  With that in mind we used the lean startup model to prove that we can do this and lead the way with the best medical and IT expertise in Northern Ireland to deliver a worldclass solution We really believe that Northern Ireland can lead the way in the development of innovative health solutions The BBC understands that the Health Board may be interested in testing the app for  months before making a longerterm decision on its use across trusts in Northern Ireland   A spokesperson for the board told the BBC that Northern Ireland has made great strides in recent years in using technology to give clinicians information to support better decisions for patients and clients  There is international recognition for our implementation of Xray imagesharing technology and the development of the Electronic Care Record that covers all of Northern Ireland These achievements allow us to reduce the number of tests we perform and provide better safer care One really important area is using smart online learning to help keep professionals up to date in the latest treatments  We are excited by this proposal and keen to look at how tools like this can help us to support better care We will be working with this development and others to test whether it helps our staff on the ground
