Pregnant women should take lowdose aspirin daily to reduce their chance of developing preeclampsia if they are at high risk for the lifethreatening disorder an influential government panel said on Monday The United States Preventive Services Task Forces draft recommendation follows a growing scientific consensus that low doses may be beneficial to some highrisk women and their offspring Lowdose aspirin reduced the risk of preeclampsia by  percent in clinical trials according to   underpinning the new recommendation which was published in Annals of Internal Medicine Lowdose aspirin also reduced the risk of premature birth by  percent and of intrauterine growth restriction  a condition in which the fetus doesnt grow as fast as expected  by  percent For every four women who would have gotten preeclampsia one case is prevented said Dr Ira M Bernstein the chair of department of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of Vermont The ability to prevent a quarter of disease is substantial Preeclampsia is a condition usually occurring in the second half of pregnancy and characterized by high blood pressure protein in the urine liver disease and bloodclotting abnormalities It is a leading complication for expectant mothers and their infants affecting roughly  percent of pregnancies nationwide The only cure is delivery When a pregnant women develops preeclampsia in the second trimester her infant often must be delivered prematurely to avoid severe maternal complications like stroke The task force recommended that women at high risk for preeclampsia take  milligrams of lowdose aspirin daily after  weeks of gestation Highrisk women include those who have had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy especially those who have had to deliver preterm women carrying multiple fetuses and women who had diabetes or high blood pressure at conception But the task force also advised that expectant women with multiple moderaterisk factors may also benefit from lowdose aspirin These risks include obesity a family history of preeclampsia women older than  and AfricanAmerican women A single highrisk factor merits lowdose aspirin use but its a judgment call between physicians and patients as to whether a combination of moderaterisk factors is enough to justify taking lowdose aspirin said Dr Michael L LeFevre the chair of the task force and a professor of family medicine at the University of Missouri in Columbia Lowdose aspirin appears to cause no shortterm harm during pregnancy according to the new review of  clinical trials and two observational studies However potential rare or longterm harms could not be ruled out The largest trial followed infants  months after birth and found no differences in development outcomes said Jillian T Henderson the lead author of the review and an investigator at Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland Ore The researchers also found that use of lowdose aspirin doesnt increase the risk of excessive bleeding after delivery placental abruption when the placenta detaches from the uterus before it should or bleeding inside the babys cranial vault Dr Phyllis August a professor of medicine in obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College praised the careful appraisal of the potential risks of taking aspirin They critically reviewed the risks and well said Dr August who for  years has had selected highrisk patients use lowdose aspirin In recent months medical organizations like the   and th also have advised that highrisk women use lowdose aspirin with slight variations in who qualifies Still our general impression is its being used infrequently said Dr LeFevre Its not currently possible to predict which women will develop preeclampsia or its complications Some women classified as low risk still get the syndrome out of the blue Effective prevention of preeclampsia has been difficult to pinpoint experts said but a remedy that could prevent a quarter of the cases is a significant step forward Wed like to be able to prevent four out of four cases obviously Dr Bernstein said Theres still a lot to learn about why the other three are still getting it and how to prevent their disease
