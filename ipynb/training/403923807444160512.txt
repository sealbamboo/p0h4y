There are lots of reasons to aim for a good nights sleep Sleep helps us   It helps our brains get   But sleep might also play a role in heart disease Men who reported difficulty falling or staying asleep had a moderately higher risk of death especially from cardiovascular disease than did men who said they fell asleep easily a study finds Researchers from Harvard and Brigham and Womens Hospital looked at the health of  men over six years Over the course of the study  men died The researchers looked at how insomnia might be related The men who had trouble falling asleep had a  percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those who said they didnt and a  percent higher risk of death The number isnt as grim as it sounds It reflects whats called   which compares the differences between two groups of people An individuals risk of death what scientists call   rose just  percentage points from  to  percent Harvard epidemiologist   one of the researchers behind the study says the findings made sense Poor sleep has influence on endocrine function it can increase chronic inflammation and also it can change circadian patterns Gao tells Shots The findings were   Wednesday in the journal   Of course this study doesnt prove that sleeping problems were responsible for the death difference It could be just chance Factors other than sleeplessness might be behind the discrepancy But the researchers took quite a few into account including age depression and diabetes Gao tells Shots that while the association documented in this study is very strong its still just an association I still believe more studies are needed he says For one thing this was an observational study and the men reported the sleep issues themselves which could influence accuracy The next step Gao says is to bring people into a sleep lab to get a more detailed look at how insomnia might affect mortality But you probably dont need to wait for the answer if youre concerned about your health To improve sleep is always a good thing Gao says In recent years scientists have become more interested in insomnia as a deeper medical issue rather than a nuisance Onethird of Americans say they have trouble sleeping All of the participants were sampled from Harvards   which has been following a group of men since  Gao says the next step is to look at women and see if the association between insomnia and mortality holds true among them
