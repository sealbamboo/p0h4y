Chelation therapy has been used as an alternative treatment for heart disease since the s but with scanty evidence to support the practice most medical doctors have long dismissed it as little more than quackery But now a prestigious medical journal has published the results of a large longterm clinical trial of chelation in heart disease patients While critics were quick to point out the studys myriad irregularities the findings have dumbfounded cardiologists The results suggest chelation originally used to treat   just might help heart patients The benefits were modest Heart attack patients older than  who underwent  chelation infusions had  percent fewer cardiovascular events in five years of followup than those given a placebo The researchers had expected a drop of  percent however and their results barely reached statistical significance Chelation involves infusing patients over several weeks or months with a substance usually   disodium EDTA that binds heavy metals to help the body excrete toxic materials The use of chelation to treat heart disease and other ailments is based largely on anecdotal experience however and the substance used in the new trial was disodium EDTA which unlike calcium disodium EDTA is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose If you had asked any cardiologist to a man or to a woman they would have said this study would be negative and that included me and my associates said Dr Gervasio A Lamas a cardiologist at Columbia University and lead author of the new study But it wasnt and thats the one thing we should be focusing on So have scientists found an effective new treatment for heart disease Critics like Dr Steven E Nissen a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist say no questioning the trials methodology and reliability The real danger is that these types of therapies divert patients away from what we know works things that have been well studied have a track record and are approved by the FDA Dr Nissen said I have had patients over the years who had severe coronary artery disease and needed bypass surgery but they are scared of surgery and they go to the Web and find a chelationist who promises to clean out their arteries and they are sucked into this The trial which lasted over a decade and cost the government  million was riddled with problems critics say Treatment involved  infusions over the course of a year The goal was to enroll  patients but only  were enrolled Among the trial sites were antiaging and wellness centers that have long provided chelation and other unproven treatments like highdose   to cure   The study was disrupted when complaints including questions about the informed consent procedures were lodged with the federal Department of Health and Human Services Nearly  participants  one in every six  withdrew their consent investigators lost track of  more At least two of the participating clinical sites   and the owner of the pharmacy responsible for distributing the blinded chelation solution   The National Institutes of Health which sponsored the study examined the data repeatedly while the trial continued something Dr Nissen said was unacceptable by any standard because of the sponsors investment of money and prestige Dr Gary H Gibbons director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute said in a statement that the institute had no commercial interest in the outcomes of the trials it funds NIH had no bias for or against the therapy he said The number of Americans using chelation therapy has increased in recent years though the treatment is grueling and expensive and can be dangerous While critics worry that data from the new study was compromised Dr Eric Topol a cardiologist with Scripps Health said the medical community should pay attention Even with all the   of this trial it does appear to signal a benefit he said That challenges the prevailing dogma
