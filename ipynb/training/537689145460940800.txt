As many as a third of adults who have high blood pressure have not been screened for diabetes despite the fact that guidelines call for them to be checked regularly new research suggests Hypertension and Type  diabetes frequently occur in tandem Together they represent one of the most common chronic disease combinations and also one of the most hazardous putting people at greater risk of having heart attacks strokes and kidney disease Medical groups have long known about the danger and encouraged people at risk to undergo screening The United States Preventive Services Task Force for example   and other diabetes screening measures  about once every three years  for people with blood pressure readings above  The group notes that the potential benefit of screening and treating such patients for diabetes is substantial But the new research   suggests that many people who should be screened are not The study was carried out by scientists at the Minnesota Health Department who looked at screening rates in Minnesota and then compared them with rates in  other states Surveillance data showed that about a third of adults in Minnesota with hypertension had either diabetes or its precursor known as prediabetes But the data also showed that about a third of people with hypertension said they had not been tested for diabetes in the previous three years The researchers found a similar pattern when they looked at data from other states Why these people were not being screened was not entirely clear But the researchers identified some factors that seemed to go along with reduced testing rates People who were younger than  were less likely to be screened as were those with fewer years of education and less frequent medical checkups Obese people on the other hand were more likely to be screened than others suggesting that normal weight people may underestimate their risk Its true that there is an association with diabetes and obesity said Rene SM Kidney a senior epidemiologist with the diabetes program at the Minnesota department of health and an author of the study But that doesnt mean there are people in the normal weight category who dont have it There are adults in the normal BMI range who have diabetes That such a large segment of people who need to be screened is not is concerning for many reasons Among them is the fact that these people have higher rates of coronary heart disease Dr Kidney said One of the leading causes of death in people with Type  diabetes is cardiovascular disease and   in diabetics stem from high blood pressure Dr Kidney said the findings suggest a need for greater awareness not only among patients with hypertension but also among doctors The research also raises some questions that might lead to better care This is an opportunity for us to say How can we improve what people with hypertension know about their risk for diabetes she said Do people know that they should be screened Do they know how to start that conversation with their provider And if they do have diabetes do they know what kind of resources are there to support them
