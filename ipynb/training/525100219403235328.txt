LONDON—GlaxoSmithKline PLC announced new cost savings, plans to explore a partial listing of its ViiV Healthcare business, and better-than-expected earnings Wednesday as the beleaguered drug maker responds to pressures in the U.S. that continue to drag down its sales. . Glaxo’s sales fell 10% to £5.65 billion ($9.1 billion) in the third quarter, disappointing analysts, as revenue from Advair, the company’s single best-selling drug, continued its sharp decline.
