On a recent weeklong cruise along the shores of southeast Alaska the dining room menu included wild salmon Dungeness crab and sablefish Many of my fellow  passengers had neither heard of nor tasted sable No wonder Almost all of this delectable nutritious fish caught by Americans is exported along with about onethird of all our wild catch Instead we dine on farmed seafood imported from countries like China Thailand and Chile  percent of the   Despite the overwhelming popularity of shrimp among Americans none was served on the trip A naturalist who lectured on board cautioned that almost all the shrimp reaching American tables is imported half of it farmed in Asia  mostly under conditions that would ruin even the most voracious appetite Shrimp farms in Asia have been swept by bacterial and viral infections When a site becomes unusable shrimp farmers simply move on destroying more miles of mangrove along the shore and wrecking habitats for all manner of wildlife including spawning fish There is nothing inherently wrong with farmed seafood says Paul Greenberg the author of two excellent books on seafood   and just published   Mr Greenberg describes several efforts to produce and market farmed seafood in an environmentally sound manner Governments like ours would be wise to divert some of the subsidies that sustain animal husbandry on land to the underwriting of sound fishfarming practices Fish and shellfish are by far the most nutritious sources of animal protein and we should be eating much more of them Even now however it is not possible to satisfy the worlds appetite with the wild catch from oceans rivers and lakes That amounts to about  billion pounds of fish a year Mr Greenberg said in an interview If everyone were to eat at least two servings of fish a week including one oily fish like salmon as nutritional guidelines suggest  billion more pounds would be needed to meet the demand So the farming of fish and shellfish is here to stay But if we must farm it must be done responsibly with an emphasis on safety and future viability And those who shop for and dine on fish whether wild or farmed must do so knowledgeably if future generations are to have the same options Ive repeatedly been admonished to avoid farmed salmon for instance a relative bargain that sells in most markets for  or  a pound Yet wild salmon costs at least  percent more because the supply has been devastated  mainly by the thousands of dams on American rivers that prevent the fish from spawning If we are going to continue to eat wild salmon we must eat them sparingly as the rarest of delicacies and their price should reflect their rarity in the world Mr Greenberg wrote But how many families of modest means can afford to do so And is farmed salmon really so bad Some critics have worried that farmed varieties might contaminate the gene pool of wild salmon But as Mr Greenberg noted almost all the farmed salmon were now eating comes from Chile where there are no wild salmon There is little chance that those farmed fish will cross the Equator and mingle genetically with our wild stock Along with salmon the most popular fish on American plates are sea bass   and tuna Shrimp is by far the most popular shellfish But many other species have all but disappeared from seafood counters and restaurant menus Where is the orange roughy that was all the rage a decade ago When was abalone last on a regular seafood menu Consumers must begin to consider alternatives Oily substitutes for salmon for instance include mackerel bluefish herring sardines and anchovies Most of the latter are used to make fish meal for farmed salmon Stocks of cod   from overfishing that many Northeastern fisheries were forced to shut down before the entire species disappeared Those seeking a flaky nonfishy wild alternative might select Alaskan pollock popular in fish sticks fastfood fish sandwiches and California rolls In the best of all worlds mussels nearly always sold from hygienically farmed stock would replace shrimp as the leading shellfish Like other   mussels are filter feeders that cleanse the water they live in stocking up on valuable   from algae in the process Mussels are also low in calories and much lower in   than shrimp and squid Two useful bits of advice for consumers   At fish counters look for   which represents the international gold standard for sustainable fishing practices   When shopping or eating out consult   selecting mostly fish on the green list and avoiding those redlisted Mr Greenberg argues that the harvest of wild fish must be better controlled if we are to maintain sustainable populations We need an ocean policy that looks at wild and domesticated fish as two components of a common future he wrote in Four Fish He pleads for a standard that will boost fish supplies in as sustainable a manner as possible Humans should purposefully select a handful of fish species that stand up to industrialsize husbandry with the goal of compensating for the huge gap between wild supply and growing human demand Mr Greenberg wrote
