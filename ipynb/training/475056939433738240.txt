A third of women at risk for accidental pregnancy have used the withdrawal method of birth control a new study finds  but hold off on the coitus interruptus jokes It turns out that pulling out during sex is often a strategy for extra protection against pregnancy  not less  used by couples most motivated not to have a baby according to Rachel K Jones and other researchers at the Guttmacher Institute Most people using withdrawal are also using another method or doubling up said Jones whose study was published Friday in the journal Contraception Using an analysis of national survey data from  women aged  to  in  Jones and her colleagues found that  percent of participants had used the withdrawal method at any time in the past  days Of those about  percent used only withdrawal to prevent pregnancy Most women who used withdrawal combined it with other methods such as birth control pills or condoms sometimes simultaneously and sometimes in rotation the study found Among younger women in the survey aged  to  slightly more than  percent had used withdrawal to avoid pregnancy in the past month but only  percent relied on it as the sole form of birth control the researchers found Women in dating relationships and those strongly motivated to avoid pregnancy also had some of the highest levels of combining withdrawal use with condoms or highly effective methods Guttmacher officials said The new study counters previous national research that found that while nearly  percent of women had ever used withdrawal only  percent were currently using it That might be in part because many people previously surveyed didnt regard withdrawal as a real or effective method of birth control and so didnt report it Jones and her colleagues constructed the survey differently making sure to include withdrawal first in a list of birth control options and to allow reporting of mixed methods of pregnancy prevention The findings suggest that far more women rely on withdrawal as primary or backup birth control indicating that health care providers should discuss its use more thoroughly Jones said Pulling out is about as effective as condoms for preventing pregnancy with a failure rate of  percent compared to  percent for condoms the study reported Couples should understand that  and that withdrawal doesnt protect against sexually transmitted infections Increased awareness of the pros and cons of withdrawal has the potential to result in lower contraceptive failure rates they wrote
