Its possible that some of us are born not to run According to an eyeopening new genetics study of lab rats   the motivation to exercise  or not  may be at least partly inherited  For years scientists have been bedeviled by the question of why so few people regularly exercise when we know that we should There are obvious reasons including poor health and jammed schedules But researchers have begun to speculate that genetics might also play a role as some recent experiments suggest In one   sets of fraternal and identical adult twins wore activity monitors to track their movements The results indicated that the twins were more alike in their exercise habits than a shared upbringing alone would explain Their willingness to work out or sit all day depended to a large extent on genetics the researchers concluded  But which genes might be involved and how any differences in the activity of those genes might play out inside the body were mysteries So scientists at the University of Missouri recently decided to delve into those issues by creating their own avid or antiexercising animals  They accomplished this task by interbreeding normal rats that had voluntarily run on wheels in the lab The male rats that had run the most were bred with the female rats that also had run the most those that had run the least were likewise mated This scheme continued through many generations until the scientists had two distinct groups of rats some of which would willingly spend hours on  running wheels while the others would skitter on them only briefly if at all   In   the researchers found some intriguing differences in the activity of certain genes in their brains In normal circumstances these genes create proteins that tell young cells to grow up and join the working world But if the genes dont function normally the cells dont receive the necessary chemical messages and remain  in a prolonged feckless cellular adolescence Such immature cells cannot join the neural network and dont contribute to healthy brain function  In general these genes worked normally in the brains of the rats bred to run But their expression was quite different in the nonrunners brains particularly in a portion of the brain called the nucleus accumbens which is involved in reward processing In humans and many animals the nucleus accumbens lights up when we engage in activities that we enjoy and seek out  Presumably as a result when the scientists closely examined the brains of the two types of rats they found that by young adulthood the animals bred to run had more mature neurons in the nucleus accumbus than did the nonrunners even if neither group had actually done much running In practical terms that finding would seem to indicate that the brains of pups born to the running line are innately primed to find running rewarding all those mature neurons in the reward center of the brain could be expected to fire robustly in response to exercise Conversely the rats from the reluctantrunning line with their skimpier complement of mature neurons would presumably have a weaker innate motivation to move  Those results would be disheartening except that in the final portion of the experiment the scientists had reluctant runners exercise by setting them on running wheels while also providing some borntorun animals with wheels After six days the unwilling runners had accumulated far less mileage about  kilometers two miles per rat compared to almost  kilometers each by the enthusiasts  But the halfhearted runners brains were changing Compared to others in their family line that had remained sedentary they now showed more mature neurons in their nucleus accumbens That part of their brain remained less well developed than among the naturally avid rat runners but they were responding to exercise in ways that would seem likely to make it more rewarding  What if anything these findings mean for people is impossible to know at this point said Frank Booth a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of Missouri who oversaw the study Rat brains are not human brains and rat motivations are at best opaque  Even so Dr Booth said his groups data would seem to suggest that humans may have genes for motivation to exercise and other genes for motivation to sit on the couch and over generations one set of these genes could begin to predominate within a family But predispositions are never dictatorial People can decide to exercise whatever their inheritance Dr Booth said and as his studys final experiment suggests they could rewire their brains so that moving becomes a pleasure
