The idea that caring for a chronically ailing or disabled family member might be good for you is so startling so counterintuitive that it sends researchers rummaging through their data to see where they went wrong There are hundreds of studies about how   said David Roth As director of the   and someone who has spent  years compiling caregiving data he has probably read most of them But his recent study in The American Journal of Epidemiology is the most recent to lend support to an emerging counter perspective dubbed the healthy caregiver hypothesis Inserting a few key questions into a large national stroke study his team was able to compare about  family caregivers older than  with noncaregivers of the same age gender education level and selfreported health The researchers also matched caregivers and noncaregivers for cognitive status and for health behaviors like smoking and drinking   variables in all The caregivers included spouses about  percent of the  followed adult children caring for parents about a third and people caring for other family members After an average sixyear followup he and his colleagues found that the   rates Nine percent of them had died compared with  percent of caregivers who were  percent less likely to die during the sixyear period  a ninemonth increase in life expectancy That amounts to a considerable survival advantage for caregivers Dr Roth said  Its intriguing said Lisa Fredman a Boston University epidemiologist who published some of the first studies documenting a possible health benefit to caregiving As   her studies have also shown that caregivers had    plus   and    than noncaregivers But the Hopkins study larger size Dr Fredman said allowed for its innovative statistical matching approach Its very rigorously done she said They had a big sample they followed over a long period Of course you dont need to be a statistician to see that if the burdens of caregiving can be overstated in studies like these the benefits might be too In the Hopkins sample for instance the outcome measured over six years is whether people lived or died It doesnt analyze whether the caregivers suffered from poorer mental or physical health as the years passed But the researchers do have some health data as yet unanalyzed so stay tuned for future findings Moreover the study used a very broad definition of caregiving The question asked was Are you currently providing care on an ongoing basis to a family member with a chronic illness or disability This would include any kind of help such as watching your family member dressing or bathing this person arranging care or providing transportation The researchers didnt try to distinguish family members who occasionally drove a parent to a doctors appointment from those shouldering roundtheclock care for a spouse with dementia But more than half the caregivers  percent reported providing more than  hours of care weekly In fact Dr Roth pointed out the researchers couldnt tell if in subsequent years the caregivers even remained caregivers If a family member died or someone else took on his care they could have become noncaregivers The noncaregivers in turn might have started providing care for someone Its a snapshot taken six years ago Dr Roth said He also acknowledged as did Dr Fredman that selfselection probably plays a role Maybe the findings reflect healthier people taking on the caregiver role  particularly among nonspouses  rather than caregiving helping to keep people healthy Yet we cant dismiss the idea that theres something about caregiving that can help as well as harm Greater physical activity The mental stimulation of multitasking Increased social connection A sense of purpose and usefulness I believe the caregiving is stressful and dangerous message has been a little oversold Dr Roth said Because the word   covers such a multitude of behaviors and relationships my own amateur hypothesis with which Dr Roth and Dr Fredman agreed is that both sets of findings can be true These studies arent really contradictory Some people in some situations find that the responsibilities of caregiving aka caregiver burden take a toll on their own health and wellbeing For others a different set of conditions may produce what gerontologists call caregiver gain including both psychological and physical benefits Ill be interested in your comments on which scenario has been more true for you Its not one uniform experience or outcome Dr Fredman said Can we try to identify what makes it OK for caregivers who have lower mortality And then design support and interventions for others so they can have a good experience too
