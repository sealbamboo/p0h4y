Smoking rots the body from within warns this years quit smoking campaign from Public Health England PHE The graphic online and print billboard adverts feature a rollup cigarette full of decaying tissue  While many smokers know the damage tobacco does to their hearts and lungs they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful it can be to other parts of the body says PHE Cigarettes can damage the bones muscles brain teeth and eyes  Current smokers are at double the risk of Alzheimers disease for example Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies says the adverts have been designed to shock and educate but smoking groups branded the campaign as poisonous The campaign also tackles common misconceptions around handrolled tobacco or rollups Many smokers mistakenly believe that they are safer than conventional cigarettes says PHE  But evidence suggests handrolled cigarettes are at least as hazardous as any other type of cigarette Yet their popularity is growing In   of male smokers and  of female smokers said they smoked mainly handrolled cigarettes By  this had risen to  for men and  for women Prof Kevin Fenton National Director for Health and Wellbeing for PHE said Much of the harm caused by smoking doesnt become obvious until middle age but the invisible damage can start shockingly early  even by the late teens  The earlier a smoker quits the better but quitting at any age can help reverse at least some of the damage Thats why there is no time better than now to quit Stop smoking and stop the rot Dame Sally said I think people know about the big killers  cancer heart disease and stroke  but I dont think they realise about osteoporosis and I didnt know about fertility  And the doubling the likelihood of cognitive decline and Alzheimers I think is quite scary Simon Clark director of the tobacco lobby group Forest said Campaigns like this are an abuse of public money Education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counterproductive because its human nature to switch off when youre being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis
