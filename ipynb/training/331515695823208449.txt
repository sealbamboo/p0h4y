This week Colorado lawmakers hope to pass the first comprehensive set of recreational pot regulations in the country The proposed rules involve who can sell it where and to whom and also include a big new tax  one that voters must go back to the polls to approve Most people who smoke marijuana smoke it out of a pipe or rolled joint But not Dan Pope He uses a vaporizer called The Volcano The device which he says resembles a kitchen appliance of sorts is stainless steel with a plastic bag attached to the top As it gently heats the marijuana the vapors collect in the bag Pope can puff on the bag to relieve the pain from his muscular dystrophy You avoid the noxious gases associated with the smoke Pope explains Its a much lighter healthier way to use cannabis And my doctor actually prefers that I do it that way When legalization passed in Colorado in November Pope initially thought he could drop his medical marijuana license which costs  a year requires a doctors visit and puts his name in a state database But then he heard that taxes on recreational marijuana could be more than  percent If a patients budget is  a month on medical marijuana thats a  to  a month increase Pope notes And that he says is too high a jump for his fixed income No one knows how many of Colorados  medical marijuana patients will hold on to their medical license for the cheaper pot it offers And thats made dispensaries cautious about moving to recreational sales Norton Arbelaez is a coowner of RiverRock Wellness in Denver where customers browse dozens of jars packed with bright green marijuana buds Medical shops like this one get first crack at becoming recreational possibly as soon as January Arbelaez says his business will cater to both types of buyers kind of like a chain drugstore And so if anything  think about a Walgreens where part of the Walgreens is overthecounter and part is a controlled substance Arbelaez says That is more or less what conceptually  its going to look like Sure many patients will choose to keep their medical license But Arbelaez also expects big things from the recreational side of the business which will be open to anyone over the age of  with a valid ID Arbelaez is conflicted He wants a low enough tax rate so the stores product can remain costcompetitive with the black market But he says the industry wants to pay its fair share The industry wants to contribute to the coffers of the state of Colorado We want to pay our own way in terms of regulation I think voters just assumed that this money would just be piped right in  just what the industry told them during the campaign But obviously thats not the case says Gina Carbone a founding member of Smart Colorado a group that opposes widespread retail pot shops She says voters unfortunately must approve any tax the Legislature settles on And I dont think that a lot of voters knew that theyd have to go back to the polls she says It makes Carbone nervous that those taxes could fail at the ballot box in November She points to a recent audit of the Medical Marijuana Enforcement Division that found the agency is severely underfunded  raising the question of just how regulated Colorados current medical marijuana industry really is State Rep Dan Pabon says there could be dire consequences if the taxes dont pass and there isnt money to beef up enforcement I fear the federal government would become involved Pabon says I fear black market concerns  diversion will happen And that he says could force the Obama administration to put the brakes on retail pot
