Many parents undoubtedly think they are doing the best for their children by having them bring lunch from home instead of eating the lunches served in school But recent studies clearly prove them wrong Homepacked lunches the research showed are likely to be considerably less nourishing than the meals offered in schools that abide by current nutrition guidelines for the National School Lunch Program That program is distressingly increasingly under attack The requirements for less salt and only whole grains were already reversed in the final federal spending bill approved by the Senate on Dec  But the program must not continue to be undermined and more schools should be encouraged to participate Nearly  million of the more than  million children in public elementary and secondary schools currently eat school lunches most of them provided through the program For about  percent of those children half or more of their daily calories are consumed at lunch Those numbers along with the recent findings on meals brought from home make the contents of lunches served in school especially important to the health of Americas children now and in the future One   found that compared with what is served in school lunches brought from home contained fewer servings of fruits vegetables whole grains and milk than the national program mandates Packed lunches also contained more desserts chips and sweetened nondairy drinks none of which can be served by schools that participate in the federal program About  percent of lunches from home contained desserts snack chips and sweetened beverages the study found A   conducted among preK and kindergarten children in four schools in rural Virginia found that calories fat saturated fat and sugar were significantly higher and protein fiber and calcium were significantly lower in lunches brought from home than in the meals served in school A   examined food selection and plate waste by elementary and middle school children in four schools in an urban lowincome school district before and after introduction of the new meal standards Juliana F W Cohen and coauthors found no increase in waste and a significantly greater selection and consumption of vegetables and fruits from the improved menus These results suggest that the new school meal standards have improved students overall diet quality they wrote Legislation to weaken the standards is not warranted Before the  school year a school lunch had to offer  to  cup of fruits and vegetables combined no variety specified  cup of milk of any kind  ounce of grains of any kind at least  to  ounces a week and   to  ounces of meat or a meat alternative at least   to  ounces per week The current program requires  to  cup of fruits  to  cup of vegetables  cup of  percent or fatfree milk if sweetened fatfree only  to  ounces of grains half of which are whole grains to a maximum of  to  ounces a week and  to  ounces of meat or a meat alternative to a maximum of  to  ounces a week A variety of vegetables  not just potatoes  must be served and children must select at least three of these options each day including at least one fruit or vegetable These improvements in the nutritional value of lunches served in schools that are eligible for federal reimbursement followed congressional passage of the Healthy HungerFree Kids Act of  The law was prompted by shocking findings in  by child nutrition experts who examined the contents of school lunches for the Institute of Medicine As Dr Jennifer A Woo Baidal and Dr Elsie M Taveras   the  experts found that children ate strikingly few fruits and vegetables with little variety Potatoes accounted for one third of vegetable consumption Intake of refined grains was high Almost  percent of children consumed more saturated fat than was recommended and sodium intake was excessive in all age groups Perhaps most distressing children ate more than  excess calories from solid fats and added sugars per day the doctors reported As a mother of two boys and grandmother of four I know that many parents who give children lunch from home want to be sure it is eaten so they pack what they know the children like But that is exactly how we got to the dismal state of child obesity and the diseasepromoting eating habits that too often carry over into adulthood Many chronic ailments that currently trouble adult Americans originate with poor diets acquired in childhood Few question the need to do a better job of teaching children to eat and enjoy the foods that are best for them Yet lessons on nutrition and handson experience with wholesome foods often fall by the wayside in busy households and in schools that now spend more time teaching to the test than fostering healthy bodies and minds But experts say it doesnt have to be this way There are ways to introduce wholesome foods into academic lessons and to make what is served in the lunchroom more appealing to students so that theyd be less inclined to bring less healthful foods from home It may not be easy to convince children to eat whats good for them but there are clearly strategies that can help Karen W Cullen professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Baylor College of Medicine suggested that parents learn more about preparing healthy lunches   is a good place to start take their children shopping let them to pick out vegetables and fruits to try and help prepare them at home Kids are adaptable and sometimes need repeat exposures to new foods Dr Cohen said Given enough opportunity they can learn to like them If you only expose children to chicken nuggets and French fries thats what theyll like to eat Dr Baidal said Schools can help by giving foods creative names and presenting them in fun ways Food service personnel can prompt children to try different foods when they come through the line Nutritious foods can be incorporated into classroom lessons in math science and language arts then served in the lunchroom Foods that are familiar are more likely to be chosen and eaten
