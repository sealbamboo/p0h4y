Do you have a decisive marriage New research shows that how thoughtfully couples make decisions can have a lasting effect on the quality of their romantic relationships Couples who are decisive before marriage  intentionally defining their relationships living together and planning a wedding  appear to have better marriages than couples who simply let inertia carry them through major transitions Making decisions and talking things through with partners is important said   a relationship researcher at the University of Denver and coauthor of the report When you make an intentional decision you are more likely to follow through on that While the   may seem obvious the reality is that many couples avoid real decisionmaking Many couples living together for instance did not sit down and talk about cohabitation Often one partner had begun spending more time at the others home or a lease expired forcing the couple to formalize a living arrangement Couples who slide through their relationship transitions have poorer marital quality than those who make intentional decisions about major milestones Dr Rhoades and her colleagues wrote The research stems from a study that began with  young adults ages  to  recruited to the Relationship Development Study in  and  Over the next five years  of the individuals in the study married offering the researchers a glimpse into the lives and decisionmaking of couples before and after marriage The researchers collected data on prior romantic experiences whether the relationship started by hooking up in a casual relationship whether the couple had a big or small wedding and what the overall quality of the marriage was Notably they found that the decisions and experiences with others before marriage had a lasting effect on the relationship In the study group most people had had sex before marriage reporting an average of five sexual partners But  percent of the subjects had only one sexual partner their eventual spouse Those individuals reported higher marriage quality than people who had had multiple sexual partners People who lived with another person before marrying also reported a lowerquality relationship In that group  percent had higherquality marriages Among those who had not lived with another romantic partner before marriage  percent had higherquality marriages The finding is counterintuitive given that experience navigating relationships should leave one better equipped to manage conflict and sustain a marriage But past romantic experience can also be a reminder that there are other options Prior relationship experience leaves some kind of imprint on us that we carry forward Dr Rhoades said We compare new partners to old partners In the study having a big wedding also was related to a stronger marriage Not everyone can afford a large wedding of course but the finding held even after the researchers controlled for differences in income It may be that couples who plan big weddings have more family support and friendships both of which are good for a marriage But the discussions and decisionmaking that go into planning such a large event also may be a sign that the couple has made conscious decisions about the relationship Couples who started out in a casual sexual relationship were less likely to have a highquality marriage Among these couples  percent had high quality marriages compared with  percent of couples who said they did not hook up before dating Most of the couples in the study who lived together before marriage said they actively discussed the decision however  percent said cohabitation was something that just happened to them Over all couples in the first group had better marriages than those in the second Sliding through lifealtering transitions leads to a worse outcome   a research professor at the University of Denver and coauthor of the new study Dr Stanley said that many couples end up sliding into big decisions  rather than making them  as a way to avoid the talk that helps define a relationship and shared commitment Relationships today are much more ambiguous said Dr Stanley who writes a blog about relationships for Psychology Today If you define things you risk breaking up Maybe you dont really want to know how committed they are and it feels safer not to have the talk In our culture many couples spend a lot of time together and have sex but they may not be sure where they stand Dr Stanley noted that the very first talk couples may need to have is to answer the question Is this a date People are not even clear now on whats a date whats not a date what are the rules Dr Stanley said The study authors note that the data simply show associations among past experiences decisionmaking and relationship quality and caution that a number of variables may influence a marriage A person who had multiple sexual partners and a small wedding is not necessarily going to have a bad marriage The larger lesson from the study the authors say is that couples should make active decisions about their relationships and major life events rather than drifting through one year after another Showing intent in some form  from planning the first date to living together to the wedding and beyond  can help improve the quality of a marriage over all At the individual level know who you are and what you are about and make decisions when it counts rather than letting things slide Dr Stanley said Once you are a couple do the same thing in terms of how you approach major transitions in your relationship
