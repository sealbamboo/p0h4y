 Seeing beer and liquor ads on   as early as seventh grade and lead to alcoholrelated problems just a few years later a new study suggests The more ad exposure the teens reported  and the more they enjoyed the commercials  the more they drank by th grade the researchers found This study provides evidence that exposure to   in seventh grade and liking those alcohol advertisements on television is associated with higher levels of drinking in the eighth and ninth grades said lead researcher Jerry Grenard an associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University in California This early drinking is in turn associated with the development of alcoholrelated problems such as fighting or academic decline by th grade he said Examples of problems include failing to do homework   passing out and getting into fights Grenard said While the research doesnt prove that liquor advertising caused the drinking Grenard said drinking by young teens was less prevalent before the heyday of TV liquor advertisements Policy makers should work with the alcohol industry to limit adolescents exposure to alcohol advertising Grenard added Parents and schools should teach children about the design of persuasive messages in the media to help them avoid undue influence by the media on their behaviors he said For the report published online Jan  in the journal   Grenards team recruited nearly  seventh graders and questioned them about use of beer wine or liquor and exposure to liquor advertising They kept tabs on many of the students through th grade Overall the more ads seventh graders watched and the more they liked them the more they drank from seventh to th grade they found Seventh graders who watched these ads especially girls were more likely to start drinking And boys who liked the advertisements were more likely to develop alcoholrelated problems Grenards group found Grenard believes the ads influence seventh graders to drink as they move on in school Of the seventh graders recruited for the study  percent had never tried alcohol or only a little he noted Therefore we were able to assess exposure to advertising before many students began to drink alcohol regularly Grenard said Other experts agreed that schools parents and doctors should help children understand that what they see on TV or on the Internet isnt always true This study contributes to existing research on advertising and alcohol use among youth by showing an association with exposure to alcohol ads on TV and later alcohol use as well as problem behavior due to drinking said Jennifer Manganello an associate professor at the University at Albany School of Public Health Based on these findings and earlier research media literacy programs are needed to educate youth about advertising claims she said Also parents should be familiar with where their children may be exposed to alcohol ads including places like social media sites and mobile phones Manganello said They should also discuss alcohol advertising with them she added But Dr Metee Comkornruecha who practices adolescent medicine at Miami Childrens Hospital in Florida doesnt believe liquor ads play an overwhelming role in getting kids to drink I think its a minor role he said Total   however does have a significant role and this includes what children see in movies TV programs and online he added Comkornruecha doesnt think liquor ads should be banned from TV as tobacco ads are A lot of responsibility is to teach kids about media literacy he said While we cant shelter all our kids from everything the important thing is teaching them how to react and how to interpret the messages they are seeing Comkornruecha said Another paper in the same journal issue found that too few doctors counsel adolescents about the dangers of drinking That  study of th graders  led by Ralph Hingson from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  found that  percent drink  percent bingedrink and  percent were drunk in the past month Although  percent had seen a doctor and  percent were asked about drinking only  percent were counseled to reduce or stop drinking the researchers found The researchers concluded that efforts are warranted to increase the proportion of physicians who follow professional guidelines to screen and counsel adolescents about unhealthy alcohol use and other behaviors that pose health risks
