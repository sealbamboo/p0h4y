The Missouri Department of Health   Every time a person takes antibiotics sensitive bacteria are killed but resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply Repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are primary causes of the increase in drugresistant bacteria    Some bad bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics   Others can become resistant by spontaneous genetic mutation or by swapping genes with other bugs  So the CDC is ranking the worst drugresistant bacteria according to how many people get sick the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths caused by each They also took into account how many if any existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria  Instead of red orange or yellow  the levels once used to describe terrorism threats  the CDC is using urgent serious and concerning Knowing the specific names of the deadly bacteria may not be essential for the average person but CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden said Monday that the CDC is warning the public about these health threats before they get out of control   For the first time said Frieden  we have a snapshot of antimicrobial threats that have the most impact on human health According to the CDC the following bacteria are the most Urgent Threats   a family of germs called carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae which includes E Coli Some CRE bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics The CDC reports more than  infections are contracted in hospitals and other health care settings from these bacteria  As many as  of the patients who are infected with CRE end up dying because there is nothing to help them fight the infections   a bacteria that can cause   It kills up to  people and causes a quarter million hospitalizations each year Most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections The problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria CDiff included    the drugresistant form of this bacteria causes gonorrhea the second most commonly reported infection in the United States Gonorrhea can cause a variety of illnesses in men and women including infertility The CDC estimates there are  infections each year In nearly a third of the cases treatment of the sexuallytransmitted disease is hampered by growing antibiotic resistance  Frieden said if the current trends continue the medicine cabinet may be empty for patients who need them in the coming months and years   To avoid what Frieden calls a postantibiotic era where none of the existing drugs work anymore and new ones havent been approved the CDC has created a fourstep plan to stem the tide of antibiotic resistance  The government agency hopes to better track infections in the future to know when a bacteria is becoming drugresistant By spotting the trend earlier scientists may be able to develop new antibiotics quicker  You can also do your part the CDC said by preventing infections in the first place Preventing infection starts with practicing good hand hygiene and safe foodhandling so you dont get sick in the first place Since many antibioticresistant infections are spread in hospital settings patients and their families should feel empowered to ask doctors and other health care personnel coming into their rooms if they have washed their hands Patients should also only take antibiotics when they are really necessary Changing the way antibiotics are used is perhaps the single most important action needed to greatly slow the development and spread of antibioticresistant infections Frieden said   Patients need to demand fewer antibiotics and doctors have to resist patients requests for them when they know they wont work  Also lowering the use of antibiotics in animals to only when its absolutely necessary can contribute to stretching the life and usefulness of available drugs Frieden said
