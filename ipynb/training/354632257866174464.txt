Heres a sobering thought for every cat owner in charge of emptying the litter box Felines deposit about  million metric tons of feces into the US environment every year a new study finds and all that poop may pose an underrecognized public health hazard No ones saying to get rid of the kitties but scientists who study an infectious parasite known as Toxoplasma gondii say theyve found that the eggs of the bug are more widespread than believed and that cat owners should take precautions when it comes to kids sandboxes and backyard gardens  Thats even though theres evidence that fewer are becoming infected by the parasite and veterinarians say that responsible pet owners are actually at lower risk than others  Its long been known that some cat feces harbor the parasite known as T gondii which can cause human illness Pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems have been warned for decades to avoid cat box duty because the resulting infections can cause congenital problems and serious illness But a new analysis by Dr E Fuller Torrey and Dr Robert H Yolken scientists at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center finds that the parasite eggs known as oocysts may be more common than previously known  perhaps between three and  oocysts per square foot of soil according to samples taken from places as diverse as California China Brazil Panama and Poland In addition it may take just a single oocyst to cause infection an alarming thought when one estimate shows that the dirt under a gardeners fingernails could harbor  oocysts reported Torrey the lead author of the study in the journal Trends in Parasitology  It may be a much bigger problem than we realize said Torrey a psychiatrist who heads the Stanley Medical Research Institute in Chevy Chase Md There have been outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in healthy people not just pregnant or immunecompromised patients he said And   although not proven  that there may be a link between high levels of T gondii antibodies and development of conditions including schizophrenia bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD  Some of us suspect that some of the important transmission may occur in childhood Torrey told NBC News  Cats acquire the parasite when they eat infected prey such as mice or birds and then shed the oocysts in their poop Children may ingest oocysts present in sandboxes and backyard dirt said Torrey who wants better control of the cat population including feral cats and better covering and monitoring of kids play areas  It should give you pause before you put your child in a public sandbox he said Still even Torreys paper notes that theres little evidence that owning a cat actually increases risk of T gondii infection And he acknowledges that the incidence of human toxoplasmosis as measured through antibody levels has decreased steadily in the US and Northern Europe during the past two decades A  study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of T gondii antibodies in USborn people ages  to  dropped from about  percent to  percent between  and   That decline could be driven in part by increased freezing of meat so fewer people are becoming infected with T gondii tissue cysts from raw beef for instance he explained The CDC says that toxoplasmosis caused by eating infected meat is a leading cause of deaths form foodborne illness in the US  Overall however the CDC estimates that although  million men women and children in the US may be infected with the T gondii parasite very few have symptoms because the human immune system typically keeps illness at bay  This is not considered a big problem Torrey admitted Indeed responsible cat owners are likely at lower risk than others said Kimberly May a veterinarian and spokeswoman for the American Veterinary Medical Association Those owners empty litter boxes frequently wash their hands and keep kids away from cat feces she said The bigger risk for T gondii comes from gardening without gloves or failing to follow those precautions  We are concerned that cats are being the scapegoats for this she said  No question the number of cats in US homes is on the rise Between  and  cat ownership increased about  percent from  million to  million pets During the same time dog ownership rose by  percent from  million to  million dogs In   million cats were owned in the US compared with  million dogs according to statistics from the Humane Society of the United States The number of feral cats in the US has been estimated at at least  million but could be much higher Torrey noted  With about  percent of cats shedding oocysts at any given time perhaps  million oocysts per day it could be a more serious problem than is now recognized Torrey contends Oocysts can survive up to  months and perhaps longer he noted  This should raise the public health concerns about the number of T gondii oocysts being distributed in the environment especially as we do not know the limits of oocyst viability or the true relationship between these oocysts and the human diseases with which they have recently been associated Thats a view downplayed by infectious disease experts including Dr William Schaffner chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville Tenn  He said that the recognized risks of toxoplasmosis infection are well known  and well communicated to the people who may be most affected including pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems  But the links between the infection and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are tenuous he said  The association has been discussed but it has not been completely accepted by everyone he said If people were convinced of that we would have acted on it Still Torrey said he worries about what future research will confirm and wants pet owners to be proactive now  Cats are nice pets said Torrey who emphasized that his intent was not to anger feline fans But when his young granddaughter wanted a kitten he advised her mom to say no  I dont think that they are ideal pets for children he said I dont think we know enough
