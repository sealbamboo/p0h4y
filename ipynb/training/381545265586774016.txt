Stephen Crohn a man best known for staying alive during the early days of the AIDS epidemic died Aug  at age  Throughout his lifetime the New York artist helped researchers uncover vital clues about HIV and how to stop it Crohns partner was one of the first people to die from AIDS in  Over the years Crohn watched boyfriends and acquaintances die from the disease But he never got sick Knowing that there was something unique about himself Crohn volunteered to be studied Eventually scientists realized that Crohn had a genetic anomaly that made him resistant to HIV infection Less than  percent of the population   this protective mutation Immunologist Bill Paxton was one of the first scientists to work with Crohn at the   in New York He figured out that some of Crohns immune cells called CD literally blocked the virus I couldnt infect the CD cells he     Id never seen that before HIV normally enters an immune cell by tugging on two receptors on the cells surface Scientists ultimately figured out that one of those receptors on Crohns cells was shortened and not accessible to the virus Without the receptor HIV couldt infect his cells This genetic change is called the delta  mutation Its discovery has helped researchers develop the antiviral drug   and devise the first experimental strategy for   HIV Crohn was an artist and freelance editor His   have been exhibited in New York San Francisco and elsewhere He committed suicide last month His sister Amy Crohn Santagata told   that he suffered from survivors guilt NPRs   host Audie Cornish recently spoke with Paxton who remained friends with Crohn over the years Yes This was back in  I was setting up a study I wanted to look at people who were highly exposed to HIV but who had remained seronegative so they hadnt contracted the virus And through a meeting an HIV activist put me in touch with a couple of doctors  Within a week I had a phone call from one doctor saying I have the perfect person to fit with what youre looking for And thats when I was introduced to Steve Well treatment was not really an option and really back in the s AIDS still was a disease to be reckoned with It still was at its peak It was still rising  Well I mean Steve was quite phenomenal When I met him we clicked instantly There was a rapport between us He understood you know before scientists that he had this resistance to AIDS He said I have this protection I have something Study me And he just had this empathy for the science He understood it And it helped that we had the same sense of humor He was a real fun character And he persevered with the study He came back he came back he came back And I think the thing which for me was most striking was at the end we could say to Steve You were right And you have this molecule missing That is advancing science And I think Steve took a lot from that Through all the misery actually at the end from studying him and people like him we actually did move HIV research forward And there are drugs out there now which from Steves findings are highly beneficial to stop the virus from replicating It is very traumatic I think he told me once that he had lost  or  good friends Week after week youre going to memorials youre going to funerals Thats just daunting Thats a daunting task My feeling was that back in the s when this discovery was made I think Steve took a positive from it I think Steve felt that he himself had contributed to the struggle But I seriously I wouldnt like to comment on what role this aspect of Steves life played on you know the tragic end
