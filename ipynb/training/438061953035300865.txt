Think too much about your life span and you will never get out of bed in the morning Once you do though all the scientific mysteries of the subject may lie panting on the rug at your feet Why should your good old faithful dog avid exerciser nonsmoker nondrinker be condemned to age and die after barely a decade while you remain firmly in your prime  and the neighbors African gray parrot lives loudly on and on Jonathan Silvertown has managed to distill the thousands of years of thought and research behind this and many related biologic questions into a small book so captivating and enlightening that  unusual for a volume packed with difficult scientific concepts  you will read it for pure pleasure even though it provides remarkably few solid answers In other words Mr Silvertown a professor of ecology at Britains Open University will not teach you how to live forever Rather he swoops like a barn swallow life span  years across a terrain encompassing the longlived ponderosa pine  years and the evanescent nematode worm C elegans days to weeks with nods to Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr  years Dylan Thomas  years and Woody Allen still ticking to demonstrate why even though you personally are probably limited to less than a century you are still a particularly lucky conglomeration of organic matter in lifes long mortal parade The puzzle of longevity Mr Silvertown points out is not why we die so soon but rather why we live so long For most of history living creatures were single cells that reproduced by dividing But once evolution produced multicellularity reproduction and survival were separated and hemmed in by new riskbenefit calculations Cell division had to persist for purposes of reproduction and repair but it also had to be controlled for uncontrolled division means cancer a brutal reminder that long life is a precarious achievement The cancer cells of Henrietta Lacks immortalized in laboratories everywhere as well as in Rebecca Skloots bestselling   demonstrate that under the right circumstances mammalian cells can survive more or less forever But the life span of whole beings is inextricably linked to nutrition environment and   all operating under an evolutionary mandate to optimize the species In animals large size roughly correlates with long life How peculiar then and still unexplained that the winner of the longevity sweepstakes is at the moment neither giant whale nor tortoise but a   while a little   can live decades longer than its bigger rodent relatives Birds live longer than similarsize mammals and birds that can fly live longer than ones that cant  eluding predators always helps And yet when researchers play God and impose terrible external disasters on a flask full of fruit flies the survivors live shorter lives than would be expected Is it because they reproduce earlier somehow sensing their jig may soon be up Life span among plants ranges from the flashinthepan annuals with gorgeous blossoms followed by quick demise and the ridiculously longlived conifers that endure for centuries or more But as Mr Silvertown points out most of the essential structural matter composing these massive survivors is actually dead And then there is a scrubby South African tree that may be tens of thousands of years old repeatedly sending up new sprouts from an ancient subterranean root Do those trees count as old even though theyre young From such paradox is the science of mortality created But be honest its the human part of all of this that really interests you  you and generations of financial entrepreneurs some of whom as Mr Silvertown details experienced various costly confusions about the statistics of their enterprise For the record life insurance salespeople should bet on longevity peddlers of annuities just the reverse Modern experts may be clearer on the calculations but many important predictors of human survival have not changed for centuries To live long it helps to have longlived parents and being female doesnt hurt provided childbirth doesnt kill you Otherwise senescence a precise statistical term in lifespan circles describing the increasing likelihood of death is inevitable Granted it is not as immediate as it used to be  over the last two centuries our own species has increased its average life span by nearly a quarter And yet we demand more with various trendy techniques for outliving your neighbors over which Mr Silvertown casts a biologists skeptical eye The new vogue for drastically limiting calorie consumption to increase life span for instance reminds him of nothing so much as a longevity gene in C elegans that apparently works by damping down metabolism creating a dormant worm called the dauer from the German for endure Humans who elect to starve themselves he points out feel perpetually cold are understandably short of energy and have low libido symptoms that have an uncanny resemblance to the dauer state of C elegans Mr Silvertowns narrative ends with the newest elements of modern longevity science   oxidative stress and freeradical dependent repair They are concepts that clarify some details but then obscure others leading much like the circle of life by thcentury savants laid out on the mosaic floor of Westminster Abbey both backward and ahead It is a glorious mysterious cycle Mr Silvertown presents one that demands enthusiastic rereading
