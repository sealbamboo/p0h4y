What could be more wholesome for students than a bag lunch packed at home A lunch from the school cafeteria Researchers found that the typical lunch brought from home contained far fewer vegetables fruit and whole grains than federal nutrition standards advised  An earlier version of this post listed quantities of some food items as daily amounts instead of weekly amounts Lunches served by schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program include  cups of fruit  cups of vegetables  ounces of whole grains and  to  ounces of meat or meat alternatives over the course of a week  They also included too much salt soda and dessert according to a report published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics by researchers who observed  kids at a dozen elementary and middle schools in Houston Since  schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program have had to serve meals that meet the standards set down in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans But theres no such requirement for those who fill the lunch boxes and brown bags that children take to school And in the   you could certainly tell The gaps between the food served at school and the food brought from home were not small  School lunches included  cups of fruit but elementary school students home lunches included only  cups of fruit of which  cups were eaten on average Middleschool students packed  cups of fruit and ate  cups  School lunches served up  cups of vegetables while younger students with home lunches packed a measly  cups of vegetables and ate  cups of them on average The middle schoolers brought a paltry  cups of vegetables and ate  cups  Though students should eat at least  ounces of whole grains during the midday meal home lunches for elementary school kids contained only  ounces of whole grains and those for middleschool students had  ounces on average With so little fruit vegetables and grains in the home lunches what foods did the kids bring from home The amount of meat or meat alternatives was in line with federal guidelines of  to  ounces per day And home lunches went a little overboard on total grains averaging nearly  ounces per day instead of the recommended  to  ounces The elementary school lunches packed at home also included  ounces of sugary drinks  servings of snack chips and  servings of dessert  none of which may be served in cafeterias that follow the National School Lunch Program guidelines Lunches brought by middle schoolers had a little more chips but a little less dessert and sugary drinks on average Dessert was the most popular item in the middleschool lunch bags   of packed desserts were eaten the researchers found The figure exceeded  because some kids got extras from their friends or purchased dessert at the school snack bar Chips were a close second with  of those packed being eaten For elementary school students milk purchased at school was the item most likely to be consumed  of it was Dessert and chips came in second and third with  and  eaten respectively The sodium in home lunches was well in excess of the federal guidelines Though lunches sold in elementary schools cant exceed  milligrams of sodium the meals packed by elementary school students contained  mg of which  were eaten on average Lunches sold in middle schools can have up to  mg of sodium but lunches brought from home by middle schoolers had  mg of sodium all but  of which were eaten Home lunches scored well across the board for saturated fat Federal standards recommend that fewer than  of total calories come from saturated fat Lunches packed for elementary school students delivered  of their calories in the form of saturated fat for middleschool home lunches that figure was  Total calories werent too bad either Elementary school lunches should contain between  and  calories the Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise The home lunches observed in the study averaged  calories but because only  of the food was eaten only  calories actually were consumed Middleschool lunches averaged  calories well within the  to calorie target laid out in the dietary guidelines The home lunches packed for elementary school students were more expensive than the lunches they could have bought at school the researchers reported The total cost of the ingredients in these lunches ranged from  cents to  per meal with an average of  A school lunch would have cost  The cost of middleschool lunches packed at home averaged  less than the  that they would have had to pay to buy lunch at school The researchers said they were surprised to find that overall home lunches brought to lowincome schools cost more than home lunches brought to middleincome schools This is a new finding that warrants more investigation they wrote Now that schools have improved the quality of lunches they serve its time for policymakers to turn their attention to parents and others who pack lunches at home the researchers concluded It is apparent that a large component of the school food environment  foods brought from home  has not been thoroughly investigated and could be a contributing factor to child overweight status they wrote
