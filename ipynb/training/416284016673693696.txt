Cold temps make it all too easy to curl up on the couch and let your gym habit slide but its common knowledge that regular exercise holds the power to lift your spirits  Moving around is helpful to everyones mood says Harvard psychologist Dr John Sharp author of The Emotional Calendar You dont even have to commit to a fullon routine In a study published in Perception and Motor Skills researchers found that even a single exercise session at any intensity can increase positive mood feelings and decrease the negative ones If you live in a wintery clime take advantage of the snowshoeing and ice skating to shake up your exercise routine  Holiday expenses take a bite out of your bank account and fretting about credit card bills can rob anyone of good cheer  Before you start racking up the bills decide if expensive gifts are even necessary A homemade present can mean much more than a pricey package  Dont be afraid of the B word a budget says Sharp It can be a big or a small number Spread it around in a way that can make you happy but dont put yourself in the hole  Tis the season for familial gatherings  and all of the holiday stress and drama they can bring  But guess what Its entirely within your power to decline any stressinducing invites If youd rather not trek to Aunt Lindas house three hours away for a holiday dinner politely say no by saying youre eager to start making new holiday traditions at home And if you just cant avoid sitting next to a relative that drives you crazy take a deep breath before engaging in conversation with her Research from Harvard Medical School shows it decreases tension and anxiety  Chowing down fattening holiday foods you dont normally eat and skipping your usual nutritious fare can leave with no energy says Jane Ehrman a behavioral health specialist at the Cleveland Clinic Make this a rule If youre hitting a party in the evening eat only fruits vegetables and lean protein during the day The antioxidants fiber and protein will fuel your body  and help keep a wellbalanced mind    While some people are running ragged at the holidays  dashing from recital to party to neighborhood caroling  others have a lot of unwanted time on their hands particularly those who dont live near extended family Holidays are oftentimes easier for couples and families and if youre by yourself you may feel alienated this time of year says Ehrman  If youre feeling blue about sitting on the sidelines make a difference by volunteering at a nursing home homeless shelter or hospital  youll be helping yourself as much as others  If seasonal revelry has upped your alcohol consumption then you may notice youre feeling draggier than usual when the alarm clock chimes in the morning  Its not just about hangovers a study published online in the journal Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research found that although booze may help put you to sleep it prevents you from getting high quality rest  If you go to a holiday party with wine being poured its hard to keep track of what youre drinking says Sharp Be clear with yourself Nurse one glass of Pinot Noir as long as possible then switch to water  The holidays are a magical time for kids but the adult realities of bills shopping wrapping presents and meal prep dont instill the same sense of wonder  As a child its about the parties and cookies and presents says Ehrman As the grownup youre responsible for all the background mechanics a kid is never aware of  If you feel the holidays have lost some of their spark try to reconnect with your childhood memories Chat with a sibling about shared experiences or pop in an old home movie to stir up happy memories  People are usually pretty busy all year but the endofyear wrapup can be particularly hectic leaving you frazzled stressed or just plain worn out  People dont always realize the amount of stress they experience this time of year says Ehrman  Not sure if youve got too much on your plate Heres a way to tell If you get excited when something gets canceled youve got too much going on says Ehrman When your plate is too full take something off  Cold weather and treacherous roads provide the perfect excuse to cancel your evening plans and veg out in your jammies  But if youre the type of person who thrives on social stimulation being a homebody could be bumming you out A study of more than  people published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that social isolation puts you at greater risk for mental health problems  Resist the urge to bail on dinner with a friend or skip a favorite group exercise class Pull on your snow boots and forge ahead with activities that put you in contact with other people  Happiness in life really is about expectation management says Sharp If you think every meal present and decoration is going to be absolutely perfect you will always be disappointed  Figure out what works for you and make the right adjustment You cant change the fact that youre going down a river but you can paddle to the left or the right to avoid the big boulder says Sharp That makes a world of difference
