Under severe threat of extinction with plummeting morale and suffering from a loss of funds and high demand  all descriptions of the pressures facing GP surgeries in the UK The BBCs Jenny Cuffe went behind the scenes at two GP practices to find out if things are really that bad Half an hours drive from his surgery in the village of Egton Dr Julian Fester pulls up at a grey stone farmhouse on the top of the North York Moors His patient an elderly man in the last stages of cancer is sitting in an armchair in the lowceilinged kitchen with his wife at his side Although the GP is under pressure to complete his home visits and call in at Whitby hospital before the afternoon surgery he shows no sign of hurry He chats about the farmers blood test results and makes sure he has the right medication to make his last weeks comfortable Dr Fester is one of two GPs serving a population of  spread across a wide area of national parkland  crowded with caravans in summer months and often blocked by snow in winter   Staff at his practice describe him as laidback but nowadays they often catch him looking worried and with good reason   This year the Government announced the phased withdrawal of the minimum practice income guarantee MPIG a sum of money awarded to practices that lost income when the GP contract was drawn up in   Egton which is one of the  most severely affected will lose a quarter of its income  The worst scenario is that we will lose a doctor says Dr Fester  In her office overlooking a field of munching cows his practice manager Alison Williams shows me the accounts Weve been making efficiencies over the last two years because we knew this was coming but there are only so many efficiencies you can make before it starts breaking apart Dr Fester has followed NHS Englands advice in considering partnerships with other GPs in the area but says they are not interested in taking on his deficit He has asked NHS England for support but it had nothing to offer  In an interview for File on  its head of primary care commissioning David Geddes said it is more equitable to redistribute the MPIG money among all practices but he does not rule out giving the hardest hit some extra financial support On a brighter note Egton is part of a consortium of GP practices that has successfully bid for the prime ministers challenge fund a m pot for doctors who will offer longer surgery hours  It will allow Dr Fester to do more of what he is already doing one day a week  On Friday surgery starts at am and I arrive in a thunderstorm to find the first patients already waiting First in the queue is a lorry driver glad that he can see the doctor and pick up his prescription at the practice pharmacy before setting off in the rain with his first load  Dr Fester sees the challenge fund as an exciting opportunity to improve patient services but points out that it is only a oneyear pilot scheme He says he is more worried about keeping his normal ampm going than offering extended hours It is not just rural practices that are under pressure  My next visit is to the Lakes Medical Centre in Salford on the junction of two busy main roads where seven GPs an assistant practitioner a phlebotomist and two practice nurses look after a population of    Out of public view three receptionists are fielding calls from patients anxious to get an appointment as soon as possible but by am all available slots for the day have gone except for a few reserved for urgent cases One caller slams the phone down on being told she will not be able to see her GP for another fortnight  Between patients Dr Jenny Walton describes the way her job has changed in the  or so years she has been practising Patients expect treatment for complaints like colds or flu and they are more demanding  An increasing number of younger people want everything to be done today they are  people she says She also sees older patients with complex needs and conditions such as diabetes which need to be carefully monitored Once patients would come to the doctor three or four times a year but now that frequency has doubled As general practice is funded per patient and not per consultation this has a profound impact on funding  A mother brings her small boy into Dr Waltons consulting room worried that he keeps being sick for no apparent reason  In the minute allotted span for a consultation she gets the reassurance she needs and advice about appropriate medication  On the wall above Dr Waltons desk is a photograph of her four daughters arms linked and smiling faces None of them has followed her professional footsteps and not many of todays medical students are choosing general practice    You used to get at least  applicants for every job but now you are lucky if you get three or four says Dr Walton The senior partner at the Lakes has just turned  another wants to retire earlier than expected because of the stress and she has only three years to go  How we will fill those vacancies Im not too certain Together the problems of recruitment workload pressures and a squeeze on funding create a situation that some doctors leaders have described as a perfect storm   Prof Chris Ham chief executive of the Kings Fund believes that at the heart of it is an historic inequity in NHS funding   GPs are responsible for  of patient contact yet receive less than  of funding   Prof Ham says What is new is that in recent years the small proportion has actually declined relative to what has gone into other NHS services What we are seeing is primary care getting a smaller share of a static cake
