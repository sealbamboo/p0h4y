Most people appreciate a free sample But at the dermatologists office that freebie might come with a hidden cost A new study finds that giving out samples may actually change which drugs a doctor prescribes Stanford University researchers looked at data from a national survey of officebased doctors most of whom distribute samples They found that doctors were more likely to prescribe medications if they also were distributing samples of those drugs The researchers also compared doctors who gave samples to those at Stanford an academic medical facility where samples arent allowed What they found was dramatic Doctors who gave samples were giving patients more frequently prescribed brandname drugs instead of cheaper generics The difference The average cost before insurance for acne prescriptions was more than twice as high for doctors in a nonacademic setting   vs   according to the study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Dermatology That was a powerful finding because acne can generally be treated with less expensive generic drugs said Dr Alfred Lane Professor of Dermatology and of Pediatrics at the Stanford University Medical Center Emeritus and author of the study I think that dermatologists need to realize that when they use samples they are writing prescriptions for more expensive drugs when a less expensive generic may be available he said The number of dermatology prescriptions that were accompanied by a sample in the survey rose to  percent in  from  percent in  In other medical specialties it dropped to  percent from  Dr Steven Woloshin who does research on prescription drugs said the study fits with other research showing samples promote the use of brandname drugs even if the new drugs are not more effective And samples raise other problems because they are less established and not dispensed by a pharmacist who can check for interactions and counsel patients There is much more uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of new drugs Its not just cost its also exposing patients to these risks said Dr Woloshin Professor of Medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice But many dermatologists defend their use of samples Dr Sherry Shieh a dermatologist with a practice in Manhattan and Assistant Clinical Professor at Columbia University and Mt Sinai Hospital uses samples in her private practice and finds them helpful There is such a variable response so I will use samples to try a test and see if everything is OK she said She does not feel that she is influenced by pharmaceutical representatives and the samples they bring Dr Lane has been on both sides of this divide He reports that Stanford stopped giving out samples only in  and it was a difficult process When we were forced to give up samples we didnt do it willingly he said We believed we were benefiting the patients by giving samples But what made the difference for me was after we stopped giving them I started to notice that the drugs that I was prescribing were less expensive than drugs that patients were on when they were referred to me from the outside dermatology community In a related editorial Dr Kenneth Katz and colleagues called for the American Academy of Dermatology and other professional groups to speak out Our specialty should take a strong united stance discouraging physicians from dispensing free drug samples in any form The American Academy of Dermatology said it recommends samples only when in a patients best interest and that more research was needed to determine if they affect the patients longterm health and wellbeing
