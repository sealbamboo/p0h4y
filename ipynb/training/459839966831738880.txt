The search for the most successful way to shed the pounds seems neverending Now researchers in China have looked at what impact gut bacteria have on peoples weight  They think that changing the type of bacteria found in the gut may be more effective at helping people to shed weight than cutting calories alone  But can it really be as simple as that  Experts warn we shouldnt ditch the cucumber sticks and hot yoga just yet  The latest World Health Organization figures show there were more than  billion adults aged  or older who were overweight in   Of these  million men and nearly  million women were obese Those numbers are rising  they have doubled since   but trials with people are only just getting started  In a clinical trial  scientists in Shanghai studied  obese people who started with an average Body Mass Index BMI of  They fed the volunteers supplements that promoted the growth of certain types of bacteria and reduced the levels of other bacteria in the gut alongside a balanced diet  At day nineweek and week intervals participants filled in a questionnaire about what they had eaten in the last  hours and were physically examined after overnight fasting They were also weighed and measured  People in the trial lost on average kg over nine weeks and the  who carried on for  weeks lost on average kg Their average BMI fell to   One morbidly obese patient who was studied as a precursor to the trial lost kg in six months  or about a stone every three weeks The paper says patients levels of the Creactive protein linked to clogged arteries and damage to blood vessels in the heart was also reduced during the trial  But the study notes Admittedly the selfcontrolled nature of this study does not allow to infer that all described effects are due to manipulation of gut microbiota  Prof Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University worked on the study He says higher levels of toxinproducing bacteria such as enterobacteria in the gut can lead to insulin resistance which means people would not feel full after eating one bowl of rice instead needing five  or  bowls to feel full  Their bodies were not telling them they are satisfied he says  Prof Zhao says changing the bacteria could switch on a gene which makes the body burn fat  He says if a person is fed a calorierestricted diet alone their ability to lose weight could be impaired if their gut still contains high levels of the type of bacteria which deactivates the gene that he says switches on fatburning  He adds It is about time to make the public see the kind of scientific evidence we have that really shows we can be confident that gut bacteria have a pivotal role in obesity  But there are doubts about the drivers of the effect  When looking at the evercomplex world of the bugs living inside us and the nuanced way these bacteria interact with our bodies there are concerns about adopting hard and fast rules about what does and does not work  Dr David Weinkove at Durham University said the study was interesting  But he said the study did not show whether or not changing the bacteria in the diet actually caused the weight loss or was just linked to it   Dr Weinkove adds What is interesting is whether the microbes can change your behaviour and that is causing obesity That is a really fascinating area Prof Sir Stephen Bloom at Imperial College London says There are  times more bacteria in the body than cells We are basically trolleys carrying bacteria around so they can be fed He says there is no question that changing the bacteria in peoples bodies can have significant effects For example he says dysentery introduces different bacteria into the gut and causes weight loss Prof Bloom says it is very hard to disentangle what makes people lose weight when they are put on diets as just changing what people eat tends to make them lose weight as they are doing something different from usual He says people in China have different bacteria to those in the UK so it is difficult to compare  His advice is simple Eat less and take more exercise If you eat less you will always lose weight  Dr Alison Tedstone director of diet and obesity at Public Health England says Overall obesity is about eating more calories than we expend There are many things that impact upon our gut bacteria the key one being what we eat  While interesting associations are described in the study there remain issues with the translation of the studies into meaningful advice for the general public She advises people to eat a healthy balanced diet and be active to get to a healthy weight
