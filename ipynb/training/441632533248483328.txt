Every Sunday evening I phone a friend in another college town who has not yet found a cancer support group in her community Lets call her Melanie Melanie had recovered from surgery and completed chemotherapy Physically she had gained strength Yet she continued to feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts  Is it possible to escape the terrifying sandstorms of fear and anxiety she asked after we discussed the inefficacy of her antidepressant Probably not I thought but surely we can find oases of respite and reprieve Melanie had been reading Women Who Think Too Much a title that initially put me off Like Women Who Worry Too Much and Women Who Love Too Much it seemed to blame women for being you guessed it weve heard it before too much But the book by Susan NolenHoeksema offered my friend a number of pragmatic ways to distract herself from recurrent worries and  keep stressful overthinking from spiraling out of control  For men as well as women cancer and its treatments often set off torrents of selfcriticism ruminations about what went wrong recriminations aimed at others obsessive dread of making medical decisions and of incapacities in a tattered present and a fraught future Feelings of worthlessness or worse of being a damaged and damaging burden breed depression From Professor NolenHoeksema my friend had learned some useful strategies to help her interrupt the injurious scenarios repeating in her head   Of course I was positive about efforts to stymie negativity even though I am sometimes wary of the feelgoodinaminute guarantees of alternative approaches So I affirmed all of Melanies efforts and started considering my own alternatives to alternative approaches  which I offer here not to supplant but to supplement the breathing meditation visualization massage and exercise routines in many selfhelp books While cancer proves that we cannot control our bodies my support group continually reminds me we can try to guide our minds and spirits There are surely other ways to come to terms with these storms which are after all part of the human condition For me that week a Sunday night phone conversation with Melanie served as an oasis  To you my darling friend who knows yourself to be Melanie now that you are facing a recurrence and grimmer odds I beg in this embarrassingly public forum what I entreat privately Please find a way to tarry among us May my lame list exasperate you sufficiently to come up with more havens And lets talk again    and then again
