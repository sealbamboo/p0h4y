There is a chance the Aids epidemic can be brought under control by  according to a report by the United Nations Aids agency  It said the number of new HIV infections and deaths from Aids were both falling  However it called for far more international effort as the current pace cannot end the epidemic And charity Medecins Sans Frontieres warned most of those in need of HIV drugs still had no access to them The report showed that  million people around the world were living with HIV  There were  million new cases in    less than the  million figure in  Aidsrelated deaths have fallen by a fifth in the past three years standing at  million a year South Africa and Ethiopia have particularly improved Many factors contribute to the improving picture including increased access to drugs There has even been a doubling in the number of men opting for circumcision to reduce the risk of contracting HIV While some things are improving the picture is far from rosy Fewer than four in  people with HIV are getting lifesaving antiretroviral therapy  And just  countries account for threequarters of all new HIV infections  The report said There have been more achievements in the past five years than in the preceding  years  There is evidence about what works and where the obstacles remain more than ever before there is hope that ending Aids is possible  However a businessasusual approach or simply sustaining the Aids response at its current pace cannot end the epidemic Michel Sidibe the executive director of UNAids added If we accelerate all HIV scaleup by  we will be on track to end the epidemic by  if not we risk significantly increasing the time it would take  adding a decade if not more   Drugs have been a miracle in reducing deaths from Aids  Normally it    acquired immune deficiency syndrome  to develop Opportunistic infections that a healthy immune system could fight off then become deadly But patients taking antiretroviral drugs can keep their HIV infection under control and have a nearnormal life expectancy The tools are there but too often they are beyond the reach of people who need them  Some  of people living with HIV do not know they are infected and  are not getting antiretroviral therapy  Diagnosing and treating the missing millions  often in subSaharan Africa  would significantly reduce the  million Aidsrelated deaths each year  Dr Jennifer Cohn the medical director for Medecins Sans Frontieres access campaign said Providing lifesaving HIV treatment to nearly  million people in the developing world is a significant achievement but more than half of people in need still do not have access In Nigeria  of people do not have access to treatment Dr Cohn added We need to make sure noone is left behind  and yet in many of the countries where MSF works were seeing low rates of treatment coverage especially in areas of low HIV prevalence and areas of conflict  In some countries people are being started on treatment too late to save their lives and pregnant women arent getting the early support they need Marcus Low from South African campaign group Treatment Action Campaign told the BBCs Focus on Africa programme It is still a crisis in South Africa  we still have about  new infections every day On the treatment side we have done well and people are living longer  But we must do more to prevent new infections
