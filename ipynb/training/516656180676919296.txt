As schools cut down on physical education and recess kids are spending more time than ever in a desk And while nerdy secondgraders like me didnt ever consider arguing for more gym theres increasing evidence that being active helps not just childrens waistlines but their brains If you consider the anthropology of humankind we were designed to move   a professor of kinesiology at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign tells Shots Hillman and colleagues have added more evidence as to how activity helps kids His   published Monday in   shows  to yearold children who run around and play like well children for at least  minutes a day show improved thinking skills particularly in multitasking compared to children who arent as active The researchers looked at a ninemonth afterschool program called Fitness Improves Thinking in Kids FITKids at the University of Illinois The  students met after school nearly every day for a snack and a quick lesson on fitness and nutrition Most importantly the children spent  minutes running around and playing tag soccer jump rope and other games The focus was not on competition but playing like kids normally do Kids tend to move and get their exercise intermittently says Hillman They dont go out and run four miles like an adult might In one multitasking test children were shown a character on the screen and indicated with a thumb press whether the character was a certain color and a certain shape The kids who had participated in FITKids were significantly faster and more accurate at identifying the color and shape than children who werent exercising Scans of the FITKids childrens brains showed increased brain activity during the task in a network known to correspond to paying attention Interestingly the changes in brain activity correlated to the amount of time kids spent in FITKids The more times they attended the greater the change The researchers also looked at the childrens ability to selectively focus attention and resist distraction but did not find as strong an association with physical activity Hillman says the significant effects resulted from only small changes to the kids activity Were not taking them from lowfit to highfit he says Were taking them from lowfit to slightlyless lowfit In fact the overall change in fitness was only about  percent Other scientists say this is yet more evidence that physical activity improves school performance It might actually help says   a professor of pediatrics at Georgia Regents University I think that parents need to go to the educators and say Why is my child sitting down for six hours a day when hes a yearold boy and he needs to move
