Dr Beth Zeeman says she can spot a case of influenza from  paces Its not like a common cold People think theyve had the flu when theyve had colds Zeeman an emergency room specialist at   in Framingham Mass tells Shots People use the word flu for everything But having   is really a different thing It hits you like a ton of bricks Joachim Santos a carpenter from Brazil in a nearby examining room says hes never been as sick in all his  years I worry that its going to get more serious and I could die he says The other day Zeeman treated a strapping yearold man who also thought he was going to die Dr   an infectious disease specialist at the University of Utah says flu has certain hallmarks A classic case of flu starts off suddenly with high fever maybe shaking chills severe muscle and body aches he says Its not uncommon for people to say their hair hurts they hurt so badly But not everybody whos getting sick this winter has the flu Pavia says the nations getting hit by a triple whammy of respiratory viruses right now One of them is called   Theres a great deal of RSV circulating right now Pavia says RSV causes pretty severe respiratory disease in children particularly younger children under about  Its pretty common for them to be hospitalized with wheezing and shortness of breath And then theres the   Although it has influenza in its name its a different bug altogether It most commonly causes croup  that kind of barky cough that children get Pavia says But in adults it can cause laryngitis and a prolonged cough But good old flu  or rather three different strains now circulating across the nation  is the first among equals when it comes to respiratory miseries Flu reliably kills people every year Pavia says It kills healthy people as well as the very young the very old and debilitated people So I still treat flu with the greatest degree of respect Theres a fourth virus also making some Americans sick  the nasty norovirus Some people call it stomach flu but it really doesnt have anything to do with the flu Its specialty is intestinal causing nonstop diarrhea and what doctors vividly call projectile vomiting That can quickly lead to a dangerous level of dehydration Norovirus is also notorious among medical people for being hard to get rid of It requires cleaning cleaning and cleaning again in order to remove norovirus from environmental surfaces Pavia says By comparison the influenza virus is a pushover environmentally speaking It doesnt survive very well in soft environments like tissues Pavia says But it can last up to  hours on hard surfaces like counters under ideal conditions That means you probably can pick up flu viruses from touching doorknobs or sink faucets or using a keyboard that somebody with contaminated fingers just typed on But most likely flu is passed on by shaking hands with somebody whos infected  and may or may not be showing symptoms yet  or by being coughed or sneezed on Thats why public health people keep harping on coughing or sneezing into your sleeve to avoid spraying virus on people nearby And washing your hands often silently singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice through to make sure youre doing a good job Those things do work And if they dont pay attention to the kind of symptoms you get when you get sick If youre having chills that are so bad that your teeth are chattering and the chair is shaking under you youre pretty sick Pavia says And if its not flu its probably a serious bacterial infection And its a pretty good indication you should see a doctor But in January  Pavia says if youve got those symptoms theres an  percent chance youve got the flu
