Fresh research adds weight to the notion that certain foods think empty carbs like bagels and sweet treats can lead to more intense hunger and overeating Fastdigesting carbohydrates can stimulate regions of the brain involved in cravings and addiction   published in the   Prior studies have shown that highly desirable foods perhaps a cheesecake or pie can trigger pleasure centers in the brain But whats new about this research is that it shows that even when people are unaware of what theyre eating the intake of fastdigesting carbs can activate parts of the brain associated with pleasure reward and addiction To evaluate this   director of the obesity prevention center at Boston Childrens Hospital and his colleagues conducted brain scans in  overweight men after they consumed two different kinds of test milkshakes Both milkshakes had the same number of calories and similar ingredients but one contained more fastdigesting carbs and the other was made of slowerdigesting carbohydrates The   here is that socalled highglycemic index foods such as sugar and highly processed breads move through the body faster than lowglycemic index foods such as fruit and whole grains After the participants drank the rapidly digesting carb shake their blood sugar spiked and then crashed four hours later And its at this point that researchers documented activation of a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens a small area that is involved in emotions and addiction Ludwig told The Salt The scans showed intense activation in brain regions involved in addictive behavior The idea that certain foods may be addictive is controversial Some scientists think its overstating the matter And clearly its not settled as to whether activity in these brain regions would be seen widely in the population or perhaps only among those who are overweight or prone to overeating As   a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco points out this research cant tell us if theres a cause and effect relationship between eating certain foods and triggering brain responses or if those responses lead to overeating and obesity The study doesnt tell you if this is the reason they got obese says Lustig or if this is what happens once youre already obese Nonetheless Lustig told The Salt that he thinks this study offers another bit of evidence that this phenomenon is real He has been a leading voice in suggesting that  is the cause of obesity and other health problems Increasingly the concept of food addiction is gaining attention from researchers Theres a body of work exploring the connection says   a neuroscientist at the University of Florida who studies food and the brain This study she says adds to the growing literature that suggests that highsugar foods can affect the brain in ways that can alter reward processing and potentially fuel overeating
