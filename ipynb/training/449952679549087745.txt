All throughout the country supporters of the Affordable Care Act have worked to reach the uninsured holding health fairs and putting ads on TV and radio The push continues to get as many enrolled as possible especially Latinos  the most uninsured group in the country Illinois has taken its show on the road with its Road  Coverage statewide mobile tour In Chicago Jose Munoz points to Road  Coverages huge RV plastered with the Illinois marketplace slogan  Get Covered Illinois  parked outside the field house at Humboldt Park The neighborhood is home to many Latinos What we are doing is going statewide with this RV meeting people in the community telling them about Get Covered Illinois Munoz says Inside the field house a big crowd listens intently as officials explain the ins and outs of the Affordable Care Act About  percent of Latinos in the US are uninsured and more than  million  citizens and legal residents  are eligible for insurance under Obamacare During this session navigators are on hand to help people enroll I think this is one of the best things the Obama administration has done says Marixa Vidal who signed up earlier I myself thank the Obama administration because I am a cancer survivor and insurance would not take me  even where I work  would not take me because of my preexisting condition There are lots of Latinos who agree with Vidal but Mark Hugo Lopez with the Pew Research Center says a recent poll shows just as many dont Fortyseven percent said that they approved of the Affordable Care Act but  percent said they disapproved Lopez says Whats interesting about this is that this is a change from September of  when  percent of Latinos approved of the law Other polls show declines too although not as deep Some Latino advocates say many still have questions about how to sign up and theres been too much emphasis on technology as opposed to persontoperson contact That personal approach is the idea at the networking party for the Little Village Chamber of Commerce which represents a business and mostly MexicanAmerican residential area in Chicagos West Side Although theres plenty of support for Obamacare among those attending accountant Jeorge Barajas says theres a reason why it may be waning among Latinos I think its a lot of the negative media that Obamacare has gotten Barajas says Some of it has been deserved because of the initial problems they had with the website but at the same token a lot of it is just a political attack on Obama Theres been no law more polarizing than the Affordable Care Act during the Obama presidency House Republicans have voted to repeal all or part of it more than  times and while that might not sit too well with Latinos who predominantly vote Democratic Carlos Pena says theres more to it than botched websites and negative attacks The decline in support is something thats not only related to Obamacare itself but also to immigration law and the recent deportation the excessive deportation says Pena who works for a local small business lender Undocumented immigrants arent eligible for insurance under the Affordable Care Act but Obamas deportation of nearly  million of them during his presidency may have soured many Latinos opinion of him Earlier this month the president spoke during a town hall meeting partially sponsored by the Telemundo and Univision networks Obama said he cant ignore laws on the books but supports comprehensive immigration reform and needs Congress to act He also had a message for people leery about enrolling if they have family members who are not legal residents For everybody out there who is in a mixed family there is no sharing of the data from the health care plan into immigration services he said You should feel confident that if somebody in your family is eligible you should sign them up Mayra Alvarez head of the federal governments Office of Minority Health says despite the presidents assurance she expects naysayers will continue to push back against enrollment efforts I think the most convincing argument is seeing other families that might be in similar situations having gone through this process and ended up on the other end with quality affordable health insurance Alvarez says Its an argument that Alvarez hopes will turn around any decline in Latino support for Obamacare Meanwhile anyone who started the process of enrolling but wont be finished by Mondays deadline will get a reprieve Under a grace period announced by the White House theyll have at least until midApril to finish the paperwork
