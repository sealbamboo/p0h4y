When the Affordable Care Act was working its way through Congress Gary Lauer was nervous Part of the bill sounded grim It said people could buy required health coverage online but only through websites run by state and federal governments That was going to pretty much delete us from the landscape he says Thats because his company   is the countrys biggest online health insurance broker If he could work with the government the new requirement for Americans to buy health insurance sounded great And subsidies would help lowerincome people afford the product he sells Were facing a market here thats easily gonna double if not triple in size Lauer says So Lauer made dozens of flights between Silicon Valley and Washington DC lobbying for access to the new market This summer he got it The federal government agreed to allow eHealth and five other online brokers to sell plans in the new subsidized marketplaces The White Houses point person for signing up as many people as possible for health coverage   says the government is going to need help Its one more avenue for individuals to access coverage to health insurance Agents and brokers do a tremendous amount of work so to that extent theyre valued partners and we want to work with them she says Lauer is happy to be a partner But theres a new rub Hes also   with the federal government which is running online health insurance markets   And hes at a disadvantage For starters the company has yet to sell a single policy on the new marketplaces since they dont open until Oct  Second insurance companies pay eHealth a commission for each policy it sells as a result of listings on its website The federal governments websites wont charge insurers this commission  an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets in New York says he thinks insurance companies are going to keep paying eHealth to market their products even if they can get the same service free of charge from the federal government The insurance companies view eHealth as an effective vehicle for distribution he says Thats why theyre willing to pay the commission Nobody really knows if the federal exchange on its own will be as effective as eHealth Insurance companies need customers and want as many young and healthy ones as they can get Halper says health insurance is a complicated product to sell People dont go online shopping for it for fun like they do for shoes or cars or new TVs and eHealth has expertise in taking customers all the way from window shopping to closing a sale Only around  or  percent of applicants actually complete the process eHealthInsurance can help Thats the value Lauer says The company has spent over  million cultivating its online marketplace since  and investing in customer service Carrie McClean manages the companys call center outside Sacramento Calif Video screens mounted on walls periodically display a countdown of the number of days until Obamacare enrollment opens Oct  and her people are preparing There are certifications that they need to take for the federal exchange and things like that So thats what were planning and getting ready for right now she says Lauer thinks his company will be ready This is new for government Government is going into the ecommerce business its as simple as that he says But ecommerce is not simple Its very complex its very fastmoving Consumers are very aware and theyre very demanding He says  percent of eHealths traffic now comes through mobile devices And it works very hard at staying at the top of Internet search engine results Market analyst Halper says eHealths success or failure hangs on whether the federal health care law will work as advertised and actually create millions of new customers for the insurance industry Im not betting on anybody Halper says The problem with trying to forecast the outcome is that you really dont know how many people are actually going to buy insurance in  The White House has set a goal of enrolling  million Americans in the new health coverage for next year And thats contingent on a complicated mix of politics technology and market behavior all going its way
