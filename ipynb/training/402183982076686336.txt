As I walk to the door of my patients house on a dirt road outside Tuscaloosa Ala I step gingerly Mrs Edgars says that she killed a rattlesnake in her flower bed last year She is at the door expecting my visit Mr Edgars sits on the couch unable to recall that I am his doctor or even that I am a doctor But he is happy to see me nonetheless We chat a moment then we move on to Mr Edgars arthritis Early on in his dementia he wandered the woods His wife was afraid he would get lost and die although the family agreed that this was how he would want it Now his knee arthritis has worsened enough that it has curtailed his wanderings I suspect that Mrs Edgars is cutting back on his pain medicine to decrease the chance hell wander off again We talk about how anxious he grows whenever shes out of his sight and how one of his children comes to sit with him so that she can run errands I leave carrying her parting gift a jar of homegrown pickled okra Back at the office I turn on the computer to write a note in the electronic health record or EHR In addition to recording the details of our visit I must meet the new federal criteria for meaningful use that have been adopted by my office with threats that I wont get paid for my work if I dont Under history I enter knee pain Up pops a checkbox menu injuryrelated surely the chronic wear on Mr Edgars knees as a farmer is an injury but I dont think thats what the programmer had in mind worsening factors none apply as he couldnt give his own history relieving factors theres no check box for a sleepdeprived wife whos purposely keeping the dose of acetaminophen low and so on Nothing fits so I exit and type in followup It cedes a blank screen I type the Edgars story in my own words so different from the computerspeak generated by the check boxes Then I move on to the review of systemsanother popup menu I used to write patient is an unreliable historian for this section but the computer doesnt understand that this applies to the entire review Using a template it generates  phrases one for each body system that says Positive Other unreliable historian Sometimes I wonder if it is disrespectful to a patient to say  times in one progress note how unreliable a historian he is but I remember that this is great data to mine for research so I plug on Next is the physical exam The check boxes ask if the person is oriented to person place and time Mr Edgars is oriented to person and place he knows his wife and home and he is happy nowhere else He no longer cares what year it is There isnt a check box for that At days end I review my meaningful use I spent more time checking boxes than talking to patients and their families There arent enough physicians to see all the homebound patients in my area so I try to visit as many as I can safely care for I could see twice as many patients if I could write their notes at the bedside while visiting with them I would happily do this using paper or an EHR that took the same amount of time but these are not options I spend more time talking to the information technology team than I do answering messages from patients As a teaching doctor my feedback to the residents now consists mainly of explaining how to document their visits so that we will all get paid instead of teaching them how to take care of elders in their homes I look at my pickled okra and I think of the patients and their families And I know where my meaningful use lies
