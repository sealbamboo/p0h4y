A year and a half ago Ruth London lay in intensive care in a hospital in Boca Raton Fla with severe pneumonia delirious and hallucinating that she was in jail With the permission of a doctor on the unit Ernest London  cooked up a plan He would bring the family dog Delilah a fluffy white Maltese to see if the pet could calm his wife down At the entrance of the hospital Mr London was met by volunteers who stopped him cold No dogs from home are allowed they told him  But a call to the doctor was made and eventually Mr London and Delilah were allowed to go upstairs In the hospital room the dog ran to Mrs Londons side and nuzzled her hand She stirred from her delirium just a little bit Mr London recalled and began to remember where she was It was a turning point he said From that point on she seemed to take a turn for the better I love that dog I love her so much said Mrs London now  It was a onetime deal after a hurried meeting hospital staff members decided they wouldnt allow Delilah to come again nor would they let other family members bring family pets to see other patients Mr London said Thats the policy at most hospitals across the country   But a few medical institutions have taken a different approach and thrown open their doors to patients own dogs and cats letting them visit along with spouses children and friends  Lots of hospitals have   using trained dogs but thats a different matter   The University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore lets family pets visit their owners so long as certain requirements are met as does the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics in Iowa City Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center in Richmond Rush University Medical Center in Chicago two hospitals associated with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn and more than a dozen other medical centers  On Long Island North Shore University Hospital allows personal pets to stay with patients around the clock in its bed palliative care unit as does Hospice Inn a freestanding bed hospice facility thats part of      Policies vary at the institutions that allow visits by patients pets but many share some of the same requirements  A doctors order allowing the family pet to visit is typically necessary as is an attestation from a veterinarian that the animal is healthy and up to date on all its shots  Most institutions require that dogs  the most common visitors by far  be groomed within a day or so of a visit and on a leash when they walk through hospital corridors Cats must be taken in and out of the institution in a carrier   If a dog or cat wants to get up on a patients bed a covering is laid down first If an animal seems agitated or distressed when it comes into the hospital staff members who meet the family and escort them to the patients room have the right to turn it away If the patient shares a room with someone that person must agree before a pet may visit  We have not had any problems said the Rev Susan Roy director of pastoral care services at the    whose your pet can visit policy has been in place since  If anything she said the visits can be hard on dogs who often respond viscerally to an owners illness and may take a day or two to recover from a visit  spent three years studying the issue before its new pet visitation policy went into effect in February Diane Gallagher the hospitals associate vice president of nursing operations described some of the questions  Would animals transmit infections to patients or vice versa What were the liability issues  Could allowing pets to visit interfere with patient care  if for instance a family dog became alarmed and protective of the sick person when a doctor a nurse or a technician came into the room  In the end officials decided that the benefits  comfort and reduced stress for patients  were more substantial than the risks   Although   that hospital therapy dogs can pick up germs and potentially transmit bacteria that can cause dangerous infections those animals typically wander from room to room while peoples own pets are expected to stay with the patient they are visiting If someone has an open wound or an active infection a visit from a family pet is discouraged according to most hospital policies Research on the value of personal pets visiting patients in the hospital hasnt been done One   of  healthy dog owners by researchers at   found that both unfamiliar and familiar dogs provoked similar reactions a relaxation response and reduction in blood pressure and levels of cortisol a stressrelated hormone according to Dr Sandra Barker director of the center and a professor of psychiatry    But personal anecdotes abound Anne Mahler  a clinical nurse specialist at   the largest provider of elder care services in the Boston area remembers how depressed her elderly father was after breaking a hip and trying to recover in a rehabilitation facility That institution wouldnt allow his beloved dog Molly a springer spaniel to come to his room but a visit was arranged in a back room off the lobby    My dad sat there sobbing Ms Mahler said Afterwards the older man began eating more regularly his attitude lightened and he seemed determined to do everything possible to return home to join Molly More than  seniors live on the longterm care unit at Hebrew SeniorLifes Roslindale campus and staff members strongly encourage pet visits Ms Mahler said Harry Grandis fought off bladder cancer for seven years before finally succumbing to the illness last October at the age of  The final year of his life he was hospitalized five times at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and during two of those stays had regular visits from Minnie his beloved Yorkshire Terrier   Minnie would come into Harrys room and his eyes would light up said Ann Grandis his widow It was like bringing home to him It just made such a difference   Harry returned home to die and on the last day of his life Minnie lay in bed at his side until close to the end Now its Ann who relies on Minnie and would want her there if anything untoward were to happen  I would be lost without her Ms Grandi  said Shes family
