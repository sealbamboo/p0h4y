Last year New Yorks first documented heatrelated death occurred on July  after   The victim was a yearold man on Staten Island The summer before a recordbreaking eightday heat wave killed four people three of them with health problems Experts say these deaths can nearly always be averted by taking some simple precautions Summer heat waves are becoming more frequent and increasingly intense They put both young and old the physically active and the sedentary at risk of a heatrelated illness and death New York is among cities that have taken steps to mitigate the risk by planting trees making surfaces like roofs more reflective and opening airconditioned centers where people can go to cool off Former Mayor Michael R Bloombergs   is amazingly two years ahead of schedule with  the expected completion date Prevention starts with preparation While being properly hydrated is always important in summer heat it can be lifesaving The bigger you are the more time you spend outdoors and the more intensely you exercise the more you should drink Dont rely on thirst to tell you how much A liter or two of water is needed to replace that lost through sweat and respiration beyond that amount some salt may be needed especially for those exerting themselves Normally salted food is adequate but if you sweat heavily or exercise in the heat for prolonged periods consider a sports drink diluted by half with water because most commercial sports drinks contain more salt than is necessary Do not take salt tablets Before engaging in vigorous activity in hot weather give yourself a week or more to become acclimated Start with moderate exercise for short periods then build up slowly over eight to  days to more strenuous or prolonged activity Heat illness is a   with the highest rate among football players according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Preseason football practice typically starts during the hottest most humid summer days when players are least physically fit and most prone to collapse Although the National Athletic Trainers Association has   and the gear to be used coaches often neglect to follow them Any player who becomes confused disoriented or unsteady should be removed immediately from practice to a cooler environment fanned rehydrated and doused with or immersed in cool water Remove the athletes clothing or soak it with water which conducts heat away from the body much more effectively than air If the players core temperature the most accurate measurement is rectal rises to  degrees or higher its considered a medical emergency Call  and immerse the player in ice water while waiting for an ambulance   by the trainers association which emphasize Cool first transport second A body temperature of  degrees for more than  minutes can be fatal noted Douglas Casa director of athletic training at the University of Connecticut When rectal temperature drops to  cut back on cooling to keep the person from shivering which will produce more heat but keep monitoring body temperature While the player is being cooled vigorously massage the arms and legs to propel cooled blood back to the bodys core where heat causes the worst damage Even if a heatexhausted player recovers quickly he should not return to vigorous activity that day A player may say I feel better now but that doesnt mean its safe to go back in the game said Dr Christopher B Colwell the director of emergency medicine at Denver Health Medical Center The way someone feels doesnt necessarily reflect the bodys core temperature which could still be seriously elevated People who work in hot environments can also experience heat illness   than other workers Others at risk include those who work outdoors road crews and construction workers for example firefighters and workers in bakeries boiler rooms factories and mines Workers at greatest risk include people ages  and older and those who are overweight or have heart disease or high blood pressure or take medications like beta blockers that reduce sweating and raise heat sensitivity The CDC   that workers in hot environments wear lightcolored breathable clothing schedule heavy work for the coolest parts of the day take frequent breaks in the shade or a cool area drink water often and avoid drinks with caffeine alcohol or lots of sugar Special attention to the elderly physically handicapped and people with chronic physical or mental illness is critical when air temperatures soar Dr Colwell urges relatives friends or neighbors to check in with such people daily Elderly persons with cognitive issues may be unable to accurately report symptoms over the phone so twiceaday visits may be necessary to check for signs of heat exhaustion and assure that they are drinking plenty of cool beverages Frequent showers or tepid baths can help keep body temperature normal but an older or handicapped person may need assistance to do this safely It need not be very hot for the elderly or chronically ill to succumb Dr Colwell said If their homes lack airconditioning he suggests installing fans and if they are unable to go out on their own taking them to a movie theater indoor mall supermarket public library or cooling center in midday But if their home is cool they are best off staying in indoors on hot days and avoiding exertion
