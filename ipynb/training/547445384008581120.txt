Our brains are adapting to touchscreen smartphone technology say researchers who have carried out a study on human volunteers  The scientists used something called electroencephalography EEG to measure brain activity  They found distinct differences between smartphone users and people who used conventional cellphones Smartphone users had more attuned fingers and thumbs based on their EEG readings  Of the  volunteers  were touchscreen smartphone users while  used oldfashioned mobile phones  The EEG readings looked at the electrical messages sent back and forth between the brain and the hands via nerves Multiple electrodes placed on the volunteers scalp recorded these exchanges about sensation From this the researchers were able to build up a picture or map of how much brain tissue is devoted to a given body region  The results revealed discernable differences between touchscreen smartphone users and people with conventional cellphones  Smartphone users had bigger EEG brain activity measurements in response to mechanical touch on the thumb index and middle fingers  And this appeared to be linked to how often they used their touchscreens  the more frequent the greater the EEG response The researchers say their findings published in the journal Current Biology make sense given that the brain is malleable and can be moulded by experience  For example in violinists the brain area representing the fingers that play the instrument is larger than in nonmusicians  The researchers suspect the same is true with smartphones  repeated use sculpts the brain  Study author Arko Ghosh from the Institute of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich said I was really surprised by the scale of the changes introduced by the use of smartphones He said the discovery underlines how commonplace smartphones have become in our daily lives
