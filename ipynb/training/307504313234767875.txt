My father sister and I sat in the nearempty Chinese restaurant picking at our plates unable to avoid the question that wed gathered to discuss When was it time to let Mom die It had been a grueling day at the hospital watching  praying  for any sign that my mother would emerge from her coma Three days earlier shed been admitted for nausea she had a nasty cough and was having trouble keeping food down But while a nurse tried to insert a nasogastric tube her heart stopped She required CPR for nine minutes Even before I flew into town a ventilator was breathing for her and intravenous medication was keeping her blood pressure steady Hour after hour my father my sister and I tried talking to her playing her favorite songs encouraging her to squeeze our hands or open her eyes Doctors couldnt tell us exactly what had gone wrong but the prognosis was grim and they suggested that we consider removing her from the breathing machine And so that January evening we drove to a nearby restaurant in suburban Detroit for an inevitable family meeting My father and sister looked to me for my thoughts In our family after all Im the goto guy for all things medical Ive been   for  years at the     and now ProPublica And since I have a relatively good grasp on Americas complex health care system I was the one to help my parents sign up for their Medicare drug plans research new diagnoses and question doctors about their recommended treatments In this situation like so many before I was expected to have some answers Yet none of my years of reporting had prepared me for this moment this decision In fact I began to question some of my assumptions about the health care system Ive long observed and sometimes chronicled the nasty policy battles surrounding endoflife care And like many health journalists I rolled my eyes   used to describe a  congressional proposal that would have allowed Medicare to reimburse physicians who provided counseling to patients about living wills and advance directives The frenzy whipped up by conservative politicians and talk show hosts forced the authors of the Affordable Care Act to strip out that provision before the bill became law Politics aside Ive always thought that the high cost of endoflife care is an issue worthy of discussion About a quarter of Medicare payments are spent in the last year of life   And the degree of care provided to patients in that last year  how many doctors they see the number of intensivecare hospitalizations  varies dramatically across states and even within states according to the   Studies show that this care is often futile It doesnt always prolong lives and it doesnt always reflect what patients want In an   I wrote for the   in  I quoted a doctor saying Theres always one more treatment theres always one more Why dont we try that  But we have to realize what the goals of that patient are which is not to be in an intensivecare unit attached to tubes with no chance of really recovering That made a lot of sense at the time But did it apply to my mom We knew her endoflife wishes She had told my dad that she didnt want to be artificially kept alive if she had no real chance of a meaningful recovery But what was a real chance What was a meaningful recovery How did we know if the doctors and nurses were right In all my reporting Id never realized how little the costs to the broader health care system matter to the family of a patient When that patient was my mother what mattered was that we had to live with whatever decision we made And we wouldnt get a chance to make it twice As my mom lay in the ICU there was no question that her brain function was worrisome In the hours after she was revived she had convulsions known as   which can happen if the brain lacks oxygen After that she lay still When the neurologist pricked her with a safety pin she didnt respond When he touched her corneas they didnt reflexively move I began checking the medical literature much like I do as a reporter I didnt find anything encouraging Studies show that after  hours in a coma caused by a lack of oxygen a patients odds of recovery are slim to none I asked my writing partner in New York to do additional research She too found nothing that would offer much hope But couldnt my mom beat the odds Harriet Ornstein was a feisty woman At age  she had overcome adversity many times before In  weeks before my wedding she was mugged in a parking lot and knocked to the pavement with a broken nose But she was there to walk me down the aisle  black eyes covered by makeup She had Parkinsons disease for a decade and in  she suffered a closed head injury when a car backed into her as she walked down a handicapped ramp at the drugstore Mom persevered continuing rehabilitation and working to lead as normal a life as possible Might she not fight through this as well Truth be told I was already somewhat skeptical about physician predictions Just last summer my dads heart stopped and it took more than  minutes of CPR to revive him Doctors and nurses said a full neurological recovery was unlikely They asked about his endoflife choices Mom and I stayed up late talking about life without him and discussing the logistics of his funeral But despite it all he rebounded He was home within weeks back to his old self I came away appreciative of the power of modern medicine but questioning why everyone had been so confident that he would die Also weighing on me was   I wrote for the   about a patient who had wrongly been declared braindead by two doctors The patients family was being urged to discontinue life support and allow an organdonation team to come in But a nursing supervisors examination found that the yearold man displayed a strong gagandcough reflex and slightly moved his head all inconsistent with brain death A neurosurgeon confirmed her findings No one was suggesting that my mom was braindead but the medical assessments offered no hint of encouragement What if they were off base too Over dinner at the Chinese restaurant we made a pact We wouldnt rush to a decision We would seek an additional medical opinion But if the tests looked bad  I would ask to read the actual clinical reports  we would discontinue aggressive care A neurologist recommended by a family acquaintance came in the next morning After conducting a thorough exam this doctor wasnt optimistic either but she said two additional tests could be done if we still had doubts If more tests could be done my dad reasoned we should do them My sister and I agreed On Friday morning the final test came back It was bad news In a sterile hospital conference room a neurologist laid out our options We could move my mom to the hospice unit and have breathing and feeding tubes inserted Or we could disconnect the ventilator We decided it was time to honor my moms wishes We cried as nurses unhooked her that afternoon The hospital staff said it was unlikely that she would breathe on her own but she did for several hours She died peacefully on her own terms late that night  my dad my sister and I by her side I dont think anyone can ever feel comfortable about such a decision and being a health reporter compounded my doubts I was fairly confident that we did what my mom would have wanted But a week later when I was back in New York and had some emotional distance I wondered how our thinking and behavior squared with what Id written as a reporter Did we waste resources while trying to decide what to do for those two extra days If every family did what we did two days multiplied by thousands of patients would add up to millions of dollars Curious how experts would view it I called Elliott S Fisher Ive long respected Fisher a professor of medicine at Dartmouth and a leader of the Dartmouth Atlas The Atlas was the first to identify McAllen Texas subject of a   in the   by Atul Gawande for its seemingly outofcontrol Medicare spending I asked Fisher Did he consider what my family did a waste of money No he said And he wouldnt have found fault with us if we decided to keep my mom on a ventilator for another week or two although he said my description of her neurological exams and test results sounded pessimistic You never need to rush the decisionmaking he told me It should always be about making the right decision for the patient and the family  We have plenty of money in the US health care system to make sure that were supporting families in coming to a decision that they can all feel good about I feel very strongly about that Plenty of money How did this mesh with his view that too much money is spent on care at the end of life He said his concern is more about situations in which endoflife wishes arent known and cases where doctors push treatments for terminal illnesses that are clearly futile and that may prolong suffering I dont think the best care possible always means keeping people alive or always doing the most aggressive cancer chemotherapy he said when the evidence would say there is virtually no chance for this particular agent to make a difference for this patient I left the conversation agreeing with Fishers reasoning but believing that its much harder in practice than it is in theory You can know somebodys wishes and still be confused about the appropriate thing to do The past few weeks have been the most difficult of my life I hope what I learned will make me a better more compassionate journalist Most of all I will always remember that behind the debate about costs and endoflife care there are real families struggling with real decisions
