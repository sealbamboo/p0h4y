It is almost inevitable that your blood will take the first steps towards leukaemia as you age researchers show The cancer is often associated with children but some types become more common with age The study published in the journal Cell Reports showed  of healthy people in their s had genetic errors that could lead to leukaemia  The researchers warn that the number of cases could soar as life expectancy increases The team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute outside Cambridge analysed the blood of  people They focused on accurately testing for errors in the DNA that are linked to the blood cancers If one blood cell in a hundred carried such a mutation they would pick it up The results were a surprise  They suggest  of people in their s have potentially cancerous mutations rising to  in people in their s One of the researchers Dr George Vassiliou told the BBC News website We had suspected people had these mutations but didnt expect they would be an almost inevitable consequence of ageing What it is saying is that a lot more people than expected are starting on the path to leukaemia but thankfully only a few make it to the end While progression to leukaemia is currently rare the scientists believe it could become more common as life expectancy increases Dr Vassiliou added There is one warning for the future if there was a significant extension of life expectancy then there could be a significant increase in leukaemia  We dont know what percentage of people would go on to develop leukaemia it might be one in  or even one in  or more and that would have a dramatic impact One in three girls and one in four boys born today   Stem cells in the bone marrow manufacture blood It takes multiple mutations to transform one from a normal cell into a cancerous one  With enough mutations it can dominate the production of blood either producing defective blood cells or one just one type to the exclusion of others  The researchers believe that searching the blood for such mutations may identify people at high risk of developing leukaemia who may in the future be targeted with preventative therapies  Dr Kat Arney from Cancer Research UK said We know that the risk of developing most types of cancer increases with age  This is a fascinating and important study highlighting how the genetic makeup of blood cells changes as we get older and may contribute to the development of leukaemia  It will be interesting to see if this kind of technique can be applied to other types of cancer too
