  A simple questionnaire can help differentiate individuals experiencing normal agerelated memory loss from those at risk for developing   most notably by their orientation to time and patterns of repetitive speech researchers found On the item Alzheimers Questionnaire patients having trouble remembering the day month year and time of day were almost  times more likely to have amnestic mild cognitive impairment a precursor to dementia according to Michael MalekAhmadi MSPH and colleagues from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Sun City Ariz Those who often repeated questions statements and stories on the same day also were at very high risk the researchers reported online in BMC Geriatrics Distinguishing mild cognitive impairment particularly when associated with memory loss rather than loss of other functional domains can be clinically challenging and time consuming and brief screening tools are sorely needed as the aging population expands according to the researchers Additionally as new therapies for   transition from being symptomatic to diseasemodifying identifying individuals who are at risk or in the earliest stages of the disease will be crucial in determining and improving disease outcome they wrote A pilot study by these researchers recently showed good sensitivity and specificity for the Alzheimers Questionnaire with responses about various aspects of memory and related   being provided by caregivers or other informants To see if certain components of the questionnaire were particularly accurate in pinpointing these types of impairments MalekAhmadis group compared responses among  patients who had been diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and  controls who were participants in a program involving posthumous brain and body donation The diagnosis of cognitive impairment had been made clinically and with neuropsychological testing with scores on verbal memory recall measures falling  standard deviations below normal ranges for age and educational attainment Cognitively normal participants all scored higher than  standard deviations on the neuropsychological tests The Alzheimers Questionnaire assesses memory language orientation visuospatial competence and functional capacity by a series of yesno questions such as Does the patient have trouble remembering to take medications On almost all questions significantly more yes responses were seen for the cognitive impairment group Regression analysis determined that along with repetitive speech and disorientation as to time two other questions were highly predictive One was whether the patient has trouble dealing with financial matters such as paying bills and the second was if the patient showed an impaired sense of direction according to the researchers These data indicate that problems with orientation to time repeating statements and questions difficulty managing finances and trouble with visuospatial orientation may accompany memory deficits in amnestic mild cognitive impairment the researchers stated Limitations of the study included the wide confidence intervals for the four items odds ratios and the possibility of bias in the R approximation In addition the study sample was ethnically homogeneous
