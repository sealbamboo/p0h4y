Many plans sold on the health insurance marketplaces offer a tradeoff lower premiums in exchange for limited choices of doctors and hospitals But consumers who opt for these plans with the idea that theyll go out of network when necessary may be taking a big financial risk The health law generally limits how much consumers can be required to pay   for medical care not including premiums In  the limit for an individual plan is  and for a family plan  But those limits apply only to care provided by doctors and hospitals in a plans approved network There may be a separate outofpocket maximum for services provided out of the network in marketplace plans or no cap at all says   research director at Breakaway Policy Strategies a research and consulting firm Similarly the health law requires that preventive care such as vaccines cancer screenings and annual checkups be covered at no cost to consumers in most health plans If someone uses an outofnetwork provider however he can be charged Going out of network opens the door to higher costs in other ways as well Plans may require patients to pay a higher copayment or coinsurance for an outofnetwork provider In addition since the doctors hospitals and other providers are not under contract with the insurance company in many states those providers may bill patients for any charges not covered by the insurance a practice known as balance billing The contracts signed by providers who join plan networks generally contain provisions that prohibit them from balance billing enrollees Plans sold on the marketplace are divided into four levels based on the amount of consumer costsharing required On average a bronze plan pays for  percent of covered medical services a silver plan pays for  percent a gold plan  percent and a platinum plan  percent But those percentages dont take any outofnetwork care into account says   project director at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms The assessment doesnt necessarily tell the consumer the full picture says Corlette If you sign up for a gold plan and its a really narrow network you might end up paying far more out of pocket than you expect A McKinsey  Co   of  silverlevel exchange plans found that  percent were narrow network plans in which at least  percent of the areas largest hospitals are not in the plan or ultranarrow network plans in which that number grows to at least  percent Narrow   can be a particular problem in HMOstyle plans that dont cover any outofnetwork care except for emergency services According to the analysis by Breakaway Policy Strategies roughly a third of midlevel silver plans are of this type typically leaving consumers on the hook for the entire bill if they get care from an outofnetwork provider The health law does provide protection for consumers when they receive emergency care from a hospital thats not in their providers network In such instances health plans cant charge   higher coinsurance or copayments However patients placed on observation status or admitted to the outofnetwork hospital from the emergency department are no longer shielded from higher outofpocket costs Once the patient is stabilized the patient will be responsible for whatever the insurer doesnt pay for that observation or admittance says Jeffrey Bettinger an emergency physician who is chairman of the reimbursement committee of the   Patients who will be admitted for any length of time may want to be transferred to an innetwork hospital says Bettinger
