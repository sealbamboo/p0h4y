Ten days ago Ashoka Mukpo an NBC freelance cameraman who caught Ebola in West Africa arrived in Omaha Neb for treatment He is one of hundreds of foreign nationals who were exposed to the virus in West Africa and have been flown to another country for treatment says Robert Quigley the US medical director at   the worlds largest medical assistance company He says his group has had some sort of interaction with all such evacuations whether a consultation or arranging for the transport of an infected patient The reason for the evacuation is always the same The patient or his or her employer wants the best possible medical care and is concerned that it wont be available in West Africa The vast majority of the evacuees are considered lowrisk cases says Quigley They had casual contact  such as a handshake  with an Ebola patient who may or may not have been contagious at the time In the early days of the outbreak these lowrisk individuals were allowed to fly out on commercial flights Now they leave on chartered flights Local health departments follow up with these cases Highrisk patients have had direct contact with the bodily fluids of an Ebola patient Some have been diagnosed with the virus others havent shown symptoms These individuals are evacuated with the highest precautions quarantine before departure escorts in protective suits no other passengers except for medical staff or in one case another Ebola patient ambulances waiting at the destination According to news reports and health agency records there have been about  highrisk evacuees see below since early August Evacuation fees can run   per person Typically the organization that employed the individual or the organizations insurance company foots the bill Regardless of the patients nationality flight arrangements have been coordinated by the US State Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for  of the evacuees Why you ask A highrisk individual should be evacuated in a plane with a biological containment unit That way pilots medical staff and ground crew are kept out of harms way USbased   has two such planes which are monitored by the State Department and CDC And the State Department decides wholl be flown out on these planes If international demand becomes too high the system might be revamped Spain and the United Kingdom have used similar planes to evacuate their nationals during the current outbreak Other countries possess the equipment but it would take time and training for them to handle an evacuation says Quigley In some cases the   plays a role The organization keeps a list of hospitals equipped to handle Ebola patients says spokeswoman Fadela Chaib NGOs governments and other health organizations can consult WHO to find the best facility WHO will approach hospitals on a patients behalf but will only pay for the evacuation of its own staff No exceptions says WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic It sets a bad precedent and were   to do so  that is to foot the bill Patients are usually sent to their home country although one WHO staffer from Senegal was flown to the closest facility for care a hospital in Germany Two potential evacuations made headlines In one incident in July a Sierra Leonean doctor who did not work for WHO was diagnosed with Ebola WHO petitioned a hospital from its list to accept the physician The approval didnt come in time and the doctor died In another instance the Sierra Leonean government asked for WHO to pay for the   to Hamburg Germany for treatment WHO denied the request for funding since Buck was not its
