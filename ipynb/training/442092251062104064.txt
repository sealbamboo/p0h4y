Scandidrama The Bridge is known as much for the personal life of Swedish detective Saga Noren and her Danish colleague Martin Rohde as for its gritty monochrome crime scenes  Saga portrayed by Sofia Helin struggles to navigate the social rules of the workplace but is never given a formal diagnosis  But according to one British psychiatrist she appears to fit somewhere on the autistic spectrum disorder ASD scale Eva Loth of the Institute of Psychiatry Kings College London says while she hasnt met a woman with ASD who is quite like Saga she does think it plausible that someone like her could exist Her portrayal is overall very useful because firstly she brings to the public the awareness that there are women who have ASD says Dr Loth of the department of forensic and neurodevelopmental sciences  She does portray well characteristic features that many people with ASD have and struggle with and she also brings home the message that in highfunctioning people with ASD there is an awareness they are different and that they are trying to fit in sometimes to different degrees of success  The character has some features often seen in ASD such as difficulty understanding jokes and irony or being profoundly honest at the cost of other peoples feelings says Dr Loth who works on a Europewide project looking at biological markers for autism But she doesnt have all the features that make up a diagnosis such as a desire to stick to a particular routine From what Ive seen I probably wouldnt give her a whole diagnosis of ASD but I would recognise autisticlike features Dr Loth says One of the recurring themes in the series is that Saga has great difficulty telling lies This can be comical  as when she explains to her colleagues wife at dinner that she doesnt care for her cooking  but it can also be extremely uncomfortable for those around her  ambassador Robyn Steward who has Aspergers syndrome a form of autism has sympathies with this She says she has had to learn to tell small white lies from time to time to cope in social situations People on the spectrum can learn to lie she says Saga has learnt to lie but shes not good at it Ms Steward who has written The Independent Womans handbook to supersafe living on the Autistic Spectrum says Saga is a good role model for women who are different and for women who are on the spectrum who may identify with her She thinks Sagas coinvestigator Martin played by Kim Bodnia is also a good role model as he helps her cope in the social world Saga appears to cope pretty well with everyday life and can do many things most of us cant  she can negotiate with murderers shoot to kill and drive at high speed in her vintage Porsche But according to Ms Steward even high functioning people on the spectrum are far more vulnerable than people think The social world can be confusing and quite lonely she says  The show has avoided giving Saga a diagnosis The actress Sofia Helin describes her character as having another way of being intelligent  Her EQ emotional intelligence is very low and her IQ is very very high According to scriptwriter Hans Rosenfeldt while the media and the audience may have decided she has Aspergers weve actually never diagnosed her in the show With Saga and her personality I dont have to write jokes I just let her ask about the things she wants to know andor have Martin trying to educate her in social behaviour he writes in a   Or let her be brutally blunt to other human beings He says Saga and Martins characters and relationship are a huge factor in the success of The Bridge  I love them and since were currently writing season three I will have the privilege to stay with them for at least another year Follow Helen Briggs on
