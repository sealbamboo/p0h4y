Corrective baby helmets have virtually no effect on head shape according to the most definitive study yet The use of rigid plastic helmets has become popular with parents concerned their baby has an oddshaped head But research in the   suggests they are little better than doing nothing and can cause sideeffects such as rashes Strategies such as placing babies on their stomachs during waking hours should be explored say researchers Most babies go to sleep laid on their backs to reduce the risk of sudden infant death Because of this mild skull deformities  where babies skulls are slightly flattened on one side or at the back of the head  are becoming more common Except in rare cases this is generally considered a cosmetic condition But some parents seek treatment from a paediatrician which involves babies wearing a  helmet for  hours a day from six months old until they turn one Past studies have produced conflicting results over the success of the therapy In the latest research scientists in the Netherlands followed  healthy fullterm babies Half of the babies wore a custommade helmet between the age of six months and one year while the other half had no treatment When checked at the age of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups with only about a quarter in each group making a full recovery   who had treatment  who had no treatment All parents of the babies who had worn helmets reported downsides including However there was no evidence that helmet therapy influenced the infants development or quality of life Lead researcher Renske van Wijk of the University of Twente said they would generally discourage parents from using the helmets The helmets have no added value compared to doing nothing and a helmet is an expensive treatment she told BBC News All parents in the study reported one or more sideeffects in the group where infants wore helmets We would discourage helmet therapy in healthy infants but parents with concerns should always speak to a doctor She added that babies with very severe skull flattening were not studied Prof Brent Collett of the Seattle Childrens Research Institute said the study was important because it was the first randomised controlled trial of helmet therapy Kids do not appear to grow out of asymmetric head shape but we dont know what the significance of that is yet he told BBC News At least in this study treatment did not appear to make a significant difference He said new strategies were needed such as encouraging the use of tummy time  placing babies on their stomachs during waking hours Experts say it is vital for parents to continue laying babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death Dr Simon Newell a consultant neonatologist and vicepresident at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in London said Parents should be reassured that they are doing the right thing to nurse their baby on herhis back when put to sleep  If this results in a change in head shape they should rest assured that their child will not come to any longterm harm
