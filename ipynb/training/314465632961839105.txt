Dr Frank Dumont knew one of his favorite patients was getting depressed When Dumont first started seeing him in his family practice the man was in his s He was active and fit he enjoyed hiking into his s But then things started to change He started complaining of his memory starting to slip Dumont says The man would forget where he had placed objects and hed struggle to remember simple words and phrases Dumont prescribed antidepressants and saw him every eight weeks or so Like a lot of people in the small town of Estes Park  miles northwest of Denver both Dumont and his patient were drawn to the ruggedly beautiful mountains there One of them called   is a cherished part of Dumonts life He and the patient talked often about the picturesque mountain He was one of those people where you see them on the schedule for the day and you just smile Dumont says You just realize you get a chance to chat with someone who feels like a friend Thats what their last visit was like Dumont says he did ask the man whether he was having any thoughts of hurting himself but got a very convincing no What in hindsight struck me about that visit is that he brought me a gift which was a geological survey marker from the top of Longs Peak says Dumont It was a replica but it was one of those things that was just another reminder to me of this connection that we had had And at the time it just seemed like a very generous gift that touched me Dumont recalls And what I didnt realize at the time was that that was I think a farewell gift or a bit of a parting gift from him Because I did not see him again And the next that I had heard of him was from an emergency phone call from his wife about a month later and she called needing to be seen  She had to come in and talk to me with how to deal with the fact that her husband had committed suicide Dumonts patient shot himself in the head with a rifle Dumont was stunned and guiltridden He says he always asks his depressed patients about suicide whether theyve thought about how theyd do it But he now regrets not asking this patient specifically whether he had guns in the house Suicide prevention researcher   at the Harvard School of Public Health says Dumont sounds like a great doctor He was doing everything he could to try to keep this guy from making a suicide attempt but what he didnt do was the second step which is make it hard for him to die if he did make an attempt Miller says The second step Miller says is asking patients if they have guns in the house or access to guns If someone tries to commit suicide without using a gun they probably   The likelihood of their dying is of an order of magnitude lower he says Instead of there being a plus percent chance of death theres a greater than  percent chance that theyll live Miller wants to make it routine for family doctors to   their patients about guns One   found that nearly half of all suicide victims had seen a primary care doctor within a month of killing themselves So its important for them to bring up suicide and possible means We have to get people to stop thinking about these discussions as gun control in one way or another but rather as a way of conveying useful information so people make decisions that protect their family Miller says There are lots of reasons family doctors avoid bringing up guns with their patients They may not want to offend a patient or they may be too busy checking off all the preventive screenings and tests on the list Not everybody wants gun advice from a medical professional Edgar Antillon organized a   at the Colorado State Capitol earlier this year He says he would resent a doctor bringing it up Tell me to stay healthy tell me my baby has colic but I dont think its their job to tell me about gun safety he says Theyre not gun experts Theyre not NRA members  And if they are then Ill take it as advice from an NRA member But Dumont has spent a lot of time secondguessing himself since his patient shot himself The doctor hopes small measures he can take will reduce the odds just a fraction that another one of his patients will die from suicide by gun I have a lower threshold for asking followup questions asking the same thing a different way he says Or if I have any inkling starting to push a little bit further and say Well so youre not really thinking about it but have you ever thought about how you would go about it if you were going to And I have a lower threshold for asking about a weapon in the home as well Dumont says he thinks more physicians would talk with their patients about guns if they got information about health risks associated with them Medical journals and a federal board of experts regularly issue advice on prevention of obesity car accidents and workplace injuries But theres been a ban on federally funded gun safety research until President Obama restored it with an
