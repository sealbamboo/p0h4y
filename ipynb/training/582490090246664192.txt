If you treat your staff like enemies what does that say about you as an employer Frances OGrady is very worried about the future of the public sector Not only has austerity hollowed it out almost to breaking point not only is doubt overshadowing the continuation of NHS and local government services  but the general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress TUC also believes this government has lost sight of what lies behind the sector At the heart of our public services are people she says In many cases the service is a human being whos looking after or teaching or saving or rescuing other people If you treat public servants well that leads to an improvement in the service When you speak to public service workers morale is really low Yes theyre having a tough time in terms of their own household budgets  but theyre also really really worried about the services theyre delivering and their future The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that cuts in the next parliament would be   under this governments plans Chancellor George Osborne has proposed spending cuts of more than bn including a further bn slash to the welfare budget but has refused to give a breakdown of where these cuts will fall The NHS despite coping well with budget cuts from  to  is now   according to an assessment published last week by thinktank the Kings Fund Central government funding for councils will have been slashed by  by May    estimates Meanwhile   plummeting morale mounting workloads and higher levels of stress and illness among staff who are complaining of increasing inspection and bureaucracy This is the backdrop for the  general election I think at a fundamental level its a fight for the future of the public service ethos and the role of public services in society and in the economy says OGrady For the TUC boss its a case of equality and fairness Despite prime minister David Camerons appeal to business leaders to offer their employees a pay rise OGrady remains sceptical of a government that has presided over the longest squeeze on real earnings since the s as   While FTSE  chief executives received   between  and  she points out that salaries for paramedics dropped by  for primary and nursery school teachers by  and for bus drivers by  over the same period Unpaid overtime is more common in the public sector with  of employees working beyond their contracted hours compared with  of private sector staff The public sector benefits from bn worth of free hours a year according to   OGrady says Did they ever consider what would happen if people withdrew that goodwill Traditionally the public sector has acted as an anchor on pay  a benchmark by which decent employment was measured she adds You kick that stick away and thats one of the reasons why employers in the private sector dont feel under any pressure to share pretty healthy figures on profit Meanwhile the Conservatives plan to   which OGrady takes as a desire to stifle any dissent in the workplace against pay unfairness Since coming to power in  the coalition government has   to bn What does this mean for the public sector At a human level OGrady believes it has led to an increase in lowpaid insecure or parttime jobs zerohours contracts and a worsening of terms and conditions Britain has been very good at creating bad jobs she says How many people will see this as a career choice for the future But outsourcing is also a matter of principle Many people believe there are limits to the free market  hence huge public concern over the future of the NHS or support for taking the railways back into public ownership  I think public service ethos is about recognising that there are places where the market shouldnt go Most of us feel its wrong to make a profit from peoples ill health or disability or imprisonment says OGrady She is also quick to point out the business case for equality and fairness Although some politicians dont like to acknowledge it decent businesses cant run without a good transport system without healthy workers without skilled and trained workers without social cohesion she says So actually if we fatally damage our public services and the public service ethos its bad for everybody and it fundamentally changes the nature of the society we live and work in And thats not to mention the pressure growing inequality places on public services in terms of health housing and welfare for example This year income inequality was   as the biggest threat to world stability according to experts polled by World Economic Forum WEF OGrady who attended WEFs  annual meeting in Davos says inequality was notably missing from many of the conversations she witnessed there  This year it felt a bit like nobody really wanted to talk about it  possibly because despite all the good words in the first year I went no progress had been made in tackling it she says People were keen to talk about Greece keen to talk about productivity and all sorts of things but not actually about that obscene gap between the rich and the rest Back in the UK OGrady is fighting hard to get the TUCs message heard She is pleased that Labour has committed to improving pay and the quality of UK jobs but has made little headway in convincing the Conservative party that austerity is a failed project  There is a lot at stake in May  for OGrady We are campaigning very hard to make the case for proper funding for public services and decent jobs and respect for the people who deliver them
