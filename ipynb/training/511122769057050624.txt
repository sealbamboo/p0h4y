Some blame witchcraft Others think its a bad batch of moonshine But Esther Okaya who lives in Korogocho a slum in Nairobi Kenya says even teetotalers are falling victim One minute quarreling with a neighbor the next minute dead And its happened to her Okayas husband left her He took the money for her childrens school fees A few mornings later her yearold son shuffled home after being turned away by the teacher And then she felt it It was as if her heart seized up She could not breathe At the health clinic the next day a nurse did something to Okaya that she hadnt seen before wrapped a rubber cuff around her arm that squeezed and beeped and spit out a number The number was   over  her blood pressure Esther Okaya age  had hypertension which made her more susceptible to heart attack or stroke While hypertension is a condition we might more readily associate with a yearold office worker in an American city its actually more prevalent in SubSaharan Africa affecting nearly  in  residents over the age of  Genetic proclivity to saltretention may play a role Another factor is economic good news As Africans earn more and move to cities and spend more on food their risk factors start to look more Western People eat either too many calories or they eat things that have too much salt in them or they eat things that have too much fat in them says Dr Catherine Kyobutungi health director for the African Population Health Research Centre APHRC in Nairobi The concern about Africa is not just that so many people have dangerously high blood pressure but that so few are told they do And its not like blood pressure cuffs are some exotic new technology Kyobutungi was using them back in medical school In Uganda yes of course she remembers It was routine it was part of the general examination But now Youd be lucky if your blood pressure got measured in a public hospital Today she says in any given African hospital youre more likely to find out your HIV status and get tested for malaria Those are the diseases around which foreign donors have poured in money supplies and training Kyobutungi came up with what seemed like a simple plan to solve this In  she sent out health workers to screen a bunch of people tell them their blood pressure numbers and offer free medication if they needed it Free completely free she emphasizes For about  months Of the nearly  hypertensive patients she found in Korogocho fewer than  percent accepted the free treatment They didnt think it was important So you need someone who can constantly reinforce the message that if you dont get treated even though you dont fall sick  things are happening in your body the doctor says Your kidneys are getting damaged your eyes are getting damaged Your heart is getting damaged Like when you go to your doctor and have the talk about high blood pressure and then you go home and hear the exact same message on a drug commercial on TV Kenyans she felt needed that level of professional nagging And she found someone to pull it off We talk with people one by one to tell them You are ready to get paralyzed You are ready to get stroke  because their blood pressure numbers are so high says Helen Onyango laughing  Onyango whos  is a community health worker in Korogocho If you are over  and live anywhere near Helen then she has knocked on your door carrying a blood pressure cuff Shell talk her way in take tea with no sugar and explain to you what a blood pressure number is And then you take the measurement there she says You tell her Yours is  over  You are sick  A pressure reading of  is in the zone of hypertensive emergency In the United States youd be advised to immediately call  When Onyangos neighbors get this kind of news they look at her and her machine and say Im okay Im not sick It is hard for anybody to take seriously a problem that you cant feel and that no one is putting money into There is no Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for African hypertension There probably never will be So Catherine Kyobutungi at the Health Research Centre decided to add the economic incentive They promised to pay community health workers an extra  shillings about a dollar for every patient screened who actually showed up at the clinic And another  cents if they came back a second time Health workers like Mary Wanjiru thought was a great deal until she tried to earn it by inviting people to the clinic I keep on going back to call them Wanjiru says They even not come that day Maybe he shall or she shall come the next month So you have to wait so that you can be paid Onyangos not afraid to take hardline tactics If a neighbor dies of a hemorrhagic stroke shell visit another neighbor with similar blood pressure numbers to the dead guy And shell say You see John is dead What about your numbers And what about her numbers Onyango is fighting her own battle against high blood pressure A blood clot impinges on her aortic artery the result of lifelong undertreated hypertension When I walk Im feeling like  too tired she says What makes hypertension such a killer in Africa is that if Helen Onyango were to have a stroke or a heart attack tomorrow theres no ambulance thats going to show up in time Though shes scheduled for bypass surgery she admits that neither she nor her adult children can hope to afford it Doctors dont give her long to live And the same prognosis may apply to many others with high blood pressure WHO scientists predict that in the next  years as Africas population ages the death toll from chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer and especially hypertension will exceed the death toll from HIV and malaria combined While Onyango no longer has as much strength to knock on doors shes proud to know that over the last two years she and about a dozen community health workers through the enduring power of badgering increased the number of hypertensive patients under treatment in this slum from  percent in  to  percent today And that success has attracted the attention of people that have an even greater economic incentive than the community health workers A group of people who in the United States have perfected the art of schooling us on diseases we didnt know we had Pharmaceutical executives are in talks with APHRC about scaling up the next group of Kenyans targeted for blood pressure screening from  to  million Now thats a market
