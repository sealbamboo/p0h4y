On Aug   a doctor climbed the stairs through a New Orleans hospital to the helipad which was rarely used and so old and rusted it wasnt even painted with the hospitals current name From that helipad over Memorial Medical Center the doctor looked out over New Orleans now flooding after Hurricane Katrina He considered the more than  people in the hospital below   of them patients Administrators had longstanding plans to manage hurricanes flooding loss of electricity and evacuations but they werent prepared to deal with them all at once which is what the hospital faced during Katrina The staff had to decide who to save and in a new book   writer and physician Sheri Fink reconstructs the choices they made She tells NPRs Steve Inskeep about the sickestlast evacuation system they put in place and how some doctors hastened their patients deaths Thats when the very first tough ethical decision arose  which was Who are you going to save first if you know that you may be hours away from all power going out  They decided that the babies would be saved first and the intensive care unit patients whose lives really depended on electricity They also decided at that point who would go last and that was patients who had do not resuscitate orders The doctors all agreed with this decision and by the way it was a small group of doctors who took this burden of making this decision on their shoulders As one doctor described it  they would maybe have the least to lose compared with other patients  Doctors tend to be  and this is some ethicists have explained this to me  doctors have kind of a utilitarian frame If you ask them Who gets the organ transplant its going to be the person who they think could benefit the most from it and other considerations might not be taken into account like justice or fairness  So youre switching in a disaster sometimes from looking at what doctors normally are supposed to do which is treat each individual patient to the max to this more populationbased approach At some point on the day that the power failed a few hours after that some of the doctors told me that they walked around the hospital had a look at the situation of the patients and felt that hastening death was the right choice You know one of them had gone upstairs to the intensive care unit where there was just one patient left Most of them had been taken out first but she was very very sick She had this do not resuscitate order and had been held back And he asked the nurse Give her enough morphine till she goes The other doctor John Thiele actually was involved in injecting some of those patients on that Thursday Sept  of that year  And he also told me that the intent was to let these people die He did describe to me having a moment after he did these acts where he did wonder whether it was the right thing And he even hesitated just before he started injecting the patients and he asked the woman next to him a nurse who was on the ethics committee whether they could really do this Now one thing he didnt consider was staying there with the patients until they died I saw it last year with Superstorm Sandy After everything we should have learned from Katrina we saw hospitals lose power hospitals being evacuated in the middle of a hurricane ICU babies taken out by hand down darkened staircases hospitals that knew that they had vulnerabilities not evacuating in advance We cant just say you know the government failed the corporation failed Thats the easy way out Yes they have to do better we have to do better But then theres also this really important role and Ive seen it over and over again in every disaster or conflict zone where Ive worked that individual decisions can have a large and reverberating impact There is a tomorrow after a disaster and its sometimes hard to remember that in the midst of it
