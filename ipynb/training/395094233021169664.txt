 Max Kelmon  has his own little version of a man cave in Palo Alto Calif Behind the family kitchen in a converted garage he has an Xbox a bigscreen TV headphones and a microphone Theres an old couch covered in a sheet And that couch where he parks himself surrounded by boxes and Christmas lights is one of Maxs favorite places on the planet From that couch he connects to friends all over the globe  and he spends hours pretty much every day honing his skills in Call of Duty The first commercially successfully video game   invaded Americans living rooms  years ago Since then the industry has evolved from a simple bouncing ball in the Atari original to games with astounding graphics and sound most of them connected to the Internet That means that kids like Max can play with people spread across the globe It also means that gaming companies can analyze how gamers play  each and every decision they make So when kids sit down with a game they are actually sitting across a screen from adults who are studying them  and in some cases trying to influence their behavior in powerful ways Researchers in game companies tweak games to get players to stay on longer or to encourage them to spend money on digital goods They study gamers reactions Its become a science And parents like Maxs mom Vanessa Kelmon often feel outgunned I hate it I really do she says He could play Xbox for  straight hours He has friends in Mexico City and friends in England Vanessa says Max is addicted to video games When I took it away he started to cry she says My God I am offering you to go play tennis or go play golf  and I am making you shut this down and youre crying about it In millions of families video games are a source of intense love and intense hate because they can be so incredibly compelling You might not believe that if you dont play them but you can get lost in a great game They make you feel good And its no accident says Ramin Shokrizade the game economist for Wargaming America The technology for this has gotten quite sophisticated says Shokrizade who began his career in neuroscience and behavioral economics At this point every major gaming company worldwide either has in place a fully developed business intelligence unit or theyre in the process of building one Todays game design is dominated by research he says As we play games game developers are tracking every click running tests and analyzing data They are trying to find out What can they tweak to make us play just a bit longer What would make the game more fun What can get us to spend some money inside a game and buy something So as millions of people play designers introduce little changes and get answers to all of these questions in real time And games evolve For example most games today sell virtual goods right inside the game  like a new gun in Call of Duty or a cow in FarmVille Shokrizades job is to get people to buy them One of the tricks of the trade is something developers at Zynga  which created FarmVille  used to call fun pain or the pinch The idea is to make gamers uncomfortable frustrate them take away their powers crush their forts  and then at the last second offer them a way out for a price John Davison who works at video game company Red Robot Labs says freetoplay smartphone games like Candy Crush Saga and Puzzle  Dragons have become brilliant at using these tests to figure out how to get people to spend money And the research is working Davison says those games are making millions of dollars  every day When adults play games they consent to share that personal information about how they play But Shokrizade worries about the millions of kids who play If its a child how do you even get consent for something like that he says Many of the people spending cash are kids including Davisons children Game consoles sell gift cards at convenience stores that allow kids to make purchases on video games even if they dont have a credit card Davisons kids started playing Clash of Clans this year In the game developed by Supercell you get to run your own little Viking village and team up with friends To protect your clan you can spend money on forts and weapons Its free to download  but because of these virtual goods its one of the highestgrossing apps in Apples store Davisons two boys loved it They were clearly getting a lot of enjoyment out of it he says But it did get to the point where my wife and I were like Do you really want to be spending everything on this  And this is coming from a man who has devoted his life to video games I was trying to sort of total up in my head how much the kids had spent on this game he says But there was also a degree of admiration for the team at Supercell that they had managed to get under my yearolds skin to this degree Apple recently settled a classaction lawsuit about kids making inapp purchases like this without their parents permission and the European Union is considering new regulations on games Some regulations are taking place on a smaller scale In Menlo Park Calif Michelle DeWolf banned her yearold son Austin Newman from playing games during the school week Originally she gave him  minutes a day but that didnt work He couldnt think about doing his homework He couldnt think about walking the dog or helping in any other way because he couldnt get his mind off the idea that he had  minutes coming she says Once he knew there was nothing he didnt think about it during the week and he almost  maybe Im not objective  but he almost seemed relieved
