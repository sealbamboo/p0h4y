Each Peach Market in Washington DC is a far cry from the Trader Joes where I usually shop For one thing its tiny  smaller than the apartment I share with two others And there are no lines snaking through aisles and aisles of tempting goods Youll find the usual staples here and also artisanal pickles locally grown and cured charcuterie and yogurt from Pennsylvanias Amish country But dont expect much selection  there are just two brands of olive oil rather than the several shelves to choose from at Harris Teeter If a regular comes in with a hankering for something thats not on the shelves owners Jeanlouise Conaway and Emily Friedberg say theyll happily put in an order But while it offers what feels like a distinct shopping experience   which opened in  isnt all that unique Its a new version of the oldschool neighborhood market which is popping up in cities across the country Theres Urban Radish and Cookbook in Los Angeles Farm to Market in Austin and Milk and Honey Market in Philadelphia  to name just a few These arent your parents bigbox grocery stores Theyre closer to the places your grandparents might have shopped  but updated for the modern foodie This renaissance of small markets has happened in just the past couple of years Friedberg says She and Conaway say they opened theirs because they sensed a growing appetite for highquality local foods But even though Each Peach carries a lot of quirky specialty goods Friedberg says the biggest draw for most customers is the neighborhoodiness We have a lot of regular customers that we see almost every day she says They stop by to pick up a couple of things at a time  maybe just ingredients for dinner that night Ed McMahon a senior fellow at the   a nonprofit research group focused on urban development agrees that independent shops like Each Peach are a growing trend in urban areas And I think itll continue to grow he tells The Salt The growing interest in eating farmfresh locally grown food is partially responsible for the small shop renaissance McMahon says As weve reported before   are coming back to cities for the same reason It used to be that everybody did all their shopping in one great big grocery store he says People would drive over to a Safeway or a Kroger once a week or once every  days and stock up But for city dwellers who might not drive and who live in small apartments with limited pantry space the walkable neighborhood grocery store is becoming more appealing And these local stores they tend to be more in touch with their consumers   says The closer you get to the people the more in touch you are with their needs wants and desires People also prefer the small grocery store for the same reasons they prefer the independent coffee shop over Starbucks or the local bookstore over Barnes  Noble McMahon says They tend to be a great place to meet your neighbors Of course these little markets are often pricier than chain stores In some cases theyre a lot more expensive At Each Peach Friedberg says she tried to stock affordable staples But a bunch of asparagus there costs  And a bag of local organic granola is   thats more than twice as much as a giant box of Grape Nuts But while modestly priced chains like Trader Joes are booming theres a growing number of people who can afford  and are willing  to pay more for their food If you want to spend your entire food budget on lownutritionalvalue nonsense your dollars can go a lot further at some of our competitors says Danielle Vogel who owns   in DC Unlike Each Peach which sources both local and imported foods Glens is  percent local That means youll only find produce grown in the Northeast or the MidAtlantic in Vogels shop I will never sell bananas she says And if youre willing to be adventurous she does carry local organic and sustainable substitutes for pretty much everything youd find at chain stores A lot of customers are willing to do that it seems  Vogel says she is drawing in regulars Weve tripled our inventory in the year that weve existed she says Friedberg says shes excited to see so many stores opening around the city Everyone is doing something a little different she says But I think theres a real hunger for local food
