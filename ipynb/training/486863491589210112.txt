Another would-be U.S. acquirer has run afoul of U.K. takeover rules.. AbbVie Inc. was forced Wednesday to retract statements it made the previous day on shareholder support for its $51.62 billion takeover offer for London-listed Shire PLC.. The U.S. drug company said it wanted to clarify certain press and wire-service reports, adding, “AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements.”
