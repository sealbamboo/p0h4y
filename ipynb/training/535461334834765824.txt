When I was growing up in Lexington Ky in the late s we used to go to an allyoucaneat buffet called Duffs It was the cheapest restaurant in town My father and mother ate for  apiece my brother and I were charged  and my little sister who was  ate free After my father paid the cashier wed sprint over to the smorgasbord and fill our plates Wed fill them again and again If the fried chicken got cold my father would tell us to throw it out and get more We gorged we took advantage we were wasteful  because we perceived it as free Wed eat so much that one of us would invariably get sick on the way home In many ways Duffs is like our health care system Someone else appears to be paying for it so who cares how much it costs To fight this insurers continue to raise copayments and deductibles making us pay more in an attempt to reduce inefficient spending But health care costs continue to rise Recently the agency that runs Medicare said that health spending would increase by  percent in   percentage points more than last year Health care prices in the United States dwarf those of all other industrialized countries Some have advocated price controls A better strategy is price transparency Patients may be shouldering more of the burden of health expenditures but they still dont know what they are paying for Requiring patients to have more skin in the game without giving them adequate price information is like making Duffs customers pay Â  la carte but not telling them what the steak costs compared to the chicken Without this information they are bound to make bad choices Forcing consumers to shop blindly while requiring them to share costs is also fundamentally unfair Cost sharing redistributes the burden of health care costs particularly to lowincome earners who often have highdeductible insurance plans but does little to lower spending Price transparency on the other hand can remedy this For example in a   patients in a health insurance plan were given access to a pricing website that calculated outofpocket costs for various medical procedures The authors found that patients who used the website searchers spent  percent less for laboratory tests and  percent less for CT and MRI scans than those who did not nonsearchers Notably searchers in the study had spent more than nonsearchers before the website went up indicating that they were no more frugal at baseline Price transparency appeared to be the factor that drove the decrease in spending In   patients in five cities mostly in the Midwest were given information about how much an MRI cost at different clinics but were not penalized if they chose a more expensive option Meanwhile patients in nine other cities were given no such data After two years the average cost of an MRI fell by  in those places where prices were provided but increased by  where they were not because of competition among different centers and more costconscious shopping Doctors too lack basic information about what health care tests and procedures cost When I was a resident in New York City we used to order patients weekend labs on Friday afternoons Every patient on our ward would routinely get a complete blood count and an electrolyte panel and additional blood tests as needed With  patients this added up to hundreds of assays every weekend None of us knew that an electrolyte panel costs about  and no one ever thought to ask But most patients dont need an electrolyte panel or complete blood count every day With a few drizzles of ink we would spend thousands of dollars with hardly a second thought Knowing the lab prices might have dissuaded our profligacy but the hospital never shared this information with us Today several states are demanding greater health care price transparency to protect patients In California for example hospitals are required to advertise their charges for the  most common outpatient procedures A similar law applying to health insurers was enacted in Massachusetts last month Corporations are also pushing for more openness The Safeway grocery chain for instance has provided prices for screening colonoscopies to its employees since  resulting in a drop in the average price of the procedure by nearly  percent because employees responsible for any excess charges are shopping around Of course price data has to be paired with quality figures so patients dont make the mistake of equating more expensive care with better care In medicine there is usually very little correlation We also have to guard against cost shifting in which providers cut prices on services for which rates are available but charge more for services whose rates are not We are lucky to live in an era in which consumers enjoy great power and choice Unfortunately the health care industry remains a major exception As doctors we strive to provide information to our patients to help them make informed medical decisions In todays costcutting environment it is only fair that we provide them the data to make informed financial decisions too
