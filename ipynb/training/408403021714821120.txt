An antituberculosis vaccine could prevent multiple sclerosis early research suggests A smallscale study by researchers at the Sapienza University of Rome has raised hopes that the disease can be warded off when early symptoms appear More research is needed before the BCG vaccine can be trialled on MS patients The MS Society said the chance to take a safe and effective preventative treatment after a first MSlike attack would be a huge step forward MS is a disease affecting nerves in the brain and spinal cord causing problems with muscle movement balance and vision  Early signs include numbness vision difficulties or problems with balance About half of people with a first episode of symptoms go on to develop MS within two years while  have no more problems  In the study published in the journal   Italian researchers gave  people who had early signs of MS an injection of BCG vaccine The other  individuals in the study were given a placebo  After five years  of those who received the placebo had not developed MS compared with  of those vaccinated   These results are promising but much more research needs to be done to learn more about the safety and longterm effects of this live vaccine said study leader Dr Giovanni Ristori  Doctors should not start using this vaccine to treat MS or clinically isolated syndrome Dr Susan Kohlhaas head of biomedical research at the MS Society said it was a small but interesting study Its really encouraging to see positive results from this small trial but theyll need validating in larger and longerterm studies before we know if the BCG vaccination can reduce the risk of someone developing MS Ultimately the chance to take a safe and effective preventative treatment after a first MSlike attack would be a huge step forward The findings add weight to a theory that exposure to infections early in life might reduce the risk of diseases such as MS by stimulating the bodys immune system Dr Dennis Bourdette of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland US said the research suggested BCG could prove to be a safe inexpensive and handy treatment for MS He wrote in an accompanying editorial in   The theory is that exposure to certain infections early in life might reduce the risk of these diseases by inducing the body to develop a protective immunity
