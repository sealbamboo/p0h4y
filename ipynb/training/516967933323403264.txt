  The governments   Tuesday detailing drug and device companies payments to doctors has been widely hailed as a milestone for transparency Once posted the information will let patients see if their physicians receive money from any of the companies whose products they prescribe But the database is also something else a very limited window into the billions in industry spending Before you dive in and search your doctor here are five caveats to keep in mind The Physician Payment Sunshine Act part of the  Affordable Care Act called for the first public release of this data  months ago But because of delays writing   the first release of data will happen today and it will only cover payments for a few months from August to December  So if you search for your doctor and you do not find him or her it doesnt mean that he or she didnt receive a payment Also those few months may not be representative of a companys spending over an entire year Some companies may try to concentrate promotional talks at the start of a year and those wouldnt be represented in these data Some of these problems will be resolved by the time the government releases data on payments for the full calendar year  expected next summer The Sunshine Act allows drug and device companies to delay the publication of data related to research of new products or in some cases new uses for existing products The payments wont be made public until the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration or four calendar years after the payment was made whichever comes first It is unclear how much money is involved but again just because a doctor doesnt show up as receiving a research payment doesnt mean he or she hasnt received one Beyond that not all types of health professionals are included Youll find physicians medical doctors and osteopaths dentists chiropractors podiatrists and optometrists But companies do not have to report payments to nurse practitioners or physician assistants so you wont find them The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has   submitted by companies for last year had data problems that could lead to cases of mistaken identity The names associated with those payments wont be released today Federal officials are asking companies to recheck the data which should be released publicly next year CMS officials discovered the problem while   that payments were being attributed to him even though they were made to another physician with the same name In the process of reviewing that issue it found intermingled data meaning physicians were being linked to medical license numbers or national provider identification numbers that were not theirs When consumers go to the   they will see payments divided into different categories consulting fees speaking fees called services other than consulting research payments honoraria gifts entertainment food and beverage travel and lodging educational items charitable contributions royalties ownership interests and grants Those different types of payments signal different levels of involvement with a company Educational items for instance include medical textbooks and reprints of journal studies given to doctors Research payments can include more than the pay a doctor got to lead a study Payments for clinical studies may include costs associated with patient care and supplies as well as the time spent by health care professionals treating patients and managing the study Educational items that directly benefit patients such as anatomical posters and medication samples do not have to be reported and wont be displayed While the payments database is a far cry from    and less complex  its reasonable to expect some glitches CGI Federal the company that led what turned out to be the botched launch of HealthCaregov is also responsible for the release of the payment data Beyond that drug and device manufacturers sometimes make their own errors Doctors have similar names and a payment made to one may be attributed to a different one The government gave doctors a day window to review and dispute payments attributed to them before the information becomes public but its unclear how many did The American Medical Association as well as pharmaceutical and device trade groups say the process has been confusing Many doctors may notice payments attributed to them in the days to come when they search their names on Google If you cant find what youre looking for on the governments website you might try   feature where we have been tracking payments by some large companies for four years Weve just added data from  and have included  drug companies accounting for half of US drug sales that year In some cases that will be more complete than the federal data If you have a question about what your doctor received you should ask your doctor
