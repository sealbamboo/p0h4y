US officials have revealed they are investigating about two dozen suspected examples of medical equipment vulnerable to hack attacks potentially putting patients lives at risk The products include heart implants and drug infusion pumps according to a report by   It said investigators were concerned that flaws in the kit could be used to cause heart attacks and drug overdoses There are no known examples of deaths having happened this way One expert suggested that investigators efforts would better channelled elsewhere But the Department of Homeland Security indicated its fears were justified It isnt out of the realm of the possible to cause severe injury or death an unidentified government official told Reuters These are the things that shows like Homeland are built from The TV series Homeland featured a plot in which a fictional US vicepresident was targeted via his pacemaker  Dick Cheney who was vicepresident under President George W Bush later revealed he had feared a similar attack and had the wireless connectivity of his pacemaker disabled The inquiry is reportedly being coordinated by the US Department of Homeland Securitys Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team ICSCert It is said to also cover medical imaging equipment and hospital networking systems The probe is reportedly an extension of research by Barnaby Jack a security expert who died in July  a week before he was scheduled to give a talk on the topic at the Black Hat conference He had earlier told the BBC about a way he had found to compromise insulin pumps used by diabetic patients which connected to the internet to get updates We can influence any pump within a ft m range Mr Jack told the BBC We can make that pump dispense its entire unit reservoir of insulin and we can do that without requiring its ID number Reuters said that government staff told it they were working with devicemakers to identify and patch software bugs and other vulnerabilities Three manufacturers whose kit is believed to affected told the news agency that they had already made safety improvements but declined to provide specifics The BBC requested further comment and one of the firms Medtronic provided a statement We are committed to addressing the industrywide issue of wireless hacking it said We believe the risk to an individual customer is low and the therapeutic benefits of our cardiac devices for treating heart conditions and insulin pumps for diabetes far outweigh this risk  Medtronic has already taken a number of concrete actions to enhance device security and will assess whether additional security measures can be implemented without compromising the therapy that the device is designed to deliver to patients However one expert suggested that the danger of such hacks was minor when compared with the risks caused by another techrelated problem with medical equipment   inconsistent user interfaces  and that efforts would be better spent on that issue Weve got no documented cases of people being killed as a result of hacking of medical equipment but there are many instances of people dying as a result of safety usability failures said Ross Anderson professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge You can find instances of pumps from the same manufacturer where the up key and the down key might be  and  on one pump and  and  on another  the design of some medical equipment interfaces is as careless as the design of aircraft cockpits was in the s And there have been tragic cases not just of kids being killed when they are given  times the dosage of morphine or whatever but of nurses who are blamed for this subsequently committing suicide
