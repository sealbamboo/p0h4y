For people with severe psychiatric illness taking an antipsychotic medication appears to drive down the risk of engaging in criminal violence a large study has found And for patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder a moodstabilizing medication has the same effect Those findings emerging from a large and comprehensive study conducted in Sweden suggest that when used by those with serious mental illness these widely prescribed medications not only tame delusions help restore emotional order and prevent relapses  they may also reduce the risk to the communities in which these patients live The  was published Wednesday in the medical journal Lancet The truth about mental illness and violence lies somewhere between two extremes In the wake of a mass shooting and the inevitable media focus on a perpetrators mental health it would be easy to assume that psychiatric illness is the principal cause of community violence But that is not the case researchers say On such occasions mental health advocatesfearing an uptick in stigma against those with mental illnesssay that those with psychiatric illness are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence leaving an impression that is not entirely accurate For patients with schizophrenia and other related psychoses a recent study estimated that the risk of perpetrating violence against other people is fourfold that of the general population That added risk appears to be concentrated mainly among those with major mental illness who also suffer from alcohol and substanceabuse disorders Against that backdrop little research has been conducted on how psychiatric medication affects the heightened risk of aggression or violence in some with mental illness and whether some medications might do a better job at driving down that risk Clinical trials that randomly assign people with diagnosed mental illness to treatment and nontreatment arms wouldnt be ethical And theres a flaw in studies that merely compare the rate of violent crime perpetrated by medicated psychiatric patients with that of similar patients taking none Other key differences in these two populationssay economic status or social supportmight account for the two groups different propensities to commit crime So in this study Oxford University psychiatrist Dr Seena Fazel and her Swedish collaborators decided to use Swedens comprehensive records of healthcare pharmaceutical dispensing and criminal cases to compare the arrest and conviction records of patients with schizophrenia bipolar disorder and related psychoses when they were on medications with their arrest and conviction records while off medication They also did a populationwide comparison of medicated patients violent criminal behavior rates with those of unmedicated patients Among the studys  subjectsall of them prescribed an antipsychotic or moodstabilizing drug at some point between  and routinely taking an antipsychotic drug was linked to a  reduced probability of being convicted of a drugrelated charge a  decline in convictions for any crime and a  reduction in the likelihood of arrest on suspicion of having committed a violent crime Subjects seeing these reductions took such newgeneration antipsychotics as quetiapine marketed at Seroquel olanzapine Zyprexa risperidone Risperdal and aripiprazole Abilify or older antipsychotics such as haloperidol  Haldol or chlorpromazine Thorazine Moodstabilizing drugsmedications ranging from lithium to neuroleptics such as valproic acid Depakote lamotrigine Lamictal carbamazepine Tegretol and oxcarbazepine Trileptalwere on average less powerfully linked to lower crime rates Compared with periods during which they were unmedicated when subjects were taking moodstabilizing drugs they were on average  less likely to be convicted of a drugrelated crime  less likely to be committed of any crime and  less likely to be arrested on suspicion of a violent crime When subjects taking one of these moodstabilizing drugs also had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder however the reduction in arrests and convictions was far more robust researchers said The studys authors acknowledge that their study design does not establish medication as the clear cause of a patients lower propensity to crime Other factorsincluding the more regular interaction with a psychiatrist that comes with medicationmight help explain the effect But the fact that violence was reduced across such a range of patients taking so many different kinds of drugs suggests that in addition to providing relief of psychotic symptoms these drugs may help tamp down behavioral traits of anger and hostility in many patients who take them the authors said
