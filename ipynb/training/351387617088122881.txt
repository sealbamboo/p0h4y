NEW YORK  About  people in Oregon do not have health insurance and Aaron Karjala is confident the states new online insurance exchange will be able to accommodate them when enrollment under President Barack Obamas healthcare reform begins on October  What Karjala the chief information officer at Cover Oregon does worry about however is what will happen if the entire population of Oregon   million  logs on that day just to check it out he said Or if millions of curious souls elsewhere wondering if Oregons insurance offerings are better than their states log on causing Cover Oregon to crash in a blur of spinning hourglasses and color wheels and an epidemic of frozen screens  Multiply that by another  states and the District of Columbia all of which will open health insurance exchanges under Obamacare that same day and you get some idea of what could go publicly and disastrously wrong  Obamacare formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA could fail for many reasons including participation by too few of the uninsured and a shortage of doctors to treat those who do sign up But because its core is governmentrun marketplaces selling health insurance online the likeliest reason for failure at the opening bell is information technology snafus say experts who are helping with the rollout  Although IT is the single most expensive ingredient of the exchanges with eightfigure contracts to build them experts expect bugs errors and crashes In April Obama himself predicted glitches and bumps when the exchanges open for business  This is a  implementation said Dan Maynard chief executive of Connecture a software developer that is providing the shopping and enrollment functions for several states insurance exchanges From an IT perspective s come out with a lot of defects Everyone is waiting for something to go wrong  Two states that intended to build their own exchanges Idaho and New Mexico announced this spring that because of the tight timeline and daunting challenges they would have the federal government operate their IT systems  Nothing like this in IT has ever been done to this complexity or scale and with a timeline that put it behind schedule almost before the ink was dry said Rick Howard research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner  The potential for problems will begin as soon as wouldbe buyers log onto their state exchange Theyll enter their name birth date address and other identifying information Then comes the first IT handoff Is this person who she says she is  To check that credit bureau Experian will check the answers against its voluminous external databases which include information from utility companies and banks on peoples spending and other history and generate questions The customer will be asked which of several addresses he previously lived at for example whether his car has one of several proffered license plate numbers and what color his old Volvo was  Its similar to the system that verifies identity for accessing personal Social Security information If someone gets a question wrong he will be referred to Experians help desk and if that fails may be asked to submit documentation to prove he is who he claims to be  The next step is determining if the customer is eligible for federal subsidies to pay for insurance She is if she is a citizen and her income which she will enter is less than four times the federal poverty level To verify this the exchange pings the federal data services hub which is being built by Quality Software Services Inc under a  million contract with the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS  The query arrives at the hub which does not actually store information and is routed to online servers at the Internal Revenue Service for income verification and at the Department of Homeland Security for a citizenship check  The answers must be returned in real time before the wouldbe buyer loses patience and logs off If the reported income doesnt match the IRSs records the applicant may have to submit pay stubs  These federal computer systems have never been connected before so its anyones guess how well theyll communicate  The challenge for states said Jinnifer Wattum director of Eligibility and Exchange Solutions at Xeroxs government healthcare unit is that they have to build the interfaces needed with the federal data services hub without knowing what this system will look like That makes the task akin to making a key for a lock that doesnt exist yet  CMSs contractors are working to finish the hub but much remains to be accomplished within a relatively short amount of time concluded a report from the Government Accountability Office GAO the investigative arm of Congress in June CMS spokesman Brian Cook said the hub would be ready by September and that the beta version had been tested for its ability to interact with the exchanges Oregon and Maryland are building  The federal hub has to verify even more arcane data such as whether the insurance offered to a buyer through his job is unaffordable in which case he may qualify for federal subsidies and whether the buyer is in prison in which case she is exempt from the mandate to purchase insurance  If someones income qualifies him for Medicaid or his children for the Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP software has to divert him from the ACA exchange and into those systems Many of the computers handling Medicaid and CHIP enrollment are as IT people diplomatically put it legacy systems meaning old even decades old  Many are mainframes lacking the connectivity of cloud computing They typically process eligibility requests in days not seconds  The legacy systems rely on daily or weekly batch files to pass information back and forth and often require followup phone calls said Wattum of Xerox which is working to configure Nevadas exchange so it can interface with the federal hub  A well call you message is unacceptable under Obamacare which has a no wrong door goal A buyer must never come to a dead end If she is diverted to Medicaid for instance she must not be required to resubmit information let alone wait a week for an answer about whether shes now enrolled  State IT systems must therefore be interoperable and integrated with an exchange Medicaid and CHIP to allow consumers to easily switch from private insurance to Medicaid and CHIP said an April report from the Government Accountability Office GAO the investigative arm of Congress  To make all those systems communicate the state exchanges must either develop entirely new systems or use application programming interfaces APIs that work with the legacy systems to exchange data in real time APIs are programming instructions for accessing Webbased software applications  GAOs Stan Czerwinski compares the necessary connectivity to adapters that let American electronics work with European outlets  State officials told the GAO that verifying eligibility enrolling buyers and interfacing with legacy systems are the most onerous aspects of developing their exchanges given the age and limited functionality of current state systems  A key goal for exchange officials is keeping wouldbe buyers in the portal so they dont give up and use a states ACA call center which could quickly be swamped  To avoid this Oregon brought in potential users to test design prototypes recorded what people did and where they had trouble and tweaked the consumer interface to make it as userfriendly as possible said Karjala  Even with that if you have a family of four and youre eligible for a tax credit to offset your premium he said you could be sitting at the computer for a long time  What everyone hopes to avoid is a repeat of the early days of the Medicare prescriptiondrug program in  Some seniors who tried to sign up for a plan were mistakenly enrolled in several while others had the wrong premium amounts deducted from their Social Security checks  Another challenge is capacity Websites regularly crash when too many people try to access them  I had no choice but to be extremely conservative in estimates of how many simultaneous users Cover Oregon has to be prepared for Karjala said Building capacity is the only way to avoid the spinning hourglass or the site freezing so in our performance testing were seeing what happens if the whole US population came to Cover Oregon to check it out  This summer state exchanges will test their ability to communicate with the federal data hub whose security frameworks and connectivity protocols are still works in progress But whether Obamacare  flies wont be known until the new health plans take effect on January  Robert Laszewski president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates Inc a consulting firm said he wouldnt be surprised if some patients showing up at doctors offices next year with Obamacare policies are told their insurers never heard of them  Caroline Humer contributed to
