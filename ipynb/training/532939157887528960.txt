For years, patient advocates and families have lobbied Congress for more funds to combat rare diseases. But to what extent does lobbying make a difference when Congress sets appropriations and the U.S. National Institutes of Health makes funding decisions?. A new study suggests lobbying by private groups does, indeed, influence federal funding for rare disease research. Every dollar spent on lobbying generated Congressional support in the form of soft earmarks, which are passages in an appropriations bill that urge or encourage spending but do not carry the rule of law. In this instance, the term refers to providing funding for NIH research into particular diseases.
