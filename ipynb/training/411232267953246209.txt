With just a few weeks left before a deadline to get health coverage lingering bugs lurk in the part of HealthCaregov that you cant see And since time is running out to get things right health officials on Thursday urged insurance companies to cover some enrollees even if their premium checks havent come in Under the laws guidelines consumers have to sign up for a health insurance exchange  and pay their first months premium  by the end of December if they want coverage in January The short time period presents a number of challenges says Robert Zirkelbach a spokesman for Americas Health Insurance Plans an industry trade group   electronic files sent from HealthCaregovs back end to insurance companies  must have accurate and complete data in order for a consumer to be considered fully enrolled The White House projected confidence this week We have a team of experts working both through technological fixes but also through some elbow grease going through and confirming that that information is conveyed accurately and completely to confirm that theyll be signed up for health care and eligible to get covered on Jan  White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday But the Obama administration estimates that  in  forms is still problematic an improvement from  in  bad forms in October and November And late Thursday health officials pressed insurance companies to grant consumers   Since health plans werent supposed to start coverage until theyre paid anyone mailing in a check will have to get it in quickly So the Department of Health and Human Services issued new guidelines encouraging insurers to go ahead and cover people in January even if their payments dont come in until later in the month So far the health plans I have spoken to have seen only about  of their enrollees pay their premium health industry consultant Bob Laszewski   Thursday The situation everyone wants to avoid is a situation in which consumers think theyre enrolled when theyre not Or the situation where they find out that theyre not enrolled when they try to schedule an appointment to see a doctor Zirkelbach says Then theres the work of reconciling the government enrollment records with the data received by insurance companies I dont think you can be confident that everyone who is enrolled will have a plan until we can do a reconciliation between the government records and the insurance company records Laszewski told NPR The work of reconciling files just got started Wednesday when health officials sent spreadsheets of their latest enrollment data to insurers to crosscheck records Zirkelbach says its a significant step It will for the first time give us the size and scope of the technical challenges that exist he says For all the focus on technology in recent weeks Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says that reconciliation work is getting done manually We are in the process of actually handmatching individuals with insurance companies she told lawmakers in a Wednesday hearing With the deadlines getting closer and December enrollments surging ahead of the deadline whatever remaining challenges exist will need to be resolved in a hurry You should probably call your insurance plan the one you believe youve enrolled in Just verify that youve in fact enrolled Laszewski says
