Most women diagnosed with breast cancer when theyre  or younger are choosing   rather than more limited and breastconserving   a study of women in Massachusetts finds Moreover most of those choosing mastectomy elect to have the other noncancerous breast removed too These   at the American Society Clinical Oncologys annual meeting in Chicago The research involved  Massachusetts women and may not be nationally representative But study authors say its in line with other studies suggesting that many of todays breast cancer patients are choosing mastectomy Sixtytwo percent of women  and younger in this study opted for mastectomy One in seven breast cancer patients falls in this age group Thats in sharp contrast to their mothers generation which saw the rise of lumpectomies in reaction to a belief that mastectomies were unnecessarily traumatic and disfiguring  and mounting evidence that lumpectomies resulted in equivalent survival The new research also documents a growing trend toward prophylactic mastectomy  removal of a noncancerous breast after discovering breast cancer in the other one In  fewer than  percent of women with breast cancer chose this option In the new study  percent chose prophylactic mastectomy in the noncancerous breast And considering just women who chose mastectomy at all more than  percent had prophylactic removal of the noncancerous breast All the women in the study had been diagnosed with stage I II and II breast cancer The study did not look at women with a socalled stagezero condition called   short for ductal carcinoma in situ The study also didnt include women breast cancer affected both breasts or had metastasized to other organs Theres no difference in survival between mastectomy and lumpectomy among women with stage I II or III breast cancer study author Shoshana Rosenberg tells Shots These are women who had a choice and  percent chose mastectomy She and her colleagues at   and other institutions are trying to understand why Some of the reasons they uncovered are clear and supported by data Others are less so For instance women who have a mutation in one of the genes called   were much more likely to choose mastectomy or double mastectomy That fits with evidence that they have a very high lifetime risk of cancer recurrence But women who had a mother or sister with breast cancer were no more likely to choose mastectomy Rosenbergsays the study didnt find younger women choosing lumpectomy because of concerns about body image You would expect that to bias them toward breastconserving surgery she says But clearly among women in this study thats not the case From our perspective the most interesting finding is that role that anxiety plays in the decisionRosenberg says Women who scored high on a standard test for anxiety were more likely to choose mastectomy This makes her worry that women anxious about the best choice are not necessarily contextualizing their true risk  not understanding or not knowing  because theres no difference in survival so it really shouldnt make a difference which surgery to choose Another clue to whether women are aware of the survival data Those who say they made the decision themselves rather than sharing the decision with their doctor were more likely to choose mastectomy If theyre making this decision on their own its hard to really know if they know all the facts and interpreting the risks accuratelyRosenberg says Weve done some other research indicating that women overestimate their risks of cancer recurrence or death The study also finds that women were more likely to choose mastectomy if they had a tumor thats   if their cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes if they had two or more children and if they were leaner That last factor probably reflects the fact that some heavier women arent good candidates for breast reconstruction surgery so theyre more likely to choose lumpectomy But the study doesnt answer other questions about mastectomyvslumpectomy that may factor into many womens decisions For instance some women may be concerned that theyll get a poorer cosmetic result from lumpectomy and radiation than from mastectomy followed by reconstruction The study doesnt address that or concern about the sideeffects or burden of weekslong radiation treatments that usually follow lumpectomy The study also doesnt address economic issues  such as the cost of one procedure versus another or whether it makes a difference if women have insurance coverage Rosenberg says the point isnt to question whether many younger women who choose mastectomy are misguided Its a high rate of mastectomy but were not trying to say women who choose mastectomy are making a bad decision she says We just want to make sure its an informed decision You want to make sure the patient understands the benefits and harms of each option
