Having breast cancer four years ago taught Letty Cottin Pogrebin  a lot about being a good friend to someone who is sick Some people knew how to strike just the right note offering love and support without hovering Others rubbed her nerves raw with excessive solicitousness when all she wanted was to be left alone Ms Pogrebin eventually realized that many interactions surrounding her illness were shaped by obligation and politeness not by honesty and directness  qualities she dearly values So this longtime journalist and activist  a cofounder of Ms magazine and more than a dozen womens groups and author of several books  decided to write about her experience and those of her many other fellow patients at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center hoping others might learn from it I caught up with Ms Pogrebin by phone in Los Angeles as she traveled the country speaking to groups about her new book How to Be A Friend to a Friend Whos Sick  Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity  When you were ill with breast cancer back in the fall of  and early  what did you most want from your friends  I wanted them to really tune into my moods Because Im somebody who sometimes needs a lot of love and sometimes needs to be left alone And the illness heightened those extremes Being sick magnifies everyones essential characteristics   What kinds of responses were most helpful to you  The people who asked Would it be good if I came over now would you rather I dont come over at all or would you rather I come on Saturday And the people who said Im going to bring you a present so you might as well tell me what you want I learned through these interactions that you can be direct and candid  on both sides    What kinds of responses were most offputting  That everyday question How are you with the portentous overlay of tragedy You would say Fine And then they would say How are you really with a sort of sanctimony bordering on pity In normal discourse its common to say How are you  And we all say Great fine But when a sick person is asked How are you we have to calculate how much were going to tell and how much someone really wants to know If it turns out someone is just going through the motions in asking that leaves a really sour taste in your mouth  So whats a friend supposed to do   Ask What are you feeling  That will elicit a much more honest answer  Then the person whos been sick can say Im really depressed and tired of people asking me how I am and I want to normalize my life Thats how I felt I really didnt want to revisit my diagnosis and the fear Id felt  What did other people with cancer tell you they like to hear from friends  Its so good to see you is something people love to hear Because that speaks volumes and its a truth between friends   Try to get at the truth of this enterprise Which is I want to make you feel better and I feel bad that youre sick or suffering Just say the simplest thing Im sorry If youre not naturally empathetic say Im not good at this I need you to tell me whats helpful and whats not  I hope youre not suffering but if you are tell me if theres anything I can do I really mean it If I had to pick three things to say it would be Tell me whats helpful and whats not Tell me when you want to be alone and when you want company And Tell me what to bring and what to leave  You ask people to understand their own response to illness before they reach out to a friend  People need this layer of honesty so that when theyre in a hospital or a sick room they can monitor themselves and realize theyre pulling back getting too close appearing too upset or being too anxious  And that these responses are really about them not the sick person  And that its up to them to control that Take a pause a beat before you say what you think you want to say to someone whos sick Stop and think Would I want someone to say to me what Im about to say to you  Are there things people should never say   Oh yes  Believe it or not friends say things like Is it terminal  Never do that  Never say What do you think you did to cause this as if it were your friends fault  Never say God only gives as much as you can handle  Are there times when words dont suffice  In the sick room when youre nervous the tendency is to overtalk And I had to learn to live in the silence It isnt easy for me  Im a big talker Sometimes the nicest thing to do might be to say Im just going to stay with you for a few minutes and we dont have to talk People respond to that  And that silence can be a bonding silence not an awkward silence  What about when someones died Thats often awkward  Tell the truth Say something like I feel so sad for you And if you have a memory give it Tell how youll always remember how beautifully this womans husband played the cello or how his smile could light up the room or how your friends mother had the most magnificent voice Something that establishes that the person left a mark on your life and acknowledges the meaningfulness of the life thats just ended
