A few years back a big clinical trial showed that certain nutritional supplements could slow the progression of macular degeneration and reduce the risk of vision loss  There was great interest among patients recalled Ingrid Scott an ophthalmologist at the Penn State College of Medicine This was big news Agerelated macular degeneration is the leading cause of severe vision impairment and blindness in older Americans  For the great majority of those who have it theres no effective treatment And it generally worsens with time Patients with agerelated macular degeneration are extremely motivated to do whatever they can Dr Scott said   The trial showed that one thing they could do was to take a specific formula of vitamins minerals and other nutrients  Manufacturers quickly responded with a host of overthecounter pills making a host of claims  Now my drugstore and supermarket  and yours  have shelves of products that supposedly help people with macular degeneration and other supplements that promote or maintain or protect eye health Do they  Dr Scott and her colleagues recently reviewed the ingredients and found reasons to proceed with caution First a primer   The clinical trial called AREDS AgeRelated Eye Disease Study conducted at  medical centers around the country by the National Eye Institute found that a supplement   by  percent over six years  The effective formula  a highdose combination of vitamins C and E beta carotene and zinc oxide with a dash of copper But the benefits of the nutrients only apply to certain stages of the disease Dr Scott pointed out  The formula could slow the progression in patients with either intermediate agerelated macular degeneration or with advanced macular degeneration in only one eye   It didnt work for people with milder forms of the disease or with advanced agerelated macular degeneration in both eyes  It didnt prevent people from getting the disease in the first place  It didnt cure anybody  But it was the best doctors could offer most patients with macular degeneration apart from lifestyle modifications like stopping smoking Last year a followup study called AREDS  examined a formula without beta carotene because its associated with higher lung cancer rates in smokers replacing it with the nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin and lowering the zinc content The revised formula    So youll find those key initials AREDS and AREDS  on a number of supplements sold in stores these days  Patients with moderate macular degeneration or advanced degeneration in one eye can take either though smokers should go with AREDS  But when Dr Scott and her fellow researchers looked carefully at the supplements ingredients in a study just published in the journal Ophthalmology they found that most bestselling products   Some contained the right ingredients but not the right doses  Some added other stuff selenium B vitamins grapeseed extract that hasnt been shown to slow macular degeneration and might actually reduce the effectiveness of the ingredients that do work Of the  supplements that market research shows were topsellers only four duplicated the AREDS formula   Moreover most manufacturers didnt bother to point out that the AREDS results dont pertain to everyone with macular degeneration and that therefore some consumers wont benefit from these products    You can read more on the National Eye Institutes   and   Manufacturers can get away with this because such products arent considered drugs The Food and Drug Administration doesnt test or approve supplements It may surprise people to know that dietary supplements are not evaluated or regulated at all for efficacy or safety Dr Scott said   When manufacturers say products that dont use the AREDS formulas protect or support your eyes these claims are very vague Dr Scott said  Theres insufficient data to support them That puts the onus on health professionals to prescribe specific brands that contain the proven formulas and on consumers to shop carefully  These supplements dont come cheap At my local CVS youd pay  for the pill size of PreserVision Eye Vitamin AREDS Formula Soft Gels  Taken as directed youll pay  or so a year  out of pocket of course because Medicare Part D doesnt cover supplements But at least thats one of the products that duplicated the AREDS formula Dr Scott and her colleagues reported Alternatively you could pay  for  tablets of ICAPS Eye Vitamin Lutein  Zeaxanthin Formula at my local supermarket  Taking four a day as recommended youll spend nearly  a year but you wont get the proper formula  The researchers found that it was one of the products with amounts of AREDS ingredients lower than those used in the studies proving they work So Im passing along the findings of Dr Scott and her colleagues which are based not on laboratory analyses just on what the manufacturers themselves said on product websites and packages The report didnt include Walmart products These four products duplicated the AREDS or AREDS formulas Other bestselling supplements didnt follow the AREDS formulae including Eye Science Macular Health Formula several products from Ocuvite and other ICAPS formulations They had lower doses of the proven ingredients or included substances not shown to be effective in these largescale clinical trials
