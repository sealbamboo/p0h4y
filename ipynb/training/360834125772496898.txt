
 Scientists reviewed each issue of The New England Journal of Medicine from  through  and found  studies examining an established clinical practice In  of them the currently used drug or procedure was found to be either no better or even worse than the one previously used The report   More than  percent of established practices studied were found to be ineffective or harmful  percent beneficial and the remaining  percent unknown Among the practices found to be ineffective or harmful were the routine use of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women highdose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant a complex and expensive treatment for breast cancer that was found to be no better than conventional chemotherapy and intensive glucose lowering in Type  diabetes patients in intensive care which not only failed to reduce cardiovascular events but actually increased mortality In some instances doctors routinely refused to give beneficial therapies despite a lack of evidence that they were harmful Vaccines were unnecessarily withheld from multiple sclerosis patients in the belief that they increased flareups women with lupus were denied oral contraceptives for fear they increased the severity of the disease and epidural anesthesia was delayed during childbirth on the theory it increased the rate of Caesarean sections Yet good studies showed that none of these fears was justified Contradicted practices dont disappear immediately said the lead author Dr Vinay Prasad Theres an inertia a year period of time when the contradicted procedure continues to be practiced Dr William E Boden chief of medicine at the Stratton VA Medical Center in Albany who was not involved in the work found the study useful and provocative Its challenging us to look at things weve done and attempt to find whether theres evidence to support their use he said Theres going to be increasing pressure to come forward with making sure that the health care dollars were allocating are being well utilized Dr Prasad chief fellow in medical oncology at the National Cancer Institute said that new medical appliances present a special problem Devices are particularly bad because they can be approved if theyre similar to ones already on the market he said He cited as an example the SwanGanz catheter a device threaded into the heart to monitor heart function and blood flow It gives accurate information Dr Prasad said but that information doesnt help We continue to introduce new catheters all the time lacking good evidence that they work This is a tremendous waste of resources Often doctors persist with procedures that lack evidence because they seem to make sense Dr Prasad said They all sound good if you talk about the mechanisms he said You have cholesterolclogged arteries it makes sense that if you open them up it will help But when that was studied it didnt improve survival  Patients too like to talk about mechanisms Dr Prasad added They tend to gravitate toward the nuts and bolts  what does it do how does it work he said But the real question is Does it work What evidence is there that it does what you say it does What trials show that it actually works You shouldnt ask how does it work but whether it works at all
