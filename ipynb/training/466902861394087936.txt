Alec Baldwin you were salmoning The actor was   for riding his bicycle the wrong way on a oneway street Cyclists use the term salmoning to describe a biker going against the stream on a oneway bike lane Surely the definition can be broadened to include Baldwins infraction While salmoning is a funny word its a dangerous action In a bike lane it can bring on an unwelcome game of chicken when a wrongway cyclist heads toward cyclists going the proper way Salmoning also creates a potential hazard for motorists crossing a bike lane via a legal cutthrough Theyd assume they only need to scan in one direction for incoming pedalers Some cities discourage salmoning with clever   like this in London If you can read this you are biking the wrong way In honor of   Ive collected a few examples of cycling jargon thats all about safety  Thats the space right next to the parked car lane If a motorist opens the door a passing cyclist can get   Cyclists have been severely injured or   from hitting the door or being bounced into traffic In many municipalities it is illegal to open a door into traffic which includes bicycles says   advocacy coordinator for the   When riding in a bike lane up against parked cars ride on the outermost third of the lane nearing the white line he suggests In other situations keep  to  feet from parked cars putting you out of the zone or at least far enough away that you can take evasive action if a door opens  A cyclist is riding in a bike lane The bike lane ends In the middle of the lane of traffic ahead sits a stenciled cyclist and a couple of chevrons That painted symbol is a    a shared lane arrow Its only been around a decade or so reminding motorists there will be cyclists ahead says   president of the   Of course cyclists have the right to ride in any lane skeptics worry that drivers might think they dont have to share the lane if theres no sharrow The jurys still out on some of these signs says Clarke As a commuting cyclist I share the sharrow view of DC commuter Evan Wilder I imagine the motorist thinking Oh right its OK that the bikers in the middle of the road   Thats a box painted between the crosswalk and the white line that shows motorists where to stop with bikes stenciled within its borders The benefit A cyclist can easily switch from one side of the street to the other to make turns This kind of arrangement is called an   in the Netherlands where it began and the bikeloving Dutch actually have two traffic signals at intersections one for bicyclists in the box to give them a head start followed by the signal for motorists  Thats a night rider who wears dark clothes and eschews bike lights Not only a bad idea but against the law in every state  a white front light and rear reflector or light are required  A shoal is a school of fish Or a collection of cyclists at a red light Thats where shoaling happens A cyclist comes up to the light eyeballs a cyclist already there thinks Im faster than that person and moves ahead But who can truly judge a cyclists speed potential Maybe the person youve shoaled is faster than you and will want to pass you once the light changes To avoid triggering such unnecessary passes not to mention road rage its safer for people to wait at the light with everybody else and make the pass in the lane says Billing Or if youre really in a rush just ask the other cyclist Hey Im late is it OK to get in front of you  Since  Idaho law has given cyclists the right to treat a stop sign as a yield slow down and roll through if traffic allows and to treat a red light as a stop sign look both ways and proceed if no cars are coming Thats the   Its the law   in Idaho although there are a few local variations Several Colorado towns have adopted the stop sign  yield portion And in some states if a red light only turns green when a sensor senses a car a cyclist can proceed after  seconds or so The Idaho stop is   In Idaho notes Clarke the sky has not fallen theres not a terrible crash rate It probably legitimizes whats already happening Then again in a world where drivers think bicyclists are renegades Clarke thinks a big push for the Idaho stop would not go over well Red lights should be inviolate he says but the mechanics of stop signs are different  having to put your foot down at every stop sign is often pointless Most cyclists can roll through without any harm Meanwhile I bet Alec Baldwin has done his share of Idaho stops In fact I bet just about every cyclist has except maybe the cyclist who once yelled at me for doing an Idaho stop at a light Youre making cyclists look like they dont obey traffic laws
