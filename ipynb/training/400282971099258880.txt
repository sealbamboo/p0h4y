Natasha Gadinsky  says she doesnt have any regrets from her years in college But the time she hooked up with a guy at Brown University does come close After his own orgasm that night she said he showed no interest in her satisfaction The next time they got together it happened again He didnt even care said Ms Gadinsky a health care case manager in New York City I dont think he tried at all He fell asleep immediately leaving her staring at the ceiling I was really frustrated she said Like generations before them many young women like Ms Gadinsky are finding that casual sex does not bring the physical pleasure that men more often experience New research suggests why Women are less likely to have orgasms during uncommitted sexual encounters than in serious relationships At the same time researchers say that young women are becoming equal partners in the hookup culture often just as willing as young men to venture into sexual relationships without emotional ties The notion of sexual liberation where men and women both had equal access to casual sex assumed a comparable likelihood of that sex being pleasurable said   a professor of neuroendocrinology at Emory University who studies female desire But that part of the playing field isnt level  led by Justin R Garcia an evolutionary biologist at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and researchers at Binghamton University found that women were twice as likely to reach orgasm from intercourse or oral sex in serious relationships as in hookups The paper was presented at the annual meeting of the   and at the Annual Convention for Psychological Science this year Similarly a   found that about  percent of women had an orgasm during their last hookup involving intercourse while  percent of men did The research was led by   a sociologist at New York University who studies the dynamics of casual sex By contrast roughly three quarters of women in the survey said they had an orgasm the last time they had sex in a committed relationship We attribute that to practice with a partner which yields better success at orgasm and we also think the guys care more in a relationship Dr England said Indeed young men surveyed in Dr Englands study often admitted that they are less focused on sexually pleasing a woman they are seeing casually than one they are dating Duvan Giraldo  a software technician in Elmhurst Queens said that satisfying a partner is always my mission but added Im not going to try as hard as when Im with someone I really care about And with women hes just met he said it can be awkward to talk about specific needs in the bedroom Youre practically just strangers at that point he said The lack of guidance is common Dr England said Women are not feeling very free in these casual contexts to say what they want and need she said Part of the problem she added is that women still may be stigmatized for having casual sex Dr Garcia said Weve been sold this bill of goods that were in an era where people can be sexually free and participate equally in the hookup culture The fact is that not everyones having a good time What women need to achieve orgasm can be very different from what they find in casual sex Roughly onequarter of women reliably experience orgasm through intercourse alone according to a review of  studies conducted by   a professor of the history and philosophy of science at Indiana University in her  book The Case of the Female Orgasm Bias in the Science of Evolution Another third of women rarely or never have orgasms from intercourse Vanessa Martini  from Marin County Calif learned early on that most men she slept with casually would not intuit her needs I havent hooked up with anybody who was so cavalier as to just like not even care she said But I think most of them were somewhat baffled that it would require more than just them thrusting Ms Martini said she was never taught how to have good sex let alone how to ask for what she needs The education she received in school was aimed at stopping teenagers from having sex at all there wasnt much discussion of arousal Ms Martini said most cultural representations of sex left out the messy details The way we view sex in porn and in movies and in books people arent talking to each other like Oh my foots falling asleep we need to move she said Communicating about those particulars is especially tricky in hookups When one awkward exchange or misread text message could end the arrangement altogether theres a certain amount of pressure to tread softly Ms Martini said You have to balance a lot of things in your brain like whats more important to me  just getting off or do I actually want to have a connection with this person  a research scientist at Indiana University said that for women casual sex is exciting precisely because it is spontaneous She compared a hookup with having dinner at a friends house You wouldnt be like This is what I want and this is how I want you to make it and I want you to use only this amount of basil she said Some women confronted with these roadblocks are redefining casual sex and the physical pleasure that they expect from it Sex without strings has carnal and emotional benefits that dont depend on reaching orgasm they say Something we dont talk about is why having an orgasm is the main goal or the only goal of sex Dr Herbenick said Who are we to say women should be having orgasms Casey Romaine a yearold Bard College graduate living in Nashville Tenn said that more than sex hookups are often much more about two people giving each other the sense of intimacy however brief they need to get through the week Its just sort of like having the experience and having somebody that you can call or you can like whose house you can spend the night in if you dont feel like you want to be going home alone she said I think a lot of the time it almost is weirdly irrelevant whether or not the sex is actually good For Kim Huynh a yearold filmmaker in San Francisco sacrificing a reliable orgasm for sex without the burden of commitment was a conscious decision After a couple of relationships in college Ms Huynh spent about five years without a serious boyfriend and many onagain offagain flings As far as my ability to climax consistently thats something I was able to have in my monogamous relationships that I never had in less committed circumstances she said Yet mediocre sex was a small price to pay for the freedom to be able to enjoy it all The physical aspect of a tryst with a relative stranger was gratifying she said even if her chances of reaching orgasm were limited When her partners performance was lackluster she still took pride in her own sexual prowess To sort of know yourself to be sort of skilled in a way or to be able to see someone elses pleasure that was your own doing I think theres definitely something very empowering about that she said
