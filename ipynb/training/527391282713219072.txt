Atlantas Emory University Hospital got the first call at the end of July An American doctor whod been treating Ebola patients in Liberia was now terribly sick with the virus himself In just  hours   would be coming   Then almost immediately the staff learned that a second Ebola patient was also on the way   first thought was What do we need today in order to care for these patients tomorrow In the three months since Emory has treated four Ebola patients all survived Most recently Dallas nurse   spent more than a week in a special treatment unit at Emory before being discharged in restored health and good spirits Tuesday The general dogma in our industry in July was that if patients got so ill they required dialysis or ventilator support there was no purpose in doing those interventions because they would invariably die Dr Bruce Ribner who heads Emorys Ebola team told reporters at a news conference Tuesday Emory he said proved instead that aggressively treating the illness can be effective Emorys plan to treat patients who have diseases like Ebola actually began  years ago Thats when the Atlantabased Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started working with the hospital to create a special isolation unit Since then Varkey says a core team of health workers has trained yearly and held practice drills every six months to stay sharp  ready for whatever infectious disease comes their way Once in  the unit was used for a suspected   case that turned out to be negative But in July with two Ebola patients on the way it quickly became clear that Emorys specially trained team was too small says   the hospitals chief of nursing Critical care nurses volunteered to help fill in the gaps but werent part of the core group that had long practiced for this day The expanded team had to quickly train  and not everybody made the cut Once all the team members were in place they focused on supportive care of these patients  administering IV fluids and preventing infections The true cure for Ebola virus is keeping the patient alive long enough to develop the antibodies that will cause them to get over the infection Varkey says Emory learned lessons big and small from each case he says For example just increasing the amount of working space around patients sick with Ebola helped a lot he says So did having a hand sanitizer dispenser available that wouldnt require us to actually touch it with a gloved hand In Emorys experience nurses on the Ebola unit who started out on eighthour shifts preferred hour rotations instead And caring for the emotional health of patients in isolation is as important as promoting physical wellbeing the staff learned Team members worked hard to coordinate their efforts From top administrators to waste management crews to pharmacists and lab technicians  every department played a role Every morning the team meets to discuss what worked well what might be refined Feistritzer says looking for lessons that might be put into practice the next shift or the next day The Emory team doesnt claim to have all the right answers Varkey says But what they do know theyre sharing Our entire   in terms of our protocols he says is now available to any person who wants to access that on the Web Those protocols went live a week ago So far more than  people have registered to get access to them
