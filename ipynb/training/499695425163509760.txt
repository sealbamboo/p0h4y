Americans are accustomed to being nagged about salt Were told we consume too much  particularly from processed foods And that all this salt can increase the risk of high blood pressure heart attacks and strokes Turns out its the same story most places around the globe Worldwide people consume an average of  milligrams of sodium a day according to a   published in the   And though there are regional daily differences ranging from about  milligrams to  milligrams the global average is nearly double what the World Health Organization   This salt overload is taking its toll The study concludes that about  million deaths from cardiovascular disease each year can be attributed to sodium consumption Thats remarkably high thats almost  in  of all cardiovascular deaths around the world Dariush Mozaffarian a study author and dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University told us by phone This suggests that a single factor in the diet salt could be contributing to almost  percent of the cardiovascular burden To get a picture of global salt consumption Mozaffarian and his colleagues collected survey data on sodium intake from  countries And they analyzed more than  prior studies to assess the effects of sodium on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease So where are the global hot spots when it comes to death by salt This study finds that   the proportion of deaths from heart attacks and strokes attributable to sodium ranges quite a bit In Canada the United States Australia and New Zealand about  percent of cardiovascular deaths among people  and younger are linked to high salt intake But theres a wide band in the study map stretching from Eastern Europe all the way across into Central Asia and East Asia There the percentage of cardiovascular deaths attributed to sodium consumption jumps up to  to  percent What seems to be linking those countries in this band  is that this is the Old Silk Road trade route where people traveled many distances and needed salt to preserve their food says Mozaffarian Centuries later this tradition of eating saltpreserved foods remains strong Not all researchers are convinced that consuming high levels of sodium is harmful In fact the same issue of the   published another study that questions whether recommendations for low sodium consumption are valid for everyone The study found the link between sodium and cardiovascular disease is strongest when blood pressure is elevated  and that potassium a nutrient found in fruits vegetables and beans can help lower blood pressure The study suggests that if you dont have high blood pressure it might be okay to consumer  milligrams of sodium a day as is typical among Americans The author of this study Dr Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Canada told the AP that its better to focus on healthy patterns of eating instead of a single element That is something everyone can rally around Yusuf told the AP The new studies may add to the debate among scientists policymakers and public health experts who have been putting pressure on the restaurant and food industries to incrementally reduce sodium levels
