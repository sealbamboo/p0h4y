After Ryan Kwanten moved to Los Angeles a dozen years ago he discovered what he considers the perfect local gym the great outdoors Best known for playing Southern heartthrob Jason Stackhouse on HBOs True Blood the actor says he stays in shape hiking surfing skiing or engaging in just about any sporting endeavor that doesnt involve formally working out At age  he survived a shark attack while surfing and was back on the water the next day In his native Australia he burnished his land and sea skills in lifeguard competitions For his starring role in the romantic comedy The Right Kind of Wrong he happily learned to hang glide It was very much built in our culture in Australia and it was probably far easier for my mum to deal with my brothers and me when we were entertained by our sports events I did everything from boxing to triathlon to surfing pretty much anything that was outdoors My dad coached me for a long time in surf lifesaving same as being a lifeguard here It happened so fast I fell trying to do a move and put my hand in the water hoping to hit sand but my hand wouldnt budge when I pulled on it When I yanked it again there was movement between my legs and I jumped on my board and sort of paddled in The lifeguard came running and identified the bite marks It was the kind of shark that has more gums than teeth so theoretically I got gummed by a shark I was a little hero for a week couldnt do anything wrong at home I worked that Tenacity is a great quality and I share that with Leo my character Leos sort of a relentless romantic and that drives him to go after what he believes in He has a crippling fear of heights and theres a hanggliding scene that is his monumental moment I had bungee jumped and jumped out of planes but had never hang glided so I had to train for it Im an adventure seeker so it was fun Ive always believed the harder you work the luckier you get That philosophy comes from the sporting endeavor Theres a certain amount of luck involved in succeeding at the craft of acting but you also have to work at it Honestly you name it and Ill try to compete Im not necessarily a trained tennis player but Im a pit bull  Ill chase down every ball and get it back into play Start by doing any little thing like taking the stairs instead of the elevator Stand instead of sitting down Walk while talking on the phone Develop a passion for a physical activity And if you do end up at the gym follow Bruce Lees philosophy Seek out the most unused piece of equipment  the chinup bar  because it provides the hardest workout
