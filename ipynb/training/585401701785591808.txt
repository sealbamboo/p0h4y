Accident and emergency units in England have missed the official waiting time target over the past three months by the biggest margin in a decade with  of patients being treated or discharged within four hours  testify to the relentless pressure on hospital AE departments as well as walkin and urgent care centres where patients go without appointments The government target is for  of those arrivals to be dealt with within four hours In the previous quarter to December   of patients were seen within four hours The performance is worse in hospital AE departments than in settings that tend to deal with less serious cases such as GP walkin centres Only  of patients in what are termed type  hospital settings were seen within four hours which is also a new low  down from  in the previous quarter The figures are politically embarrassing for the government but Dr Barbara Hakin national director of commissioning operations for NHS England said hospitals were doing well given the very high numbers of people arriving at AE The   has continued to deliver good services for patients with last week seeing the highest number of emergency admissions this year she said In the last  months we have seen more than  million patients at AE an increase of  on  with more than  million emergency admissions an increase of  on the previous year In the face of this intense and ongoing pressure our staff continued to admit or treat and discharge more than nine out of  patients within four hours This represents an incredible effort by NHS staff over the course of the year A significantly low point came in the week before Christmas  dropping to  of those turning up at the type  hospital AE departments Andy Burnham shadow health secretary said Theres only one person to blame for the AE crisis and thats David Cameron He has made it harder to get a GP appointment cut council social care budgets and wasted bn on a reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody voted for  If David Cameron gets back in his extreme spending cuts mean he cant protect the NHS and the crisis in AE will get even worse Labour has a better plan for the NHS We will recruit  more nurses and  more GPs paid for by a mansion tax on homes valued over m and we will guarantee GP appointments within  hours But a spokesman for the Conservatives said AE units across the UK faced unprecedented demand this winter but English AEs see  more patients a day within four hours than in  and perform better than Scotland Northern Ireland and Labourrun Wales so it is completely wrong for Labour to try to turn this into a political football  Thanks to a strong and growing economy we are investing bn in the front line next year to transform care in the community and take the pressure off hospitals  Dr Peter Carter chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said These figures demonstrate what nurses have been telling us for some time  the socalled winter pressures are now lasting all year round The ongoing strain on AE departments is a symptom of problems elsewhere in the health service and it cannot be solved in isolation AEs are seeing more patients than ever before and this will continue to be the case unless there is sustained investment in community services and a reversal of the cuts to staff like district nurses who keep patients out of hospitals Christina McAnea head of health at Unison which has a variety of healthcare workers among its members said patients and staff deserved better Its bad enough that some sick and injured people were having to wait for more than four hours in the depths of winter  a time when demand on the NHS was at its peak But for that still to be the case now that spring is here shows just how stretched AE departments have become she said
