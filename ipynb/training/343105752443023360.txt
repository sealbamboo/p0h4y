Goody Tyler isnt just any hardcore Great Salt Lake swimmer Hes a certified   In December Tyler swam  mile in the lake when the water temperature was only  degrees the maximum temperature for an official ice swim Youre only allowed to wear one cap one pair of goggles and a Speedo Tyler says And thats it It took  minutes in the snowfringed lake and the yearold schoolteacher husband and father of two girls had more to prove than his own wacky toughness Tyler was about to undergo surgery for testicular cancer and begin  rounds of chemotherapy I actually felt the moment when my brain switched from fun cold swimming to okaythis is officially survival mode Tyler wrote in his   His body began to shut down as hypothermia set in Blood drained from his arms and legs to protect the core of his body and extremities became numb stumps A beautiful but profane thing happened at the same time Tyler wrote I started to get madreal MAD because cancer was taking away his ability to swim in the Great Salt Lake I didnt actually intend to do the ice mile that day he recalls now I just happened to go for it Tylers blog describes what happened next I then was chanting the full words F CancerF U Cancer over and over It worked I was so stinking mad that I started to swim faster His Salt Lake swimming buddies Gordon Gridley and Josh Green were there cheering him on It was a good thing too because after the swim Tyler couldnt stand up on his completely lifeless legs He had to be carried out of the water and into a waiting van The heater was blasting but even that didnt counter the cold Tyler was shaking violently and moaning from the pain So Gridley and Green drove the ice man to a warm shower at the marina The recovery was brutal he later wrote Ive never felt pain like that Tyler had trained for the swim by working out in the cold lake He actually favors cold water when the temperature rises much above  degrees it begins to feel too warm The experience he says helped him get through   Id spend hours and hours at a time being in cold water Tyler remembers You have to be able to tolerate being cold uncomfortable miserable cramps tired and hungry That was an advantage when chemo treatments began because you have to sit there for six hours at a time being cranky uncomfortable tired and hungry But I was used to being uncomfortable for hours at a time After the swim Tyler wrote I want something to LOOK BACK ON when Im miserable and use that as motivation to get better As he warmed up after the ice swim the emotional impact of the swim and his fight against cancer hit hard I cried like a baby in front of my  friends and felt no shame it At the time Tyler became the eighth American to complete a certified ice swim The first round of chemo began four days later Now chemo treatments are done and a jagged surgical scar begins just below his sternum extends down and around his navel and disappears beneath his swimsuit On his blog Tyler lists his goals for the year Goal  is BEAT CANCER And next to those words is this DONE Also on the list is a mile swim Thats at least  hours in the water
