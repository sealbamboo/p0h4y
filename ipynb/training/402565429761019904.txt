A pretty nightie a new lipstick a fresh toothbrush Doris Racher noticed that small things she had bought for her yearold mother Eryetha Mayberry a dementia patient at a nursing home in Oklahoma City had been disappearing Ms Racher assumed the culprit was another resident who sometimes wandered into her mothers room and fell asleep in her bed So in  Ms Racher placed a motionactivated camera in her mothers room It looked like an alarm clock and Ms Racher nearly forgot about it About two months later the family decided to pore through the recordings The camera had not caught the petty thief But it captured something else An aide stuffed latex gloves into Mrs Mayberrys mouth while another taunted her tapping her on the head laughing Hoisting her from her wheelchair they flung her on a bed One performed a few heavyhanded chest compressions My niece started bawling and couldnt watch anymore said Ms Racher  I was furious Mrs Mayberry died soon after On Nov  propelled by the outcry over the Mayberry case Oklahoma became the third state  along with New Mexico and Texas  to explicitly permit residents in longterm care facilities to maintain surveillance cameras in their rooms In the last two years at least five states have considered similar legislation Although some states have administrative guidelines for electronic monitoring most legislative efforts have stalled because of questions about liability and in particular privacy rights raised by facility owners unions elder care lawyers and families Despite such concerns not only have family members turned to these granny cams  a popular nickname that some consider patronizing  but even the government has used them A year ago the New York state attorney generals office which has   demonstrated its methods at a national training program for state investigators In June Mike DeWine the Ohio state attorney general announced that his office with permission from families had placed cameras in residents rooms in an unspecified number of state facilities Mr DeWine has moved to shut down at least one facility in Zanesville where he said cameras caught actions like an aides repeatedly leaving a stroke patients food by his incapacitated side The recordings can have an impact Based on Ms Rachers videos one aide pleaded guilty to abuse and neglect The other appears to have fled the country Similar scenes of abuse have been captured in         and other states by relatives who placed cameras in potted plants and radios webcams and iPhones The monitoring is often a lastditch step by relatives who suspect abuse but feel that the authorities dismiss their complaints Families are witnessing injuries and neglect of loved ones and the only way to detect whats happening is to use hidden cameras said Wes Bledsoe the founder of   a group based in Oklahoma that tracks such cases around the country Although no one tracks its use the technology is accessible affordable and widely accepted said Dan Frith a lawyer in Roanoke Va who represents plaintiffs in neglect and abuse cases against longterm care facilities Im confident there are numerous granny cams in nursing homes in Virginia that people never discuss with the staff he said Its a cheap quick way to verify But the secret monitoring of a resident raises ethical and legal questions Families must balance fears for their relatives safety against an undignified invasion of their privacy They must also consider the privacy rights of others who pass through the room including roommates and visitors Proponents of hidden cameras argue that expectations of privacy have fallen throughout society nanny cams webcams and security cameras are ubiquitous But others say that it is one thing to videotape a nanny in ones home who is putting a diaper on a monthold and quite another to record an aide doing so for a yearold This is infringing on someones privacy arguably for their own benefit  said   a law professor at Syracuse University We have to be especially careful that its justified A longterm care resident often lacks the capacity to consent to being recorded so the decision is usually made by a representative who may not be a relative That decision maker has to stand in the residents shoes Ms Kohn said If the resident were mentally capable would he or she agree to roundtheclock monitoring of many intimate moments  being bathed put on the toilet even having sexual relations with another resident Ms Racher said she never worried about violating her mothers privacy Certainly the workers see your rear end anyway she said So if your family sees your naked behind whats the big deal But residents often have roommates who state laws say have the right to refuse to be monitored Maryland which has administrative guidelines for facilities says that cameras must be in a fixed position directed at only the intended resident Another question is whether signs should be posted alerting staff members and visitors that monitoring is taking place Certainly abuse has been exposed precisely because staff members did not know about hidden cameras Mr DeWine who said his Medicaid Fraud Control Unit pursued facilities only where there were extensive complaints refused to name other settings where his cameras were in place If workers think they may be monitored but dont know for certain he said that uncertainty may deter abusive behavior Notice is not necessary he said and would defeat the purpose But many privacy experts believe that notification benefits everyone Facilities that permit inroom monitoring usually require families to post a notice on the residents door In recent years facilities themselves have placed signs that cameras are in public areas like lobbies and dining halls Notification encourages transparency and reaffirms shared expectations for quality care said Joseph DeMattos the president of the   which represents longterm care and rehabilitation centers  a geriatrician in Irvine Calif has misgivings about cameras but feels that with careful consent and notice the practice can be put to good purpose The documentation in nursing homes can be so poor that you cant tell whats going on and you dont know who to blame she said Good caregivers can be unfairly accused But the effect of monitoring on employees is debatable Unlike the residents who expect privacy because their room is essentially their home workers cannot assume that their actions are going unrecorded Some facilities have lobbied against electronic monitoring legislation Unions also dislike cameras particularly when they are placed without notice When you have lowwage health care workers in difficult settings they feel subjected to scrutiny and attack said Anthony Caldwell a spokesman for the   whose local represents aides in Kentucky Ohio and West Virginia Secret surveillance takes away from their professionalism Its unfortunate and creepy and wrong Greg Crist a spokesman for the   which represents about  skilled nursing centers said each state must write its own laws about monitoring Our caregivers are often the new families of these residents he said We want that to be an ongoing trustbased collaborative relationship  a geriatrician and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College is concerned that recordings may be misinterpreted Nursing home residents he said can become   A jury could view a skilled kind loving nursing assistant trying to bathe the person with advanced cognitive challenges who is saying Stop stop stop  he said And that assistant could be misconstrued as abusive Regulation is needed he said to detail when and how monitoring may occur who owns the recordings and who may watch them Use of hidden cameras may catch bad actors after the fact but can monitoring help redress the deepseated problems at many facilities MarieTherese Connolly a former Justice Department coordinator of the Elder Justice and Nursing Home Initiative said We shouldnt rely on them to substitute for proper staffing and training which are better ways to assure quality
