The birth rate among teenagers reached another historic low in  government researchers announced Friday and there is evidence that a switch to more effective means of birth control is a factor According to the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the birth rate among young women ages  to  fell  percent last year to  births per thousand the lowest rate in the  years the government has been collecting the data The decline was across all racial and ethnic groups The  number is a considerable one year drop says pediatrician Dr John Santelli a professor of population and family health at Columbia University who has no connection to the study And it follows fairly sizable declines since  when the rate was  births per thousand young women ages  to  In fact except for a small uptick between  and  the teen birth rate has been steadily declining since  when it reached  births per thousand Our data comes from the birth certificate that parents complete at the hospital and it provides a wealth of information says Brady E Hamilton a statistician with the National Center for Health Statistics and the lead author of the report But to figure out why the teen birth rate is falling we have to rely on other sources Hamilton says such as surveys that the CDC conducts of high schoolers Santelli has studied those and other survey results There is not much evidence of a change in abortion use and not much change in sexual activity since  says Santelli For example the percentage of high school kids reporting ever having sexual intercourse was about  percent in  according to the CDC survey declined through  and then held steady at about  percent through  the last year of available data  What we have seen is greater availability of much more effective birth control methods says Santelli While condom use increased substantially in the s and early s among high schoolers it actually declined slightly after that according to the CDC survey At the same time medical professionals have increasingly been recommending the IUD a small plastic device that is inserted and left inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy says Santelli While it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases it can be used in combination with a condom which does offer such protection Young people sometimes use condoms incorrectly and sometimes they forget to use condoms says Santelli There is almost zero user error with the IUD Once it is in place it works every time Beyond teens the birth rate for women in their early twenties also declined in  to a new record low of  births per  women while birth rates rose for women in their thirties and early forties People are starting families later and later and these are historical changes and happening worldwide says Santelli The last downturn in the economy has accelerated the trend
