Health warnings would also be required and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited Initially the only health warning required for ecigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine   Manufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the FDA They would be able to market new products only after an FDA review and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any direct or implied claims of risk reduction associated with their product  Companies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples  After the public comment period and once the proposed rules are finalized manufacturers will have  months to submit applications to allow their products to remain on the market or to submit new product applications  Ecigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor They are usually batteryoperated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine When heated the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor thats inhaled Most look like cigarettes cigars or pipes but some resemble pens or USB memory sticks Because they have not been fully studied the FDA says its unknown what health risks they pose how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled or whether there is any benefit to using them  Last year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an ecigarette more than doubled in one year from  As electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity so have the number of related calls to poison control centers nationwide According to a recent CDC report poison control centers logged  calls involving ecigarettes in February alone Of those calls  involved children    Its really the wild wild West out there said Margaret Hamburg FDA commissioner Because ecigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace Theyre coming in different sizes shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them and theres very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up ecigarettes especially the flavored ones  and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products    Hamburg said officials dont know how many types are on the market another reason why regulation is critical   Were already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these ecigarettes and  to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through ecigarettes But until we can really regulate them we cant have all the information we need and we cant take all the actions that we might want to to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them Miguel Martin president of LogicTechnology Development  considered the secondlargest electronic cigarette company in the US  said he is encouraged by the FDA announcement  We look forward to being a part of this process and believe that sciencebased and responsible regulations are good for both adult consumers and responsible electronic cigarette manufacturers Martin said  Logic opened its doors in  The company has nine products on the market both disposable and rechargeable but no flavored nicotine products Logic implemented rules a year ago similar to the ones the FDA has proposed We support and have already implemented those steps to ensure that adult smokers are the audience and consumer base of our products Martin said We work with the retailers to ensure the product is sold to adult consumers of legal smoking age Experts have said that ecigarettes if properly regulated could help reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobaccorelated disease  But a lot of unanswered questions remain according to Michael Eriksen dean of the School of Public Health at Georgia State University one of   US institutions conducting FDAfunded research on electronic cigarettes  Nicotine is a drug and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in ecigarettes is highly toxic even in small doses It can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin How concentrated is liquid nicotine Are there impurities in it  Eriksen asks Nicotine is a pesticide fundamentally and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in People treat it liquid nicotine as sugar when its a toxin Harold Wimmer president and CEO of the American Lung Association believes nicotine is   or an ecigarette  So how safe are ecigarettes  Hamburg said its buyer beware We think that theres a lot of information that needs to be understood about ecigarettes and their use  Were trying to help provide some of that information through research that were conducting she said But we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about ecigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the American public and potentially ecigarette users and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits Hamburg believes these new rules will change the landscape   If the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products she said it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans But big changes could come slowly  It may be years before much regulation is imposed said Carl Tobias a law professor at the University of Richmond The lobbying at FDA and Congress will be intense And some believe the FDA has already waited too long It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the Administration so long to act Matthew L Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids said in a statement This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids and their use has skyrocketed The FDA and the Administration must now move as quickly as possible to finalize this rule
