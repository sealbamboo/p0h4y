From early birds to night owls we all can agree that when we finally lay our heads on the pillow wed like to actually go to sleep thank you Nothing is more annoying than   and the evidence is piling up that   Although the research is a bit spotty when it comes to which foods help or harm sleep anecdotal evidence does suggest that certain items consumed right before bedtime are more likely to be sleep promoters while others may be sleep stealers says Russell Rosenberg PhD CEO of the   Heres a list of potential good guys and bad guys when it comes to getting some shuteye Cherries are one of the few natural foods to contain melatonin the chemical that helps control our bodys internal clock says Keri Gans a registered dietician in New York City and author of   One studyalbeit a small onefound that drinking tart cherry juice resulted in small improvements in sleep duration and quality in adults who suffered from chronic insomnia And travelers often take melatonin capsules to combat jet lag Why not a few cherries tart or otherwise to promote sleep The stratospheric fat content of this particular fast food is guaranteed to be a sleep killer Fat stimulates the production of acid in the stomach which can spill up into your esophagus causing heartburn Fatty foods can also loosen the lower esophageal sphincter the barrier between the stomach and the esophagus making it even easier for acid to get in all the wrong places In fact theres almost nothing to recommend this kind of highfat saltladen indulgence if you want to preserve your health including the quality of your sleep  You may have fond memories of your mother or grandmother making you a glass of warm milk to help you fall asleep This may not be just an old wives tale Milk contains the amino acid tryptophan a precursor to the brain chemical serotonin Although the topic is a controversial one some people believe that tryptophan and serotonin might make it easier to sleep Or maybe  a simple glass of milk brings back soothing childhood memories which help you drift off Alcohol of any kind is terrible for sleep says Rosenberg Why It metabolizes quickly in your system and causes you to wake up multiple times during the night One study found that a glass of bourbon or vodka mixed with caffeinefree soda at bedtime increased the amount of time women spent awake during the night by  minutes It also reduced nightly sleep time by  minutes and diminished quality of sleep If you dont refrain from alcohol for our own benefit do it for your mate Alcohol makes snoring worse so it will impact you and your potential bed partner said Rosenberg Jasmine rice ranks high on the glycemic index meaning the body digests it slowly releasing glucose gradually into the bloodstream A  study in the   found that consuming jasmine rice four hours before bedtime cut the amount of time it took to fall asleep in half when compared with eating a highglycemicindex meal at the same time interval The authors speculate that highglycemicindex meals may up the production of tryptophan Coffee contains caffeine which is a central nervous stimulant Translation Drinking Java too close to bedtime will keep you up at night Of course people differ in their sensitivity to caffeine and thats usually based on how much caffeine youre accustomed to consuming says Timothy Roehrs PhD a senior scientist with Henry Ford Sleep Disorder and Research Center in Detroit If you dont know your tolerance skip the java especially late in the day Carbs in general are good for sleep but its not a great idea to binge on a box of cookies before bedtime or anytime Instead try a bowl of Kashi or shredded wheat which contain good or complex carbs Even better cereal goes well with milk which has its own sleeppromoting qualities Thats two for the price of one Rosenberg says Other complex carbs are quinoa barley and buckwheat Chocolate contains not only calories but caffeine especially dark chocolate A ounce Hersheys milk chocolate bar for instance contains about  milligrams of caffeine or the same amount as three cups of decaffeinated coffee A Hersheys specialdark bar has  milligrams of caffeine about the same as half an ounce of espresso Chocolate also contains theobromine another stimulant that can increase heart rate and sleeplessness Bananas help promote sleep because they contain the natural musclerelaxants magnesium and potassium says Gans Theyre also carbs which will help make you sleepy as well In fact bananas are a winwin situation in general Theyre overall health promoters says Rosenberg We need potassium for cardiovascular health and cognitive functioning Yup the culprit here again is caffeine and its present in spades An eightounce Red Bull energy drink contains about  milligrams of caffeine or equivalent to a oneounce Starbucks espresso FiveHour Energy packs  milligrams of caffeine into just two ounces which means you might as well be imbibing  ounces of regular coffee With this much caffeine you might do well to avoid energy drinks even earlier in the day In some people caffeine can take up to eight hours to wear off says Gans Like milk turkey contains tryptophan a chemical that can make people doze off in front of the TV after Thanksgiving dinner But if youre a diehard insomniac a meals worth of turkey or a glass of milk isnt likely to help you Youd have to drink a lot of milk or turkey to have a major effect says Rosenberg But if you need a little bit of a push in the right direction it might help Mountain Dew MDX along with jolt Cola and Vault contain  milligrams of caffeine per ounce serving Thats the upper limit of what the US Food and Drug Administration allows Other sodas arent much better Also typical soda drinks like Pepsi and Coke contain citrus as well as sodium benzoate and other chemicals which can aggravate the gastrointestinal tract and promote acid reflux not a recipe for a good nights sleep Sweet potatoes are a sleepers dream Not only do they provide sleeppromoting complex carbohydrates they also contain that musclerelaxant potassium Other good sources of potassium include regular potatoes baked and keep the skin on lima beans and papaya Its not Indian food per se but the heavy spices which can keep you awake at night One study conducted in Australia found that young men who poured Tabasco sauce and mustard on their dinner had more trouble falling asleep and experienced less deep sleep than men who ate blander suppers Spices can also cause heartburn So definitely dont do spicy and highfat in the same lateday meal Its a potential sleepwrecking recipe The root of the valerian plant has been shown in some studies to speed the onset of sleep and improve sleep quality Some people hold that valerian tea along with motherwort chamomile and catnip brews none of which contain caffeine will help make you drowsy It may not be any property of the actual tea however but the power of the relaxing ritual as you get ready for bed says Roehrs Chicken or any type of protein is going to be counterproductive if consumed at night Digestion is supposed to slow by about  while youre sleeping but if you eat a lot of protein you digest even more slowly explains Rosenberg Instead of focusing on sleeping your body is focusing on digesting Adding a carbohydrate to the protein can tip the balance back towards sleep
