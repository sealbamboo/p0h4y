A mutant form of a bacterium that lives in soil and thrives in lowoxygen environments appears to be a precise and aggressive killer of malignant tumors as well as an energetic activator of the bodys immune system according to new research When scientists injected spores of a weakened form of the bacterium   directly into the softtissue tumors of dogs and that of a single human subject the results were not only abscesses fever and pain at the siteall inflammatory responses that showed the immune system had been drawn to the area In a matter of hours the bacterial spores quickly found their way into these tumors necrotic cores and began replicating madly in several cases killing the malignant tissue Within a day of receiving an injection directly into the tumor wrapped around her shoulder and upper arm the woman developed a lowgrade fever and for about three weeks required intravenous pain medications But her tumor stopped growing and the bacteria continued to eat away at necrotic tissue in and around the lesion Roughly six weeks after the injection the woman suffered a fracture in her necrotic upper arm which physicians repaired The experimental therapy and the research on mice leading up to it were reported this week in the journal   This is a cancer therapeutic that is truly different said one of the studys authors Saurabh Saha of BioMed Valley Discoveries Inc a researchanddevelopment organization in Kansas City Mo that conducts biomedical research on potential therapies that are too early unconventional or unprofitable to draw interest from pharmaceutical companies We have to approach it with caution But the field of cancer immunotherapy is beginning to prove itself and if it progresses well this can be another weapon in the cancer armamentarium As a next step researchers at eight sites across the United States have launched an   of the bacteriologic cancer therapy Researchers plan first to test the safety of the therapy on volunteers with solid malignant tumors of all kinds who have been treated with at least one systemic cancer medication and who have no options for curative therapy Outside experts hailed the new research as promising but cautioned there were substantial issues of safety and effectiveness to be worked out before it could be ready for widespread use Inducing bacterial infections in any patient is tricky business they noted By activating a robust immune response such an infection might rally the bodys diseasefighting powers directly to the site of cancer but it might also kill the patient We have to harness the promising aspects of this treatment while minimizing the potential toxicity said Basel alRamadi an immunologist at United Arab Emirates Universitys College of Medical and Health Sciences who was not involved in the current research Until we sort that out it will continue to be a limiting factor The articles senior authors call the proposed bacterial therapy a form of biosurgery Applied directly to the site of a tumor the method deploys a strain of anaerobic bacteria to attack with precision a recognized weakness of malignant tumorsthat in its frenzy of growth cancer often overreaches generating zones that are not yet serviced by a network of blood vessels Its not a new idea Medical cases as much as a century old offer accounts of cancer remission in patients who contracted serious bacterial infections Those set Hopkins oncologist Shibin Zhou and his lab to explore the potential power of anaerobic bacteria which thrives in tissue with little oxygen to home in on these necrotic zones Zhou one of the papers senior authors found strains of   whose spores would move quickly into a tumors oxygenstarved regions and release an enzyme that killed cells there In a bid to find a strain less likely to kill the patient as well as the cancer Zhous team screened samples of  for weakened versions of the strain They found one that lacked the gene necessary to create some of  s most potent toxins cultivated it and injected it into rodents who had had glioblastomassmall widely distributed tumorsin their brains The   shrunk those tumors causing many to disappear But while glioblastomas neatly fit the profile of oxygenstarved tumors to which   are drawn Zhou cautioned that the experimental therapy was likely to remain a poor choice for brain cancers because bacterial infections in the brain are almost always disastrous This suggests that this type of treatment should be considered only in locations were abscess treatment is lowrisk and tolerable said Dunn Given the challenges of treating cancers that resist standard treatments he said we should be open to new therapies But patients and physicians would be justifiably wary of a treatment that risked causing abscess or ventriculitis in the brain he added In an interview Zhou underscored that the  strain used was naturally occurring That he added leaves open the possibility of further improvement of the bacterium with genetic engineering The researchers focused on softtissue tumors as a useful proving ground since such malignancies are often wrapped around or embedded in normal healthy oxygenated tissue Such tumors would give   the chance to demonstrate that it would attack cancerous tissue and leave healthy tissue intact Ramadi of the University of United Arab Emirates said that a delayed injury in the studys lone human subject might cause some worry on this front  days after she received the therapy the womans upper arm was found to have been fractured after exertiona sign that the bacterial therapy may have weakened necrotic bone tissue as well as her tumor Ramadi added that the latest study also did not demonstrate that the  prompted an adaptive immune response one that is trained on a particular diseasecausing agent and limits itself to fighting that alone The presence of abscesses pain and fever in dogs and in the studys lone human subject suggests that the injections of   spores did set off a generalized immune response But many cancer immunotherapies he said aim to focus the immune systems power on the cancer alone
