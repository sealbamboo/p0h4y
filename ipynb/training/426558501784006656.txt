There is little reason to prescribe vitamin D supplements to healthy adults to reduce the risk of diseases or fractures say researchers writing in the Lancet They found no significant reduction in risk in any area after analysing more than  trials They added that future studies were unlikely to change the figures Atrisk groups including babies pregnant women and elderly people are still advised to take supplements The research team from the University of Auckland in New Zealand had previously carried out a metaanalysis which showed no major effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density  they looked at existing randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplements with or without calcium They found that vitamin D supplementation does not change the relative risk of heart disease stroke or cerebrovascular disease cancer and fractures by a noticeable amount equivalent to  Vitamin D supplements did not reduce hip fracture risk by more than  in hospital patients and when given with calcium did not lessen the risk in healthy individuals either The study said there was also uncertainty as to whether vitamin D with or without calcium reduces the risk of death The New Zealand researchers concluded In view of our findings there is little justification for prescribing vitamin D supplements to prevent myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease stroke or cerebrovascular disease cancer or fractures or to reduce the risk of death in unselected communitydwelling individuals Writing in a linked article in the Lancet Karl Michaelsson from the department of surgical sciences at Uppsala University in Sweden said there was continuing debate about whether there were health benefits to taking vitamin D supplements for a mild form of vitamin D deficiency The impression that vitamin D is a sunshine vitamin and that increasing doses lead to improved health is far from clear Mr Michaelsson said that until more information was available it would be wise to choose a cautious approach to vitamin D supplementation for otherwise healthy individuals While some nutrition experts say vitamin D deficiency is responsible for a number of diseases such as fractures cancer cardiovascular diseases diabetes and a higher risk of death others say vitamin D deficiency is more likely to be the result of ill health and not the cause Dr Colin Michie consultant senior lecturer in paediatrics and chairman of the nutrition committee at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says the study puts Vitamin D supplements into context This shows vitamin D has a relevant role to play but its not that important GPs shouldnt be rushing around getting blood tests done for the average healthy person Instead the oldfashioned advice still holds true Eat more fish watch your diet and how you lead your life  unless youre specifically at risk People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency include children under five pregnant and breastfeeding women the overs and people at risk of not getting enough exposure to sunlight  Those with darker skin such as people of African Caribbean and South Asian origin and people who wear fullbody coverings as well as paleskinned people have also been shown to be at higher risk
