This is an enormous shift in policy as it relates to who should be treated for high levels of cholesterol said Dr Steven Nissen chief of cardiovascular medicine at the   The biggest change from the old guidelines he says Ignore the numbers For many years the goal was to get the bad cholesterol levels  or LDL levels  below  Nissen said Those targets have been completely eliminated in the new guidelines and the threshold for treatment has been eliminated In their place the guidelines suggest using specific risk factors to determine who should be treated with cholesterollowering statin drugs and who should simply make lifestyle changes Among the four questions to ask to determine risks Do you have heart disease Do you have diabetes Type  or  Do you have a bad cholesterol level more than  And is your year risk of a heart attack greater than  According to the new guidelines if you answered yes to any of those four questions you should be on a statin Period For those who do not fit those criteria the committee behind the new policy says lifestyle and behavior management should be sufficient to help manage high cholesterol The focus for years has been on getting the LDL low said Dr Neil Stone committee chairman  Our guidelines are not against that Were simply saying how you get the LDL low is important Considering all the possible treatments we recommend a hearthealthy lifestyle and statin therapy for the best chance of reducing your risk of stroke or heart attack in the next  years So how do you and your doctor determine if your year risk of a heart attack is above  and you should be put on a statin A simple calculation said Dr Donald LloydJones chairman of the committee that developed the equation We were able to generate very robust risk equations for both nonHispanic white men and women as well as AfricanAmerican men and women LloydJones said Those equations factor in age sex race total and HDL good cholesterol levels blood pressure levels blood pressure treatment status as well as diabetes and current smoking status Each of those factors is assigned a numerical value and can be used to determine individual risk percentage using an    The hope LloydJones said is that by doing these calculations patients can be more informed about their risks when going to see doctors The greatest strength behind these guidelines is that they hit at the heart of prevention  which is that lifestyle rather than treating isolated risk factors is the key to reducing risk of chronic disease said Dr Sharon Horesh Bergquist an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University in an email We tend to focus on quick fix answers such as a pill  whereas the risk reduction from lifestyle changes such as exercise threefour days a week reduces risk nearly double to that from any one of the medication interventions By changing the way doctors evaluate a patient for statin therapy Nissen said these new guidelines will effectively double the number of Americans eligible for statin therapy bringing the total to about  million So does this mean big bucks for the pharmaceutical companies Nissen said no  and in fact it may mean a downturn in their business Now except for Crestor theyre virtually all generic  you can get a threemonth supply for  he said  So theres really no money to be made with statins anymore He goes on to say that while prescriptions for these drugs will increase dramatically the guidelines all but shunned other cholesterollowering drugs such as Zetia a big moneymaker for Merck  Co Aside from the financial aspects of medicating  million more Americans using statins in a much broader population has been controversial Some people such as cancer expert Dr David Agus advocate giving everyone older than  a statin due both to cholesterollowering properties and potential benefit in reducing cancer Others say that with the potential side effects from statin use  muscle pains and soreness a potential moderate increase in liver disease and    they should be used with care Nissen who strongly disagrees with Agus suggestion on statins said a measured approach is best If you have a young woman who is otherwise healthy giving her a statin doesnt make any sense at all Nissen said I do believe the evidence is solid that if you have risk that statins are enormously beneficial In addition to the guidelines on evaluating cholesterol risk the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology released two other sets of guidelines relating to overall heart health One report gives guidelines for eating a hearthealthy diet including reducing saturated and trans fats as well as limiting sodium to  milligrams per day   less than the average American consumes on a daily basis The other report dealt with treatment guidelines for physicians on managing weight loss in their patients They include a call to create individualized weight loss plans and recommend counseling with a dietitian or other certified weight loss professional for at least six months That report also goes on to suggest that doctors should begin offering bariatric surgery as a potentially viable option to improve health for patients with a body mass index over  or those with a BMI over  and other complicating factors
