We discuss a fair number of grim topics hereabouts so when I hear about good news I figure I should grab it So let me pass along two encouraging developments on the pneumonia front First the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has just issued  for older adults that should bolster their protection against this dangerous lung infection Second a largescale study has found that when older Americans do land in hospitals with pneumonia those  of treating them Each year pneumonia sickens three million to four million American adults most over  according to Dr Michael Fine who studies the epidemiology of the disease at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare and is the senior author of the study published in JAMA Internal MedicineÂ More than a million adults are hospitalized because of pneumonia but hospitalization becomes much more common at older ages In  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  which tracks how well hospitals do at treating pneumonia  established seven performance measures To receive reimbursement hospitals had to report how frequently they took these steps including taking cultures in the emergency room to diagnose bloodstream infections starting appropriate antibiotics within six hours and offering flu and pneumonia vaccines and smokingcessation counseling to prevent future infections Viruses fungi and aspirated food can also cause pneumonia but only bacterial causes can be effectively treated with antibiotics To gauge how hospitals responded the researchers examined the records of  million Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with pneumonia between  and  They not only looked at how frequently the  hospitals managed to complete each of the seven processes they also constructed a composite  an allornone measure  which showed how often hospitals took all the required actions patients were eligible for In  less than  percent of hospitals took all the required steps for all eligible pneumonia patients the researchers found Five years later that proportion had risen to more than  percent Theres been major improvement over time Dr Fine said In fact some measures became so universally practiced that Medicare stopped tracking them Even though the elderly patients average age almost  in this study had grown sicker with higher admissions to the intensive care unit and more comorbidities more than one illness at a time they were more apt to recover Over five years the researchers found small but significant reductions in mortality and in hospital readmissions  which is after all the reason we care whether staffs check off all their requirements What drove the improvement Im sure that knowing reimbursement is linked to this plays some role said Dr Fine a master of understatement He pointed out too that hospitals performance on pneumonia care is readily available on   That theyre being publicly reported probably plays some role too he said Its hard to say how much Still within  days of their admissions more than  percent of these patients died and more than  percent cycled back into a hospital after being discharged Clearly older people do better by avoiding pneumonia in the first place which is where the new vaccination recommendations come into play For about  years the CDC has recommended a pneumonia vaccine  a onetime inoculation with something called a polysaccharide vaccine  for everyone over   Last week the CDC advised that seniors should receive an additional pneumonia vaccine first a shot of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine already in wide use for children and then six to  months later the current polysaccharide vaccine The order matters said William Schaffner past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine The conjugate vaccine results in a burst of antibodies he explained in an interview To get the maximum benefit you have to let the bodys immune system respond to the first take a deep breath then go with the second Studies have shown that this regimen is more effective than the reverse If you have already had the current polysaccharide vaccine however you can add the conjugate vaccine after a year You can get your annual flu shot at the same time as either of these Dr Schaffner added Influenza is a virus and the flu vaccine is an entirely different animal immunologically The CDC acted after a large clinical trial in the Netherlands called CAPiTA showed better protection against communityacquired pneumonia  about  percent  when older people received the conjugate vaccine brand name Prevnar  which protects against  strains of pneumococcal bacteria The existing polysaccharide vaccine Pneumovax protects against  strains and also helps prevent complications like meningitis and bloodstream infections Prevnar  also reduced invasive pneumonia a rare but often lethal infection by  percent That made it clear that we had to recommend the conjugate vaccine to people over  said Dr Schaffner who served on the CDCs advisory committee on immunization Side effects for both vaccines are low primarily soreness from the injection The glitch though is that Medicare currently covers the cost of just one pneumonia vaccine Medical groups are urging Medicare to change those rules Unfortunately its a somewhat lengthy process Dr Schaffner said If youre just embarking on pneumonia vaccination you can start with the conjugate vaccine Prevnar  which is the more expensive  and hope that by the time a year has passed Medicare will also cover Pneumovax the polysaccharide vaccine If you have already had Pneumovax and now want to add Prevnar you may have to pay about  out of pocket And you may have to explain all this to your physician if he or she missed the CDC announcement Heres a brief   Its very new Dr Schaffner acknowledged and it will take time for this to penetrate with doctors out there taking care of older people
