The federal government has poured more than  billion into breast cancer research over the past couple of decades but the results have been disappointing The disease remains a stubborn killer of women So the National Breast Cancer Coalition is trying something bold The advocacy group has decided that its not simply going to lobby for more research dollars Instead its leaders are sitting down at the table with scientists studying the disease and telling them how theyd like that money to be spent Weve come to a phase in our lives where were just sick of losing our friends says   a member of the coalitions board We are looking into the eyes of our children and saying No more No more We need a deadline  That deadline is January  The goal is not to eradicate breast cancer by that date but to have figured out by then how to put an end to the disease Theres no question when we started the National Breast Cancer Coalition we thought navely If we just got enough money to the scientific community they would get the answers we need says   president of the NBCC And then we came to learn that it is much more complicated than that In the old days an individual scientist would come up with an idea related to one small question regarding breast cancer get funding and then retreat to his or her lab to run experiments to test the idea Good ideas have resulted in better understanding of breast cancer and better treatments but years have turned into decades without a cure We decided we could no longer afford to have the scientists set the agenda Visco says and that we were going to decide what questions need to be answered and we were going to bring together the necessary scientific expertise collaborating with advocates to answer those questions So three years ago the coalition started what it calls the   The project asks If youre going to end breast cancer what would you need to do The first answer the coalition decided is Prevent the disease A vaccine would be ideal  if someone could figure out how to make one Next for women who already have breast cancer the challenge is to keep it from spreading throughout the body  the process of metastasis If you could figure out how to prevent metastasis so that no one died of breast cancer and no one died of the treatment for breast cancer we believe we will have achieved the goal Should the National Institutes of Health rather than a nonprofit organization be sponsoring a collaborative project like this Yes Visco says quietly but adds You know the goal of the NIH is to fund the scientific community It is not the mission of the NIH to end breast cancer She says shes not discounting research initiated by scientists The process by which a scientist comes up with an idea and then wants to pursue it is a process that must continue Visco says We need that process We need discovery Once researchers have identified the ideas they want to pursue as part of the Artemis Project they apply for grants from the National Institutes of Health or from the Department of Defense which has a  million fund earmarked for breast cancer research The backdrop for this new patientdriven paradigm for treating disease is a quiet   for biomedical research Scientists studying diseases are fighting over a steadily shrinking pool of money for research But for breast cancer Visco believes the problem isnt a shortage of funding  its how its being spent a professor of surgery at Duke University is part of the breast cancer coalitions Artemis Project He likens the collaboration to the highly coordinated Apollo project that put men on the moon To succeed with Apollo he says scientists needed one team to build the rocket to get the spacecraft to the moon and also a navigation system Scientists and experts in the booster rocket may or may not be the same scientists and experts in the navigation system he says Similarly many types of medical researchers have been working on breast cancer Lyerly says but they havent been working toward one clear common goal as the Apollo engineers and scientists did Hes certainly not promising that the Artemis Projects coordination will enable scientists to figure out breast cancer by January  but he is impressed by this collective approach to medical problemsolving I think that is a remarkable opportunity he says and even that achievement would be one that I think would be a positive for science At the National Cancer Institute director   defends the scientific establishments current strategy I would never abandon the opportunity for anybody whos got the spark of genius to make an application to do something that is novel and individual Varmus says I do believe that individual labs still have an important role to play But people who think that we dont have a lot of collaborative work  team science  are wrong Weve always had that for years and we continue to support it The breast cancer advocates are pushing the medical establishment to make those collaborations much deeper and more ambitious I think the national breast cancer coalitions model is incredibly sophisticated and smart says   a science policy researcher at Arizona State University They recognize that you cant turn a problem of great social concern  such as womens mortality from breast cancer  over to scientists and expect them to solve the problem Sarewitz acknowledges that breast cancer advocacy is sometimes criticized for its singleminded focus which leads breast cancer to absorb a disproportionate share of research dollars But he says that success also gives them more leverage to change the system Theyre in the lead in understanding how difficult the problem is and how science needs to reorganize to address the problem If they succeed everyone else will want to be like them Fran Visco says this is her best  and last  shot If the group cant reach its ambitious goal by January of  she plans to end her long celebrated career of trying to conquer the disease I understand there are people who believe that its going to take decades maybe a century to end breast cancer she says And I wish them a great deal of luck
