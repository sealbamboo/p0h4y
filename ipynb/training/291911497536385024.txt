 Existing evidence suggests the childhood immunization schedule is safe although research looking for potential safety concerns should continue according to a report from the Institute of Medicine The member committee that looked into the issue acknowledged that vaccines carry some risks  like any medication or intervention  but found that the benefits outweigh those concerns In this most comprehensive examination of the immunization schedule to date the IOM committee uncovered no evidence of major safety concerns associated with adherence to the childhood immunization schedule which should help to reassure a diverse group of stakeholders according to the report Indeed rather than exposing children to harm following the complete childhood immunization schedule is strongly associated with reducing vaccinepreventable diseases Physicians are usually comfortable discussing immunization with parents but having this report may make the talk easier according to Elaine Schulte MD MPH chair of the department of general pediatrics at the Cleveland Clinic Every time theres an IOM report physicians usually pay attention to it and theyre able to again go back to their patients and their families and say You can be confident that what were doing is correct she said in an interview The report sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services HHS addressed the childhood immunization schedule established for children  and younger by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices The schedule is designed to protect against  pathogens Although about  percent of children receive most of the recommended vaccines by the time they enter kindergarten the remaining  percent either receive vaccines on an alternate schedule or do not receive any vaccinations at all In that latter group parental concerns about vaccination and potential side effects are driven largely by the number of immunizations required in the first years of life Children can receive as many as  immunizations before age  and as many as five shots in a single visit In light of this HHS asked the Institute of Medicine to identify research approaches methodologies and study designs that could address questions about the safety of the current childhood immunization schedule the authors wrote adding that parents providers and public health officials agree that there has been insufficient communication between providers and parents about vaccine safety concerns The committee made a recommendation to improve that communication deficit committee chair Ada Sue Hinshaw RN PhD of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda Md  said on a conference call with reporters The committee recommends that the National Vaccine Program Office systematically collect and assess evidence regarding public confidence in and around the concerns of the entire childhood immunization schedule with the goal to improve communication  communication with healthcare professionals and between healthcare professionals and the public  regarding the safety of the schedule Hinshaw said The IOM committee  which included experts in pediatrics neurology medical ethics immunology statistics epidemiology and public health  reviewed the existing evidence base on the safety of the vaccine schedule and did not find evidence suggesting that it is unsafe The committees efforts to identify priorities for recommended research studies did not reveal an evidence base suggesting that the childhood immunization schedule is linked to autoimmune diseases asthma hypersensitivity seizures child developmental disorders learning disorders or developmental disorders or attention deficit or disruptive behavior disorders the authors wrote They acknowledged however that existing research was not designed to evaluate the safety of the vaccine schedule in its entirety and that research should continue looking for potential safety concerns with the schedule which could become more complex as new vaccines are developed To help set priorities for future research the systematically collected concerns raised by the public on the safety of the vaccine schedule will be used in conjunction with scientific evidence from safety surveillance and epidemiological studies as well as biological plausibility to help set priorities for future research committee member Alfred Berg MD MPH of the University of Washington in Seattle said on the conference call The report pointed to existing data sources as the best options for monitoring vaccine safety Those include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System the Vaccine Safety Datalink and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network  which are CDC projects  and the FDAs Sentinel Initiative Newer systems including the National Childrens Study and the PostLicensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring PRISM program could also provide useful information according to the IOM authors The committee concluded that the best tool out of that group is the Vaccine Safety Datalink which collects information on demographics vaccination history diagnoses medical procedures and outcomes from more than  million children and adults treated within nine managed care organizations Potential limitations of that data source however include a lower level of diversity in the study population when compared with the US general population and potential difficulty in accounting for differences between children who adhere to the federal vaccine schedule and those who use an alternate schedule Future federal research approaches should continue to fund and support the Vaccine Safety Datalink project to study the safety of the recommended immunization schedule the authors wrote They ruled out randomized trials as a way to evaluate the safety of the vaccine schedule because although this is the strongest study design type ethical concerns prohibit this study as unvaccinated individuals and communities intentionally would be left vulnerable to morbidity and mortality Also because fewer than  percent of all Americans refuse all vaccines an observational study to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children would have to very large  prohibitively so  to find meaningful differences in health outcomes according to the report Source
