Millions of Americans are walking around with deposits in their coronary arteries that do not obstruct blood flow to their hearts  at least not until a piece of the plaque ruptures and forms a blood clot causing a heart attack These plaques are signs of a condition called nonobstructive coronary artery disease and they are found in  percent to  percent of patients who have a coronary   typically done for patients with symptoms like   or   or those who flunk a cardiac stress test Historically doctors have considered the partial obstructions insignificant and a surprisingly large percentage of patients with them are sent home without treatment Often patients are given the good news that they dont have a coronary blockage said Dr Thomas M Maddox a cardiologist at the Veterans Affairs Eastern Colorado Health Care System and the University of Colorado in Denver Sadly the news isnt really good By some estimates the majority of heart attacks result from these nonobstructive lesions Four years ago Dr Maddox and his colleagues published a study of nearly  million patients with varying degrees of coronary artery disease Compared with those who had major obstructions in their coronary arteries patients with nonobstructive lesions   to reduce their heart attack risk This month Dr Maddox and coauthors   graphically demonstrating the sometimes devastating consequences of ignoring nonobstructive coronary disease especially in patients with symptoms The researchers gathered data on  veterans without known coronary artery disease who underwent elective angiograms between October  and September  in the Veterans Affairs health care system Fiftyfive percent were found to have obstructive coronary disease and  percent had nonobstructive disease The risk of having a heart attack or dying within one year was directly related to the extent of disease in the participants coronary arteries As expected the risk was greatest among patients who had obstructive coronary disease defined as a blockage equal to or greater than  percent in one or more coronary arteries But the prognosis for patients with nonobstructive disease was hardly benign Compared with those who had no evidence of coronary artery disease or CAD the risk of suffering a heart attack within just one year of the exam   and more than four times greater in those with nonobstructive disease in two or three arteries The death rate increased with the extent of nonobstructive disease These findings highlight the need to recognize that nonobstructive CAD is associated with significantly increased risk for   or heart attack Dr Maddox and his colleagues concluded The researchers spurned the traditional distinction made between nonobstructive and obstructive CAD and suggested that all patients with nonobstructive disease would likely benefit from drug treatment  although no randomized clinical trials have yet been done to support this recommendation In particular   have not been shown to be an effective preventive for such patients If we did an angiogram on every adult a significant number would be found to have nonobstructive disease and be at risk of a heart attack Dr Maddox said in an interview If an angiogram shows a blockage of   or  percent in one or more arteries the patient should be on preventive therapy He does not recommend routine angiograms however which are costly and have risks of their own On rare occasions they can cause   infection damage to blood vessels or an allergic reaction to the dye used Alternatively patients can choose a noninvasive test like a coronary   score or CT angiogram  is linked to a slew of risk factors smoking being overweight obese or physically inactive having high       or pre  a family history of heart disease before age  consuming an unhealthy diet and being  or older Chronic stress also has been linked to heart disease Doctors usually advise patients at risk to modify their living habits If they smoke they should stop  within as little as a year their coronary risk can drop to that of a nonsmoker Those who are overweight may be told to cut down on fattening foods eat more fruits and vegetables and to exercise more measures that help lower body weight and cholesterol and help control high blood pressure and diabetes If high cholesterol is a problem saturated fats like dairy and meat fat should be reduced and unsaturated olive or canola oil used when fat is needed Some of this advice was given to my father in  after he suffered a heart attack at age  He never smoked was already active and not overweight He modified his diet which helped to keep him alive for  more years But lacking anything more to do to protect himself he succumbed to a second heart attack at age  Now there is proof that certain medications can ward off even a first heart attack in people at risk The two most commonly recommended are a daily baby aspirin and a statin Aspirin thins the blood reducing the risk that a blood clot will form in a coronary artery The Food and Drug Administration does not recommend daily use to prevent a first heart attack  but some doctors do Possible side effects include an increased risk of   A statin though primarily prescribed to lower blood levels of arteryclogging cholesterol turns out to have cardiac benefits beyond slowing the formation of new plaques in coronary arteries  sometimes reduce the size of existing lesions They can suppress inflammation that contributes to plaque formation They improve the function of cells that line the arteries enabling them to expand as needed Statins may also stabilize plaques reducing the chance that they will rupture and block arteries feeding the heart Given these benefits and the fact that plaque rupture is the source of  percent of heart attacks Dr Maddox said that if he had coronary artery disease and was stranded on a desert island the one drug he would want to have with him is a statin Â
