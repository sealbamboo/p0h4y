Lasers have been used to regenerate parts of damaged teeth and could one day be used to prevent root canal treatments claim US researchers The laser beam triggered a series of changes that led to the formation of new dentin the layer below the enamel in animal tests  The results   showed stem cells in the dental pulp were activated Experts said it was intriguing but a long way from the dentists chair  The team at Harvard University used a drill to remove part of a tooth in mice and rats  One dose of laser therapy on the damaged tooth led to the production of a partial layer of dentin  weeks later  It was not a perfect match for natural dentin but the researchers argue it would be easier to achieve with human teeth which would be larger and by refining the laser The scientists could not produce a new layer of the hard enamel that protects the tooth from wear and tear  However Dr Praveen Arany said his research could have a role in preventing root canal treatment  the dreaded and painful procedure involving the removal of a tooths nerve and blood vessels  Dental cement is currently used to trigger new dentin formation but it is not always successful  Dr Arany told the BBC that lasers may be a better option The laser tool and the mechanism we have outlined would ideally be used in pulp capping that would prevent root canal treatment and hopefully preserve the tooth without the need for it to be eventually extracted But once you reach the pulp and the pulp is necrotic the cells you have to work with are no longer there so this would not work in those cases Prof Ian Needleman the director of the International Centre for EvidenceBased Oral Health at University College London said full tooth repair was still a distant prospect What wouldnt come out of this is that a whole tooth could be regenerated One tooth tissue could show some signs of regeneration or repair but thats a million miles from regenerating a tooth It is interesting as a model of whether laser light can play a part in regenerative medicine but in terms of dentistry its not offering an innovation at the moment The source of the new dentin was traced back to stem cells in the dental pulp  Experiments showed energy from the laser light was creating highly reactive oxygen inside the dental tissues It in turn activated growth chemicals that stimulated the stem cells to produce a new layer of dentin  Chris Mason a professor of regenerative medicine at UCL said I was intrigued that shining a little bit of light triggered stem cells to differentiate  Its incredibly lowcost and would be patientfriendly so it seems to have a lot going for it but they cant grow the enamel The tooth is like a house the dentin is the inner walls but it still needs a roof and outside walls
