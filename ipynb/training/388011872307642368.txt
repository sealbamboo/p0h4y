 Kids have been fidgeting nervously at doctors offices since the needle was invented but it took one mother with a background in pain research and a wailing son to find a solution for needle phobia Amy Baxter an emergency pediatrician in Atlanta created a highfrequency vibrating ice pack that helps disrupt pain signals on their way to the brain She stuck a cute striped bee on the front won a   from the National Institutes of Health and the product now known as   was born She had originally used it just on patients at the hospital where she worked and on her son who was finally able to face his fear of shots with Buzzy by his side But she was anxious to share her solution with other kids Every time I saw a child being held down  I felt guilty she says I felt like I should run in there with the Buzzy prototype I had in my pocket The device operates on a pain theory called   Researchers in the s speculated that some kinds of sensory stimulation could actually interrupt pain signals traveling up the spinal cord before they reach the brain After experimenting with different kinds Baxter decided on a combination of cold temperature and highspeed vibrations  think running a cut under cold water or rubbing a stubbed toe The vibrating bee attaches to thin ice packs that look like wings and then is placed above the location of the pain The vibration also dilates nearby veins Baxter says making it easier to stick a needle in successfully Oh and it doesnt hurt that Buzzy looks like a cute toy Thats probably called the spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down theory Since then Baxter has discovered uses beyond shots and vaccinations It helps block out itching so kids with eczema can use Buzzy for relief she says It also can help with the pain of cleaning wounds or drilling cavities at the dentist or taking daily diabetes injections Baxter recently   on its benefits for arthritis medication and dialysis People dont think about the fact that they can be empowered to control their own pain she says Doctors were less excited about adopting Buzzy than she had expected she thinks its because theyre generally more stoic when it comes to pain she says But that hasnt hindered success Over the past year the yearold companys sales nearly tripled Baxter says We havent advertised she says Its really been patients telling other patients and moms telling other moms Buzzy is available on buzzyshotscom and Amazoncom
