Home health care aides are waiting to find out if they will be entitled to receive minimum wage A decadesold amendment in labor law means that the workers   do not always receive minimum wage or overtime The Obama administration has yet to formally approve revisions to the   that would change that classification On Dec     and thenLabor Secretary Hilda Solis offered her support for the revisions in the   The guidelines would affect a growing industry revenues for home health care services nearly doubled to  billion between  and    The revision would also affect people like Lou Garcia Garcia is up before the sun rises in Los Angeles to prepare breakfast for an elderly woman with Alzheimers They do errands together Garcia reads her books takes her to doctors appointments does her laundry cleans her house and makes her dinner Garcia makes  an hour She works  hours a day and sometimes on the weekends But while she works more than  hours a week Garcia doesnt make overtime Shes not even guaranteed minimum wage because a provision in the federal law passed in  says home health aids are exempt from those requirements Companies can pay home workers what they want and can ask them to work as many hours or days as theyd like The Labor Departments   notes that while the regulations havent changed since they were enacted the inhome care industry has undergone a dramatic transformation Catherine Ruckelshaus legal codirector at the National Employment Health Project calls the exemption an accident of history with US labor laws treating the workers like adult babysitters Ruckelshaus says Medicaid pays agencies about  an hour for inhome care services Private clients usually pay a few dollars more The worker sees about half that Companies usually pay home workers  to  an hour meaning the companies are bringing in  to  for every hour a worker spends in a home William Dombi is vice president for law for the National Association for Home Care and Hospice a trade organization that represents the companies hiring the workers He says they are supportive of paying workers at least minimum wage But Dombi says the companies cannot afford to pay overtime for nights and weekends because the companies profits are largely fixed by Medicaid Businesses cant simply add another cost like overtime through a price rise as other businesses might for a hotel room or for a rental car Dombi says The workers and the companies arent the only ones engaged in this debate over how the federal guidelines should be amended Theres also an association representing people with disabilities who use the workers Bob Kafka codirector of disability rights group ADAPT says he wants the workers to be paid overtime and minimum wage but he says his organization cant support the overtime changes to the guidelines either We dont in principal oppose that but the unintended consequence of these rules is that people with significant disabilities will have to find multiple attendants and many of the attendants will end up just leaving the job Kafka says Kafka says families wont be able to pay more and neither will the government He says many of these people will be forced back into nursing homes which will cost taxpayers significantly more But workers like Garcia say that is the point In a nursing home workers doing the same job  cleaning bathing and caregiving  are entitled to minimum wage and overtime I think its unfair to us because we are doing a job and we are also human and we need to be treated as the other people doing other jobs Garcia says
