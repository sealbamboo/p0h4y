Information technology has transformed much of the American economy but its use in health care still lags especially when it comes to electronic medical records Heres an example The state of Colorado runs a computerized   where any provider who gives a child a vaccine can report that information The system should help kids stay current with their immunizations But the states computer system isnt compatible with most of the ones doctors use so many practices dont update the central database because its just too much extra data entry says   director of the Childrens Outcomes Research Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine That means doctors and researchers like her who try to keep kids immunizations on track cant rely on it to make sure a vaccine isnt missed or given twice This is just one instance of the digital disconnect thats holding health care back says   a policy analyst with the Rand Corp He says the ability for doctors to easily share information is the exception in the US not the rule Kellermann   in this months   reflecting on a   that said information technology could save America  billion a year by making health care more efficient He found actual savings have been scant and that many doctors complain electronic records make them less efficient The result is that the health care industry isnt benefiting from the computer networks that have transformed other industries such as manufacturing retail and banking You can take your ATM card and go to any ATM in the country to withdraw money or transfer funds among accounts Kellermann notes You cant do that with health information technology today According to a   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while  percent of officebased physicians use some sort of electronic system in their practice only  percent of practices meet the definition of even a basic system People talk about the ATM but thats seven data elements and they charge you  for shipping those seven data fields over Were talking thousands of data fields around things that are life and death says   the national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services His office is charged with leading American medicines digital transformation That office meets constantly with software vendors  on average one meeting every   hours for the past three years Mostashari claims  trying to hammer out the industry standards necessary to make health information as easy to share as bank records or other commercial data The number of doctors and hospitals using electronic records has doubled in the past two years Mostashari says thanks in part to federal stimulus money for doctors who adopted electronic records He admits there are growing pains but says the governments strategy is helping though it will need six more years before it can show significant savings Both he and Kellermann agree that patients would get better care at lower cost if health care systems could share patient records easily But that wont happen until doctors and hospitals start getting paid for being smart about IT Right now duplicative testing also means duplicative payments But Kellermann is optimistic the Affordable Care Acts payment reforms can change that As we shift American health care and start paying for the best quality care and the best outcomes rather than who does the most stuff who orders the most tests or who does the most operations then I think youll see IT becoming a tool for efficiency and high performance Kellermann says
