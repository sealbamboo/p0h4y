Dr Paul Offit doesnt like getting threats But the yearold pediatrician at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia says it goes with the territory when taking on powerful industries and interest groups whose beliefs are deeply rooted in emotion  Hes ready for a tsunami of criticism with his latest foray into debunking popular wisdom    in which he takes on the vitamin and herbal supplements industry alternative medicine of all kinds Congress and celebrity doctors who peddle their own products It hits the shelves on Tuesday Yes I do get hate mail Offit admits He makes the case that the vitamin industry in particular has successfully lobbied to keep itself unregulated while selling billions of pills to an eager and gullible public People think of dietary supplements as natural benign and helpful Offit told NBC News People dont think of them as drugs Yet studies have shown that not only do vitamin supplements fail to lower cancer risk but they can actually cause cancer  most notably the  Finnish study that found smokers who took beta carotene  which the body converts to vitamin A  actually had a higher risk of lung cancer than men who didnt take the supplements Alternative therapies of all kinds are often not only of no benefit whatsoever  they can be harmful he notes is best known for taking on vaccine doubters  people who worry that vaccinations might somehow harm children and whose fears culminated in a wave of support for the argument that childhood vaccines can cause autism Offit has received death threats and even notsosubtle telephone threats against his own children after he challenged these ideas in national media they worsened when he wrote a book  that not only systematically took down the arguments but sought to expose some of the powerful moneymaking interests that were driving a supposed grassroots lobby But hes challenging a much bigger group this time According to the  more than half of Americans took some sort of dietary supplements in   percent of them multivitamins  Some are recommended  doctors routinely prescribe certain vitamins for pregnant women to prevent birth defects But too much vitamin A can cause birth defects so women must be careful And the Institute of Medicine recently questioned the common practice of prescribing vitamin D for people whose levels are low Offit says it infuriates him to see not only ordinary citizens buy into the claims of homeopaths naturopaths and the vitamin industry but doctors and hospitals He calls out Dr Andrew Weil Dr Deepak Chopra and others saying they have abandoned science for the thrill of celebrity that goes with evangelizing alternative medicine They have this almost gurulike stature that you should listen to them Offit says It is the surety of their statements that draw you to them They make you think they are someone who just knows But it should be the strength of data the strength of science rather than personality that decide what it is true Weil for instance has promoted the plant kava as a nonaddictive relaxant Seven years later when kava was shown to cause severe liver damage the FDA issued a warning against its use Offit writes But few consumers are aware Weil sells his own line of supplements Chopra sells a line of supplements oils books and even jewelry Chopra has helped wealthy businessmen celebrities and politicians like Michael Jackson Elizabeth Taylor Winona Ryder Debra Winger Madonna Mikhail Gorbachev Michael Milken and Hillary Clinton find their inner space without feeling bad about being rich Offit writes Spokespeople for Weil and Chopra did not respond to requests for comment Offit who helped invent the RotaTeq vaccine against rotavirus is himself the frequent target to critics who say he has his own vested interest in promoting commercial pharmaceuticals But drugs and vaccines that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are held to a standard Offit argues Their makers have to prove not only that they work but that they are safe And he answers his critics with an anger and determination born from watching children die I see myself as a child advocate Offit says Profits from his book go to the hospital where he works He famously tells how he started his work on a rotavirus vaccine after watching an otherwise perfectly healthy monthold girl die of the infection while he was finishing his medical training Just this year Offit says a child died of influenza at his hospital The childs parents hadnt believed in the need to vaccinate against flu I had to watch those parents go through the worst thing a parent can go through which is watch that child die very slowly every day until they are dead he says I dont see how you cant be moved by that Offit starts his book with the case of Joey Hofbauer who died at age  of Hodgkins disease after his parents subjected him to a series of alternative treatments instead of standard cancer therapy that would have given him a  percent chance of survival Joey Hofbauers story while extreme contains much of what attracts people to alternative therapies today a heartfelt distrust of modern medicine he writes Offit describes how the vitamin industry used this distrust to lobby Congress to give it a pass The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act DSHEA passed in  specifically exempts vitamins and supplements from FDAs premarketing scrutiny although the agency can warn against products found to be dangerous Although the supplement industry skillfully manipulated people into believing that the Supplement Act was about the freedom to make health choices it was really about freeing the supplement industry to offer unsafe choices Offit writes If knowledge is power DSHEA is powerlessness People want to believe that because something is natural it must not only be safer but must somehow work better than synthesized drugs But many drugs on the market from antibiotics to chemotherapy agents are either based on natural products or taken directly from plants Herbal products bought in stores can have many of the same sideeffects as prescription drugs  but because they arent regulated the same way people dont know it Offit gives Vioxx as a case in point Vioxx approved in  was a huge hit for treating arthritis pain Its a more refined version of the drugs in the same class as aspirin and ibuprofen without causing the stomach bleeding that can make them dangerous Tests showed it could raise the risk of heart attacks and Vioxxs maker pulled it off the market  So which is more dangerous Vioxx or vitamins Indeed both have dangers Offit writes The better question is why does everybody know that Vioxx can cause heart disease and nobody knows that megavitamins can cause cancer The answer is that we have chosen not to know Offit doesnt accuse the public of being stupid I think we are generally pretty cynical as a society We are certainly skeptical of Big Pharma he says Yet when people look at these supplements or megavitamins they suspend all disbelief  One explanation is extremely sophisticated marketing Offit says You have to give credit to the industry  they have set themselves up as different from big pharma when they are exactly the same as big pharma he says Another is the sense of selfcontrol that people can get from using herbs vitamins or supplements You can be your own doctor he says But at least with prescription drugs there are watchdogs  not the just FDA but a drugs competitors and the academic research community While studies are done on vitamins and supplements its not as common as with prescription drugs Without data you are strictly relying on infomercials and internet chatrooms and your friends he says Anecdotes are powerful Offit adds but the story of one or two people cannot outweigh data involving thousands One answer is to look for what data there is The National Institutes of Health now has a center set up to test the claims of alternative treatments from chiropracty to acupuncture The has found that acupuncture can relieve some forms of nausea and tha helps hepatitis C The   which looks at published studies that have been done with a certain level of scientific rigor has found that garlic   caused by clogged arteries that the amino acid creatine can h  and that music  before surgery The answer is to be a smart consumer Offit advises We should demand that claims be supported
