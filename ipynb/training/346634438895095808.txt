Socrates did not fear death he calmly drank the hemlock Kierkegaard was obsessed with death which made him a bit gloomy As for Lorraine Tosiello a yearold internist in Bradley Beach NJ it is the process of dying that seems endlessly puzzling Im more interested philosophically in what is death What is that transition Dr Tosiello said at a recent meeting in a Manhattan coffee shop where eight people had shown up on a Wednesday night to discuss questions that philosophers have grappled with for ages The group which meets monthly is called a Death Cafe one of many such gatherings that have sprung up in nearly  cities around the country in the last year Offshoots of the caf mortel movement that emerged in Switzerland and France about  years ago these are not grief support groups or endoflife planning sessions but rather casual forums for people who want to bat around philosophical thoughts What is death like Why do we fear it How do our views of death inform the way we live Death and grief are topics avoided at all costs in our society said Audrey Pellicano  who hosts the New York Death Cafe which will hold its fifth meeting on Wednesday If we talk about them maybe we wont fear them as much Part dorm room chat session part group therapy Death Cafes are styled as intellectual salons but in practice they tend to wind up being something slightly different  call it cafe society in the age of the meetup Each is led by a volunteer facilitator often someone who has a professional tie to the topic Ms Pellicano for instance is a grief counselor The participants include people of all ages working and retired who are drawn by Facebook announcements storefront fliers local calendar listings or word of mouth Women usually outnumber men In Europe theres a tradition of meeting in informal ways to discuss ideas  the caf philosophique the caf scientifique said Jon Underwood  a Web designer in London who said he held the first Death Cafe in his basement in  and has propagated the concept through a Web site he maintains Mr Underwood adapted the idea from a Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz who had organized caf mortels to try to foster more open discussions of death Theres a growing recognition that the way weve outsourced death to the medical profession and to funeral directors hasnt done us any favors Mr Underwood said He envisioned Death Cafe as a space where people can discuss death and find meaning and reflect on whats important and ask profound questions In practice peoples motives for attending vary as does the depth of the conversation Dr Tosiello who said she had never lost a close family member was there for intellectual enjoyment Others went to ponder the questions and feelings that the death of a loved one had raised For instance at a Death Cafe meeting this month in St Joseph Mo the host Megan Mooney a yearold social worker asked each of the  participants to supply a single word that he or she associated with death Freedom someone said Grief Transition Relief Finality And then Graduation The last came from Kelly Vanderpool a yearold mother who was a high school freshman when a friend with a new drivers license died in an auto accident Ever since Ive wanted to know where he was she said in an interview Is it true that life continues Is Joe around still Jeneva Stoffels who is  and drove  miles from Auburn Neb to attend the meeting told Ms Vanderpool that she did not have an answer But she did know that her late mother once spoke to her in a dream A younger version glowing and happy an Im in a good place so you can let go kind of thing Ms Stoffels said in an interview Regardless of where it came from it was reassuring Ms Mooney the host asked a series of conversationstarting questions What is your biggest fear about death What do you want your legacy to be She had brought markers and blank boards on which people could finish the sentence Before I Die I Want to   The responses included See Egypt Win the lottery Write a book of poems and See my daughter grow up Over all Ms Mooney said There are some somber moments but people laugh They have fun The meetings tend to be more mundane than macabre and more likely to produce small epiphanies than profound realizations Its not like psychotherapy Ms Stoffels said Theres not going to be a big breakthrough It just widens the door a crack Doctors and scholars who study attitudes toward death say that for most people such conversations are healthy talking about death can ease peoples fears and the notion that death is taboo A major part of American society is very averse to thinking about dying said David Barnard a professor of ethics at the Oregon Health and Science University who has written extensively about the end of life In the United States Death Cafes have spread quickly The first one met last summer in a Panera Bread outside Columbus Ohio where guests were served tombstoneshaped cookies Since then more than  meetings have been held in cities and towns across the country including Atlanta Baltimore Cleveland Los Angeles and Seattle At one cafe I had someone who believed in reincarnation sitting across from three atheists telling them about her past lives said Lizzy Miles a hospice social worker who organized that first meeting in Columbus and has led the group there ever since Discussion topics have included euthanasia grief the bestselling book Proof of Heaven and donotresuscitate orders Ms Miles logged  participants in her first nine events and determined that a quarter were under  and  percent were over  with most ages  to  and women predominating About half of the people who filled out a survey after a meeting agreed with the statement that I feel more comfortable talking about death and dying now The Death Cafe movement has a few ground rules Meetings are confidential and not for profit People must respect one anothers disparate beliefs and avoid proselytizing And tea and cake play an important role Theres a superstition that if you talk about death you invite it closer said Mr Underwood the organizer in London But the consumption of food is a lifesustaining process Cake normalizes things
