As a kid having no understanding of fashion I never understood pointy shoes After all the human foot doesnt come to a point which to me seems to explain the popularity in the early s of Earth Shoes which had a downsloping negative heel and a footlike shape with an almostrectangular toe box They were oddlooking but so comfortable that I always hoped theyd make a running shoe In fact runners feet get so beat up that over the years a twisted badge of honor for megamilers became the acquisition of black toenails from slamming your smushed toes into the front of the toonarrow shoe Today some hardcore athletes get their toenails removed Fortunately that could be a thing of the past as shoe makers have discovered the footshaped running shoe The natural anatomical shape gives your toes room to splay out naturally If youre a runner looking for more comfort and balance and you like your toenails fleshcolored you might like these  Ultralight formfitting trail runner and hiker with a zero drop  millimeter in elevation from heel to forefoot and a toggle lace closure ZEM stands for zone of endless motion  Feels as comfortable as being barefoot Excellent trail feel Feathery light at about  ounces in a mens size  Super agile and grippy  Its billed as a light trail runner for a reason The minimal cushioning about  mm between the sole and the insole might leave your feet beat after a long trail run   to     Highly cushioned footshaped roadtrail shoe for longdistance training and racing It features a flat zerodrop profile and a  mm pile of cushioning  A very comfortable and wellbalanced feeling My toes had plenty of room to splay out naturally The zerodrop from heel to forefoot and the ample forefoot space encouraged me to maintain good form a forefoot landing and good traction on steep ups and downs To add support on long runs there is additional cushioning on the medial side For all the cushioning its surprisingly light at about  ounces in size   If it had a quick lacing system itd be flawless      Medium to longdistance road running shoe with a blunt rectangular shape and lacefree Boa closure system which requires you to spin a dial to tightenloosen thin nylon wires It has a  mm drop from heel to toe  I loved that the laces could never come undone with the Boa system a simple commonsense approach to cinching up your shoe This goodlooking shoe feels much lighter than its  ounces in  The slight angle from heel to forefoot felt natural and may be preferred by those used to a taller heel  Although nicely squaredoff I found the toe box a bit too cramped narrow and lowvolume for my Dwidth feet although those with narrower feet may not have this issue      Lightweight trail runner with a wide footshaped forefoot and a zero drop from heel to toe  Lots of toe room and a thin tactile sole that lets you feel the trail but with enough cushioning to feel protected It provides great traction and peace of mind in all trail conditions While I gave this shoes more Minimalist predecessor the Trail Glove a great review I like this morepadded shoe even better due to its  mm of cushioning versus  mm in the former It kept my feet from getting beaten up on rocky surfaces Weight  ounces in size   It needs a quick lacing system to keep laces from coming untied
