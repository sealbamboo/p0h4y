For some time psychologists and other researchers have been studying how personality traits affect health and healthrelated choices Not surprisingly they have found that people blessed with innate conscientiousness meaning that they are organized and predictable typically eat better and live longer than people who are disorderly They also tend to have immaculate offices What has been less clear is whether neat environments can produce good habits even in those who arent necessarily innately conscientious To find out researchers at the University of Minnesota conducted a series of experiments the results of which were   In the first experiment they randomly assigned a group of collegeage students to spend time in adjacent office spaces one of which was exquisitely neat the other wildly cluttered with papers and other workrelated detritus The students spent their time filling out questionnaires unrelated to the study After  minutes they were told they could leave and were offered an apple or a chocolate bar as they exited Those students who sat in the orderly office were twice as likely to choose the apple than those who sat amid the mess A second experiment however found that working in chaos has its advantages too In this one college students were placed in a messy or a neat office and asked to dream up new uses for PingPong balls Those in messy spaces generated ideas that were significantly more creative according to two independent judges than those plugging away in offices where stacks of papers and other objects were neatly aligned The results were something of a surprise says Kathleen D Vohs a behavioral scientist at the University of Minnesota and the leader of the study Few previous studies found much virtue in disarray The brokenwindows theory proposed decades ago posits that even slight disorder and neglect can encourage nonchalance poor discipline and nihilism Chaos begets chaos But in the study by Dr Vohs disordered offices encouraged originality and a search for novelty In the final portion of the study adults were given the choice of adding a health boost to their lunchtime smoothie that was labeled either new or classic The volunteers in the messy space were far more likely to choose the new one those in the tidy office generally opted for the classic version Disorderly environments seem to inspire breaking free of tradition Dr Vohs and her coauthors conclude in the study which can produce fresh insights The implications of these findings are also practical My advice would be if you need to think outside the box for a future project Dr Vohs says then let the clutter rise and unfetter your imagination But if your primary goal is to eat well or to go to the gym pick up around your office first By doing this the naturally messy can acquire some of the discipline of the conscientious
