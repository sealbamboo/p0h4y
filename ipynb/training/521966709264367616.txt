When passengers arrive in the United States from Liberia Sierra Leone or Guinea theyre handed a flier instructing them to call a doctor if they feel ill  Never mind how hard it is to get your doctor on the phone but even if you could its quite possible shed tell you to go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care center  We saw how well that worked at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas On September  the hospital sent a feverish Thomas Eric Duncan home even though he had told them hed recently been to Liberia  And weve seen how well that worked in Massachusetts where an ill man recently returned from Liberia walked into an urgent care center which then evacuated its other patients and closed for several hours  One way to do it differently Set up a toll free number for returning passengers that would reach a centralized office which would then dispatch a local ambulance to get the patient to a hospital  The hospital would be warned that a possible Ebola patient is on the way and the patient would not be brought through the main emergency room  Thats the idea of Gavin MacgregorSkinner an assistant professor at Penn States Department of Public Health Sciences  Do you really want someone with Ebola hopping on a bus to get to the hospital No he said And once they get there do you want them sitting in the waiting room next to the kid with the broken arm Again no  Essentially any hospital in the country can safely take care of Ebola You dont need a special hospital to do it Dr Thomas Frieden said Sunday at a press conference  I think its very unfortunate that he keeps restating that said MacgregorSkinner the global projects manager for the Elizabeth R Griffin Foundation  He said when it comes to handling Ebola not all hospitals are created equally As seen at Presbyterian using protective gear can be tricky Plus its a challenge to handle infectious waste from Ebola patients such as hospital gowns contaminated with blood or vomit  Dr Michael Osterholm an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota  said some hospitals have more experience with infectious diseases and consistently do drills in how to deal with biohazards  If you were a burn unit patient wouldnt you want to go to a burn unit he said  The CDC may already be moving in that direction  Designating certain hospitals as Ebola treatment units is something were exploring further said Tom Skinner a spokesman for the agency  Under this system a doctor or nurse who is about to do a procedure on an Ebola patient has a buddy another health care worker who acts as a safety supervisor monitoring the worker from the time he puts on the gear until the time he takes it off  The buddy system has been effective in stopping other kinds of infections in hospitals  Skinner said the CDC is considering recommending such a system to hospitals  Taking care of Ebola patients is tricky because certain procedures might put doctors and nurses in contact with the patients infectious bodily fluids  At Sundays press conference Frieden hinted that Presbyterian might have performed two measures  inserting a breathing tube and giving kidney dialysis  that were unlikely to help Duncan He described them as a desperate measure to save his life   Both of those procedures may spread contaminated materials and are considered highrisk procedures he said Im not familiar with any prior patient with Ebola who has undergone either intubation or dialysis Osterholm said CDC should coordinate with medical groups to come up with treatment guidelines  We could have and should have done it a few months ago he said  Once Duncan was diagnosed health authorities started making daily visits to  of his contacts   But that didnt include several dozen workers at Presbyterian who took care of Duncan after he was diagnosed They werent followed because they were wearing protective gear when they had contact with Duncan Instead they monitored themselves  Public health experts said that was a misstep as the CDC should have realized that putting on and taking off protective gear is often done imperfectly and one of the workers might get an infection  How did Dallas nurse contract Ebola We have to recognize that our safety work tells us that breaches of protocol are the norm not the exception in health care said Dr Peter Pronovost senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine We routinely break precautions  Skinner said that in this case selfmonitoring worked but that monitoring from health officials can be beneficial too and so health care workers who were involved in Duncans care will now get daily visits from health authorities
