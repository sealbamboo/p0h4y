An annual technology conference known for buzzy new social-networking apps has turned more of its focus to health care.. The South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas, this month is hosting dozens of panel discussions about the role of technology in wellness and a business-pitch competition for makers of personal health apps and gadgets. Entrants include a smartphone-connected thermometer, an online doctor-referral service and a "smart" pill bottle that sends text-message reminders.
