A pair of new drugs to treat hepatitis C offer a cure for millions of Americans afflicted with the disease  but at a potentially staggering cost to taxpayers and health plans Until now therapies for hepatitis C helped only about half of patients and posed numerous side effects such as flulike symptoms anemia or depression In comparison clinical trials of Sovaldi and Olysio have shown cure rates of  to  with far fewer complications That progress though comes at a price A week course of Sovaldi can cost  or about  a pill and some patients may require two courses Treatment with Olysio runs more than  Using either one many patients wouldnt require significant treatment again It could be the right thing to do clinically but at this price can we afford it said Steven Pearson president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review a nonprofit group in Boston that analyzes the effectiveness and cost of new treatments Its a tough ethical and financial quandary In a new report the institute estimates it would cost  billion to provide the two drugs to Californians with more advanced liver disease from hepatitis C The annual cost could top  billion if half of all California patients with hepatitis C received the medications Drugs for some types of cancer multiple sclerosis and rare illnesses can carry similar price tags But few of those drugs would be prescribed so widely And the increased costs for new drugs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher health insurance premiums Left unchecked some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage liver cancer or death Chronic hepatitis C infection affects about  million people in the US and its the leading cause of liver transplants in the nation On Monday a panel of medical experts will meet in San Francisco to examine the use of Sovaldi and Olysio which federal regulators approved late last year and to recommend treatment guidelines The discussion will revolve around which patients are the best candidates for these medications and whether doctors should advise other patients to wait until their disease worsens given the high prices Those types of restrictions trouble some patient advocates who favor full access Of the two drugs Sovaldi is viewed as a potential blockbuster along the lines of the cholesterolfighting Lipitor Employers and health insurers warn that Sovaldi and Olysio are just the beginning of other expensive specialty drugs coming to market They say that their rapid growth could undermine efforts to rein in medical spending The pharmaceutical companies behind the hepatitis C drugs defended their pricing by noting that the medicines represent a major advancement compared with current treatments Gilead Sciences Inc in Foster City Calif sells Sovaldi and Olysio comes from Janssen Therapeutics a unit of healthcare giant Johnson  Johnson Both companies said discounts and other financial assistance are available to government health programs and lowincome patients Gilead said the new therapies also help avoid the longterm medical expenses related to liver failure cancer and transplants A liver transplant for instance can cost more than  not including a lifetime of followup care Sovaldi is a shortterm treatment that results in very high cure rates that can avoid future costs related to disease progression or treatment failure said Gregg Alton an executive vice president at Gilead Craig Stoltz a spokesman for Janssen said the price of Olysio reflects its value MediCal officials said they dont know yet how many patients may need the new drugs More than  MediCal patients are prescribed drugs for hepatitis C now These new drugs are expensive said MediCal spokesman Norman Williams MediCal is currently negotiating with the drug manufacturers for a state supplemental rebate California said no decision has been made on requests from MediCal managedcare plans to carve out these drugs from already negotiated rates and reimburse insurers separately for them Molina Healthcare Inc a major Medicaid managedcare plan in California and  other states has asked health officials across the country for guidance on how to proceed with patients Im scratching my head why the American taxpayer is being asked to pay such an enormous price for this drug said J Mario Molina the companys chief executive WellPoint Inc the nations secondlargest health insurer said it costs nearly  more on average to treat hepatitis C patients on its state Medicaid plans since the newer drugs were introduced While new drug treatments for hepatitis C have shown to be highly effective these drugs could have a serious impact on premiums said Charles Bacchi executive vice president at the California Assn of Health Plans an industry trade group As with many new drugs MediCal is requiring prior authorization before patients can receive them Some health insurers may require patients to try older less expensive treatments first The potential pool of hepatitis C patients is expected to grow as more screening occurs Federal officials have recommended that all baby boomers be tested for hepatitis C because researchers have found a higher prevalence of the disease among that group Hepatitis C can go undetected for years and many people show no symptoms The transmission of the disease is often associated with intravenous drug use But people have contracted it in the past through blood transfusions transplants or in some cases sexual contact Thus far existing patients have been able to receive the new treatments Uninsured lowincome patients treated in Los Angeles County facilities have been receiving the drugs free under the manufacturers assistance programs said Dr Mitchell Katz director of the county Department of Health Services Project Inform an HIV and hepatitis advocacy organization in San Francisco said that callers to its help line have not reported trouble getting the new medicines But David Evans director of research advocacy at Project Inform said hes concerned that could change if insurers or public programs begin rationing therapy for only the sickest patients We should be pushing all of the payers to give access Evans said Dont punish the patients because they have hepatitis For many years the standard treatment for hepatitis C patients was a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin Starting in  doctors added new antiviral drugs to the mix Like those medications Olysio is approved for use with interferon and ribavirin But the US Food and Drug Administration approved Sovaldi for use without interferon and ribavirin in certain cases That has opened up the possibility of treating many patients who couldnt tolerate the side effects of interferon said Dr Rena Fox a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco Sovaldi Fox said is the true game changer Twitter  Twitter
