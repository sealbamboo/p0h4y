People may think that ecigarettes are a safer alternative to tobacco but insurers might not agree Tobacco use is one of just four things that insurers that sell health plans on the individual market can   when determining someones premium age geographic location and family size are the other three People who use tobacco can be charged up to  percent more than nonsmokers Under the rules use of any tobacco product four or more times a week on average in the past six months could subject someone to the tobacco surcharge But  states   insurers from applying the tobacco surcharge in the individual market according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services So the big question will be if insurers end up classifying ecigarettes as tobaco products The batterypowered devices   producing a smokelike vapor that usually contains nicotine and flavoring agents The Food and Drug Administration  in April when it   although the proposed regulations arent as strict as those for regular cigarettes The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also is looking into the use of ecigarettes and the tobacco surcharge according to an agency official But a lot of this will rest on the science and the jury is still out the health effects of ecigarettes In a recent   researchers at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco found that although the longterm health effects of ecigarettes are still largely unknown they emit potentially harmful substances into the air and can be a source of indoor pollution The researchers also found that ecigarettes actually reduce the likelihood that people will quit smoking in contrast to advertising claims that firing up an ecig will help people kick the habit The potential role of ecigarettes as a smoking cessation tool has insurance coverage implications too The health law requires most health plans to cover FDAapproved smoking cessation products and counseling without any outofpocket cost to consumers The federal government   clarifying which services and products must be covered Since ecigarettes arent FDAapproved for quitting smoking  and in fact are on the brink of being labeled by the agency to warrant regulation like cigarettes  they arent covered as a free preventive benefit under the law Clearly more specific guidance will be needed The Affordable Care Act does not specify ecigarette use for purposes of cessation coverage or tobacco surcharge application says Catherine McMahon policy principal at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network The lack of clarity may allow health plans to try to add the surcharge for ecigarettes
