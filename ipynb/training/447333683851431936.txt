A leading researcher on cholesterollowering statin drugs has accused critics of misleading the public about the dangers of taking them  Prof Sir Rory Collins said two critical articles published in the British Medical Journal BMJ were flawed But BMJ editor Dr Fiona Godlee said they were well researched The drugs are already offered to about seven million people in the UK who have a oneinfive chance of heart disease in the next decade The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE says the scope for offering this treatment should be widened to people with as low as a one in  or  risk to save more lives Its recommendation follows a study which was overseen by Professor Collins team at Oxford University  Prof Collins criticised articles in the BMJ by John Abramson from Harvard medical school and Aseem Malhotra a UK cardiologist who both claimed statins caused harmful sideeffects and did not reduce mortality He told BBC Radio s Today programme Statins are given to people at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes  if people at elevated risk stop taking their statins or dont start taking their statins then they will have unnecessary heart attacks and strokes there will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes This is really irresponsible journalism He said the studies claims that about  of people suffer disabling sideeffects due to statins was not supported by the original research referenced by the papers published by the BMJ He   was creating a situation which had echoes of the MMR vaccine controversy It is a serious disservice to British and international medicine he said  But the BMJs editor Dr Fiona Godlee defended the articles saying some research understated the risks of sideeffects The randomised control trial data is notoriously poor at reporting adverse events So I think its extremely important that the public understand when were talking about extending statins to people at low risk that the balance between benefits and harms becomes much more important she said She added The articles were well written well referenced they were peer reviewed Dr Godlee also criticised the fact that the individual patient data of Prof Collins research had not been released Its no longer sufficient to make widespread extension of drug treatments on the basis of data that is not widely available for scrutiny she said  Currently doctors are supposed to offer statin tablets to the estimated seven million people who have a  chance of developing cardiovascular disease over  years based on risk factors such as their age sex whether they smoke and what they weigh Doctors will need to make a judgement about the risks to people who have a less than  risk of developing cardiovascular disease and advise them appropriately say the draft guidelines The NHS currently spends about m a year on statins If the draft recommendations go ahead this bill will increase substantially although the drugs have become significantly cheaper over the years
