 Sandwiched between three mindnumbing years of basic science courses and hospital rotations and the lockdown years of residency training the fourth year of medical school has long been a welcome respite for future doctors It is the only time in their medical education when students have few requirements and a plethora of elective course offerings  and the time to go on vacation and spend time with friends and family  Do it now a mentor said as I was about to start my last year because you may never get the chance again  I followed that advice wholeheartedly I spent most of my fourth year away from my medical school caring for children with hematologic disorders one month then shadowing cancer surgeons for another in hopes of figuring out which specialty I liked more I spent time working in a laboratory something Id never done learning how to culture and freeze cells care for mice and critique studies I attended national medical meetings hung out with old friends and slept and ate to my hearts content at my parents home For me it was a pivotal reassuring year But not all of my classmates felt the same One friend interested in a particularly competitive residency spent much of the year in highstress audition clerkships fourweek clinical tours at hospitals where she hoped to train she resented having to pay tuition at our home school while paying travel and living expenses so she could learn at other institutions Another older classmate who had already spent  successful years in another profession was just eager to get on with his training for him a fourth year filled with electives and extended vacations was a waste of time and tuition money  The fourth year is kind of bogus one friend recently recalled It might have been fun at the time but Im not sure it made me a better doctor These disparate opinions came to mind recently when I read two   in The New England Journal of Medicine on   For several years medical educators have been engaged in an increasingly heated and occasionally cantankerous   and training Many experts have suggested   but surprisingly few have argued for similarly dramatic changes in the medical school curriculum   as part of a   to a chaotic collection of schools apprenticeships and flybynight training programs the fouryear medical school curriculum is the sacred cow of medical education Like soldiers in lockstep nearly all medical students over the last  years have spent their first two years in lecture halls learning the theory and basic science of medicine and their third and fourth years on the wards learning the practical clinical applications Apart from a few   during World War II and in the s to shorten the curriculum to three years not even the most radical of educational reformers have dared stray from the norm carefully integrating their changes well within the venerated fouryear framework  But now it appears that the convergence of physician shortages rising health care costs and student debt has begun to tip this hallowed heifer In  responding to the physician shortage Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine began offering a threeyear medical school track for select students interested in primary care Soon thereafter Mercer University School of Medicines campus in Savannah Ga    and this fall   in addition to its traditional fouryear students its first group of students to pursue a threeyear option Proponents believe that the threeyear programs will help address several pressing issues By producing doctors faster threeyear MD degree programs help to address the critical doctor deficits   And with almost twothirds of medical students graduating with   and more students entering   the threeyear option allows students to begin practicing sooner and with as much as  percent less debt We cant dissociate medical education from societal and student needs said Dr Steven B Abramson lead author of the   and vice dean for medical education faculty and academic affairs at NYU We cant just sit back in an ivory tower and support a mandatory year of prolonged adolescence and finding oneself when society needs doctors to get out into the community sooner But critics are quick to point out the failures of past attempts to do the same In the s for example with support from the federal government as many as  medical schools began offering a threeyear MD option to address the impending physician shortages of the time While the threeyear students did as well or better on tests as their fouryear counterparts the vast majority if offered a choice would have chosen the traditional fouryear route instead Many who completed their work in three years were exhausted by the pace of accelerated study and as many as a quarter asked to extend their studies by a year or two anyway  The most vocal critics were the faculty who under enormous constraints themselves to compress their lessons found their students under too much pressure to     The threeyear experiments were quickly abandoned You cant pretend to have a great educational experience without spending time on the educational experience said Dr Stanley Goldfarb   and associate dean for curriculum at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Dr Goldfarb and other critics contend that a host of new issues complicate the issue The amount of material that students must assimilate for example has increased dramatically since the s and regulations now limit the number of hours trainees can work in the hospital Taking away an entire year of the educational process dramatically whittles away the time young doctors have to interact with patients and gain critical clinical experiences  The complexity of medicine is greater than its ever been Dr Goldfarb noted Compressing what has become more complex than its ever been seems counterintuitive Four more medical schools are nonetheless   And while all of these shorter programs still remain an option and not the norm the debate they have incited has brought greater attention to other exciting initiatives like a   that is based on a students actual skill rather than the number of years completed This competencybased assessment would mean that students would be allowed to graduate when they demonstrated the skills and not just when they fulfilled the fouryear requirements of a yearold standard Everything has changed around us Dr Abramson said Specialties have changed society has changed and the debt burden has changed We are never going to be able to adapt to changing needs of society and of our students if we continue to believe that the way we educate medical students is sacred
