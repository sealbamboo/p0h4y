Though increasingly common Alzheimers disease still isnt all that easy to diagnose especially in its early stages Forgetfulness and other signs of dementia can be caused by lots of things other than Alzheimers Sometimes the symptoms are fleeting or normal in the context of a persons age But at other times these symptoms mark the dark path of Alzheimers Doctors standard approach to diagnosis includes taking a medical history of the patient assessing mental function and administering various neurological and lab tests Since last year theres been a new drug to help The Food and Drug Administration approved a radioactive tracer called   for use in PET scans to identify clumps of proteins in the brain that are associated with Alzheimers disease Researchers have   to gauge these socalled amyloid plaques in the brain Theyve already found that amyloid shows up years before people start having problems with memory or thinking But is the test appropriate for widespread clinical use A panel of advisers grappled with that question Wednesday at a public meeting to consider whether   The mere presence of plaque on a PET scan doesnt prove someone has Alzheimers according to the   And the results cant be used to predict how dementia may develop or whether a patient is responding to drug therapy If no plaques are found the test can help rule out Alzheimers Amyvid isnt cheap The drug costs about  per patient exam The total cost of a test with the drug including the PET scan and doctors time runs about  The panel zeroed in on whether the results of the Amyvid test had a meaningful effect on the outcomes for patients The panel was skeptical given the limited effectiveness of current drugs available to treat Alzheimers I just cant connect the dots between the current state of knowledge of the way the test performs and the outcome said panelist   a former FDA official now working for Myraqa a consulting firm I dont think you can create a chain of evidence here that works he said according to Dotmed News   Geriatrician   chief scientific officer of the Alzheimers Drug Discovery Foundation who testified at the hearing rejected the prevailing therapeutic nihilism about Alzheimers Even without a cure for it he said there are choices to be made once a diagnosis of Alzheimers has been reached  or when it has been ruled out There are huge care management issues in this disease where early diagnosis has been shown to be costeffective he said But there were worries the Amyvid test would be overused I would expect every patient over  would eventually get this test said   of Massachusetts General Hospitals Institute for Technology Assessment In the end the panel which casts votes on a fivepoint scale rated its confidence that the evidence is adequate to make a decision about Amyvid having an effect on patient outcomes at about   in the lowtointermediate range of its scale Thats not an endorsement for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to start paying for the test The agency isnt bound by the advice however Eli Lilly  Co whose Avid Radiopharmaceuticals subsidiary makes Amyvid stood behind the test The overwhelmingly positive testimony presented by the medical experts around the clinical utility of betaamyloid imaging agents reinforces that these tools should be a Medicare covered benefit for patients with cognitive impairment being evaluated for Alzheimers Disease and other causes of cognitive decline said a statement by WeiLi Shao senior director for Lillys Alzheimers business He encouraged CMS to heavily consider the realworld medical experience presented and   developed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging and the Alzheimers Association to outline appropriate use of the test
