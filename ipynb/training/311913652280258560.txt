If youre heading down to Florida for spring break   packing bug spray and longsleeve shirts After a year hiatus the mosquitoborne illness dengue fever officially reestablished itself there People infected during a  outbreak in Florida didnt catch the virus abroad but rather got a strain thats unique to Key West virologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Wednesday in the journal   The virus has been circulating around the Key West population for at least two years the researchers say and it has evolved its own genetic fingerprint distinct from dengue in Central America and the Caribbean Also known as breakbone fever   causes pounding headache high fever and such severe joint pain that you feel like your bones are  well breaking Theres no vaccine or cure Although the disease is rarely fatal doctors cant do much for it except treat the symptoms Dengue fever was endemic in the US before World War II until the US Army led aggressive mosquitoeradication campaigns to   among troops Their efforts wiped out malaria in the US and took dengue along with it But in the past decade or so the virus and its primary transmitter the   mosquito have been slowly   back into Florida In  a woman from New York caught dengue while vacationing in Key West It was the first case acquired in Florida in at least  years and it triggered a larger investigation A   by the CDC found that about  percent of the Key West community had been exposed to the virus and at least  people got sick In  the cases grew to  and none of those infected had traveled to places outside the US where the virus typically hangs out Such evidence suggested that dengue fever had set up longterm residency in Key West instead of just popping in periodically with travelers But to know for sure where a virus originates you have to look at its genes So dengue specialist Jorge MunozJordan and his team at the CDC examined the RNA sequences from  dengue strains around Florida The viruses from Key West all shared a similar genetic code which was different from dengue strains found elsewhere in the world In contrast viruses from mainland Florida looked very similar to dengue in Central America and probably hopped a ride to the US with vacationers The group of viruses in Key West are practically identical to each other MunozJordan tells Shots They form a little family to themselves MunozJordan isnt sure why dengue has returned to Florida But the disease is definitely expanding its reach around the world In January the World Health Organization   that dengue cases had increased thirtyfold over the past  years making breakbone fever the fastest spreading vectorborne viral disease in the world Of course the threat of dengue in Florida is minor compared with other tropical regions Since the  outbreak Florida has seen only a handful of dengue cases MunozJordan says while nearby Puerto Rico recorded around  infections just in  The WHO estimates that nearly  million people are infected with dengue fever each year globally
