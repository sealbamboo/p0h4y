I plan to keep my nose And I have you to thank Rene Zellweger  Your decision to do   is helping me accept my yearold face as it is More to the point I have decided not to go under the knife after all to fix that slightly bent nose of mine Even after being savaged in a recent online forum about my face Last year I wrote an essay   mildly mocking myself for the myriad ways I have tried to turn back Father Time I confessed to getting blond highlights to cover the gray taking ice baths to maintain a youthful vigor and  drumroll please  undergoing surgery to blast away my eye bags My goal was to show that it is not just women who are held to untenable standards of youth and beauty in this culture Although I will be the first to admit it is still easier for us guys To this point the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery   that The number of cosmetic procedures for men increased over  percent from  A few days after the article was published a friend in London sent me a   all about me and my essay The boldfaced headline was Selfconfessed vain man  I paused in midsentence because my eye caught the two photos the Mail had chosen to run of me One was a fairly current author photo blown up so much that I could see right inside my nose every facial flaw was magnified to the extreme for the papers voracious readers The other photo was almost  years old I guess the photo editor dug it up online Im quite sure it had been Photoshopped tan deepened teeth whitened somewhere along its journey from the Google archives to front and center in The Daily Mail The story proved not nearly as painful to read as the comments which were so numerous and vociferous that the webmaster quickly posted We are no longer accepting comments on this article I myself could only bear to read about a halfdozen which included this little gem Presumably this comment was about my Before photo  with Photoshop the only invasive procedure When Ms Zellwegers big reveal spread across the web last week I both felt sorry for her and curious about what else had been said about me  and my face Believe me when I say this was not an exercise for the faint of heart Herewith a couple more Then The Mails readers decided to let me know how old they really thought I looked Some of my favorites included Well make up your minds Although really who asked your opinion Seemingly no topic was off bounds Others felt the need to comment on my sexual orientation although I had come out in my story noting a samesex husband Posted one reader Finally the coup de grace A laserlike focus on my nose I have a deviated septum with my nose tilting to the left Its asymmetry has long been a sore point for this selfconfessed vain man And at times I snore worse than a horse Yes its true Ive twice consulted doctors about fixing it Most of all I think my husband would appreciate it  for the additional zzzs he would get Daily Mail readers had a lot to say about that part of my face Those comments finally pushed me over the edge or should I say back from the brink of another surgery While facial symmetry is often equated with classic beauty I decided I am just fine embracing my lack of perfect balance which is a good thing because I have one foot thats smaller than the other and an offcenter belly button thanks to an abdominal surgery  For sure Ms Zellwegers previously squinty eyes and chipmunk cheeks werent the quintessential definition of beauty either but they certainly made her stand out in a world of cookiecutter actors Debora L Spar the president of Barnard College and the author of   said to another reporter The things that made her unique are now gone and now she looks like a million other people  I plan to keep my nose just the way it is because my nose makes me look like me This decision is made just a little bit easier by a rare supportive post among The Daily Mails commenters who wrote of me  Alright so Im a little vain
