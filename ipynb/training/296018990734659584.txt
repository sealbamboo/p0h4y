Palm Springs with Frank Sinatra Colorado with Gerald Ford Aaron Spelling and Nancy Reagan as family friends Nancy Davis days were glamorous and full when she got the diagnosis that would change her life I was diagnosed with    years ago recalls Davis the daughter of former oil billionaire and film studio owner Marvin Davis At that time there was no known cause no cure no drugs on the market I went to a doctor and he said go home and go to bed she saysÂ I was  And I had a lot of plans for my life  All of a sudden I felt like this person came and cut me down and said no life anymore Initially Davis   and a frantic search for second opinions I lived in denial for another month and thought if I get enough second opinions somebody in fact will tell me I dont have this disease called multiple sclerosis I didnt want to have it says Davis And then gradually she began to research the condition that currently affects  million people worldwide She turned what she learned into a proactive and unconventional plan for living with her own disease Then she confronted what she saw as a somewhat haphazard effort to find a cure for MS and put her connections and fortune to work helping to organize and pay for MS research  an effort that has contributed to the development of seven of the nine MS drugs now on the market I think when people tell you theyre taking your life away and youre not going to be able to do anything you want to get it all in while you still can cause you kind of have this fear that tomorrow Im going to wake up and not be able to do anything Davis shares I think it stimulates you more to do those things that you might have not wanted to do  I have this little thing hanging over my head Its telling me to   At the time of her diagnosis Davis was a yearold mother of three leading by all appearances a charmed life Her father  who   magazine said was worth  billion in   had just sold Pebble Beach Golf Links one of the most beautiful golf courses in the world for  million and Davis was one of the beneficiaries Elizabeth Taylor was her neighbor and she is godmother to Nicole Ritchie MS  specifically a  diagnosis of relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis  was definitely NOT part of the script An autoimmune disorder MS typically lies dormant for years before causing the immune system to attack healthy tissue It usually surfaces between the ages of  and  and develops in more than twice as many women than men according to the   Symptoms range from blurred vision fatigue and pain to cognitive decline tremors and paralysis Davis believes her disease was activated by a skiing accident and the stress of a bad marriage   I blamed everything on the ski accident of course because that was easier she adds I had my knee surgery and right after the ski accident I started having my MS symptoms  It was this thing that was just lying in my body that I didnt know about After getting over the initial shock and depression of what she took to be a death sentence  Davis recalls telling her doctors You basically just took my life away and have given me no hope  she learned to live with the disease including periods when it takes a turn for the worse Those days are scary Its very hard to function Theres a huge amount of exhaustion   There are times when you have no feeling in lots of parts of your body If you lose the feeling in your hands you cant drive you cant write you cant do a lot of things she reveals The disease is very unpredictable and it takes turns and if you have it one way it might completely switch on you and have different things  so no people with MS ever have the same exact situation she says If you have certain symptoms it doesnt mean these are always going to be your exact   Based on her personal research and experience Davis a poised polished West Coast blond currently subscribes to a   I think that MS is so different for everybody and you have to find that thing that works for you and empower yourself to make that big choice she says I think a positive attitude for anybody with any disease is really important When you always feel that youre the victim and youre not willing to take the steps to make yourself feel better youre not going to do well Homeopathic treatment is met with much skepticism by most physicians Just because something is natural if its not studied it might be bad for this disease says Karen BlitzShabbir MD director of the MS center at the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset NY We dont know if it negatively impacts the efficacy of  medicine We dont know if it enhances your immune system We dont know There are no studies on all these natural therapies Dr BlitzShabbir asserts Davis believes homeopathy has worked well for her At  she welcomed twins into her family She has also launched her own jewelry line Peace and Love Jewelry and has authored the book   which chronicles her MS journey She has not had any flare ups for the past year But beyond taking care of herself Davis has devoted much of her energy to jumpstarting the search for new drugs and MS treatments In researching her own disease Davis was confronted with a lack of available information on MS and discovered that scientists involved in the search for cures didnt always communicate with each other  particularly when their findings were disappointing  and sometimes replicated the same research She decided to take matters into her own hands There has to be hope and so a light bulb went off in my head and I thought if I can make a difference the best thing I can do is have all the best doctors work as a team to never duplicate each others research and communicate every month about everything going on and we will get there quicker exclaims Davis Everybody thinks that doctors communicate And they do after theyve had a successful study Ninety percent of all studies end up with a negative result The negative is as important as the positive she stresses Davis established her own foundation in    that sponsors the starstudded Race to Erase MS gala forum and symposium each May  its represented by the color orange  and this year the foundation will honor rock royalty Sharon Osbourne and her son   Were going to honor Jack and Sharon this year at our Race to Erase MS says Davis I really feel like they embody what people youre honoring should be all about and are really forcefully trying to change the whole landscape of MS Davis organization garners a tremendous amount of celebrity support from Tommy Hilfiger and Avril Lavigne to Stevie Wonder and   We have such a wonderful support system in the Hollywood community that comes together and really helps us year after year Davis says They want to make sure that theyre part of something thats going to make a difference  Im so grateful that theyre giving that time and tone It helps raise the profile of what were doing she adds To date Davis charity has raised over  million Part of what were trying to do is help bring public awareness to understanding what MS is she proclaims With all of her success Davis still remains grounded and thankful You know Im the luckiest person living today with MS When doctors look at my MRI they say I shouldnt really be walking she says I have my black belt I ski Im now a   and I have a jewelry business and I run a charity full time and Im living a full time life But most importantly Davis asserts The dream is I have to find a cure for MS Proceeds from the gala fund Davis Center Without Walls program which spearheads new medical discoveries for MS treatment The foundation brings together the best and brightest minds from around the country  including experts at Harvard Yale and Johns Hopkins to name a few  and recruits and funds young new scientists and their research Young researchers have learned medicine in a very different way than older doctors who are respected Davis asserts MS is changing It is fast Its fast and furious Amazing young doctors are really on the cusp of all these things Of the many   as a result of her foundations efforts Davis says I think its amazing and Im constantly talking to patients who are on these medicines They work really well And different medicines are right for different patients with different types of MS She is confident that more treatments will be found and that the future holds a reality of being able to treat most anybody But at the same time Davis stresses the importance of patients being accountable for their health A doctor cant read your mind and its your job because its your body Youre responsible for it for taking notes and telling your doctor everything that your are feeling  Its really important that people empower themselves to know their own body
