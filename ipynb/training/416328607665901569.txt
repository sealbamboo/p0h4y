The study which was conducted in Finland followed  patients between the ages of  and  with symptoms of degenerative wear and tear of the meniscus a diskshaped piece of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the shinbone and thighbone They had no detectable arthritis suggesting that any pain was due to a problem with the meniscus About half the patients underwent an arthroscopic meniscectomy in which a surgeon inserts a blade through a tiny incision in the knee and essentially shaves down the rough frayed edges of the meniscus  The other half underwent an elaborately staged sham surgery in which the doctor made an incision and poked around without any actual manipulation shaving or cutting  A year later there was no significant difference in the knee pain reported by patients in each group Nearly twothirds on each side said they were happy with the results and most said they would do it all again   In patients without arthritis the authors conclude the procedure provides no significant benefit over sham surgery   As many as  arthroscopic partial meniscectomies are performed in the United States every year at a direct cost of  billion according to the study authors  But the procedure has come under scrutiny with the publication of papers      and    that found it provides little or no benefit in older patients whose meniscus is frayed through simple wear and tear as opposed to a specific injury  Its pretty obvious to anyone who really has an interest in this that what weve called a meniscal tear isnt really a tear says Dr Teppo Jarvinen who led the research team It has nothing to do with the tears we talk about in a yearold athlete who twists or sprains their knee   According to some the new study draws a stronger conclusion because it includes patients with mechanical symptoms like popping clicking or a sense of the knee locking up  When we hear a knee is locking a bell goes off this needs arthroscopy says Dr Dennis Cardone an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York  If anything this study swings it a little bit more Even when a patient complains of locking arthroscopy might not be necessary  But Dr Frederick Azar vicepresident of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says patients in the study are not typical  To have a degenerative medical meniscus tear and no evidence or arthritis is extremely unusual says Azar Its well less than  of the patients we see    Dr Scott Rodeo cochief of the Sports Medicine and Shoulder Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York says its likely that many of the patients in the study are in the early stages of developing arthritis even if its not detectable through Xrays  He said the Finnish study reaffirms the sense that surgery is not likely to help these patients whose pain is due to arthritis   Azar a professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee and team physician for the Memphis Grizzlies basketball team says hes worried about scaring away patients who might be helped This is a very useful lowcost intervention with a short recovery time and good results in most patients he says A worn meniscus can be a simple result of aging but its more common in people whose knees take a lot of pounding including longdistance runners and people whose jobs have them standing for long periods on a hard floor Obesity is an additional risk factor  The Finnish study looks at meniscectomy as opposed to meniscus repair in which a surgeon actually sews together torn cartilage According to Cardone patients under  do especially well with meniscus repair especially those whose injury stems from a single incident   But orthopedists say many people with knee pain can be helped with physical therapy to strengthen muscles that support the knee  Before recommending surgery Azar also counsels patients to consider switching to lowimpact activities  for example to mix biking or swimming into a workout routine instead of just longdistance running He says other patients may be helped by antiinflammatories or injections of hyaluronic acid  In advanced cases when the meniscus is totally worn away more drastic steps are an option  If its boneonbone says Azar their pain is coming from osteoarthritis and the only surgery to help is a knee replacement But we try to exhaust all measures before doing that  However Jarvinen says the abundance of caution needs to start much earlier  All your fellow orthopedic surgeons will tell you I already knew this But the facts are this is still the most common orthopedic procedure he says and the vast majority of operations are unnecessary
