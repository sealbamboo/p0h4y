Theres not much in health care that economists agree on But one of the few things that bring them together is the idea that   is nuts It just doesnt make sense says   an MIT health economist and  author of   And its important to emphasize in this world where economists seem to agree about nothing this is something where theres just broad and universal agreement There are several reasons for that One is that its expensive  it costs the federal government   Another is that its regressive  it benefits people with higher incomes more than those who earn less And finally the tax benefit encourages people to take their compensation in health insurance rather than wages That in turn encourages them to use more and more health care Heres another way to think about it says Gruber who   on the subject We have a system where we bribe you to get employersponsored insurance And the richer you are the bigger bribe you get So if everyone agrees its such a wrongheaded policy why is it still around Mostly its inertia Its very hard to get rid of the policy Its very hard because people view it as a tax increase Gruber says And as hard as economists try to explain that no its just ending a tax subsidy  people just say dont increase the taxes on my health insurance  Organized labor has led the defense Unions have spent years negotiating for better benefits rather than higher wages ATT call center worker Valeria CastleStanley   from southwest Virginia back in  to protest the idea of taxing the most generous health plans to help pay for the federal health law Were not rich she said at a demonstration outside the Capitol on that cold December day Were average middleclass Americans We need quality health care When I heard some of our senators want to tax our health care I just couldnt believe it The health law in the end did include the socalled   although it doesnt take effect until  But labor officials warn its not just union members who will be affected when that tax kicks in Same goes if Congress decides to expand the taxation of employerprovided health insurance Whats likely to happen to most workers is that employers will push down the value of their coverage and their insurance plans will simply cover less says Tom Leibfried a lobbyist for the   So their deductibles will be higher Their copays with each visit will be higher Many of the approaches to putting a limit on this tax exclusion are designed to do just that  increase cost sharing for consumers Leibfried says that taxing health benefits is based on the idea that working families are overinsured and use too many services But I have yet to meet anyone who comes forward to say they feel like theyre overinsured Unions arent the only ones resistant to changing the tax treatment of health insurance however Were very concerned at this pivotal transitional moment in the nations health care system about any change in tax treatment that would upset the apple cart in terms of what is so important for employees financial protection says Jim Klein Hes president of the   which represents large employers who offer health insurance to their workers Klein also insists its backward to say that the tax exclusion benefits the wealthier more For whom would it be more difficult to obtain coverage if not from their employer  Warren Buffett or his secretary he says The benefit is very progressive It means much more to a lowerpaid person than a higherwage individual Its been that combination of opposition from both employers and workers that has made the tax treatment of health insurance sacrosanct for so long But Ron Pollack of the consumer group   says he wouldnt be shocked to see a bigger effort to tax health benefits if  and its a big if  it was in exchange for sparing Medicare and Medicaid from larger cuts If theres a modification in the tax exclusion if thats used as a way to allow tax rates to go down  I just dont think that makes sense at all Pollack says If on the other hand its used to minimize any potential cuts to Medicaid and Medicare then I think weve got something thats sensible Because youre protecting programs for people that desperately need them And if youre doing it carefully youre finding an alternative that really affects people at the highest income levels and people who have really good health coverage Whether Congress and the president will take that advice however remains the  billion question
