When I was  my dad drew this picture of me You will notice something on my left cheek  a little brown spot Thats a mole The doctor called it a birthmark My mom called it a beauty mark I was born with it Having grown up before supermodel Cindy Crawford became famous I was not familiar with the allure of beauty marks and anyway Im a guy My mom said it was hardly noticeable I didnt believe her It didnt go away Worse in my mind it was growing bigger In grade school I worried that the mark on my cheek was the first thing people saw when they looked at me I would look at photos of myself and Id always see the dot first me second I was not even remotely a boy with a dot I was a dot with a boy Thats me on the left Thats how I felt on the right Even much later in my s if I happened to be in the same room with someone with a birthmark on his cheek Id get enormously embarrassed It didnt matter if the Dotted One was somebody I admired like   the actor who played JohnBoy in   One day Richard Thomas came to NPR he has a dot on his left cheek just like me My friends knew of my umm problem they arranged for me to pop in and say hi to Richard whispering Robert you can do this  but when the moment came I thought oh no two dots on the same cheeks in the same room  the world might explode It was that bad I couldnt go in Even when I was older and calmer still I hoped my dot would disappear It never did but as the decades rolled on it faded a little and now I dont think about it much But last week I heard the wonderful   and my dot feelings came rushing back Jupiter is apparently experiencing the very thing I had hoped for for so long slow Dot Removal Maybe you saw the news Jupiter the planet is a cloudy stormy place with bands of clouds moving at different speeds across its surface but its most prominent feature sits just below its equator You can see it in the photograph below  its called the Great Red Spot a ferocious anticyclone that blows winds counterclockwise at more than  kilometers an hour Its been storming that way for centuries What astronomers call a storm I call a dot When astronomers   Jupiters dot in the late s it was wide enough to fit three Earths comfortably side by side at  kilometers across Thats enormous But then in  and  the spot was measured again and mysteriously it had shrunk By almost half To  kilometers As you can see from these subsequent dot photos on the right side of the image in   and  the dot kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller No one has a good explanation for whats happening but it keeps happening According to NASA the   seems to be quickening Its now losing around  kilometers of dot every year The last measurement from Hubble telescope on April  was just under  kilometers across the smallest diameter weve ever measured says Amy Simon of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland Will it go to zero Who knows But oh I hope so  for Jupiters sake Speaking as a Dotted One dots arent pleasant Ive read that as she got older even   goddess of the Beauty Mark had   about hers It grew a little and she worried I dont know what Richard Thomas thinks because as Ive mentioned weve never talked But I do have little chats with Jupiter all the time Ill look up at it in the early evenings cover my dot with my pointer finger so it cant hear and I say through gritted teeth lucky you And Jupiter I feel this  Jupiter knows exactly what Im talking about Its got to be totally pleased One day it will do a complete rotation and this thing on its surface will have  poof  disappeared And if planets can sigh thats what Jupiter will do Im so jealous
