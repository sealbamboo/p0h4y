a day for  years Richard knew his days were numbered even though he had    years before his diagnosis of stage  cancer Now there is guarded hope for the millions of other former and current smokers who are at high risk of developing one of the deadliest of cancers Through the Affordable Care Act and if draft recommendations are adopted soon through   as well many insured individuals will be eligible for a free CT exam that for some at least could be lifesaving  is the third most common cancer among Americans exceeded only by cancers of the prostate and breast But it remains by far the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women causing more deaths annually than breast and prostate cancers combined Despite treatment advances for many cancers lung cancer has remained a stubborn killer with only  percent of patients alive five years after diagnosis This year an estimated  people in this country will learn they have lung cancer and more than  will die of the disease according to the   The disease is aggressive and  percent of cases are diagnosed in advanced stages which accounts for the low survival rate Only  percent of lung cancers are discovered in stage  or  when surgery offers a potential cure and only about half of those are cured Now after years of research and one of the largest cancer screening trials ever mounted there is genuine hope for reducing the toll exacted by this disease A   involving  current and former smokers believed to be healthy showed that annual screening by lowdose computed tomography or LDCT could prevent three lung cancer deaths for every  people screened Given the millions of people at risk that could translate to a lot of lives saved But it is by no means a miraculous solution to lung cancer mortality for every  people screened  still died of the disease All told of the  study participants screened with LDCT for three years  received a lung cancer diagnosis and within three years of followup  died of the disease For the benefits shown in the trial to be fully realized and for those benefits to outweigh potentially serious risks screening would have to be limited to people at high risk of developing lung cancer As   by Dr Peter B Bach of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center and Dr Michael K Gould of Kaiser Permanente Southern California screening highrisk individuals would prevent  times as many lung cancer deaths as screening those at low risk of developing the disease In addition to maximize the ratio of benefit to risk screening should only be done at venues with uptodate equipment and thoroughly trained personnel who know whom to test how to interpret the results and when to follow up with additional tests and treatment if needed Dr Bach said Such criteria resulted in a  percent higher survival rate in individuals screened annually for three years by LDCT than that achieved through screening by chest   LastDecember the United States Preventive Services Task Force   with LDCT be limited to adults between the ages of  and  who have at least a packyear smoking history and either still smoke or quit within the last  years Packyears are calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years a person smoked A  packyear history would result for example from smoking a pack a day for  years or two packs a day for  years or half a pack a day for  years The task force also recommended that screening be discontinued after a person had not smoked for  years or developed a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative   A Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool developed by Memorial SloanKettering is   Why shouldnt everyone get a LDCT screening test Although the test itself is noninvasive and the amount of radiation involved is very low comparable to six months of natural background radiation it is also associated with potentially serious risks Most common is the risk of a falsepositive result Up to half of lung   seen on LDCT turn out not to be cancer Although in most cases a repeat scan can rule out cancer in others a lung biopsy which can be risky is required In the national trial major complications including some deaths occurred in  of every  persons from procedures used to determine whether nodules seen on LDCT were cancerous Followup tests can also uncover other possible unrelated problems that must be checked leading to a spiral of additional procedures any of which can have its own complications Anxiety can also result from a suspicious finding prompting a Brown University team to   beforehand about the potentially high rate of false positives and significant incidental findings associated with LDCT screening Then there is the cost which    billion for Medicare alone and higher rates for everyone insured The trial   compared with no screening LDCT costs an additional  for a person to achieve an additional  years of life for a total of  per lifeyear gained or  for each qualityadjusted lifeyear Finally every screening program should offer help for smoking cessation Dr Bach said Stopping smoking is far more important than screening Laurie Fenton Ambrose president of the   an advocacy group said screening provides a teachable moment and a chance to provide smoking cessation tools that can result in a quit rate four times higher than in the general population She said her organization is working with hospitals to assure that every screening program follows best practices Â
