Back in  doctors in Cambodia made a worrisome discovery They were having a hard time curing some people of malaria Even the most powerful drug wasnt clearing out the parasite from patients blood as quickly as it should Malaria had evolved resistance to the last medicine we have against it a drug called   At the time scientists thought they might be able to keep this dangerous form of malaria from spreading says biologist   of the University of Washington There has been a hope that we could keep drugresistant malaria in the Pailin province of Cambodia she says That you could launch a massive intervention cast a ring around it and extinguish it Now all those hopes have been dashed A study   Wednesday in the   found that artemisininresistant malaria is common throughout mainland Southeast Asia Its cropped up in Thailand Laos Vietnam and Myanmar an international team of scientists reported The takehome message of the study is clear says Sibley who wasnt involved in the study Drugresistant malaria hasnt stayed in Pailin Although theres no evidence yet that the dangerous type of malaria has spread outside Southeast Asia scientists are looking for it in Africa and fear it could easily jump over to nearby India Artemisinin comes from a shrubbery plant called   The Chinese have used wormword extracts for thousands of years to treat fevers and artemisinin drugs were highly effective in Cambodia for decades So why has the drug lost its potency recently Researchers arent sure says   of the University of Maryland School of Medicine who contributed to the study But now that drug resistance has occurred it seems to be spreading pretty rapidly It looks like the parasites in Southeast Asia have picked up a few mutations in their DNA that make it easier for them to evolve drug resistance Plowe says Its like the parasites have a genetic predisposition for picking up resistance he says just like some people have a genetic predisposition for gaining weight or getting a specific type of cancer The good news though is that artemisinin can still cure nearly all malaria infections when its mixed with other drugs It just takes longer to clear the parasite out of the blood in some cases Plowe says Instead of taking a day or two after starting treatment it can take up to four or five days he says Artemisinin is the last approved drug that can cure any type of malaria around the world But there are a few new medicines in the pipeline One from the pharmaceutical company Novartis can clear the parasite from blood in about  hours a preliminary study   The new drug looks promising Plowe says But its only been tested in very small studies So it will be some time before thats available
