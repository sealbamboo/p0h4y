Many doctors arent asking teenagers about sex or sexuality and those who do are spending just  seconds on the topic on average Thats not much time to get into sexually transmitted diseases or birth control let alone sexual orientation dating or other big topics And teenagers are so bashful when it comes to asking questions about sex and health that they wont bring it up if the doctor doesnt researchers say Theyre so reluctant to interact says   an associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center who led the study which was published Monday in   No teen brought up the topic themselves even if they wanted birth control Almost half of highschoolers have had   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so clearly these are conversations that need to happen But there are lots of reasons that they dont the researchers say beyond the obvious desire to avoid sensitive topics One is that teenagers dont go to the doctor very often In the study researchers taped conversations during  annual visits in North Carolinas RaleighDurham area then analyzed them for content and how much time was devoted to various topics Teenagers were more likely to talk about sexuality if they were female older and AfricanAmerican the researchers found For boys you only get them for health maintenance visits for sports or camps Alexander says If a boy comes in and has a problem with acne or ADHD medicine that may override the preventive health stuff There are other topics that are getting in the way Having a longer office visit helps too The teenagers spent nine minutes with the doctor on average In that time doctors are supposed to go down a long checklist of topics from the American Academy of Pediatrics Alexander timed how long it took to read the suggested questions on sexuality and sexual decisionmaking There is no way a doctor can get through them in  seconds Alexander told Shots let alone hear the answers Its easy for things to get lost in the shuffle Alexander says I dont want to bash doctors Theyre required to do so much They should do this But its hard Having a confidential conversation with just doctor and teen helps too the researchers found But in these visits that happened just onethird of the time Mom and Dad are often to blame Alexander says Its hard to get the parent out of the room Alexander says But some doctors are good at explaining at the beginning of the visit that theres going to be time set aside for a confidential oneonone he says So when its time to kick the parent out its not a surprise Parents can make it easier for their children to get the information they need by talking with their children about sexual development early on says   a professor of behavioral and community health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who wrote an editorial accompanying the study Answer the questions when they come up and start answering those questions early Boekeloo told Shots And parents can encourage both teenagers and doctors to discuss sex and health during office visits The physicians probably need as much support as the youth in a visit in terms of logistics The good news Boekeloo says is that other studies have shown that teenagers really do feel comfortable with their doctors and when they have actually had these conversations theyre glad they did The same goes for talking about sex and sexuality with their parents Its ultimately important to the adolescent Boekeloo says And sometimes the conversations that occur in the car in the back seat on the way to the game or to school can be the best conversations
