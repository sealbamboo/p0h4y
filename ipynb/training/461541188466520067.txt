Health inspectors have found numerous problems with elderly patient care at Glasgows Southern General Hospital They found some patients with cognitive impairment were being moved from ward to ward against hospital policy to help cope with new admissions The inspection team also found dozens of cases of elderly patients being kept in hospital due to delays in finding a social worker to assess their needs Glasgow health board apologised for the failings which it is addressing The unannounced inspection visit by Health Improvement Scotland HIS was carried from  to  February this year Inspectors found a number of areas of strength but also identified instances where care of elderly patients was below the expected standards They expressed concern about the patient flow and capacity especially in relation to the practice of boarding which is when a patient is moved around to meet the needs of the hospital and not the patients clinical needs  said NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde patient flow policy states that patients with cognitive impairment are not boarded However we found this was not the case  For example a patient with known dementia and increased confusion had several ward moves  Although some of these moves were due to clinical need some were documented as being due to capacity issues in the hospital The inspectors report also found dozens of cases where patients planned discharge from hospital had been delayed and said this could be damaging to their wellbeing We noted that  patients were listed as delayed discharge the report said We were told that patients are waiting up to  days to be allocated a social worker to allow an assessment of needs to be carried out  This is detrimental to the patients as it can lead to issues with cognitive impairment increased risk of infection and impact on functional ability Elsewhere the inspection team found examples of Jacqui Macrae HIS head of quality of care said During this inspection we were particularly concerned about patient flow and capacity within the hospital  On the majority of wards inspected we found no evidence of care plans being used to inform and evaluate the care given to patients  We did however observe friendly and polite interactions between staff and patients with the most speaking positively about the quality of care received  Ms Macrae added This inspection resulted in two areas of strength and  areas for improvement which NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde must address as a matter of priority  We will followup these concerns at future inspections Rory Farrelly NHS Greater Glasgow and Clydes acute director of nursing said We are pleased to note that the inspection team observed friendly and polite interactions between staff and patients with the most of the patients interviewed speaking positively about the quality of care received However we are sorry that in a number of areas we are still falling short of the standards expected in all our hospitals Clearly we need to reinforce some of our policies with staff and provide additional training where required   Mr Farrelly said it remained the health boards policy not to move patients with cognitive impairment unless under exceptional circumstances He said the instance referred to in the inspectors report was one of these occasions   It remains one of our highest priorities to prevent this happening to older people and to ensure that the patients interests are best served while in our care he said Our action plan demonstrates our commitment to address all of the improvements raised in the report Mr Farrelly said the health board noted the specific comments by inspectors about capacity at the hospital   It must be understood that we use our inpatient acute beds flexibly across all our hospital sites to give us sufficient capacity to cope with patient demands including when there is a surge at any one particular hospital he said If one of our hospitals is experiencing such a surge we divert GP emergencies to the nearest neighbouring hospital thus ensuring that our hospitals remain open at all times   We value these inspections as they often reinforce areas where we can further improve the services we provide
