A giant routinely oversubscribed health clinic for the uninsured and needy at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena failed to fill all of its available appointments during a signup event over the weekend according to organizers The annual Care Harbor free clinic which will take place Thursday through Sunday had  available appointments but only  were requested  leaving more than a third unclaimed  during signups Sunday Several hundred dental appointments always the biggest draw at the event remained available as of Tuesday said Howard Kahn chief executive of LA Care Health Plan one of the backers of the event In recent years all the available appointments were snapped up in a single day with dental appointments running out especially fast Officials with Care Harbor said they are trying to determine why signups were down They will poll people leaving the clinic this week to determine how many have health insurance and how they heard about the event Kahn said a number of factors may have contributed to the lowerthanexpected turnout last weekend including the decision to hold signups on a Sunday this year and the hot weather But he said he hoped that the expansion of health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act played a role as well indicating that people who once depended on the clinic for care are now visiting their own doctors You figure weve reduced the number of uninsured in Los Angeles County by a million people he said If thats true you would hope youd see some decreased demand The event  which provides dental vision and other services as well as outreach about preventive care  has long been seen as a symbol of the shortcomings of the US health system before Obamacare This year as in previous years people have spent the night queued up outside the Sports Arena hoping to get one of the prized appointment wristbands Kahn said that Sunday however the line was less thick than it had been in the past with people stacked two deep rather than four or five Clinic founder Don Manelli said he doubted the healthcare law had much to do with the turnout Sunday saying that his organization needed to analyze our outreach and that an expansion in clinic capacity from  to  appointments also may have played a role He noted that Obamacare plans dont provide much coverage for vision and dental services and that its estimated that more than  million people in LA County will remain uninsured after the healthcare reforms are fully in place Our hope always is that one year well make ourselves obsolete he said But I think were a way off from that yet Care Harbor will hold a second round of signups at the Sports Arena starting at  am Wednesday Manelli said he expected the rest of the appointment wristbands to be snatched up quickly I think well have plenty of people there he said Im hoping we dont have too many
