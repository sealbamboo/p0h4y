In a widely viewed YouTube video a cyclist named Casey Neistat deliberately takes tumble after tumble while  Â  The video is funny  it even includes a crash into a parked police car  but it also has struck a chord with bike commuters around the country facing a seemingly endless array of road hazards In urban areas many riders have reason to be nervous and that in itself is part of a vicious cycle The most common mistake new cyclists make is not riding predictably said Ken Podziba chief executive of   a nonprofit group that promotes cycling For example people who are afraid of getting hit from behind by a car will often do things like ride on the sidewalk or ride against traffic which actually increases the danger that they will get hit by a motorist who doesnt see them Fear is a cyclists worst enemy Driven in part by riders demands for a greater sense of comfort and safety on the road new apps and gadgets are promising to do for the bicycle what air bags and satellite navigation did for the family car What used to be a simple healthful mode of transport is fast becoming a tech festival on wheels Perhaps it was to be expected Travel by bike has surged in recent years spurred by bikesharing programs and efforts to set aside and improve bike lanes New York Chicago and San Francisco introduced bikeshare programs last year and a dozen cities nationwide are planning to follow suit From  to  the number of bicycle commuters nearly doubled in the  largest cities according to data collected by the   Today Americans make more than four billion trips by bike each year One of the biggest grievances of all these cyclists is not being seen Jonathan Lansey  spent so much time dodging cars on his daily commute in Boston that he began a   campaign to finance production of a bike horn that could not fail to get drivers attention His brainchild   sounds like a twotoned car horn and at  decibels is about as loud Its embarrassing to get honked at Mr Lansey said But its more embarrassing to get honked at by a bicycle He   on his commute and found that drivers reacted immediately as they would to another car Theyre more worried about damaging their car than another person he noted Philip McAleese  of Newtownards Northern Ireland also wanted to make cyclists more visible so he developed a bike light called   which has sensors that react to surrounding light levels and movement If the cyclist swerves or brakes for instance the lights flash in a pattern similar to those on an ambulance or a police car SeeSense also has a broad beam so the bike is more visible from all angles helping to prevent a sideon collision Who needs bike lanes at all The   is equipped with two highvisibility red lasers that project two threefoot lines onto the road   The lighted lane is visible to motorists up to a mile away according to the manufacturer But perhaps the most surprising leap in hightech safety is an inflatable bike helmet called the   which works much like an automobile air bag The device worn around the neck like a quite fashionable scarf detects the impact of a crash and inflates a sort of instant helmet around the cyclists head and neck  performed by the Folksam insurance company in Sweden suggest it may be three times as effective as a standard helmet But riders in the United States will have to wait to try it at the moment the Hovding is sold only in Europe In addition to their personal safety cyclists worry about safeguarding their bikes A device called   affixed to the frame allows you to track its location on a smartphone so you can find a stolen bike or just keep track of family and friends on the road For a monthly fee the app also alerts your smartphone when a bike has been in a crash or deviates from its expected course such as a child riding too far from home or is tampered with BikeSpike goes on sale this spring  is a bike lock with a twist It can be locked and unlocked by a smartphone and not just the cyclists Once other users have permission they can use the app  which also provides the bikes location  to grab the bike wherever it has been left The result instant individualized bikeshare without the costly and ubiquitous street racks The locks should be available by fall For cyclists who want to take selfquantification to the next level theres the   which replaces the regular back wheel of a bike It tracks how the cyclist pedals the distances traveled and calories burned The wheel also includes a motor that kicks in on longer or steeper rides which is intended to remove the perennial objection of wouldbe commuters that a ride is too long or difficult making it a more appealing alternative to jumping in the car The wheel is available for preorder online For many cyclists the most important onboard device is a phone   a USB battery pack that is recharged by pedaling can be connected directly to any USBpowered device such as your phone or bike light or removed from the bicycle to charge a device after your ride Were providing mobile power for mobile technologies said David Delcourt chief executive of the manufacturer Siva Cycles The device can be preordered online for shipment in July Not all cyclists are enthusiastic about the rapidly evolving robobike They say the new technology could become a distraction to cyclists who need to stay focused on the road Maybe whats really needed is a course in improving realworld bike skills perhaps paired with devices like a loud horn or a brighter light to help make the streets less intimidating You can have your bike outfitted with all the latest technology which is great said Mr Podziba of Bike New York which offers instructorled rides around the city But you have to remember that youre sharing the road with drivers and other cyclists who are used to certain behavior Once riders get over the fear he added the daily chaos can actually be fun interesting and connect them to our amazing city like nothing else can
