To understand the violent criminal says   imagine a yearold boy doing the things that make the terrible twos terrible  grabbing kicking pushing punching biting Now imagine him doing all this with the body and resources of an yearold You have just pictured both a perfectly normal toddler and a typical violent criminal as Dr Tremblay a developmental psychologist at University College Dublin in Ireland sees them  the toddler as a creature who reflexively uses physical aggression to get what he wants the criminal as the rare person who has never learned to do otherwise In other words dangerous criminals dont turn violent They just stay that way These findings have been replicated in multiple large studies by several researchers on several continents Its highly reliable said   a psychology professor at Ohio State University and an expert on child violence who noted that toddlers use physical aggression even more than people in violent youth gangs do Thank God toddlers dont carry weapons The son of a professional football player Dr Tremblay played football himself and was fascinated with its regulated version of extreme physical aggression After college he did social work in a prison and saw firsthand how seldom such programs changed violent criminals By the time the violent child gets big its often too late So he trained his focus earlier and earlier and learned that the younger the children the more they whacked each other With adolescents physically aggressive acts can be counted in incidents per month with toddlers he said you count the number per hour In most children though this is as bad as it gets The rate of violence peaks at  months declines steadily through   and plunges in early adulthood But as Dr Tremblay and   a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University found in a   a troublesome few do not follow this pattern The study tracked behavior in  mostly disadvantaged Quebec schoolboys from kindergarten through age  The boys fell into four distinct trajectories of physical aggression The most peaceable  percent a no problem group showed little physical aggression at any age two larger groups showed moderate and high rates of aggression as preschoolers In these three groups violence fell through childhood and adolescence and dropped to almost nothing when the boys reached their s A fourth group about  percent peaked higher during toddlerhood and declined far more slowly Their curve was more plateau than hill As they moved into late adolescence and young adulthood their aggression grew ever more dangerous and it tailed off late At age  they were four times as physically aggressive as the moderate group and committed  times as many criminal infractions Its these chronically violent individuals Dr Tremblay says who are responsible for most violent crime These numbers are all for boys and young men girls physical aggression declines in arcs similar to those of boys but at sharply lower levels The results were surprising At first glance they seemed at odds with one of criminologys oldest tenets  the agecrime curve first graphed in  by the Belgian statistician   Mining French crime records Quetelet found that arrest rates soared in the midteens before falling in the s His famous curve was later replicated in studies of criminal records going back to the th century By contrast the TremblayNagin findings suggested that violent behavior peaked much earlier than the teen years But as Janette B Benson and Marshall M Haith noted in a    the two sets of curves are not contradictory Quetelets curve reflects not violence but the rate at which we start arresting and convicting individuals who have been physically aggressive toward others at least since kindergarten In  Dr Tremblay and Dr Nagin published   tracking  groups of about  Canadians between ages  and  for periods of six years The research echoed the  study A third of the children were peaceable throughout about half used physical aggression often as toddlers but rarely as preadolescents and about a sixth remained physically aggressive as yearolds This last group matched groups in other studies that ran in the  percent to  percent range To Dr Tremblay the findings suggest cause for optimism that humans more readily learn civility than they do cruelty We start as toddlers We learn through conditioning as we heed requests not to hit others but to use our words We learn selfcontrol Beginning in our third year we learn social strategies like bargaining and charm Perhaps most vital we use a developing brain to read situations and choose among these learned tactics and strategies But what of the relative few who remain physically aggressive If its possible to spot this cohort as early as kindergarten why cant we bend their arc downward Here says Dr Tremblay the entire field is stumped Programs that provide comprehensive support including parent training do seem to help though they are difficult to deliver to the deeply troubled families that need them most Child development experts increasingly say such services are crucial  starting as close as possible to conception as Dr Tremblay put it in one recent paper and continuing through early childhood Similarly his research is going further back in the life span He and some colleagues are planning to capture data in mothers and newborns and then to follow them for two decades to determine whether environment shapes the chemical wrappings of the childrens genes and thus perhaps their activities in ways that correlate to behavior When I remarked to Dr Tremblay now  that this seemed like an awfully long time to wait for answers he laughed Science is slow he said and behavior is hard to measure We may never completely crack this nut But we have to try
