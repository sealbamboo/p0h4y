Marvin Tolkin was  when he decided that the unexamined life wasnt worth living Until then it had never occurred to him that there might be emotional issues he wanted to explore with a counselor I dont think I ever needed therapy said Mr Tolkin a retired manufacturer of womens undergarments who lives in Manhattan and Hewlett Harbor NY Though he wasnt clinically depressed Mr Tolkin did suffer from migraines and struggled through a lot of things in my life  the demise of a longterm business partnership the sudden death of his first wife  years ago He worried about his children and grandchildren and his relationship with his current wife Carole When I hit my s I thought The hell with this I dont know how long Im going to live I want to make it easier said Mr Tolkin now  Everybody needs help and everybody makes mistakes I needed to reach outside my own capabilities So Mr Tolkin began seeing   a professor of clinical psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan They meet once a month for  minutes exploring the problems that were weighing on Mr Tolkin Dr Abrams is giving me a perspective that I didnt think about he said Its been making the transition of living at this age in relation to my family very doable and very livable Mr Tolkin is one of many seniors who are seeking psychological help late in life Most never set foot near an analysts couch in their younger years But now as people are living longer and the stigma of psychological counseling has diminished they are recognizing that their golden years might be easier if they alleviate the problems they have been carrying around for decades It also helps that   pays for psychiatric assessments and therapy Weve been seeing more people in their s and older over the past five years many who have never done therapy before said   a professor of research in the department of psychiatry at Stanford Usually theyve tried other resources like their church or talked to family Theyre realizing that theyre living longer and if youve got another  or  years why be miserable if theres something that can help you Some of these older patients are clinically depressed The National Alliance on Mental Illness   But many are grappling with   issues unaddressed for decades as well as contemporary concerns about new living arrangements finances chronic health problems the loss of loved ones and their own mortality Its never too late if someone has never dealt with issues said Judith Repetur a clinical social worker in New York who works almost exclusively with older patients many of whom are seeking help for the first time A combination of stresses late in life can bring up problems that werent resolved That members of the Greatest Generation would feel comfortable talking to a therapist or acknowledging psychological distress is a significant change Many grew up in an era when only crazy people sought psychiatric help They would never admit to themselves  and certainly not others  that anything might be wrong For people in their s and s now depression was considered almost a moral weakness said Dr GallagherThompson Fifty years ago when they were in their s and s people were locked up and someone threw away the key They had a terrible fear that if they said they were depressed they were going to end up in an institution So they learned to look good and cover their problems as best they could But those attitudes have shifted over time along with the medical communitys understanding of mental illness among seniors In the past the assumption was that if older people were acting strangely or having problems it was probably   But now the awareness of depression anxiety disorders and   as possible problems has grown said   a professor of gerontology and psychology at the University of Southern California and the author of Psychotherapy With Older Adults A   found that about half of all Americans ages  to  will be at high risk for alcohol and marijuana abuse by  compared with less than  percent in  In years past too there was a sense among medical professionals that a patient often could not be helped after a certain age unless he had received treatment earlier in life Freud noted that around age  the elasticity of the mental process on which treatment depends is as a rule lacking adding Old people are no longer educable Never mind that he continued working until he died at  Thats been totally turned around by what weve learned about cognitive psychology and cognitive approach  changing the way you think about things redirecting your emotions in more positive ways said   a gerontologist and professor of human development at Cornell and author of  Lessons for Living Treatment regimens can be difficult in this population Antidepressants for instance can have unpleasant side effects and only add to the pile of pills many elderly patients take daily Older patients may feel that they dont have the time necessary to explore psychotherapy or that its too late to change But many eagerly embrace talk therapy particularly cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on altering thought patterns and behaviors affecting their quality of life now Experts say that seniors generally have a higher satisfaction rate in therapy than younger people because they are usually more serious about it Time is critical and their goals usually are well defined Older patients realize that time is limited and precious and not to be wasted said Dr Abrams They tend to be serious about the discussion and less tolerant of wasted time They make great patients After her husband died two years ago Miriam Zatinsky a retired social worker who is now  moved into an independent living facility at Miami Jewish Health Systems It was a difficult transition to make late in life It was really strange to me and I couldnt seem to make any friends here Ms Zatinsky said I really couldnt find my way I was having a terrible time The medical director for mental health at the facility   a   told her that her problems were not unusual for someone in her situation and encouraged her to make some friends He prescribed Xanax to help with anxiety which she said she rarely takes and he put her in touch with a social worker Shyla Ford whom Ms Zatinsky saw once a week until Ms Ford moved Ms Zatinsky now has a new social worker she talks to They strategized on how she could reach out And slowly she did Sitting at the table for dinner you talk to people said Ms Zatinsky who has become president of her building Typically  to  sessions of talk therapy are enough to help an older patient unless he or she is struggling with a lifetimes worth of significant problems Still even longterm issues can be overcome After a debilitating depression in which she spent three months unable to get out of bed Judita Grosz  of Pembroke Pines Fla decided to see Dr Agronin who prescribed medication She also tried group therapy but didnt like it He also practiced some cognitive behavioral techniques with her  for instance requiring her to get dressed every day for a minimum of  minutes Eventually she began to feel better I learned to adjust my thinking and I dont get as anxious as I used to said Ms Grosz who has since begun making and selling jewelry I found out at this age that I am artistic and creative and innovative and smart I just woke up to the fact that I have a mind of my own Talk about a late bloomer Dr Agronin who still meets with Ms Grosz monthly said You might not be able to gain a magical insight and wrap up their entire life in therapy but you might be able to accomplish one or two small but meaningful goals Sometimes what older patients really need is help putting a lifetime in perspective Things can be seen differently from the perspective of old age that relieve some guilt and challenge assumptions that youve had for decades Dr Abrams said Â Maybe it wasnt too terrible after all maybe I shouldnt blame myself Maybe some of your worst mistakes werent so egregious and maybe there were unavoidable circumstances you couldnt control Mr Tolkin still stops by Dr Abramss office for a monthly checkup Everybody has a certain amount of heartache in life  its how you handle the heartache that is the essential core of your life Mr Tolkin said I found that my attitude was important and I had to reinforce positive things all the time He said he wishes he had tried therapy years ago But he adds I cant go back I can only go forward
