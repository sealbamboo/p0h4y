Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day In the past two years Dorsetts memory has given him increasing trouble On Monday doctors at UCLA told Dorsett  he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE the Hall of Famer said CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma  The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players However a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the holy grail of CTE research providing a means to diagnose and treat it and the UCLA study may be an important first step Using a scan called a positron emission tomography or PET typically used to measure nascent Alzheimers disease researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body crosses the bloodbrain barrier and latches on to tau Then the players brains are scanned We found the tau in their brains It lit up Dr Gary Small professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study said in February Dr Joseph Maroon a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett and two other living former players need further study This is very very preliminary he told Sportsradio  The Fan in Pittsburgh There are many many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss particularly when you get over  or  years of age  Its something to obviously be concerned about and the question is what can be done about it Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings Memory loss more so than anything its been my big deal he said Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that But my thing was not remembering Ive been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there His daughters are afraid he said They wonder which father they will get Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood  For others known to have had CTE symptoms include depression aggression and disorientation In  Mike Webster a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE After his retirement Webster suffered from amnesia dementia depression and bone and muscle pain Unlike Webster who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact  He won the Heisman Trophy as college footballs best player in  and became an instant NFL star on the leagues most popular team the Dallas Cowboys He played  seasons and gained  yards eighth best of all time His yard run in  is an NFL record He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in  Now he looks in a mirror and wonders And I say who are you What are you becoming he said Its very frustrating to be a person thats been so outgoing then all of a sudden Im like a couch potato Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk  who died in a  highspeed chase Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age  after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiance Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters who shot himself in  Terry Long a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze and Junior Seau the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of  Dorsett said that wont happen to him  Im going to beat this Trust me he said Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners He said a  million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough  I cant put a price on my health The owners knew about the dangers of concussions for years and they looked the other way and they kept putting us players in harms way The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams concussionrelated compensation medical research for retired NFL players and their families and litigation expenses according to a court document filed in US District Court in Philadelphia The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case which involved more than  plaintiffs
