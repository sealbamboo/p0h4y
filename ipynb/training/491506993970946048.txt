Saidu Kanneh was given a heros welcome last week when he walked into a community meeting about Ebola in a tiny village of mud huts in the Kissi Kama region of Sierra Leone Kanneh was diagnosed with Ebola early in July was treated for  days in a Doctors Without Borders hospital and overcame the disease God has made me as an example to survive and then get into the community to talk to my people says Kanneh whos about  years old and runs a health clinic near the border with Guinea and Liberia In treating Ebola cases he too caught the disease  he thinks he may have been infected from contact with the bodily fluids that transmit the disease perhaps because of a gap between his rubber gloves and his shirt sleeve Kannehs message is that not every patient dies And there are signs of hope changes taking place that could be key to stopping the West African outbreak that began in March and has so far seen   in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone with more than  deaths There is no cure but that does not mean we cant treat it with success says Tim Jagatic a Canadian physician at the   hospital in Kailahun where Kanneh was treated  a series of tents set up in a field He says the human body can figure out how to combat it This is just a virus Its a virus like influenza When we have influenza we know we stay home take our fluids and let our bodies do the rest Thats the same thing that we are doing here Our job is eliminating distractions for the immune system so it can create the anitbodies that cure the patient So they can walk out Treating patients is one element of the response to this outbreak the other huge challenge is stopping transmission of the virus through contact with vomit blood sweat and mucus Funerals were initially a major source of transmission Relatives sometimes fall cry on the dead body wash the body says Temba Morris who runs a government health clinic in a remote village of roughly  people near the epicenter of the Sierra Leone outbreak Funerals in Sierra Leone Morris says are a very physical expression of mourning But when someone dies of Ebola the level of virus in the body is at its peak The corpse is incredibly contagious People have been told not to touch the body of anyone who may have died of Ebola Changing that custom Morris says is very hard Especially when a strong relative dies like a mother father a child Everybody wants to touch everybody wants to fall on the dead And maybe roll over it To maybe express their love for the particular person So it is yet difficult to accept that one Nonetheless he says Sierra Leoneans are now accepting that they must stay away from the corpse of an Ebola victim That change in behavior could go a long way to bringing this outbreak to an end
