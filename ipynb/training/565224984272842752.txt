ealth and wellbeing boards would have been one of the many agencies concerned by research released last week which estimated that official   across England The report issued by Crisis and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation claims there has been a  rise in local authority homeless case actions last year compared with  In Haringey the local health and wellbeing board on which I sit has been looking at how homeless people are counted and included in local plans as we try to improve their health of some of our most vulnerable residents Homeless people have greater and often more complex health needs than the general population While this fact is perhaps unsurprising the statistics that underpin it are startling  of homeless people have a mental health problem  have a physical health problem almost half have attempted suicide The average homeless life expectancy is just  years Despite this more than twothirds of joint strategic needs assessments  the documents produced by councils the   and their partners to profile the health needs of the local area  make no reference to single homeless people or rough sleepers Without proper health plans that give an accurate picture of the extent and nature of homelessness in an area little progress can be made in ensuring homeless people get the care they need Thats why in Haringey our health and wellbeing board recently signed a pledge created by homeless charity   to measure and better understand the health needs of homeless people and to embed these in our own joint strategic needs assessment Of course measuring the health needs of homeless people is quite a different thing to meeting them but it is the right first step For instance we now know that there are approximately  homeless people living in Haringey We also know that many of these people have complex health needs that for a number of reasons they are less likely to access appropriate treatment for Were working with a number of health professionals and homeless people exploring what can be done to improve this situation One approach that has been well received is offering homeless people peer support when they attend medical appointments Many homeless people have told us about the stigma of seeking medical help and how having somebody who has been in a similar situation to them and even sit in on consultations will make them more likely to attend Weve recently trialled this approach for drug users to good effect and we hope to roll it out more widely Another idea being considered is a specialist homeless GP service recognising that the needs of homeless people can be too complex to be covered in a simple minute consultation A specialist service could also allow other types of support for homeless people  such as housing employment and benefits advice  through a single point of contact Were well aware that while essential meeting the immediate health needs of homeless people is not on its own a longterm solution to improving homeless health   is of course inherently unhealthy and any effort to tackle it needs to focus on its cause not just its symptoms To this end health and wellbeing boards have an important role to play The multiagency makeup of health and wellbeing boards  which include local government and public health the NHS and the voluntary and community sector  means complicated issues such as homelessness can be approached from a holistic perspective with partners working together to ensure not only that those who are homeless remain healthy but that there is the right support in place to ensure that fewer people become homeless in the first place This approach is in its early stages in Haringey and Im optimistic that the commitment by Haringeys health and wellbeing board to prioritise its focus on homelessness will pave the way to real progress and improved life chances for our homeless and at risk of becoming homeless communities
