Its one of the worst fears we have for our parents or for ourselves that we or they will end up in a nursing home drugged into a stupor And that fear is not entirely unreasonable Almost  nursing home residents are currently receiving antipsychotic drugs usually to suppress the anxiety or aggression that can go with Alzheimers disease and other dementia Antipsychotics however are approved mainly to treat serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder When it comes to dementia patients the drugs have a   saying that they can increase the risk for heart failure infections and death None of this was on Marie Shermans mind when her family decided that her mother yearold Beatrice DeLeon would be better off in a nursing facility near her home in Sonora Calif It wasnt because of her Alzheimers disease explains Sherman  it was because her mother had had some falls We didnt want my dad to try to lift her and we wanted to make sure she was safe says Sherman It wasnt long before the nursing home staff told Manuel DeLeon Beatrices husband that his wife was agitated and they wanted to give her some medication for that So he said OK They kept saying she was making too much noise and that they give her this medicine to quiet her down he says  prohibits the use of antipsychotics and other psychoactive drugs for the convenience of staff Its called a chemical restraint There has to be a documented medical need for the drugs But they just kept giving her more and more says DeLeon and I noticed when I used to go see her shed just kind of mumble like she was lost The DeLeons daughter Marie Sherman says that when her mother wasnt lost she was out of her skin I mean she was calling for help Sherman says She was praying Our Father who art in heaven please please help me Please take me please get me out  It turned out Beatrice DeLeon was given Risperdal and   which are approved to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia But professor   who teaches pharmacy and gerontology at the University of Southern California says antipsychotics should only be used as a last resort and just for a month or so before gradually being eliminated Antipsychotic drugs change behaviors Williams says They blunt behaviors They can cause sedation It increases their risk for falls And in the vast majority of cases the drugs arent necessary If you want to get to the very basic bottom line he says why should someone pay for something thats not needed But residents or their guardians may not know that the drug is not needed And theyre rarely told about the serious risks says attorney   who specializes in elder law She has sued nursing homes in California for failing to get informed consent when they use antipsychotic drugs as required by law We learned that the families really werent told anything other than The doctor has ordered this medication for you please come sign a form  says Moore And families did One of her clients is Kathi Levine whose mother Patricia Thomas had Alzheimers Despite her dementia Thomas had been doing fine in  living in a memory care facility near Santa Barbara walking and talking dressing and feeding herself Levine remembers visiting her mother at the facility one day when there was a party going on with a Hawaiian theme My mom was standing up with a lot of the other ladies doing the hula recalls Levine And she pulled me up off the chair and said Hula with me Its fun And I think that was the last time I remember her having that I love my life kind of look on her face Not long after that Patricia Thomas fell and fractured her pelvis After a brief hospital stay she went to a nursing home for rehab But within a week says Levine she was in a wheelchair slumped over sucking on her hand mumbling to herself completely out of it not even aware that I was there Her mother was so out of it she couldnt do the rehabilitation work that was the reason she went to the nursing home in the first place So they discharged her Thats when Levine first saw a list of her mothers medications I literally freaked out says Levine I couldnt believe all of these drugs on a list for my mother Among them were   and   both powerful antipsychotics Levine tried to slowly wean her mother from the drugs but Patricia Thomas remained in her wheelchair She never had another conversation She was dead in two months When you are your parents caretaker and their guardian and things like this happen you feel terribly guilty says Levine I know the medications they gave her werent my fault But the guilts still there Its always going to be there So Levine and her attorney Jody Moore brought a classaction lawsuit  the first of its kind  against the nursing home charging wholesale violation of informed consent Moore is a seasoned attorney but says she was amazed at a deposition she took from one of the doctors who said not only do I not get informed consent but I dont know of any doctor who does and youre crazy to think that thats my job The nursing home settled Its now required to change its practices An independent monitor will make sure it follows through But this facility was not out of the ordinary when it came to dispensing unnecessary antipsychotic drugs In    found that  percent of Medicare claims for antipsychotics prescribed in nursing homes were for treating symptoms of dementia even though the drugs arent approved for that So the next year the federal government started a campaign to get nursing homes to reduce their use of antipsychotics by  percent That  percent reduction was supposed to take less than a year It took almost two And it still left almost  nursing home residents on risky antipsychotic drugs But Beatrice DeLeon is no longer one of them Shes home again with her husband The family found a state program that sends health aides to the house And now she can have the kinds of conversations that mean something to her and to her family Can you kiss me she asks apropos of nothing Of course I can Mama says her daughter I love you guys We love you too Beatrice DeLeon says thank you She says that a lot Currently shes not taking anything but her Alzheimers medication But that seems to be enough for a life filled with love and gratitude
