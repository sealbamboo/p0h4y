A form of mammogram that takes multiple images does a slightly better job of finding tumors and reducing womens risk of having to be scanned again a study finds Its the biggest study yet to look at tomosynthesis also called D mammograms But its still unclear if using this kind of mammogram increases a womans odds of surviving breast cancer the researchers say Rather it found that the D mammograms reduced the rate of recalls where women had to have more scanning or a biopsy by  percent And the number of invasive cancers found increased by  percent with D screening The number of cancers in situ found remained the same Conventional mammograms miss about  percent of breast cancers according to the National Cancer Institute and deliver false positive results about  percent of the time The study  Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association compared the records of almost  women who had mammograms at  medical centers around the country More than half of those women  had standard digital mammograms while the rest had D mammograms The results are promising   a professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina wrote in an accompany   but its still uncertain whether women should ask their doctors for D mammograms Having a study where the same women do both forms of mammogram might provide more convincing data she says This wasnt a randomized clinical trial so it didnt directly compare the harms or benefits of the two forms of mammograms Instead it looked at digital mammograms taken in  and  before the medical centers started using tomosynthesis and then in  and  Standard mammograms take two images of each breast one vertical and one horizontal In a D mammogram the Xray machine moves and takes about  millimeterthick images which the radiologist can flip through The Food and Drug Administration  D mammography in  and even though its being used for screening mammograms most insurers still consider it experimental and wont pay for it
