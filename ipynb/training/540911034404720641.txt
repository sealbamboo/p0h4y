If obesity is linked to Americans  lifestyles would it help to reset the clock that dictates our eating A new study of mice suggests it would and in ways that go well beyond weight alone Even with a diet high in fat and sugar mice that had their eating day  compressed into a period of eight to nine hours and then fasted for the remainder of the day were less likely to become obese says   Mice that observed a lengthy daily fast also suffered less systemic inflammation fatty liver disease worrisome cholesterol and metabolic disturbance than did mice that ate whenever they pleased The difference wasnt how much or what the mice ate Mice kept on a daily fasting regimen ate the same fattening chow and just as much of it as did those who were free to eat round the clock The only difference was when they ate it  and how long they didnt The daily fasters also showed exercise endurance far superior to that of mice who were allowed to eat whenever they wanted They not only outran the chubby rodents allowed to eat all the fattening food they wanted but they also left mice reared in normal healthy chow in the dust Perhaps most exciting mice that reaped the rewards of fasting could make an occasional dietary detour and still stay healthy The latest research found the beneficial effects of a long daily fast during a fiveday workweek can even withstand a regular departure from the strict regimen during a sequence of twoday weekends I wouldnt run out and start doing this in humans Right now we really dont have the science to give those kinds of recommendations said physiologist Kenneth P Wright director of University of Colorado at Boulders sleep and chronobiology lab But this study is a tour de force and studying these effects in humans is certainly the next step said Wright who was not involved in the research The idea that timing ones food consumption to maximize health is hardly new Nutritionists have until recently insisted that breakfast is the most important meal of the day But as research mounts on the ill effects of shift work and of chronic sleep deprivation the idea that our cells also adhere to a sleepwake cycle and process fuel differently at different times of the day has gained scientific currency That in turn is prompting scientific interest in the notion that   we eat affects our well being as much as   we eat The latest study by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla and published this week in the journal Cell Metabolism fleshes out the limits and possibilities of using the clock to prevent or reduce obesity and to improve health The group subjected  male lab mice from the age of  weeks the rough equivalent of early adulthood to a variety of feeding patterns and gauged the effects of those patterns on a wide range of measures beyond weight gain including body composition metabolic function inflammation cholesterol levels and exercise endurance Compared with mice allowed to eat highfat highsugar chow whenever they wanted those given access to the same diet but only for nine hours a day gained only half as much weight even though both groups consumed about the same number of calories When the researchers tested the effects of lengthening the window in which mice were allowed to feed on highfat food those maintained on a regimen of ninehour feeding and hour fasting gained the least weight Mice allowed to eat the highfat chow whenever they wanted gained   as much weight But even a moderate daily fast made a difference Mice made to fast for only nine hours a day and permitted to eat fatladen chow for  hours gained only  of weight that the allday eaters had Although a long daily fast appeared to protect mice from becoming fat it also aided in weight loss among mice who were obese Obese mice switched from the eatwhenyouwant mode to a hour daily fast mode lost  to  of their body weight over three months while the weigh of obese mice maintained on the eatwhenyouwant diet continued to increase between  and  The mice that adhered to daily fasts of  hours or more clearly laid down less fat  probably because their bodies once fasting switched from using glucose for energy to burning fat Inflammatory markers that play a key role in diabetes heart disease and cancers were also tamped down and the fasters livers were healthier Alas lab mice are not humans When it comes to eating lab mice do not fall prey to latenight television advertisements that seduce with juicy cheeseburgers or chocolate shakes topped with turrets of whipped cream They are not called upon to work and eat while others of their kind sleep And they do not eat bowls of latenight ice cream while mourning a recent breakup They also do not as do many modernday Americans live for the weekend But in the Salk study the health of daily fasters did suggest that brief weekly departures from their dietary norm might be forgiven In the current study researchers switched mice who were well established on a longdailyfast regimen to a weekly pattern of five days on followed by two days off Despite the researcherimposed weekend these mice maintained their svelte shapes and their measures of good health Timerestricted feeding say the authors led by Salk scientist Satchidananda Panda is a potentially powerful behavioral intervention that deemphasizes caloric intake hence making it an attractive and easily adoptable lifestyle modification A largescale randomized control trial would show whether the strategy would work in humans they said
