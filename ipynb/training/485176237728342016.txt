When Rick Rayburn retired from the California State Parks system he had his heart set on balmy days of gardening playing tennis and traveling to France with his wife Marianne But then about three years ago she was diagnosed with dementia It disrupted the couples lives from top to bottom right on the cusp of retirement At  Rick has taken on a big new role Im  percent responsible for her wellbeing I have to help her pick her clothes out be there when shes getting dressed he says I cant leave her alone too often I can run out and empty the trash cans or do this or that And thats always a game you play How long can I run out and brush my teeth and get shaved without something happening on her side Rick is one of  million Americans caring for a family member with dementia That thought may conjure images of boomers caring for elderly parents but if earlyonset dementia is in play its a completely different equation A spouse often becomes the roundtheclock caregiver Rick rarely stops moving By  am hes up fixing breakfast for Marianne  and he stays on duty until Marianne goes to bed at  pm Theres no spare time to tend his vegetable garden Ricks busy making sure his wife keeps her weight up  and colors her hair Are you in the hairdoing business these days Marianne asks Rick as he prepares to dye her hair at the couples home outside Sacramento Calif Honey have you ever used the hair stuff Me Yeah I did your hair in the hospital Rick says The reality is Rick has played hairdresser many times Marianne just doesnt remember He also bathes his wife sets out her clothes and styles her hair with a straightening iron He cooks from scratch every day Ricks goal is to keep Marianne at home for as long as possible Hes confident he can handle the many physical demands of caregiving Its the social isolation thats brutal for Rick He says their social life as a couple evaporated when Mariannes dementia accelerated Its hard as a caregiver to know how to relate to people in a way that doesnt just turn them off Youre a broken record The disease part of a life the downside its not all that interesting and its not relationshipbuilding Rick says Its more just reporting the facts of a crummy situation To help deal with the stress and loneliness of dementia care Rick goes to a caregiver support group for men Your world becomes very small and as things get worse the friends that were helping a little bit kind of drop off So you tend to be isolated says Carol Kinsel a geriatric care manager who hosts the group Its common to find men in this role grappling with a changing sense of identity Kinsel says no matter what age group they fall into The older generation its really going to be a role reversal I think the younger generation is more used to maybe participating but its still a big change because they have this wife who played a huge role in their marriage thats socalled fading or changing and theyre trying to pick up the pieces that she filled in the marriage she says Marianne no longer recognizes that shes married to Rick and has been for  years Dementia has transformed her into someone whos dependent and vulnerable Thats triggering changes within Rick too Hes noticed himself gravitating toward traits Marianne was known for like empathy The importance of listening and caring for others Now I can see why that is so important and why you can go through life just giving and feeling totally satisfied You know thats a good thing Rick says Marianne may no longer be the woman Rick married but he says shes still helping him become a better husband
