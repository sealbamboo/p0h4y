President Obamas proposal to try to let more people keep their canceled health insurance policies sounded so simple when he announced it Thursday Insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into  And Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to reenroll in the same kind of plan he said in unveiling the proposal at the White House In other words if your insurance company says so you can keep your existing health policy for another year But you might have missed what the president said right before that State insurance commissioners still have the power to decide what plans can and cant be sold in their states Indeed But theres a problem with that In some of these states it may actually be against state law to implement the presidents proposal says   a research professor at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms Corlette says several states  some put the number at around a dozen  have basically written the Affordable Care Acts requirements into their own state laws But it also means that starting Jan   even if the federal government says canceled plans can continue for another year state regulators might find their hands tied by their own state laws Indeed Corlette says eight states have already moved to   now that extend into  Thats something the federal law does not prevent But in most of the states whether or not to allow insurers to reverse the cancellations will indeed be up to state regulators And they seem to be divided on the issue along lines that are not necessarily partisan Californias insurance commissioner for example  a Democrat  has announced that   allowing insurers to go forward if they want to But   the state of Washingtons commissioner  also a Democrat and a former member of Congress  has said   He says his states health exchange is working smoothly and he sees no reason to make changes now It would have been very disruptive to try to figure out a way to implement the presidents suggestion Kreidler says And quite frankly Im not even sure it would have been feasible under the best of circumstances Kreidler says allowing canceled plans to continue would also be unfair to the states insurance companies The firms have already set their rates based on the assumption that most people will be buying plans that do meet the new requirements When you change the rules halfway through the game all of a sudden everything theyd been operating under with certain assumptions goes away Kreidler says And that would have been very difficult for the market That may be true says Kansas Insurance Commissioner   but shes worried about people in her state being unable to get onto the balky federal website and get any insurance at all Thats why shes planning to take up the presidents offer even if the older plans dont cover a full array of benefits or preexisting conditions as the new rules require Our first responsibility is to protect the consumers Praeger says and at least in my mind that means finding a way to let them stay on those policies if they want About the only thing thats clear right now More than ever if youre shopping for an individual or smallbusiness plan the kind of health insurance you can get depends in large part on where in the country you live
