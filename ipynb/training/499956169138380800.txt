Here are eight of the most impressive kids from around working towards a healthier tomorrow  are valued for their ability to develop into specialized cells and have the potential to treat Parkinsons disease spinal cord injury and other conditions But artificially generated stem cells have short lifespans that limit their medical usefulness  Joshua Meiers   which started off as a class project when he was just  identified the genes linked to this cell aging process Meier who will begin studying biology and computer science at Harvard this fall hopes that his research can be applied to other cells and eventually lead to realworld solutions like treating cancer Cancer is a disease where cells keep growing and growing and growing Meier says But if we age cancer and stop its growth then thats a potential treatment  It was a trip to the beach that sparked Adeeb Alblooshis inventing career When his father  who had suffered from polio  could not go swimming because of his prosthetic leg Adeeb then six made him a waterproof alternative using an enhanced medical wax coating Soon after he created a small vibrating robot to help his mother clean small spaces It wasnt long before the media and subsequently the Dubai government came calling  With the governments supervision and funding hes come up with five more inventions since then including a seat belt that monitors a passengers heart rate and alerts the authorities when its too high or low  Since April hes been on an international scientific tour with the Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology which has had him attending academic conferences meeting with researchers and even attending space camp at the US Space  Rocket Center in Alabama Ive learned a lot but most importantly Im having fun while doing it he says  For Samantha and Michelle Marquez science is a family affair The daughters of a chemist and a chemical engineer the two were always encouraged to ask questions and hunt down answers  A school project when she was in seventh grade led Samantha to create celloidosomes threedimensional structures built out of living cells which act as a container for other particles She suggests that these capsulelike structures could be used for organ repair and as innovative way to deliver drugs to the body but anticipates that there could other applications too  I like to think that the celloidosomes is really just one very small pebble in the beach she says a very small grain of sand in the beach thats going to be the movement towards bottomup engineering for medicine   Michelle on the other hand decided to explore elements that couldnt be touched music and emotions Her research analyzed brain activity and found that highly complex sounds  or chaotic noise  triggered the part of the brain associated with negative emotions while lowcomplexity music triggered the part of the brain associated with positive emotions  Both sisters were recognized at the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair Intel ISEF but theres little sibling rivalry at play  I think its been really great to see Michelle blossoming into the young woman the young scientist that she is Samantha says I think shes kind of paving her own journey  While others his age were just getting into the swing of university life Sandile Kubheka then  had become South Africas youngest doctor four years ahead of schedule  Since then Kubheka now  has been honored with a slew of awards for his community work and medical achievements and was nominated for an MTV Africa Music Award for leadership These awards acknowledge not just his obvious precocity but the time hes put in outside of the classroom especially when he was a student On weekends he was helping underserviced communities taking care of patients at a studentrun clinic during his December holidays he was volunteering in the labs of rural hospitals to serve the community and hone his own skills These days hes had to cut back He spends most waking hours completing an intensive twoyear internship at Greys Hospital in Pietermaritzburg South Africa but he finds time to act as an ambassador for the South African National Blood Service and set up a trust fund to help youth in developing nations and rural regions get into engineering and medicine  Now that Ive started working its harder to balance that he says laughing But as soon as Ive got that balance I want to get back to the community Tony Hansberry was likely the only yearold boy making a difference in gynaecology Attending a high school with a program geared towards medicine gave Hansberry the chance to intern at the nearby UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville Florida There he was challenged to improve how the vaginal cuff the top of the vagina is sutured after a hysterectomy Typically the cuff is sewn together with a horizontal stitch to decrease the risk of infection after surgery but Hansberry suggested that a vertical stitch might be faster When demonstrating his method on a mannequin he was able to suture the area three times faster than the traditional method It proved so much more effective that the supervising doctor still uses his method today having nicknamed it the Hansberry Stich Now  Hansberry is studying chemistry at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University He hopes to become a surgeon someday and make a difference in the lives of others  Thats what I love about the idea of medicine he says The fact that you can change so many lives with just your hands  Jack Andraka was aged just  when he started developing an easy earlydetection test for pancreatic cancer By the end of the school year he succeeded  The test developed under the guidance of a Johns Hopkins professor takes just minutes to complete and Andraka claims it is faster cheaper and more sensitive than the current medical standard  Though his invention has yet to undergo peerreview or rigorous testing it earned Andraka not only the  grand prize at the Intel ISEF in  but also the attention of every major news organization frequent speaking gigs   and a seat on The Colbert Report It seems the whole world is waiting to see what he does next  Andrew Almazn Anaya is best known for becoming a qualified psychologist at  but in his eyes he still has a lot to accomplish  I studied not only because I wanted to learn more or I liked the subject  I have to make this knowledge useful for future says Almazn Anaya who is also an MD  This is why for the last five years hes been part of a team trying to perfect islet cell transplantation in diabetics  working to prevent the cells from being rejected by a recipients immune system While the team awaits the OK to move from testing on mice to larger animals Almazn Anaya has more time to dedicate to   the Talent Attention Center a group that pushes for the early identification and support of gifted children where he serves as head of psychological research He hopes his internationally recognized work will spread awareness about gifted kids and equip them to make the most of their potential as he has
