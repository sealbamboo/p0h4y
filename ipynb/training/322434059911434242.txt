Health care types have spent years trying to make the point that seniors are being prescribed medications that are unnecessary and dangerous But the message hasnt really sunk in More than  percent of people with   coverage are taking at least one highrisk medication a new study finds People in the Southeast are especially vulnerable the data show In many parts of the South more than onethird of seniors are taking drugs that they should avoid or sub out for something safer Ten percent are taking two or more Geography really stands out says   an associate professor of health services policy and practice at Brown Universitys Alpert Medical School Hes a coauthor of the   which was published in the April   More than  percent of Medicare Advantage enrollees in Albany Ga got at least one risky drug compared with  percent in Mason City Iowa the area with the lowest rate The people prescribed risky drugs were more likely to be poor white and female Why are Southerners more likely to be given risky meds It could be that patients are asking for them Trivedi says Or it could be that doctors there are more apt to stick with old prescribing habits But whatever the reason he says its a marker for poorquality health care The risky drugs include obvious culprits like amphetamines barbiturates muscle relaxants and narcotics Then there are oldstyle sedating antihistamines and medications for depression and anxiety such as longacting diazepam or Valium which can cause apnea and cardiac arrest Many of the drugs increase the risk of falls Because the the medication stays in the body longer it increase the risk of falls and fracture says Danya Qato a pharmacist graduate student and coauthor of the study If the physician decides to prescribe a benzo there are shortacting alternatives Trivedi was surprised to see that older patients were being prescribed   a longacting drug that reduces blood sugar in diabetics In younger populations its fine Trivedi an internal medicine physician with older patients told Shots But because older people take longer to metabolize drugs they run the risk of having their blood sugar go dangerously low The researchers used the National Committee for Quality Assurances   Doctors should all have this information but the numbers in this study make it clear that patients and caregivers need to be on the case too The takehome message for patients is to take ownership of their drug therapy Qato says As a pharmacist I love talking to patients about their drug therapy People should talk with their doctors about risky medications Qato says And they also should make an appointment with their pharmacist go over their meds list and ask which drugs are good candidates to be stopped or replaced with less risky products
