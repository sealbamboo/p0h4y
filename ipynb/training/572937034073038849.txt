Sexting may be part of the new normal for teenagers who are on the verge of becoming sexually active new research shows Teens who told researchers they had sent naked pictures of themselves to someone in  were nearly onethird more likely to be sexually active in  than teens who had sent no such messages the year before according to a   published Monday by the journal Pediatrics However teens who sent explicit photos of themselves in email or text messages were no more likely than other teens to report having had many sexual partners in the previous year to have had sex without a condom or to have used drugs or alcohol before having sex That we did not find any link between sexting and risky sexual behavior over time may suggest that sexting is a new normal part of adolescent sexual development and not strictly limited to atrisk adolescents wrote the researchers who are from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston The study was an attempt to solve the chickenandegg problem regarding sexting and sex Plenty of   has found that people who do one also do the other But most studies of sexting behavior ask about both things at the same time so its hard to know which came first Perhaps sexting is a way of introducing sex into a relationship the researchers wrote Alternatively it may be that having sexual relations increases the level of comfort in sharing nude images To see which came first Jeff Temple and Hye Jeong Choi examined data from an ongoing study called Dating it Safe More than  teens were enrolled in  In  when the average age of study participants was  they were asked whether they had ever sent naked pictures of yourself to another through text or email They were also asked whether someone had asked them to send such a picture and whether they had requested a naked picture from someone else Then in  the teens were asked whether they had ever had sexual intercourse Compared with teens who didnt sext in  those who did were  times more likely to have had sex in  the researchers found On the other hand teens who merely asked for a sext or were invited to send a sext but didnt were no more likely than others to be sexually active a year later according to the study Future research should examine the role of sext messages that involve explicit messages and seminude content the researchers concluded
