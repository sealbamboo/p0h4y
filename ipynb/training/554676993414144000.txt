he announcement that Circle has withdrawn from its contract to run Hinchingbrooke hospital after the Care Quality Commission   has predictably delighted those who are against outsourcing NHS services to the private sector  But patients and the public should not rejoice at Circles decision The hospital was in a financial mess and faced with closure when Circle took it over three years ago Its debts were m on a turnover of m and Circle agreed to eliminate the debt and leave the NHS with several million pounds to spare It planned to achieve this by   a total saving of    Although it appears that none of the debt has been paid off Circle has reduced the hospitals annual loss to m and kept it open This outsourcing initiative was started in  under the last Labour government But Circles hands were tied in that   so Circle lacked the freedoms of privatelyowned hospitals Despite that it took the risk  and could not have foreseen the increase in AE patient numbers  Before those against outsourcing celebrate too much they should consider if the hospital will now be viable if taken over by the NHS particularly given the state of NHS finances The   will inherit the hospitals remaining debt and must ensure it no longer runs in the red Staff and the public could lose more now the contract has ended As the   pointed out the contract illustrates the naivety of attempting to pass too much risk to the private sector particularly if it is unquantifiable The Circle contract was for  years Who can predict the future for NHS service requirements that far ahead The AE crisis currently faced by the NHS is partly because it wasnt expected When public sector organisations let contracts they do not outsource the risk whatever the contract states If the supplier is unable to deliver the contract the risk goes back to the public sector organisation responsible for ensuring that the service is delivered Both Circle and the NHS East of England Strategic Health Authority were overoptimistic about the risks and due diligence was flawed The real debate should not be over whether outsourcing is good or bad It is about good commercial judgment and contracting But very few public sector organisations have or could retain sufficient expertise for letting oneoff major contracts They have not had the experience to be able to determine if largescale operations would be better kept inhouse or outsourced The   the body that provides professional procurement advice to the public sector needs a team of experts in letting and managing such contracts who understand risk management and are able to make objective decisions about whether a contract should be let Until this is done and its use made mandatory expect plenty more problems with major contracts
