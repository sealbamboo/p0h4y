What can I help you with today Its the question I open every visit with but it heralds a moment of suspense The reply is what doctors enter into the chart under Chief Complaint but its really a moment of suspense because you never know how a visit will unfold I recently posed this question to a patient a healthy middleaged woman whom Id seen once before a year earlier for a routine checkup as I ushered her into my office I smiled as we sat down prepared for a straightforward visit She stared stonily at the wall in front of her as my question hung too long in the air I almost didnt come back today she said I was ready to choose another doctor but I decided to give you a second chance There was a reflexive start in my chest from her unexpectedly harsh reply but I held my composure What could this be about I quickly scanned the chart from our last visit to see if there had been anything wed disagreed about or any unresolved issues But no it had been a routine checkup Nothing beyond standard health screening issues and some runofthemill acid reflux Someone had said you were a good doctor she said derisively still addressing the wall but I was not impressed My previous doctor even though he was just a resident in training was much better than you That certainly stung especially since I still had no idea what had transpired between us but I endeavored to stay quiet and let her finish speaking But he graduated and now Im stuck with you She folded her arms across her chest pursed her lips and then was silent I kept my voice as low key as possible Im so sorry if there was something that upset you Im trying to recall   You dont remember she snapped It figures Now I was scraping desperately around in my mind What had I done Making a patient livid isnt something you typically forget but I couldnt come up with anything for this patient I apologize I said as genuinely as I could but I honestly dont recall what happened Could you tell me She looked at me for the first time her eyes taut and icy You didnt do a physical exam All you did was talk to me and then you handed me a prescription My old doctor   did a physical exam but you didnt even bother My jaw actually dropped when she said that Id forgotten the physical exam How could I have done that As an internist Im well aware of the limits of the modern physical exam For most medical ailments nearly all the crucial diagnostic information is gathered in the history in the conversation between doctor and patient The physical exam serves mainly to confirm the diagnosis though once in a while something unexpected does turn up And   it remains an important part of my interactions with patients a refuge from the encroachment of technology that can help foster intimacy and often uncover a patients true concerns  So now I really did feel like an idiot both negligent   a hypocrite Looking back at my notes I honestly couldnt tell if I had been running late that day or was distracted or simply had a momentary lapse But the simple truth was that Id neglected part of the medical visit and the patient was appropriately calling me on it I am truly sorry I said to her after composing myself I honestly have no idea why I didnt do a physical exam that day I really dont I placed my hands down on the desk between us I can only offer you an apology both for my shortcoming that day and also for the bad feeling that it left you with She gave a small nod of acknowledgment and the muscles of her face softened somewhat Our gazes simultaneously traveled to the exam table and then back to each other questioning Its up to you I said I would completely understand if you would feel more comfortable with a new doctor She shrugged Like I said Im willing to give you a second chance It was an awkward physical exam no doubt for both of us I felt like I was being given a test but appreciated the opportunity to face up to a mistake and work through it Though objective measures of quality abound in medicine these days getting meaningful feedback is actually quite rare Getting it directly from a patient rather than on a spreadsheet from an institution is rarer still And even though its never pleasant to be reminded of your shortcomings I actually felt quite lucky that this patient had the grit to come back and tell me directly She could just as easily have moved on to another doctor and I never would have known It makes me wonder how many other times I may have disappointed a patient but been completely unaware Im sure the number is larger than Id care to acknowledge and probably rising as time pressures and documentation requirements mount I thanked my patient for giving me a second chance and we parted cordially Ill find out next year if I passed Â
