One of the reasons Ebola is so terrifying is that theres no vaccine and no cure But the World Health Organization hopes to change that with plans to quickly test experimental products during this outbreak By November two promising vaccines will have been tested on people to see if theyre safe says   assistant directorgeneral at WHO After that these vaccines will start to be rolled out in the affected countries starting with health care workers and other frontline staff Kieny said at a press conference held after a twoday meeting in Geneva on how to speed up the development of experimental vaccines and therapeutics Around  experts came  including officials from the countries hit by Ebola researchers from government labs and biomedical companies and experts on clinical trials The group agreed that a priority was to help affected countries use convalescent serum  taking blood from Ebola survivors and using it as a therapy for people stricken with the disease This is one thing which is realtime now says Kieny adding that there was a good chance the procedure could help and that affected countries needed assistance to make sure they draw and prepare the blood safely In addition she expects that several other experimental treatments will be tested in treatment centers once research protocols can be worked out This can happen only at the place where the disease is present she says  who heads a biodefense research office at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the group that a slew of products are at various stages of development although theres no clear frontrunner I think if there had been an ideal perfect candidate that everyone agreed upon there wouldnt be the need for this meeting says Kurilla Of the two main vaccine contenders one just started safety testing in people this week If all goes well production of this vaccine could be ramped up quickly and  doses could be ready by years end Eight hundred doses of the other vaccine have been donated to WHO Supplies of any potential treatments will be much more limited than vaccine supplies A few Ebola patients did get a secret serum called   which is a cocktail of antibodies Now theres no more of it In the next six months Kurilla expects to see production of only a few hundred doses of this serum No one knows if any of these products are safe much less effective Historically most therapies that make it into initial human tests never get approved as drugs Kurilla notes because theyre found to be deficient in many ways And so it is because of some of that that people feel you need to be especially cautious Whats more health care workers in West Africa are already overworked and overwhelmed just trying to provide basic medical care in very difficult conditions We are sometimes unable to give patients IVs We are sometimes unable to give patients all of the care that we could have available and that is relatively simple says Estrella Lasry a tropical medicine expert with Doctors Without Borders in New York As things stand now about half of those who get Ebola do survive If supportive care were better even more might live If you are going to put them at risk of not surviving because of using a new drug where you dont have a guarantee of the safety then the do no harm principle is not being kept says Lasry She says it would be different for patients with a very poor prognosis who really have no other hope Her organization is willing to help test new drugs  and even vaccines  if studies are set up in a rigorous ethical way and the effort doesnt detract from the urgent need to get more doctors nurses and public health workers to provide the triedandtrue basics Thats something everyone agrees on The issue right now is taking the tools that we have  infection control finding cases trying to get people into treatment  and pushing on those as much as possible while we wait for the work on the vaccines and medicines to go forward says   assistant directorgeneral for health security at the World Health Organization The possibility of having vaccines and medicines which are safe and effective against Ebola would be great But the reality is right now they definitely are experimental
