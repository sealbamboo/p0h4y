Good morning, everyone, and welcome to another working week. We hope the weekend respite was enjoyable, because that startling routine of deadlines and meetings and what-not has now returned. But you knew this was coming, yes? So please join us as we hoist our ritualistic cup of stimulation and attack the ever-growing to-do list. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits to get you started. Hope you conquer the world today and do keep us in mind if you hear anything interesting…. Laboratory Corp. of America, the diagnostics company, is expanding with a $5.9 billion to buy Covance, one of the largest contract research organizations; a Johnson & Johnson spokesman denies to Pharmalot a report that the consumer health giant is planning to close its plant in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico; and two-thirds of general practitioners in the U.K. are ignoring new guidelines to prescribe statins to more patients, because the advice is “simplistic” and would allow the “mass medicalization” of the public.
