The day when a simple blood test or saliva sample can identify your risk for medical conditions ranging from cancer to Alzheimers disease seems tantalizingly close But genetics specialists say the hype around many of these tests has outstripped the science Insurers generally only cover a test if theres strong scientific evidence that it can provide a health benefit to patients The utility of some tests is not as clear as wed like to think says Sharon Terry president and CEO of the   an advocacy organization aimed at promoting health through genetics These technologies are advancing at a really rapid rate and theyll make a big impact on health But the data gathering you need to do to determine clinical utility is difficult One example is the  genetic test sold directly to consumers by the company   It had been marketed as providing information about a persons risk for more than  health conditions and traits But in November the Food and Drug Administration   because the agency concluded that health claims made it a medical device and required FDA review and approval Last week andMe   it would stop selling reports about health risks while it seeks federal review but still offer ancestry information and raw genetic data Previously the company had   that its health test wasnt diagnostic and shouldnt be submitted to insurers for payment What kind of tests will insurers pay for Newborns are usually tested for rare lifethreatening genetic disorders through a drop of blood gathered in the hospital Insurers cover those tests And insurance companies also cover tests that look for genetic abnormalities if the patient has a family history or other risk factors and if theres both a reliable test and some potential benefit such as a medical treatment thats recommended by a standardsetting organization like the US Preventive Services Task Force In such cases insurers also typically cover genetic counseling with the goal of collecting family and personal history to determine whether that patient is a candidate for a particular genetic test and then help patients understand their results says Rebecca Nagy president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors Coverage is generally routine but in recent years some health plans have begun paying a declining percentage of the cost of testing says Nagy Companies that were covering a test at  percent are now covering it at  percent she says Thats a problem because   A genetic test for the BRCA mutations that increase breast cancer and ovarian cancer risk for example may cost  or more Under the Affordable Care Act most health plans must make   to women whose family history indicates they have a higherthanaverage risk of mutations in the BRCA or BRCA genes The federal health laws prevention coverage requirements are based on a   by the US Preventive Services Task Force Its the only preventive genetic test the organization endorses But theres confusion about who should get genetic testing for breast cancer mutations especially after Angelina Jolie revealed in May that she had a double prophylactic mastectomy after learning she has a mutation in the BRCA gene If a womans only family history of the illness is one relative who developed breast cancer at age  for example that by itself doesnt mean shes at higher risk says Nagy With counseling many times we can give them reassuring numbers In September health insurer Cigna began requiring   for policyholders interested in three commonly ordered and commonly misunderstood genetic tests says David Finley the companys national medical officer The tests covered by the new requirement are those for the BRCA mutations for breast and ovarian cancers colorectal cancer and   that can cause sudden potentially fatal heart arrhythmias Doctors who order these tests dont necessarily suggest that patients receive genetic counseling even though national organizations recommend it says Finley From our perspective the only way to make sure that patients are getting the information and taking the time that they need about these tests is to require that they see a genetic counselor he says Like other insurers Cigna typically wont pay for genetic tests that dont provide a medical benefit to the patient You dont test for testings sake says Susan Pisano a spokesperson for Americas Health Insurance Plans a trade group A test for an Alzheimers gene is among those not usually covered It identifies which of three versions of the   The APOE gene is associated with lateonset Alzheimers disease and someone with two versions of the gene called e is at higher risk of developing the disease The APOE test is ordered fairly frequently but we dont pay for it says Cignas Finley Its not enough for a test to be accurate and scientifically reliable It has to benefit the patient And with the APOE test I dont think theyve met those standards
