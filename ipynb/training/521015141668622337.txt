Fecal transplants can be lifesaving for people with stubborn bacterial infections but theyre not for the faint of heart So doctors have come up with a way to make them more palatable the frozen poop pill People infected with  suffer debilitating diarrhea but the bug often defies antibiotics Doctors have recently discovered that a fecal transplant will restore good gut bacteria that banishes the   But the procedure is awkward requiring a donation of fresh feces usually from a relative and a colonoscopy to deliver it Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital figured they could improve on that First they tried delivering the   through a tube snaked down the nose and into the stomach It delivered the healthy bugs but wasnt much fun Just getting the tube down is a problem   a staff physician in infectious diseases at Mass General told Shots And the doctors worried that if people gagged and vomited they could inhale fecal matter Thats pretty scary Enter the poop pill A pill wouldnt require invasive procedures the researchers speculated and would be less likely to cause vomiting And if they froze the pills donors wouldnt need to be standing by To test that hypothesis the researchers got donations from young healthy volunteers screened to make sure they didnt have HIV hepatitis or other infectious diseases They froze the material and waited four weeks to test the donors again Once the donors got a clean bill of health pill production began By now youre probably wondering what a poop pill looks like When I first started doing this I had in my mind that it would be a little redandwhite banded capsule like a Tylenol capsule Hohmann says That was my dream But alas the capsules had to be acidresistant so they could make their way past the stomach into the large intestine where the good microbes work their magic And acidresistant capsules only come in translucent So they are sort of brownishcolored capsules Hohmann says Fortunately because theyre frozen when you take them out of the freezer they sort of frost up a bit and theyre not too gross Twenty people with recurrent   infections took  pills a day about the size of a large multivitamin for two days Fourteen of them were free of diarrhea almost immediately with no recurrences The other six tried the treatment again that did the trick for four of them The two people who failed to get results were in poorer health overall the study found But the treatment worked for people from age  to age  The Mass General group has since treated another  people with the pills with similar success The results were announced Saturday at the IDWeek meeting in Philadelphia and   in   the Journal of the American Medical Association Were really jazzed that a journal of this stature has picked this up Hohmann says Ive been a microbiology researcher for  years and this is the biggest thing weve done Has she been published in  before Oh no no never Despite the impressive results poop pills may turn out to be not the silver bullet they seem today Though the treatment appears safe and effective theres always the possibility that unknown infectious agents could be transmitted this way Hohmann says We screen these people to be as healthy as we can determine in  but who knows
