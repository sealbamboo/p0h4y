Are   making a comeback Some pet owners think so Over the past few years anecdotal reports from dog and cat owners around the country suggest that the bloodsucking parasites are getting more difficult to control despite the use of oncerevolutionary topical flea treatments But veterinarians and flea product makers say the products work when used correctly and that many pet owners may be making mistakes or have unrealistic expectations about how the treatments work Last summer Mark Conrad a freelance photographer in Fairfield Conn noticed his golden retriever Tia scratching more than usual Mr Conrad said he suspected an allergy rather than fleas because the dog had been treated diligently every month for three years with a leading flea treatment that contains the chemical fipronil which has been shown to be highly effective against fleas Soon however he discovered that his dog and home were infested with fleas It was a nightmare for two months he said Tia was miserable and the fleas just kept coming back Because the dog had already been treated for fleas Mr Conrad tried using a flea comb natural remedies and flea baths and even spraying his yard but nothing helped He came across other pet owners who were beginning to doubt the efficacy of fipronil When it came time to treat Tia again he switched to another topical solution that includes the active ingredient permethrin The fleas finally resolved and he decided to stick with the new treatment Veterinarians said they hear stories similar to Mr Conrads all the time but that there was no convincing research to suggest that fipronil or other leading flea treatments have become less effective in most areas Michael W Dryden   at Kansas State University has conducted numerous studies on the efficacy of flea treatments Dr Dryden who is commonly called Dr Flea said there are some areas particularly in the southeastern United States where flea populations are strong and some treatments may not be working as well as they did  to  years ago However flea products continue to work well in most parts of the country so the real issue is educating consumers on the best way to use the products and what results to expect Most of us by the time we start treating fleas our homes are already infested Dr Dryden said No home is ever under control in a week and it can take weeks or months in some homes It can take time for a flea infestation to be gone and that has nothing to do with resistance Christine L Cain   at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine said that even among pets being treated for fleas outbreaks can occur Missing a monthly treatment by even a few days can be enough to give fleas a foothold for instance Sometimes particularly in pets with long hair a topical treatment may not be applied correctly or may inadvertently be washed off before it has a chance to be absorbed she said A pet that comes into contact with an infested animal at a dog park or in the wild could also develop a temporary flea problem since most monthly flea treatments prevent longterm infestation but dont repel new fleas A lot of times what people are perceiving as resistance may not be true resistance Dr Cain said Topical treatments revolutionized flea control when they were introduced in the s Most of the treatments are applied to the skin between an animals shoulder blades The chemical is absorbed into the sebaceous glands across the animals skin but does not get into the bloodstream The treatments do not repel fleas but those crawling on an animal will absorb the chemical and eventually die usually within four hours Several new flea control products have been introduced recently including monthly pills and longacting collars available through veterinarians The oral pills are easier to use and less messy but some pet owners still prefer a topical treatment Dr Cain said that when a pet develops a severe skin allergy to fleas a pet owner may use a combination of topical and oral treatments to protect the animal Michael Murray a veterinarian and technical marketing director for Merial a unit of Sanofi the company that makes the Frontline flea treatment said that a rainy summer can trigger a flea bloom causing a population explosion among wild animals The fleas can then get in the grass exposing treated pets to more fleas During a flea bloom even animals treated with a topical solution are vulnerable If treated properly the fleas will die off but not necessarily before owners have caught sight of the fleas on their pets These products dont work instantaneously Dr Murray said When there is a lot of exposure during a flea bloom people are more likely to see the pests and conclude the product is not working Dr Murray said owners who have treated their pets properly need to be patient and allow the product time to do its work If an owner has missed a treatment it may take longer to rid the pet of fleas By the time owners notice fleas on an untreated animal they are probably seeing a second or third generation Dr Murray said That means by the time you start treating your pet youve got this massive amount of flea biomass in your home flea larvae and pupae he said It can take as little as three weeks or as long as several months for that to run its course Â
