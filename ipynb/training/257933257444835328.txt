Giving the human papillomavirus vaccine to teenage girls doesnt increase the likelihood that they will be sexually active according to a new study That may help put parents at ease the notion of vaccinating  and yearold girls for a sexually transmitted virus has made some uncomfortable and is one reason why only a little more than half of teenage girls have had the vaccine When it comes to sex and daughters evidence doesnt trump emotion Julie Stewart is one of those parents She   NPRs Richard Knox last fall that it seems premature to be giving her preteen daughter a vaccine to protect against cervical cancer which can be caused by HPV I realize its probably more about my squeamishness with the thought of her becoming sexually active than the vaccination itself Stewart says Its not the science I think its my own issues around her developing sexually Researchers hope this new study will help parents like her come to grips with their squeamishness Rather than ask girls to report whether they were sexually active the study authors looked at medical records from teenage girls who went to the doctor at Kaiser Permanente clinics in Georgia They identified the ones who had become pregnant had contracted a common sexually transmitted disease or had asked for counseling about using contraceptives Then they looked to see which ones had had at least one HPV shot when they were  or  The full regimen is three shots one study in    that only  percent of eligible women and girls get all three shots Of the  girls in the Kaiser study the ones who had the HPV vaccine were no more likely to have had sexually related health issues than the ones who hadnt In both groups only about  percent had medical visits related to sexual activity in the three years after getting the vaccine You never know exactly at what age girls will become sexually active says Robert Bednarczyk a clinical investigator with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research Southeast and an epidemiologist with the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University who authored the study By providing the vaccine earlier it gives protection into adolescence and early adulthood But he acknowledges that parents concerns about daughters and sexual activity remain a barrier to widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine along with concerns about vaccine safety It is trailing behind other adolescent vaccines Bednarczyk told Shots This is the first study to look at the question of HPV vaccine and sexual activity that didnt rely on girls to report whether they were sexually active It was   in the journal   Earlier this year the American Academy of Pediatrics   that teenage boys get the HPV vaccine too but that decision hasnt sparked nearly as much worry as has vaccinating girls A different bit of data may be the most reassuring The number of teenage girls who are sexually active has been declining steadily Now less than onethird of  to yearold girls say theyve had sex compared with  percent in  according to surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The CDC and the pediatricians say that vaccinating well before teenagers become sexually active is the best way to ensure that they will be protected against HPV infection as teenagers and young adults
