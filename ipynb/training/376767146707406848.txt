A mysterious disease in the Middle East has triggered international alarms for two big reasons The virus is often deadly It has killed almost half of the  people known to have caught it And theres no clear treatment for it Now scientists might have made some progress toward fixing that second problem A combination of two drugs commonly used for other viral infections reduced the symptoms of the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS in monkeys virologists   Sunday in the journal   If a physician is faced with a very sick person with MERS they at least now have an option  a combination of drugs that has been used on many many patients  even though the scientific evidence is small for its effectiveness says the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases   MERS causes pneumonia and breathing problems in both people and monkeys But when virologists at NIAID gave macaque monkeys   and   infected animals developed less damage in their lungs The drugs also improved the sick monkeys breathing and slowed down the viruss growth The good news is that that the drug combination has been used for decades to treat hepatitis C Fauci says So the therapy is already approved for that purpose The cautious news is that the number of animals tested is very small  just three animals in each group Fauci tells Shots It would be clearly premature to make any recommendation for treatment based on an animal model with so few animals tested Still Fauci says the findings are important because they give doctors an option to try and save a person from MERS Individual physicians will have to make up their own mind whether its worth the lastditch effort Ribavirin and interferon together can have serious   such as fever diarrhea and skin rashes In the study the drugs were given just eight hours after the monkeys had been infected with MERS So its unknown if the therapy would be effective after symptoms have already appeared But Fauci says that shouldnt stop doctors from considering the treatment When youre in a situation that you have a patient dying you dont ask the question This was used early in the infection so should I not try it  Since MERS was first detected in Saudi Arabia in September  researchers around the world have rushed to build animal models of the disease and to search for the source of the virus Studies have detected signs of MERS in   and bats But its still unknown exactly how people are catching the virus The vast majority of MERS cases has occurred in the Middle East But a few travelers have brought the virus to   Italy the UK and Tunisia
