Marijuana has been used medically recreationally and spiritually for about  years Known botanically as cannabis it has been called a crude drug marijuana contains more than  chemicals from  chemical families More than  compounds are released when it is smoked and as with tobacco there are dangers in smoking it Medical marijuana clinics operate in  states and the District of Columbia and its recreational use is now legal in Colorado and Washington A Gallup poll conducted last month found that   Yet researchers have been able to do relatively little to test its most promising ingredients for biological activity safety and side effects The main reason is marijuanas classification by Congress in  as an illegal Schedule I drug defined as having a potential for abuse and addiction and no medical value American scientists seeking clarification of marijuanas medical usefulness have long been stymied by this draconian classification usually reserved for street drugs like heroin with a high potential for abuse Dr J Michael Bostwick a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn said the classification was primarily political and ignored more than  years of scientific research which has shown that cellular receptors for marijuanas active ingredients are present throughout the body Natural substances called cannabinoids bind to them to influence a wide range of body processes In a lengthy report entitled   published last year in Mayo Clinic Proceedings Dr Bostwick noted that the socalled endocannabinoid system has an impact on the autonomic nervous system immune system gastrointestinal tract reproductive system cardiovascular system and endocrine network There is evidence that several common disorders including     and   involve disruptions in the endocannabinoid system suggesting that those patients might benefit from marijuana or its ingredients The strongest evidence for the health benefits of   or its derivatives involves the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and the   caused by   Medical marijuana is widely recognized as effective against nausea and appetite loss caused by   although better treatments are now available But preliminary research and anecdotal reports have suggested that marijuana might be useful in treating a number of other conditions including           growth       incontinence bacterial infections   intense   Tourettes syndrome and   Medical experts emphasize the need to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug to facilitate rigorous scientific evaluation of the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids and to determine the optimal dose and delivery route for conditions in which efficacy is established Diane E Hoffmann and Ellen Weber legal experts at the University of Maryland   Marijuanas bestknown ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is responsible for the high sought by recreational users But many people who try smoking marijuana to relieve a health problem are distressed by its psychoactive effects Experts believe that some people would do better with a derivative of marijuana that offers therapeutic action without the mindaltering baggage A more precise dose free of unwanted contaminants would be safer and its effects would be reproducible We believe that physicians should clearly explain to their patients that medical marijuana is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that it is not a standardized or purified product Dr Herbert D Kleber of Columbia University and Dr Robert L Dupont of Georgetown Medical School   One vocal proponent of a more scientific approach to medical marijuana is Martin A Lee the author of   and director of Project CBD an acronym for cannabidiol a compound in marijuana with high therapeutic potential but no psychoactive properties indeed it can   Mr Lee said in an interview that medical marijuana clinics offer a hodgepodge of products including many strains of the plant with varying ratios of active ingredients While all clinics are in business to make money he said the more serious ones try to direct consumers to products that best suit their needs Still access to purified and welltested drugs derived from marijuana would be a far better approach One such drug Sativex is currently in Phase  trials in the United States for the relief of neuropathic pain It is a combination of CBD and THC in a ratio that minimizes the appetite stimulation   and anxiety induced by THC while magnifying painkilling and antitumor properties Mr Lee said The endocannabinoid system has two types of receptors CB and CB that bind to different components in marijuana CB receptors are concentrated in the central nervous system when activated they can make people feel high And when THC stimulates CB receptors governing food intake the resulting munchies can help people whose appetites are depressed by   or cancer The drugs Marinol and Cesamet are THC compounds in pill form approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat chemotherapyinduced   and AIDSrelated   and   Their action is slowed by having to pass through the digestive system before reaching their target CB receptors are concentrated in the peripheral nervous system and immune system Their stimulation primarily by CBD can relieve pain and increase the bodys antiinflammatory activity Sativex the THCCBD combination is available in Canada to treat cancer pain and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis It is sprayed under the tongue for quick entry into the bloodstream as happens when marijuana is smoked   Dr Bostwick described the medical potential of marijuana as incredibly exciting But he added it is not being realized because researchers cant get the material for study Lamenting the current patchwork of state laws governing medical marijuana he said consumers should be sure to know the law in their jurisdiction and work closely with a physician to assure they are using marijuana appropriately
