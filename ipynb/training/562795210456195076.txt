Hey fitness junkies heres something to ponder the next time you lace up your athletic shoes for that long heartpounding run A Danish study recently concluded that highintensity highmileage joggers die at the same rate as channelsurfing couch potatoes The study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology is the latest to confront the controversial topic of what constitutes too much exercise Although previous research has found that physically active people have at least a  lower risk of death compared with inactive people the ideal dose of exercise remains uncertain Noting that the most famous  and perhaps apocryphal  case of physically overdoing it involved the Athenian messenger Pheidippides who dropped dead after running  miles from the battlefield of Marathon to shout the word Nike or victory the researchers hypothesize that strenuous running can damage the heart over time Longterm excessive exercise may be associated with coronary artery calcification diastolic dysfunction and large artery wall stiffening wrote lead study author Dr Peter SchnohrÂ of Copenhagens Frederiksberg Hospital and his colleagues To our knowledge there has been no study of the longevity of marathon halfmarathon or triathlon participants but such studies would clearly be informative The researchers based their findings on data from the Copenhagen Heart Study and followed  healthy joggers and  nonjoggers for about  years By the end of the study  of the joggers and  of the nonjoggers had died Although joggers as a group appear to live longer than sedentary nonjoggers light joggers and moderate joggers have lower mortality rates than sedentary nonjoggers the authors wrote However strenuous joggers  people who ran faster than  mph for more than four hours a week or who ran faster than  mph for more than  hours a week with a frequency of more than three times a week  had a mortality rate that is not statistically different from that of the sedentary group the authors wrote The study is by no means the last word in the matter  the researchers themselves say the subject needs further investigation  but it may come as welcome news to those easygoing joggers who prefer shuffling along at modest speeds The dose of running that was most favorable for reducing mortality was jogging  to  hours per week with no more than three running days per week at a slow or average pace the authors wrote A slow or average running pace was determined to be  mph or a minute mile In an editorial that accompanied the paper the authors noted that the study was limited by a number of factors Lee and his colleagues who did not participate in the Copenhagen study wrote that since the study participants selfreported their running habits they may be subject to error or bias They wrote also that the  study participants who were identified as strenuous joggers may have been too small a group to accurately calculate mortality risk Further studies are needed to better evaluate this controversial issue wrote the authors of the editorial Ideally these studies will be wellcontrolled interventions because we certainly agree that the goal is not to unnecessarily frighten people who wish to participate in more strenuous exercise
