Every year more than half a million Americans undergo procedures to have a narrowed coronary artery propped open with a small metal mesh tube or stent In an emergency when someone is having a heart attack the operation can be lifesaving But far too often studies show stents continue to be implanted in patients who stand to gain little if any benefit Last month two of the countrys largest medical organizations identified the procedure commonly used to place a stent  called a percutaneous coronary intervention or angioplasty  as one of five highly overused medical interventions Their   focused only on elective procedures performed on patients with stable coronary artery disease a type that can cause chest pain and other symptoms during physical exertion but generally not at other times Studies show that in these particular patients inserting a stent is generally no better at preventing a heart attack or an early death than taking medication alone And yet many patients continue to undergo such procedures even when there is the prospect of harm and the unlikelihood of benefit The two groups that issued the report the American Medical Association and the Joint Commission said that roughly  in  elective angioplasty procedures performed nationwide may be inappropriate and another third questionable The operation typically costs around  and in rare circumstances it can cause tears in blood vessel walls major bleeding and other problems Major complications are not very common said a member of the panel that issued the report Dr Stephen D Persell of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine But when it does occur it can be catastrophic One recent recipient of a coronary stent was former President George W Bush Few facts are known about his case but a spokesman said Mr Bush   at a Dallas hospital last week after a blockage was discovered during his annual physical In some cases experts say doctors are motivated to use stents for financial reasons because of the large revenue streams that stent procedures can bring hospitals But some experts say that part of the problem is simply that many patients and even some doctors incorrectly regard coronary artery disease as a plumbing problem According to this view of the disease cholesterol is slowly deposited in an artery wall creating a lesion that grows and clogs the artery like a pipe eventually rupturing and causing a heart attack In theory propping the artery open with a mesh stent where this stenosis or narrowing occurs should reduce the likelihood of a heart attack But plaque does not work that way and the plumbing analogy does not account for crucial factors like inflammation said Dr Michael B Rothberg the vice chair for research in the medicine institute at the Cleveland Clinic Researchers   that most ruptures occur at lesions that appear otherwise mild in some cases so small that they do not limit blood flow and may be invisible to cardiologists he said Vulnerable plaques often cannot be identified or stented before they rupture and lead to blood clotting  a thrombus  that completely obstructs an artery Dr Rothberg recently   that described what he called two of the leading myths about coronary artery disease One is that dietary fat creates plaque and clogs arteries In fact studies show that diets that include fats like the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated kinds found in nuts and olive oil can protect against heart disease The other widespread misconception about coronary artery disease Dr Rothberg said is that narrowed arteries are the problem If you have a clogged sink you call a plumber and he cleans out your sink and its fixed thats the analogy people have in their minds he said But thats not how angioplasty works Theyre not cleaning out the whole pipe Theyre just going to this one small area where theres a stenosis But the rest of the artery could be full of inflammation and other plaques For some doctors who see an isolated narrowing or blockage on an angiogram it can be hard to resist the urge to fix it a phenomenon medical journals call the oculostenotic reflex said Dr Grace A Lin an associate professor of medicine and health policy at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine In a study published   Dr Lin found that some doctors performed elective angioplasty procedures because they believed it would alleviate a patients anxiety Others felt that new and better stents would make a difference or they worried they would feel guilt if they did not operate and a patient had a heart attack down the line But some simply could not accept the idea that opening a narrowed artery would not be helpful One of the beliefs among primary care physicians and cardiologists is that if you see a blockage and you open it it must help in some way even if the data suggest otherwise said Dr Lin If youre thinking of the arteries as plumbing and you see a narrowing then your response is to try to open it Dr Rothberg said that patients with stable disease who are told they have a blockage naturally assume that angioplasty must be lifesaving unless their doctor explains to them otherwise In a small study   Dr Rothberg and his colleagues interviewed hospital patients as they were about to get wheeled into operating rooms for elective angioplasties They also spoke to their cardiologists About  out of  patients said they believed the procedure was going to prevent a future heart attack  expectations that were completely at odds with the expectations of their cardiologists We found that patients generally are not informed of the risks and benefits Dr Rothberg said The report last month noted that strategies like random case reviews and a standardized reporting system might reduce the number of unnecessary procedures It also said there should be a greater emphasis on informed consent and a full disclosure of the risks and benefits of treatment so that patients and families are fully apprised of the outcomes that can be reasonably expected Dr Rothberg said that some doctors make the mistake of telling patients they have a blockage and then leaving the plumbing implications to their imaginations Its more complicated to explain that the blockage isnt necessarily the problem and that you need to take medication that can control the disease he said But if you dont say anything patients are going to assume that this is something that needs to be fixed
