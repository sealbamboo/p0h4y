When it comes to fried foods sometimes I feel cursed My husband can eat as many spicy crispy chicken sandwiches as he wants and never gain a pound But for me just smelling the chicken fryer seems to expand my waistline Now doctors at the Harvard School of Public Health show what weve all suspected Some people do indeed pay a higher price for indulging in French fries and Tater Tots And we have Mom and Dad to blame for it People with higher genetic risk for obesity gain more weight when they eat fried foods than people with lower risk a team from Harvard Medical School   Tuesday in the   The effect isnt huge But for some people the extra pounds could be the difference between being normal weight and overweight Eating fried foods four or more times each week is associated with two extra points on the body mass index scale when you carry  obesity risk genes the study found But heres the surprising part For people who dont have any of the obesity genes one of those extra BMI points melt away In essence those mozzarella sticks are more fattening for those of us predisposed to a bigger waistline To find this interaction between genes and fried foods epidemiologist   and his team analyzed the dietary habits of nearly  adults in the US They also calculated each persons genetic risk for obesity by analyzing  genes known to be linked to the disease Having these genes doesnt mean youre obese Instead they increase your risk for having a higher BMI at some point in your life As expected people who ate more fried foods gained more weight than those who indulged less frequently And people who carried more of the obesity genes also had higher BMIs But the volunteers who had both risk factors  eating lots of fried food and a high number of fat genes  had the largest BMIs of all groups and the biggest risk for obesity In other words a love of fried food may magnify your genetic disposition for adding on pounds Qi and his colleagues think the same may be true for sugary drinks A few years ago they performed a similar experiment  instead of looking at fried foods they analyzed peoples weekly consumption of sodas fruit juices and lemonade Drinking at least one sugary beverage each day was associated with a bump in BMI by about  points when people carried  of the obesity genes The soda penalty shrank by nearly half for people without the risk genes the team   in   In Westernized societies we are all exposed to caloriedense food sedentary lives stress and sleep deficit geneticists Alexandra Blakemore and Jessica Buxton from Imperial College London   in a comment about the current study Some people seem relatively insensitive to these environmental pressures while others are severely affected and become obese The Harvard studies offer an explanation for this observation But they come with limitations For starters Qi and his team couldnt tell whether the fried foods or sugary drinks caused the increase in BMI Thats because a love of fried foods could be an indicator of other unhealthy habits In the study people who indulged more often also tended to watch more TV and get less exercise The findings are also averages over a large number of people They have poor predictive power for any given individual Blakemore and Buxton write Nevertheless the synergy between fried food and genes offers one more reason to take pause before ordering that aromatic fried chicken  even if you dont have obesity genes And its pretty easy to figure out whether you do Christpher Ochner    You dont need a fancy DNA test Just take a look at your parents he says
