Nearly  in  young Americans between ages  and  acknowledges having perpetrated an act of sexual violence at least once and  of a nationally representative sample of American kids reported attempting or completing rape a new study finds While those most likely to report initiating unwanted sexual contact in their early to midteens were boys girls were among the perpetrators as the age of respondents increased Latino and African American youths and those from lowincome families were less likely to have coerced another person to engage in sex than were whites and those from higherincome families the study found And among perpetrators of sexual violence consumption of Xrated materials  specifically those depicting physical harm in the context of sex  was notably more common than it was among youths who did not report efforts to coerce or force someone else to engage in sex The research published Monday in the journal   appears to be first to gauge how widespread sexual violence is among Americans of highschool and college age It was based on surveys conducted between October  and March  with  people ages  to  who participated in a broader longitudinal study called Growing Up With Media Drawing upon the US Justice Department definitions of sexual violence the authors of the latest research asked participants whether they had ever engaged in a wide range of behaviors including kissing touching making an unwilling partner do something sexual or coercing or forcing someone who did not want to have sex to do so That range of behavior might range from sexual harassment to rape but is generally all defined as sexual violence In all  of those responding   of  respondents  reported they had kissed touched or made someone else do something sexual when they knew the person did not want to characterized as forced sexual contact About  reported they had gotten someone else to give in to sex when the perpetrator knew the other person did not want to characterized as coercive sex Also  acknowledged attempting rape meaning that he or she had been unable to force someone else to have sex And   a total of  individuals  said they had forced another person to have sex when they knew the person did not want to a completed rape Coercive tactics including arguing pressuring getting angry or making someone feel guilty were most commonly reported by those who acknowledged attempted or completed rape And the study found that  of the cases of sexual violence occurred in the context of a boyfriendgirlfriend relationship Ten of the respondents  just under   acknowledged having threatened or used physical force to get someone to engage in sex While vaginal sex was the most common form of forced or coerced sex sought it was closely followed by oral sex The study also found that perpetrators of sexual violence of all types were unlikely to accept responsibility for their acts One in seven believed that he or she was not at all responsible for what happened and almost  in  said they considered the victim somewhat or completely responsible for the reported incident And only two of the respondents reported being arrested for the transgression The authors said that the rarity with which perpetrators either are caught or assume responsibility for their actions underscores the importance of bystander training and intervention in US high schools and colleges Such training emphasizes the responsibility of peers not only to discourage and prevent negative behavior within their group or community but also to recognize stop or report such behavior when they witness it Widely used in antibullying campaigns bystander intervention is now gaining ground on college campuses as a means of reducing sexual violence The study was conducted by Michele L Ybarra of the  in San Clemente CA and Kimberly Mitchell of the University of New Hampshires    An earlier online version of this story said the study was based on survey results from  people there were  people
