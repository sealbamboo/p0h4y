Some people have had it with natural food For fifteen years   director of consumer safety and sustainability for Consumer Reports has been pointing out that natural is just about the most misleading label that youll ever see on a food package Yet consumers still   for that word food companies still love to use it and the Food and Drug Administration cant or wont define it So Rangan now says its time to kill the natural label Consumer Reports is about to submit formal   to the FDA and the US Department of Agriculture asking them to ban the word from food packages so that consumers wont be hornswoggled by empty promises Its the latest turn in a debate thats gone on for decades in part because defining naturalness seems to be just as hard as defining beauty According to a   from the Center for Science in the Public Interest the FDA told a food manufacturer in  that canned heattreated grapefruit juice couldnt be called natural This term should be reserved for fresh juice or juice which has been kept without intervention of any process of heat treatment the agency wrote But times and technology change These days the FDA only objects to calling a food natural if it contains artificial flavor color or other synthetic additives Otherwise there are few restrictions Farmers can grow crops using pesticides and genetically modified crops often called GMOs They can feed antibiotics to animals or keep egglaying chickens in cages Food processors can add sugar an allnatural sweetener after all or corn starch or anything else derived from plant or animal life to their products Its all natural This is galling for Rangan because Consumer Reports been campaigning against several of these practices including the use of antibiotics and GMOs Most consumers she says believe  mistakenly  that food labeled natural is produced without these practices Surveys show that most consumers think that the label is equivalent to organic Organic rules do ban the use of antibiotics GMOs and almost all synthetic pesticides In theory the FDA could define natural In reality Rangan says theres little chance that will happen at least not quickly It took many years for the USDA to come up with a working standard for organic food and defining natural would be just as complicated Better she says just to ban the word Others have attacked the problem through the   More than  lawsuits have been filed against the use of natural arguing that it cant apply to food containing GMOs or hydrogenated oils In some cases companies responded by erasing the offending word from the label Rangans quest to ban the word entirely however faces tough legal hurdles Id be very surprised if the FDA has any interest in acting on this says David Ter Molen an attorney with Freeborn  Peters in Chicago whos also editor of a   This is not a health or safety issue for them and not high on the agencys list of priorities So for now whether something is natural remains a matter of opinion
