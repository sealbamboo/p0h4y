This is a wonderful time of year for getting together over meals with those closest to you I suffer from fish allergy and my daughter has a peanut and tree nut allergy  Members of our inner circle are the most reliable and trusted food allergy gatekeepers for parties and celebrations but its not possible to assume that friends and family will always remember to avoid reactioncausing foods after youve told them After all they dont live with your food allergy day in and day out and thus naturally arent yet in the habit of checking every label every time The holiday season is an optimal time to check in and remind everyone of your allergies prior to the gettogethers This season is also an excellent time to ensure your autoinjectors and rescue medications are uptodate The autoinjectors in particular have a relatively short shelf life and the product visibly starts to deteriorate at or around the expiration date Remaining vigilant is key Here are some holiday gathering tips for both hosts and guests  Keep food labels for everything used to prepare a festive homemade holiday meal so an allergic guest may doublecheck the ingredient list  Request flowers wine or holidaythemed napkins and plates if guests want to contribute to the party and someone with a food allergy is attending  Some prebasted turkeys contain soy wheat and dairy Instead look for turkeys labeled natural which by law must be minimally processed Some freerange allnatural fresh turkeys are free of antibiotics hormones and allergens   Care with utensils and surfaces when preparing foods is a must Rinsing a knife that chopped walnuts is insufficient  thoroughly scrub all utensils and surfaces with soap and water and wipe clean Even trace amounts of a food can cause a reaction for highly allergic people  How about trying colorcoded cooking utensils this year A bright red silicone spatula or a nifty lime green serving spoon is sure to alert foodallergic guests Many large box stores stock seasonal arrays of themed and brightly colored utensils in advance of the holiday season  If a guest brings a food item that contains allergens and theres an allergic diner at the table you could accept the item if its wellsealed and donate it later to a friend or a soup kitchen Some cities even have volunteer organizations dedicated to alleviating hunger After a free phone call their volunteers who deliver sometimes more than  tons of food a week to agencies feeding people in need will pick up your donation   When in doubt beautiful fresh flowers are always a welcome hostess gift instead of a pie from a bakery when youre just not sure about the allergy safety  If youre allergic and flying to visit friends or family make some simple allergyfree foods that travel well and ship them to your hosts home a week or more in advance so youre sure theyll arrive in time for your visit   If your host has food allergies you can always bring a gift of unpeeled fruit or a prepackaged seasonal safe food with ingredient lists approved by your host  If youre food allergic and even if the party youre invited to is not a potluck why not offer to bring a safe dish or two so theres definitely something you can eat Your host will be thankful not to have to prepare separate food items and sharing dishes that are allergenfree will delight everyone there If you are allergic always let your host or restaurant where youre celebrating know in advance  dont assume they will remember Even a restaurant where you frequently dine may not immediately remember you and your medical condition at holiday banquet tables with prixfixe meals Be sure to remember to always carry your rescue medication just in case of emergency And heres to your good health
