The day before her daughter died Deanna Slifka felt her move with kicks just as strong as any during the perfectly normal pregnancy with her second child But by the time the Ohio mother delivered Sophia on May   during a planned cesarean section the babys heart had stopped inexplicably  and doctors couldnt start it again The pound ounce girl was stillborn raising all of the anguished questions that the unexpected death of a baby can bring So when the call came asking if Slifka and her husband Joseph would consider donating Sophias tissue or organs the stunned parents didnt know what to say So they said yes Obviously it was the worst moment of my life said Slifka  of Youngstown Ohio But I knew there had to be more to her life than  weeks inside of me She held not just the potential to save another baby but to save another parent as well With that decision the Slifkas became part of a small but growing group of parents who agree to neonatal donation a littleknown practice that retrieves organs and tissues from babies who die during birth or shortly after for use in transplants and research Its a rare procedure of course  so rare that some parents whove asked about donating organs say they have been told its impossible Between  and  just  organ donors in the US were a week old or less according to the United Network for Organ Sharing But some transplant experts are urging much wider use They say such infants have the potential to ease a serious shortage of donor organs that leaves  people to die each day on US waiting lists Cells obtained from infants and young children are rare but researchers say they may hold the key to understanding the start of diseases such as diabetes About  percent of babies who die in the neonatal intensive care units or NICUs may be suitable candidates for donation according to a   that looked at donation after cardiac death Over two years that translated to  livers  kidneys and  hearts enough to make a dent in the  of  children  months and younger actively waiting for organs A neonatal heart isnt going to help an adult but it may help another neonate said Dr Richard Parad a coauthor of the study published in the Journal of Pediatrics Just as compelling neonatal donation can help grieving parents cope with their loss giving them a sense of purpose amid wrenching tragedy he said We were motivated to do this project because of the experiences we had with parents who said Cant something good come out of this terrible situation said Parad noting that previous research found that in  percent of such cases parents initiate conversations about donation The Slifkas said their experience was helped by   the Ohio organ procurement organization or OPO that arranged for them to donate Sophias heart valves which went to two babies who needed replacements We spoke to a woman who was amazing and gentle and compassionate Deanna Slifka recalled It has been the No  thing besides our faith that has helped us get through this But other parents said they have had to fight to donate their babies organs either because doctors and other professionals arent aware its possible or because traumatized families are discouraged from pursuing it Bethany and Eric Conkel of Dayton Ohio were devastated in  when prenatal tests found that their first baby a boy had anencephaly a severe birth defect in which babies dont develop part of their brain or skull After the diagnosis  weeks into the pregnancy the couple decided to carry the baby to full term  and to donate his organs and tissues if possible Eric Conkel  was an undergraduate science student working in a cadaver lab so the notion of donated bodies was familiar to him But it took until two days before their son Amalya Nathaniel was born to find a program that would agree to accept his tissues Many parents are just told theres simply no way to donate said Bethany Conkel  Most families are told it is unethical or illegal Its neither experts told NBC News But there can be barriers to neonatal donation Many newborns die of disease defect or trauma damaging organs and tissues Others are without oxygen too long The biggest problem is that many hospitals and donors dont consider infants as organ donors when they could said Parad I cant think of a reason it cant be done he said The data suggest that its worthwhile and technically possible Amalya Conkel was delivered by cesarean section on Sept   He lived  hour and  minutes He never cried or moved or made any sound He did open his eyes his mother said After his death with the help of the   an organ and tissue agency the Conkels were able to donate Amalyas liver and pancreas and his body for research His tissues have been used in lifesaving therapies for babies with type  diabetes she said We are beyond thrilled and blessed Bethany Conkel said I think it brought a lot of healing Thats an emotion shared by Sarah Gray a Washington DC mother who became pregnant with twin boys Thomas and Callum in  but learned early on that Thomas had anencephaly She carried both boys to term Thomas died at home five days after his birth She and her husband Ross donated their sons eyes to the Schepens Eye Research Institute in Boston his liver cells to Cytonet LLC in Durham NC and his cord blood to the Duke Center for Human Genetics also in Durham They tell themselves that they have the right to say their son went to Harvard when it comes to sports they root for Duke It made me feel like my sons death has a meaning said Gray  whose surviving twin is almost  It makes a huge difference Its something well be proud of for the rest of our lives Now all three families devote energy to helping other parents understand that neonatal donation is possible Gray is the marketing director for the American Association of Tissue Banks Bethany Conkel has started a website   that provides information and direction about organ donation for professionals  and for expectant parents who have learned their babies will die She also works with the IIAMs new   which launched last summer and has helped a dozen families so far according to Gina Dunne Smith the groups general manager And Conkel is pregnant with a second child a girl Hazel who is due in May Shes perfect Conkel said Deanna Slifka a graduate student studying to be a counselor juggles care of her first child Isabella now  with that of a new baby Eliana now  months old Shes terrified of public speaking but she delivers group talks frequently now working with the local OPO to make sure that other parents of stillborn and neonatal babies know that organ donation is an option Its her way of remembering and honoring Sophia she said This is how I get to parent her I get to be her mom by sharing her story Slifka said She was never able to take a breath on this earth but she lives on through this
