Dublin-based Shire PLC, a specialist in drugs to treat attention-deficit disorder and rare diseases, has rejected a £27.2 billion ($46.35 billion) takeover bid from U.S. rival AbbVie Inc., in the latest move by a U.S. company to pursue a deal for a company with a lower tax rate.. Shire, which is tax-resident in Ireland, said in a statement Friday the proposal “fundamentally undervalued the company and its prospects.”  The proposal comes amid a wave of interest in such so-called tax-inversion deals, most prominently Pfizer Inc.’s failed $120 billion attempt to buy AstraZeneca PLC, which ended last month. Similarly, U.S. medical-device company Medtronic Inc. on Sunday agreed to buy the U.K.’s Covidien PLC for $42.9 billion, also in part to lower its tax rate.. AbbVie can always come back with a fresh offer, and other suitors may emerge. But for now, Shire is staying solo. Corporate Intelligence did a selective survey of some of the other companies that have managed to stay single—at least for now—in the current scramble for trans-Atlantic deal partners.
