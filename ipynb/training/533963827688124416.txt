Too many patients are struggling to book GP appointments in England the health watchdog has told the BBC Patients at one in six surgeries have problems booking appointments the Care Quality Commission CQC said after an inspection of  practices  The watchdog also raised concerns over variations in how serious incidents were reported and investigated Prof Steve Field the CQCs chief inspector of GPs said most practices offered safe and effective care We believe that the vast majority of GP surgeries in England are providing good care for their patients but unfortunately the vast majority are being let down by a small minority and unfortunately we have seen some examples in our pilot phase of some really poor care he said What I want is that all patients have access to really good care wherever they are and we will make sure that happens The CQC said some practices did not have robust and consistent systems for reporting incidents or a culture of identifying where things had gone wrong and learning from them The practices were inspected between April and September   They were pilots for a new inspection regime that came into force at the start of October and will involve nearly  practices being inspected by March  Under the new system each surgery is given a rating of either outstanding good requires improvement or inadequate  To date inspectors have just had to report whether they were compliant with a set of core standards GP practices given an inadequate rating by the CQC will be given six months to improve If they fail to move out of the bottom rating they will be placed in special measures and given another six months  Failure to improve while in special measures will lead to either the CQC withdrawing its registration or NHS England terminating its contract The CQC said the new regime reflected a profound culture change at the organisation A spokeswoman said We have moved away from a regulationfocused approach to a more holistic assessment of the quality of care by asking five key questions  Is a practice safe Is it effective Is it caring Is it responsive to peoples needs And is it wellled The inspection teams have also changed comprising an expert inspector and a GP specialist adviser Practice nurses and managers may be brought in to make the inspection more of a peerreview process  Dr Julie White is a GP in Irlam Greater Manchester whose surgery has just been rated as outstanding She told the BBC Were very traditional GPs we have a traditional structure  a couple of nurses a healthcare assistant reception staff   We dont do anything particularly different to what you would expect in a practice  I think what we do do is we manage our patients quite well we follow people up we will have quite a lot of telephone contacts during the day so were quite accessible Dr Maureen Baker chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners said the vast majority of practices were doing an excellent job Family doctors want to do their best for their patients but we are carrying out m consultations a year  m more than five years ago Since  the number of patients visiting their GP has risen by over  a day she said We also have a desperate shortage of GPs in many parts of the country with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring  To ensure patients can get the level of service they deserve we urgently need to recruit  more GPs by
