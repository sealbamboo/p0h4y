When people choose to have their leukemia treated aggressively its a big commitment more so than for almost any other cancer With this therapy  three days of the drug daunorubicin which comes in a reddish color so distinctive that one of my patients a former chemist used it in his professional life as a dye for plastics and seven days of the drug cytarabine which is infused continuously over  hours  we offer them the chance to be cured of a disease moving like wildfire with a stiff breeze behind it at the height of drought  The offer can be seen as a Faustian bargain though In return comes the very real possibility of dying from our treatment along with immersion into a kind of purgatory of a hospital stay lasting four to six weeks We joke with our patients that we love boring  it is in fact a medical ideal that our patients complain of nothing more than ennui on a daily basis But the psychological mettle it takes to endure this experience is remarkable and theres little that can prepare a person for it We make our rounds as a group  nurses physician assistants residents a fellow a pharmacist a case manager me and occasionally additional observers It can be quite absurd really this thundering herd walking slowly down the hallway of the leukemia unit stopping at each doorway A few weeks ago when I was attending on the leukemia service we came to our eighth patient of  a yearold man whose leukemia persisted despite our first round of chemotherapy so we gave him more It was now his th day in the hospital and his blood counts showed no signs of recovery a wasteland of emptiness A few of us walked into his room where his wife sat in a chair by his bed reading She looked up and gave us a halfsmirk as we glanced over at him His sheets were pulled completely over his head and then tucked underneath it creating the image of a starched white cocoon  Dont mind him He always sleeps like that she said On the ship the couch where he rested was directly under a vent and this was the only way he could ever grab any shuteye He stirred and pulled the sheets down squinting against the rooms lights He was captain of a barge that traversed the Great Lakes hauling iron ore for the steel mills back when steel mills were still open and the Steinbrenners controlled a lot of this commerce He steered these massive vessels from the back aft he liked to remind us landlubbers staring out across the two football fields of their length Hed be gone from March through October his wife said I was one of the lake widows She laughed but stopped herself quickly realizing the nickname threatened to become a reality But I knew what I was getting myself into His father was a ship captain too so my motherinlaw sat me down before our wedding day to prepare me I asked what it was like to go eight months without seeing each other I missed her but wed meet up every month or two my patient chimed in now awake I would track the ship his wife added I knew what day they would set out from Duluth and approximately when theyd be getting into Chicago So Id pile the kids into the car and wed go see him Wed have  hours as a family but if we were lucky and there was a maintenance issue on the ship sometimes wed get  She smiled at the memory But mostly there was a lot of waiting My patient said It got better when the kids went off to college Then she could join me on the ship for two weeks at a time He gestured to a photograph on his wall of the sun rising over a body of water in a cloudless sky It was beautiful really seeing that every day Beautiful his wife echoed Everyone in the room was still thinking about the expanse of water the miles he had already covered and what lay ahead  So I guess theres no change in my blood counts my patient asked Nope not yet I answered But they could improve any day now Its OK he said Were not in a hurry Well see you tomorrow  His wife waved goodbye and went back to her book as we left his room the waters calm the air without breeze
