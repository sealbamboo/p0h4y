A man whose heart stopped  times within minutes is incredibly unusual to have recovered fully doctors say John Gilmartin  from Chaddesden had his heart restarted  times on the way to hospital and six further times at Royal Derby Hospital Dr Gareth Hughes said in repeatedresuscitation cases the patient nearly always suffers neurological damage Mr Gilmartin who is fit and had had no previous heart problems said he was lucky to survive He said he felt unwell on the day in September and went for a lie down before waking up in intensive care I didnt have any heart problems Ive always been fit and well he said  My family were terrified The wife slipped me down on to the floor and performed CPR on me until paramedics came There was a chance Id have suffered brain damage without CPR Paramedics had to repeatedly administer electric shocks to keep his heart going on the way to the hospitals AE department He had a further six attacks during an operation to fit a small balloon pump inside his heart Dr Hughes who was part of a team of  which saved Mr Gilmartin said Its incredibly unusual to have such a successful outcome that not only did he survive but survived completely neurologically intact The fact that hes quite young and probably has reasonable cardiac functions has helped him in this case in that we were able to recover it Theres no reason why he shouldnt go on to have a long and fruitful life hopefully
