I am  years old I am a doctor I am a mother I am recovering from that most British of things  the silent breakdown I had been a GP in the   for  years when I had the chance of a sabbatical My husband was offered a new job and while I settled my family into a new life abroad I would embark on a project I hadnt previously had the time to do A break from clinical practice has meant leaving my patients and I still feel the relentless thwack of guilt I beat myself with Its not because I am indispensible but because I can now see when I look back that like many of my hard working compassionate colleagues I was heading for burnout We are all told we have a professional obligation to seek help if were not coping the scary truth is I didnt notice I just felt enormous guilt that I was struggling with the everincreasing demands Now I can see that I was pouring more and more of myself into work and losing perspective So I am no longer on the journey beside the man who clutched my hand his eyes imploring me to chase death from the room as it inched its fingers across the pillow towards him I am no longer providing the safe space for the young mum to cry at the unfairness of her terminal diagnosis  so desperate to continue to provide love and care to her children And I am not helping rebuild the life of the  year old who presented with acne but unravelled her story of abuse at the hands of her stepfather Ten minutes per patient at least  times a day The paperwork had started to feel like Harry Potters invitations to Hogwarts letters flowing down the corridors seeping under the window frames They threatened to drown us all in demands to chase results deliver diagnoses organise referrals or tell us there was nothing more that could be offered I used to lie in bed in the dark at the end of a  hour day hoping that resting was as good as sleep Thoughts churned in my head I replayed conversations Had I said the right thing Could I have done more Should I have done it differently What was happening with that mans leg  the MRI was okay what was I missing Had I remembered to  oh no Id forgotten Id leap out of bed to turn on my laptop to check something that could wait except there wouldnt be time tomorrow Id slip back in beside my husband apologising that Id woken him but knowing he hadnt been asleep Hed been worrying about me but didnt know what to do I dont want this anymore I whispered He put his arms around me reaching through my isolation This cant go on he said Im taking the job We made plans to leave I do not wish for sympathy Doctors know better than anyone that many others are worse off than we will ever be but this is exactly what makes it so hard to care for yourself I believed my own story about taking a few months to pursue a different interest and was more surprised than anyone to watch myself crash once Id stopped work   and I am horrified because only now do I realise the extent of the casualties I also now know that I am one of them the NHS falling apart has cost me dearly financially psychologically and in terms of my career There will be blame heaped upon doctors for not doing more to save the NHS But how can we speak up and change a system when we are exhausted and firefighting Burnout advice in medicine focuses on the individual recognising symptoms and seeking help This is stupidity In the army it is the leaders who know their troops and look out for battle fatigue Soldiers also have regular breaks from frontline duty with an expectation that they will return I read that Mother Teresa believed that every few years her nuns should take a year off to allow them to heal from their care giving work My prescription for a new NHS would have structured career breaks doctors could be redeployed in teaching policy research or management where their skills and experience could feed back into the UKs healthcare system When they returned to clinical work they would have a new perspective and real ownership of what they helped build   also need proper management and leadership it is time to stop pussyfooting around the old adage that managing doctors is like herding cats We are not infallible great people management is not about bossing or imposing endless restructuring but should be about recognising skills encouraging innovation and knowing when and how to support your best frontline staff
