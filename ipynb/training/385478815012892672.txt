Lets start by agreeing to this premise Kale is very good for you And yes we here at The Salt have been known to indulge in  nay    kale chips and kale salads on a not infrequent basis Still when we found out that Wednesday is    featuring a kale dance party we kid you not  we couldnt help but think Come on people the kale love has officially Gone Too Far Turns out the ringleader of this spanking new holiday is   a psychiatrist at Columbia University who wears his passion for the dark leafy green on his sleeve  or perhaps more aptly on his book jacket Hes the author most recently of the cheekily named   a book of recipes Ramsey specializes in the link between nutrition and mental health and says kale first drew his attention because of its excellent concentration of nutrients including vitamin C vitamin A vitamin K and omega fatty acids And he became convinced that advising patients to eat kale was one of the most important pieces of advice he could give them Food is a big part of my practice and I realized that the standard messaging  telling people to avoid fat and cholesterol  was unhelpful because it doesnt help people fill their plate Ramsey tells The Salt Instead we need to be telling people what foods we want them to eat  nutrientdense foods like kale mussels and farmfresh eggs As Ramsey sees it kale is also an ideal antidote to a public health crisis And his kale evangelism has been growing ever more fervent in preparation for National Kale Day Ramseys   includes several scheduled Google Hangouts and a kale health summit Then theres the aforementioned kale dance party complete with kale cocktails at Seasonal Whispers in Soho in New York City You can dance along at home via the magic of Google Hangout Our goal is to get more converts he says especially kids in school and kale newbies who have heard about it but havent actually tried it All of which is laudable  except theres a small problem with superfood evangelism As weve reported many times it can be dangerous to fixate on individual foods as curative sustenance because your diets influence on your health is an incredibly complex equation The dangers of elevating this cabbage cousin to canonization status were brilliantly illuminated recently by food blogger Melissa McEwen In a   on her blog Hunt Gather Love she enumerated the dangers of eating kale including its horrific effects on livestock and that its laden with pesticides The post by the way was meant to show how easy it is to demonize a food by selective citation of scientific studies but it also does a good job of noting the dangers of focusing your diet almost exclusively on one ingredient  which I think anyone will agree is a bad idea McEwen writes Besides the health of humanity seems like an awfully big burden to place on the fragile shoulders of little ol kale As we make kale the health halo food du jour we risk turning it into the Gwyneth Paltrow of the vegetable world  a perceived goody twoshoes that deservedly or not everyone loves to   Hat tip to   for   this celebritycultivar comparison And as a recent     reminded us kale is not universal In France where kale is often seen as a reminder of the dietary deprivations of World War II an American woman named Kristen Beddard is waging a crusade to put this trendy green on menus far and wide Not surprisingly Beddard happens to be on the board of National Kale Day A noble quest perhaps but is it also a necessary one to save the French As French food writer Sana Lemoine noted to the   They dont need magical vegetables or superfoods They already have a tradition of eating balanced meals In a strange way kale is superfluous Still such snickering will not deter kale crusader Ramsey To all the naysayers Ramsey has this to say Eat more kale to improve your attitude
