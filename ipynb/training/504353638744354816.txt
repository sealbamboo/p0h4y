For the second time in two years, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has run afoul of FDA inspectors, who cited the drug maker for lax manufacturing practices at a plant that makes its only marketed product, the pricey Soliris treatment for combating a rare blood disorder.. The agency cited the drug maker for three production issues found during an inspection this month, and these were separate from problems cited in a March 2013 warning letter that followed an earlier inspection in 2012, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
