Researchers have discovered the largest virus ever and theyve given it a terrifying name   In mythology opening Pandoras Box released evil into the world But theres no need to panic This new family of virus lives underwater and doesnt pose a major threat to human health This is not going to cause any kind of widespread and acute illness or epidemic or anything says   an evolutionary biologist at the National Institutes of Health who specializes in viruses Instead the  opens up a host of questions about the origins of life on Earth according to its discoverer   of AixMarseille University in France He says We believe that those new   have emerged from an ancestral cellular type that no longer exists The   appears today in the journal  A typical virus is a tiny sack of genetic material that injects itself into a much larger cell and uses it to make more viruses The  is enormous by comparisonlarge enough to be seen in an ordinary microscope about  micrometer Its so big its hard to even tell its a virus Claverie says They dont have a regular shape like a regular viruses they really look like blobs And so they really look like small bacteria Bacteria are singlecelled organisms that reproduce on their own Claverie first stumbled across giant viruses a decade ago when another researcher brought him one that was misidentified as a bacterium It was only when Claverie saw it infect amoebas that he realized it was a virus After a recent survey found genetic hints of giant viruses in seawater Claverie and his team decided to go on the hunt They teamed up with oceanographers and scooped out sediment samples from the coast of Chile and a freshwater pond in Australia They brought back the samples and placed them in a solution filled with antibiotics to kill any bacteria that might have been along for the ride Then they exposed the samples to their laboratory amoebas If they die we suspect that theres something in there that killed them says   Claveries coauthor and also his wife It worked The infected amoebas spawned lots of   When Abergel and Claverie sequenced the genome of the new virus they were in for a shock Its genetic code is roughly twice the size of the recordholding   And it seems almost completely unlike anything else on the planet Only  percent of its genes resembled the genes other organisms Claverie says he thinks the   may come from a different origin  perhaps radically different We believe that those new   have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists he says That life could have even come from another planet like Mars At this point we cannot actually disprove or disregard this type of extreme scenario he says But how did this odd cellular form turn into a virus Abergel says it may have evolved as a survival strategy as modern cells took over On Earth it was winners and it was losers and the losers could have escaped death by going through parasitism and then infect the winner she says Eugene Koonin who wasnt involved in the research isnt buying this theory These viruses unusual as they might be are still related to other smaller viruses he says The viruss size is probably part of its survival strategy Amoebas and other simple creatures could mistake it for bacteria and try to eat it opening them up to infection The internal environment of the amoeba cell provides a very good playground for acquiring various kinds of genes from different sources Koonin says He thinks that the   unusual genome may be a mishmash of random genetic material its sucked up from its hosts Nevertheless Koonin says the new virus is fascinating And he predicts this is only the beginning We are going to see many many more giant viruses discovered around the world some of which probably will be bigger than   Meanwhile Claverie is also looking at what   actually does in the wild The fact that it can be found on different continents and in both fresh water  salt suggests it may be a big player in underwater ecosystems around the globe
