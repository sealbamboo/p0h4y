On Thursday we   why a yearold man who had recently given up heroin cocaine and marijuana had a sudden attack of nausea and vomiting so severe that he had to go to the hospital Two big clues were provided His nausea and vomiting eased when he took a hot shower and he regularly used an herbal product that he bought in a neighborhood store called Spice said to be synthetic marijuana  We got more than  responses Several of you correctly identified the syndrome as cannabinoid hyperemesis But given that this young man had a urine toxicology screen that showed he had no cannabinoids in his system I was also looking for you to link that syndrome to his use of Spice  Several of you did just that but the first was Dr Martine Lamy an intern in child psychiatry at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center Dr Lamy told me that she had cared for a patient who had the exact same presentation The young man she had seen an athlete on a college team had first developed cannabinoid hyperemesis when he smoked marijuana Once the college started drugtesting all athletes she tells me the whole team switched to Spice which does not show up on urine screens
