Signs warning shoppers how much exercise they need to do to burn off calories in sugary drinks can encourage healthier choices US research suggests A study of teenagers purchasing habits found they bought fewer sugary drinks and more water when the signs were up The most effective sign said it took five miles to walk off the  calories in a sugary drink Public Health England said the study showed simple health messages worked Study leader Dr Sara Bleich associate professor at the Bloomberg School John Hopkins University said people do not understand calorie content on its own on a label What our research found is that when you explain calories in an easily understandable way such as how many miles of walking is needed to burn them off you can encourage behaviour change For six weeks the brightly coloured signs were displayed in corner shops in neighbourhoods in Baltimore in full view of young customers buying sugary drinks Four different signs were used in the shops Two translated the calories in the drinks into the amount of exercise needed to burn off those calories One sign said it would take  minutes of running to work off the  calories  or  teaspoons of sugar  contained in a ml bottle of fizzy drink sports drink or fruit juice The remaining signs listed the sugar content of the drink and the calories contained in the drink A can of fizzy drink which is ml in size in the UK contains around nine teaspoons of sugar To find out the impact of the signs the researchers  writing in the American Journal of Public Health  interviewed children aged between  and  years old leaving the shop Out of the  of those interviewed who said they saw the signs  said they believed the sign and  said their behaviour had changed as a consequence Before the signs were put up  of drinks bought in the shops were sugary ones After six weeks this was reduced to  During the time the signs were on view sales of larger bottles of fizzy drinks went down from  to  of all purchases The percentage of teenagers who chose to buy no drink at all in the shops increased from  to  This change in behaviour continued for several weeks after the exercise signs were taken down the study adds In total more than  drinks purchases were observed by the research team Dr Bleich said the findings could help in the fight against obesity This is a very lowcost way to get children old enough to make their own purchases to drink fewer sugarsweetened beverages and they appear to be effective even after they are removed Using these easytounderstand and easytoinstall signs may help promote obesityprevention or weight loss Dr Alison Tedstone chief nutritionist at Public Health England said This is an interesting study which demonstrates that we need to use a range of clear simple messages to help people follow healthier diets  This is one of many possible approaches and PHE continues to keep the evidence base for behaviour change under review  PHE says ChangeLife uses sugar reveals in its campaigns which have been proven to have an impact on a persons selection of drinks Dr Tedstone added We all need to make sure we get our six to eight glasses of fluids a day not from sugary drinks but from water lower fat milk no added sugar or sugarfree drinks Kawther Hashem a nutritionist at campaign group Action on Sugar said that any measure which helps draw attention to the dangers of consuming too many calories  was a good thing especially if it converts awareness into people taking positive action and switching to less calorific drinks  She said it was also critical that soft drink manufacturers were made to reduce the sugar content of their drinks One quarter of all adults and one in five children in the UK are classified as obese
