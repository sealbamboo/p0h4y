Ever since the magazine published   in May last year readers have been writing and tweeting their requests for an updated more advanced version For them the workout became too easy or humdrum as tends to happen when exercises are repeated without variation So here it is a new more technically demanding regimen one that requires a couple of dumbbells but still takes only seven minutes  To come up with the workout I turned to Mark Verstegen the founder and president of the Phoenixbased EXOS a company that focuses on health and athletic performance He and his colleagues train among others NFL players and the German national soccer team which won the World Cup this year EXOS also develops inhouse fitness and nutritional programs for corporations so Mr Verstegen has experience working with those of us who dont already have bowlingball biceps and vast reservoirs of endurance and gritty resolve He and his colleagues Mr Verstegen says know how difficult it can be to find the time and motivation to work out as often as we know we should Hence a routine that can be completed in just minutes and without much space  no more than a hotel room or an office for example Taken together the exercises stress and strengthen muscle groups throughout the upper body lower body and torso The full workout see stepbystep instructions below also provides a compressed but intense intervalstyle endurance workout Anyone who completes multiple pushuptorowtoburpee movements in  seconds Exercise  will raise his or her heart rate substantially The subsequent  seconds of side bridges Exercise  provide a brief aerobic respite before the aerobically demanding Exercise  singleleg Romanian dead lift to curl to press Theres a lot of scientific support for the benefits of this sort of highintensity interval training In recent months articles have reported that even a few minutes of intervalstyle exercise increase endurance   and   in sedentary adults more effectively than traditional prolongedendurance exercise In other words seven minutes or so of relatively punishing training may produce greater gains than an hour or more of gentler exercise Whats more study subjects who did a combination of prolonged exercises like running or cycling and highintensity interval workouts typically   Interval programs based on cycling walking and running come with a downside however They improve overall fitness and health but do little to improve muscular strength other than in the legs By contrast the New Scientific Minute Workout does more than build the large obvious muscles that most of us can namecheck as Mr Verstegen puts it  the quads and glutes for example its exercises also engage smaller often overlooked muscles in the back abdomen shoulders and hips that when neglected and weak contribute to back neck and knee pain  The workout should combat a desk jobs aches pain and fatigue Mr Verstegen says as well as teach clean and efficient movement patterns even to those of us who tend to be clumsy The exercises demand precision and over time should instill graceful athletic coordination Done correctly they should make you healthier stronger less prone to injury and athletically more capable As a whole the routine is also extremely scalable Mr Verstegen says People who are out of shape today may be able to complete only one or two reverse lunges with rotation during the  seconds of Exercise  But after several weeks of practice they may be able to perform five or more repetitions he says and can continue to intensify the routines physical demands by adding as many repetitions as possible in the time allotted It should be noted that the Minute Workouts the original and the advanced versions are not meant to be your sole exercise Any routine if thats all you do will become monotonous and demotivating Mr Verstegen says So mix up your workouts Perhaps alternate the old and the new sevenminute regimens over days or weeks Go for a run at lunch Join an over rugby league Buy a bike or a Speedo  use them together in a triathlon The idea is to develop a relationship and routine with your body Mr Verstegen says so that it feels strong and healthy and you feel energized and excited to be up and moving The New York Times is now offering a free mobile app for the popular Scientific Minute Workout and the new Advanced Minute Workout  The app offers a stepbystep guide to both minute workouts offering animated illustrations of the exercises as well as a timer and audio cues to help you get the most out of your seven minutes Go to   on your phone tablet or other device to try our new Web app  For more information on installing the app which can be used on an iOS Android or other device visit
