Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by breaking down important messagecarrying chemicals researchers reported Monday They found that children with autism have a very different makeup when it comes to gut germs compared to children without autism More importantly chemicals produced by these bacteria may affect the brain they told a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology Its a small study and needs to be replicated but the team at Arizona State University is seeking permission to try experimental fecal transplants to see if they might alter the symptoms of the children with autism Researchers are beginning to discover that the bacteria fungi and yeast living in an on our bodies called the microbiome are extremely important to health They can affect the bodys susceptibility to infection they can affect body weight and may even play a role in cancer Theres also some evidence they play a role in mental health and this study suggests perhaps they are important in developmental disorders DaeWook Kang of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University and colleagues tested  typical children and  with autism looking at the DNA from all the different species of microbes living in their colons They also looked at metabolites  the breakdown products  that have been linked with autism Most gut bacteria are beneficial aiding food digestion producing vitamins and protecting against harmful bacteria Kang said in a statement If left unchecked however harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body including the brain They found the children with autism had different types of gut bacteria and had less diversity in the numbers of different species of these bacteria than kids without autism And when they looked at the metabolites they found seven out of  were different in the children with autism Some are known to play a role as messagecarrying chemicals called neurotransmitters Most of the seven metabolites could play a role in the brain working as neurotransmitters or controlling neurotransmitter biosynthesis Kang said We suspect that gut microbes may alter levels of neurotransmitterrelated metabolites affecting guttobrain communication andor altering brain function For instance the children with autism says had lower levels of chemicals called homovanillate and NNdimethylglycine Homovanillate is made when with neurotransmitter dopamine is broken down while NNdimethylglycine is a component proteins and neurotransmitters NNdimethylglycine is also sometimes used as a dietary supplement to treat autism symptoms although its not been scientifically validated The next step is to try and see if changing the populations of gut bacteria affects symptoms We will try fecal transplants to children with autism Kang said We will try to administer fecal material from healthy people to children with autism That will require permission from several groups including the Food and Drug Administration Autism spectrum disorder can range from the relatively mild social awkwardness of Aspergers syndrome to profound mental retardation debilitating repetitive behaviors and an inability to communicate Theres no cure but experiments with   suggest it might be possible to help children overcome some difficulties Genetics   Autism runs strongly in families but genes dont explain it all Better diagnosis doesnt explain all of it either and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this documented a big jump among yearolds diagnosed with the disorder in a twoyear period to   children
