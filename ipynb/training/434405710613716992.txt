Twentyfive years ago two pals went out for a seafood dinner while vacationing in the Bahamas What could be better than some fresh grouper steaks and a night on the town without the wives Um plenty A few hours after dinner the men started having stomach pains and diarrhea Their legs began to tingle and burn And their sense of temperature went haywire Ice felt hot while fire felt cool All the while their wives were completely fine  until they had sex with their hubbies The men had ingested a potent fish toxin a team of doctors   at the time in the journal   And they had passed the poison along to their wives through their semen the doctors hypothesized For several weeks the women had terrible pain and burning in their pelvis With fish   to the US from all over the world the toxin has since appeared outside its endemic tropical regions  in Vermont North Carolina and   Some researchers are now worrying that   could make the poison even more common The toxin causes the strange foodborne illness known as   The molecules open little holes in nerves triggering an array of crazy symptoms reversal of how you experience temperature vertigo and the sensation that your teeth are falling out Patients find the symptoms of ciguatera so strange says neuropsychologist   who treats patients for the toxin at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami I have heard people say they wake up and step on a cold floor and have a burning or uncomfortable sensation And then theres   otherwise known as painful sex This symptom isnt commonly reported possibly because its information people dont normally volunteer to their doctors Friedman tells The Salt But since the two men in the Bahamas first reported a link between dyspareunia and ciguatera in  a few others have also had the unfortunate symptom For instance six of nine people who got the fish poisoning from eating   in North Carolina in  complained of painful intercourse the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   The Bahamas cases so far have been the only ones in which sexual transmission was suspected The toxin can also cause hallucinations or giddiness Friedman says if the fish came from the Pacific or Indian Oceans Although ciguatera is new to most people poisonings are fairly common in   Friedman says In South Florida ciguatera is considered endemic Its not foreign to our emergency rooms here The CDC says it gets reports of about  cases of poisoning by marine toxins including ciguatera each year in the US The ciguatoxin is produced by a singlecelled   that sticks to algae on tropical reefs The poison then moves up the food chain and eventually accumulates in large predator fish such as red snapper grouper amberjack and barracuda  species that also happen to be quite tasty Theres no cure for the poisoning One treatment can reduce the symptoms but it must be given within three days of ingestion Otherwise just a few bites from an infected filet and you may be stuck with the strange neurological problems  and a restrained sex life  for a few weeks Friedman says So what can you do avoid this nasty toxin Dont order the red snapper or grouper caught in areas associated with   she recommends You cant detect the toxin by smell or sight So you really dont know when youre eating it Plus you cant cook clean or freeze the toxin away from the fish Thats whats so frustrating about the illness she says It doesnt occur because of improper cooking storing or fish handling And when you do eat fin fish that hang around coral reefs Friedman says go for the smaller ones less than about  pounds Or eat a limited portion If you think you have ciguatera fish poisoning try to save a piece of the fish she adds Then you can send it into the Food and Drug Administration for testing At least then you might have a better chance of finding out if your dinner is to blame for an unwelcome interruption of your sex life
