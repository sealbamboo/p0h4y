One of the first people to volunteer for human testing of an experimental Ebola vaccine said the effort is his small contribution to the fight against a horrendous disease Nick Owen  manages content on the website for aid organization Doctors Without Borders And while he said hes participating in the British trial independent of his employer he said the work of his colleagues and other health workers in West Africa inspired him to help I was given a chance to in a very very small way to respond to this crisis Owen said Thursday I can play a very tiny cog in getting the vaccine out in the field He added I can play a part in protecting my colleagues The trial began Sept  and is being conducted at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford The vaccine was developed by drug firm GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institutes of Health The objective of this vaccine isnt to have it sold  its to have it deployed and used in a sort of emergency relief setting in the three afflicted countries in West Africa   Owen was given the vaccine on Oct  among the first in a trial that will eventually include  volunteers Hill said participants are closely monitored over a sixmonth period This observation phase includes physical exams blood tests and the assessment of any symptoms Owen said the side effects following the shot were minor I felt a lot worse from having a standard flu vaccine than the Ebola vaccine he said adding that the researchers are hoping to see results by the end of the month Polly Markandya  who has been working for Doctors Without Borders for more than  years got her shot Wednesday She referred to herself as a human guinea pig and said she agreed to participate in the clinical trial after seeing firsthand in Uganda how ravaging the disease can be Someone asked me about my motivation and I explained I know whats going on and anyone who knows whats going on would want to do something to help she said The Ebola outbreak has killed at least  people mostly in the African countries of Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea according to the latest  from the Word Health Organization Owen said his loved ones were worried about his participation in the trial but he feels reassured My family and friends think Im slightly crazy for wanting to do this My mom was a bit worried he said Its very safe I felt very reassured if the worst that could happen was the flu or having a sore arm On her part Markandya said she doesnt feel particularly brave for agreeing to participate in the trial Its just not that big a deal And if someone asked me to give a pint of blood to help Ebola of course you would do it she said
