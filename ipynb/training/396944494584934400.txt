Minnesotas new online health insurance marketplace MNsure has been open for about a month but getting the word out to hardtoreach populations is just ramping up Outreach efforts have been slow to start due to delays in training navigators and finalizing  s contracts with organizations who provide oneonone help One of the target populations to inform about the insurance options is Latinos who are   as white Minnesota residents to lack health insurance When you have questions about health insurance you may not necessarily think beauty salon but Clarence Jones does Barbershops and beauty shops are really one of the places where people come and they talk to trusted messengers he says Jones is outreach director for   one of the organizations thats   to provide the boots on the ground to explain what MNsure is about and how to sign up for coverage Jones says they know people are concerned about their health so we wanted to establish some kind of relationships with barber shops and beauty shops so that we can give them information on how to access medical care which is an issue in many communities On a recent Saturday Jones and about a halfdozen of his colleagues visited Karinas Beauty Salon in the heart of St Pauls Latino community They set up shop in a big white bus parked outside and squeezed into available niches in the salon to screen customers for health problems give flu shots and spread the word about MNsure They call it the clipper clinic The salons owner Karina Cardoso says  percent of her customers are Hispanic She says most are like her  selfemployed with no health insurance When I talk to the clients there is a huge thing now with Obamacare and I dont think that a lot of us know exactly what Obamacare is she says Southside Community Health Services worker Miguel Rivera is training to help people sign up for coverage He says confusion about the federal health care law is common among the people he sees Theyre totally confused Theres still a lot of information  the client has to get into it and navigate the system  but people can do it he says When the fivehour clipper clinic is over no one has signed up for health insurance On board the bus health worker Heidi Benson isnt discouraged She says up to  percent of Latino patients at Southsides health clinics are in the country illegally so even people who qualify for coverage may not sign up to protect an undocumented family member Benson says the clinic at Karinas is only the first step in a continuing conversation about MNsure I think it opens up the ability for the conversation to broaden she says so people whove been afraid or dont know what questions to ask when they hear more information start to understand that its OK to ask any questions  and hopefully get the answers that they need to go forward and take care of themselves Throughout the country about   are expected to qualify for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act Outreach through trusted networks in the community  like the beauty salon  is critical to help reach them says Mayra Alvarez who works in health policy for the federal Department of Health and Human Services I think thats why you see that this first openenrollment period is six months is to allow people the time to ask those questions to become familiar with the marketplace to make an educated decision about health insurance she says For a lot of people this is going to be the first time they have access to health insurance Alvarez says she hopes the Spanish version of HealthCaregov   will be open to accept enrollment in a few weeks
