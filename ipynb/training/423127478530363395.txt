DAVIS CALIF  Classical music played in the background as a team of surgeons leaned over Mischa who lay anesthetized on the table mouth wide open tongue lolling to the side all four legs in the air The owners of the yearold German shepherd had rushed her to the veterinary hospital at the University of California Davis after she ran in front of a small private plane and was clipped in the jaw by a propeller She was lucky She had only a nicked lip and a few   relatively minor wounds compared with many others that the veterinary surgeons Boaz Arzi and Frank Verstraete treat here As experts on maxillofacial reconstruction they have patched up pets with split heads mashedin faces disfiguring tumors dislocated jaws and in a recent highprofile case a dog whose entire snout and upper jaw were sheared off by a speeding motorcycle In the past many of these animals would have been euthanized Dr Verstraete said Now we can fix them A few months later Mischa was back to playing with the familys cats and gnawing on bones To look at her youd never know she was hit said her grateful owner Christy Taylor The only lingering consequence of her accident Mischa wont go near planes Pets like her are undergoing reconstructive surgeries as sophisticated as anything in human medicine joint replacements skin and bone grafts ligament repairs even therapeutic eyelifts for ingrown lashes and yes nose jobs  the last resort for snuffling shortnosed breeds like pugs and Persian cats That more and more pets are going under the knife stems partly from technological advances and the increasing presence of specialists in general practices It is also a consequence of the fact that pets are living longer Reaching  even in dog years raises the odds of   and other ailments that call for surgical treatment But veterinarians say the biggest driver is demand by pet owners Most now view their furry charges as members of the family  and are willing to spend accordingly More people are willing to lets face it pay more for specialized people like myself to fix their pets said Kevin McAbee a veterinary surgeon in Auburn Hills Mich Those treatments can bring four and even fivefigure tabs depending on the complexity of the problem and whether complications arise Since just  percent of Americans have pet insurance most end up covering the expenses themselves Christi Voelker a Philadelphiabased consultant and her husband spent  on a series of surgeries to treat a facial cancer afflicting Ace their yearold rescue dog Ace is basically our child said Ms Voelker  We decided instead of buying a new car wed put it into Ace Nearly  reconstructive techniques for animals were pioneered by Michael M Pavletic director of surgical services at Angell Animal Medical Center in Jamaica Plain Mass Many of them are outlined in his seminal text   Its a compendium of ways an animals life can go wrong full of advice on how to reattach severed paw pads apply grafts to a burn or repair a bullet wound These days reconstructive surgery on pets often involves procedures that would be difficult in humans For one thing its relatively easy to move around pieces of skin on dogs and cats To treat a greyhound whose thigh was shredded in an attack by other dogs Kat Ham a veterinary surgeon at Ohio State University once stretched a flap of skin from the dogs chest over the wounded area and then stitched up the area from which she had cut the flap It was successful though she said he now has nipples on his thigh Reconstructive techniques also have expanded the options for cancer treatments allowing surgeons to be much more aggressive Ace the Voelkers dog had a tumor below his eye Because these tend to be invasive John R Lewis a veterinary surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania removed tissue from much of Aces cheek and jaw in order to ensure he got all of the cancerous cells He then cut free a skin flap from Aces neck and rotated it to cover the hole hed created A second skinflap surgery was needed to close a large wound in the roof of Aces mouth Now  months later the only sign of Aces ordeal is that the fur on his cheek grows up toward his eyes rather than down Despite the increasing complexity animals that undergo reconstructive procedures often come out looking surprisingly good The fur covers a lot said Daniel Degner a veterinarian in Burton Mich Dr Arzi and Dr Verstraete are testing a variety of innovative techniques in facial reconstruction for animals Working with the schools bioengineers theyve developed a method to print D plastic models of patients skulls from twodimensional CT scans They use the models to plan surgeries which allows them to plot their moves with micronlevel accuracy said Kyriacos Athanasiou a professor of biomedical engineering at CaliforniaDavis They are also testing an experimental compound to stimulate bone growth called bone morphogenetic protein to treat animals with oral cancers or broken jaws While excising a lowerjaw tumor from Whiskey a yearold Munsterlander from San Francisco the surgeons removed seven centimeters of bone installed titanium plates to recreate the contour of the jaw and then filled the gap with a spongy scaffold infused with the BMP The protein grows bone really quickly Dr Arzi said Within two weeks you could feel hard tissue and within three months we saw on the   that it almost matched the density and porosity of the remaining jaw bone To date they have treated  dogs  and one bearded dragon lizard missing part of its lower jaw because of an old    with the compound It turned out to be a much simpler matter to treat the astonishing injury suffered by a dog in a Philippine village who threw herself at a motorcycle that was about to hit her owners niece and daughter Kabang saved the girls but the bike tore off her upper snout leaving a fistsize hole across the center of her face Her heroism   and she was brought to CaliforniaDavis for reconstructive surgery with the help of a fundraising campaign that raised more than  In a complicated fivehour operation in late March surgeons pulled skin flaps from the top and sides of her head together to close the wound and fashioned two holes to serve as nostrils She looks strange but dogs dont look in the mirror Dr Verstraete said On her return to the Philippines Kabang was welcomed with a motorcade through her hometown The technology may have advanced but many veterinary surgeons are reluctant to put animals through such arduous procedures unless there is a strong chance of success Although some vets leave it up to the pet owner Dr Lewis who operated on Ace says he sometimes turns owners away if an operation will buy their pets only a few more months of life Im looking for years rather than months of quality time he said Even devoted owners hesitate to subject pets to such intensive treatment We had to think about whether this was going to help him or whether it was just for us said Brad Voelker owner of Ace Though it would mean months of pain and aftercare the Voelkers decided it was in the dogs best interest because this gave him a strong chance of living another five years or so
