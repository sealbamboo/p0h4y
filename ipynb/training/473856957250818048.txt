DURHAM NC  Before scrubbing in on a recent Tuesday morning Dr Selene Parekh an orthopedic surgeon here at Duke Medical Center slipped on a pair of sleek black glasses  Google Glass the wearable computer with a builtin camera and monitor He gave the Internetconnected glasses a voice command to start recording and turned to the middleaged motorcycle crash victim on the operating table He chiseled through bone repaired a broken metatarsal and drilled a metal plate into the patients foot  has been using Glass since last year when Google began selling test versions of its device to thousands of handpicked explorers for  He now uses it to record and archive all of his surgeries at Duke and soon he will use it to stream live feeds of his operations to hospitals in India as a way to train and educate orthopedic surgeons there In India foot and ankle surgery is about  years behind where we are in the US he said So to be able to use Glass to broadcast this and have orthopedic surgeons around the world watch and learn from expert surgeons in the US would be tremendous At Duke and other hospitals a growing number of surgeons are using Google Glass to stream their operations online float medical images in their field of view and hold video consultations with colleagues as they operate Software developers too have created programs that transform the Glass projector into a medical dashboard that displays patient vital signs urgent lab results and surgical checklists Im sure were going to use this in medicine said Dr Oliver J Muensterer a pediatric surgeon who recently   Not the current version but a version in the future that is specially made for health care with all the privacy hardware and software issues worked out For his study published in The International Journal of Surgery Dr Muensterer wore the device daily for four weeks at Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital at Westchester Medical Center in New York He found that filming rapidly drains the battery and that the camera  which is mounted straight ahead  does not point directly at what he is looking at when he is hunched over a patient with his eyes tilted downward He also had to keep the device disconnected from the Internet most of the time to prevent patient data and images from being automatically uploaded to the cloud Once its on the cloud you dont know who has access to it Dr Muensterer said Google has yet to announce a release date for Glass and the company declined to comment on how many of its testers were doctors or affiliated with hospitals But demand is high said Nate Gross a cofounder of   a medical technology incubator I probably get asked every few days by another doctor who wants to somehow incorporate Glass into their practice And already outside hospitals privacy concerns have led some bars and restaurants to ban the devices Legislators have proposed restrictions on the use of Google Glass while driving citing concerns about distraction Doctors too are raising similar concerns The Glass projector is slightly above the users right eye allowing doctors to see medical information without turning away from patients But the display can also be used to see email and surf the web potentially allowing doctors to take multitasking to dangerous new levels said   at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has   Being able to see your laparoscopic images when youre operating face to face instead of looking across the room at a projection screen is just mindbogglingly fantastic he said But the downside is you dont want that same surgeon interacting with social media while hes operating Indeed similar technology has not always had the smoothest results Studies have found for example that navigational displays can help surgeons find tumors but they can also induce a form of tunnel vision or perceptual blindness that makes them more likely to miss unrelated lesions or problems in surrounding tissue And in aviation pilots who wear headmounted displays that show crucial flight information can lose sight of what is happening outside their windshields said     at Wright State University Pilots can get so focused on aligning the icons that help them land the plane she said that they miss another plane that is crossing the runway One doctor who does not allow the device in his practice   the medical director of radiation oncology at Lowell General Hospital in Massachusetts said that security and distractions were primary concerns A doctor wearing Glass could accidentally stream confidential medical information online he said and patients might not feel comfortable with their doctors wearing cameras on their faces Until Glass has been better studied in health care and equipped with safeguards Dr Katz said doctors should be forced to check their wearable computers at the clinic door From an ethical standpoint the bar is higher for use in a medical setting said Dr Katz who is also an outside adviser for the   As a doctor I have to make sure that what Im doing is safe and secure for my patients  First do no harm Until I am I dont want it in my practice Bakul Patel the senior policy adviser at the Food and Drug Administrations Center for Devices said the agency would regulate only those Glass software programs that function as medical devices the same approach it takes on health applications on handheld devices The glasses have been on our radar and were excited about it Mr Patel said Hospitals that are experimenting with Glass say they are doing so very carefully  obtaining patient consent before procedures using encrypted networks and complying with the federal regulation that protects patient privacy known as   Medical software developers say they too have security and privacy in mind Pristine a company based in Austin Tex created   for consultations The company plans to sell a customized version of Glass directly to hospitals It erases Googles software and configures the glasses with its own Hipaacompliant programs 
 Another company   which has done pilot tests of Glass at medical centers in the San Francisco area said patients were informed that their doctors would be wearing the device In a study of  cases only two or three patients asked that their doctors remove it said Ian K Shakil a cofounder of Augmedix Some hospitals see Glass as a relatively lowcost and versatile innovation much like smartphones and tablets which more than half of all health care providers use to get access to patient data and other medical information But handheld devices are not very useful in the sterile world of surgery Because Glass is voiceactivated and handsfree it may be particularly well suited for the surgical suite where cameraguided instruments robotics and D navigation systems have been commonplace for years  a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of California San Francisco calls wearable computers a game changer In surgery Google Glass is incredibly illuminating said Dr Theodore who uses Glass to float Xrays and CT scans in his field of view at the operating table It helps you pinpoint what youre looking for so you dont have to shift your attention away from the operation to look at a monitor somewhere else At Indiana University Health Dr Paul P Szotek a Level  trauma surgeon is developing an app for Glass for use by paramedics The app streams a live feed from the glasses to the closest emergency rooms so that doctors can see accident victims at the scene and give paramedics potentially lifesaving instructions  like when to go directly to a Level  trauma center Last year I lost a lady on the table from a spleen injury that was absolutely survivable because she was taken to a local hospital and then the delay was over two hours to get her to me Dr Szotek said With this wearable technology well be able to assess patients on the scene and decrease the mortality associated with trauma significantly Dr Szotek met with Google in March to discuss his software called st Sight He and other Glasswearing surgeons recently founded a group  the    that is holding its first meeting in Indianapolis in July At Duke Dr Parekh performs backtoback surgeries on most days wearing the Glass headset as he moves from one patient to the next About six years ago he founded a charity with the goal of advancing foot and ankle surgery in India He travels there every year with a team of expert surgeons to hold clinics and training sessions for local orthopedic surgeons In January at a conference in Jaipur Dr Parekh performed surgery and used Glass to stream the procedure on   That day the site drew in so many visitors from India and elsewhere that it crashed Ive been even more excited about Google Glass since then he said
