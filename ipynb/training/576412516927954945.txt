Some researchers have disputed that microbes have swapped genes with the cells of complex animals such as humans But   indicates it has probably happened a lot Humans may have as many as hundreds of socalled foreign genes they picked up from microbes Surprisingly far from being a rare occurrence it appears that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution of many perhaps all animals and that the process is ongoing meaning that we may need to reevaluate how we think about evolution Crisp said That may not surprise microbiologists We humans and other complex animals are full of microbes gajillions of them People have so many that microbe cells living in our bodies outnumber our own vastly  A body has about  trillion human cells says microbiologist Rob Knight The microbe cells living inside of us number around  trillion Thats a ratio of  to one The biggest collection is in our gut Theyre mostly helpful and we wed have a hard time living without them  Their genetic material dwarfs ours The human genome adds up to  genes The collective genomes of the many varieties of microbes in our bodies adds up to between  million and  million Knight says Its no wonder that some them probably have been seeping into our DNA over millions of years It has helped diversify our evolution the Cambridge researchers say In recent decades scientists laid down genomes  a detailed description of gene sequences  for all kinds of species including humans The Cambridge researchers compared the genomes of various species of fruit flies worms and primates including humans  They calculated similarities and differences between the genes across those species to look for ones that stuck out as not being part of a smooth evolutionary lineage but instead probably popped in at some point  They found  formerly unidentified foreign genes in humans and confirmed  that had previously been reported Most of them play a role in digestion  But the scientists also found that the gene that determines blood types  A B and O  is foreign Some foreign genes that transferred in from microbes help our bodies immune systems defend against microbial infections like bacteria and fungi  The researchers said there may be an obscure chance that the foreign genes got into our DNA a result of evolutionary happenstance but they also said theirs is the most logical and likely explanation The microbes did it
