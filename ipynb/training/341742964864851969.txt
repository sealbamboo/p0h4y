Mississippi lawmakers have embarked on a controversial campaign to discourage older men from having sex with teenagers Starting in July doctors and midwives in the state will be required by law to collect samples of umbilical cord blood from babies born to some girls under the age of  Officials will analyze the samples and try to identify the fathers through matches in the states DNA database It is our hope that we can deter men over the age of  from having sex particularly with girls  years and younger particularly if they know we are going to pursue them said   the states Democratic attorney general who helped draft the bill Officials said Mississippi is the first state in the country to try the approach Gov Phil Bryant a Republican is also a supporter of the effort Previously a deputy sheriff   said its necessary to protect young women who might be victimized by older men even if the teenagers say they consented to having sex Too many of these young teens are becoming pregnant against their will he said It is a tragedy that I think has been accepted over the years where people say the young girl agreed to it so we have to accept it And that has got to stop he said State statutory rape law applies if the two people are more than three years apart in age until the girl is  the age of consent in Mississippi For example if the mother is  and the father is  even if sex is consensual its considered rape in the state The bill doesnt explain who would prosecute the men if they are located and are believed to have broken the law but prosecutors would have to determine in which county conception had occurred before charges could be filed It also isnt clear what age range prosecutors will target The law also doesnt lay out who is going to pay for testing Regulations about implementation are still being drafted Republican state Rep   who drafted the bill said one of his motivations is to find who harmed that child because these new mothers often refuse to name the father of their child The bill is a solution looking for a problem according to Jamie HolcombBardwell director of programs for the   an advocacy and funding group on womens issues Few teen pregnancies involve very young girls and much older men she said It is a lot easier for politicians to talk about protecting young women than it is for them to talk about adequate sex education access to contraception looking at multigenerational poverty making sure we have an adequately funded education system she said All of these things have been shown to decrease the teen pregnancy rate While Mississippis teen pregnancy rate is about  percent above the national average it is near a year low Of the  births to teenagers in   were babies born to girls under the age of  Roughly  percent of teenage pregnancies in the state occur between teens who are one or two years apart in age The state medical association reluctantly accepted the law but insisted that lawmakers remove a provision in the early version of the bill that levied penalties against doctors who dont comply But   a constitutional law professor at the Mississippi College law school in Jackson said the measure could raise a hornets nest of legal problems It is not at all clear that the legislature can deputize health care workers to collect evidence without a warrant he said
