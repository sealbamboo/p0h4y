As far back as he can remember George McCann lived in fear When he was asleep he would have horrific nightmares filled with violent images When he was awake he often felt threatened by people including members of his own family And when he felt threatened he would become aggressive even violent George spent his childhood certain that something very bad was going to happen And when he was  it did His unrelenting fears led to a violent outburst at school And George landed in a psychiatric hospital It was a frightening place for a fearful kid When staff members tried to restrain him during a confrontation he fought as if his life were at stake George was big and strong for his age But it was no contest I was strapped down at the ankles across the chest and at my wrists he says And they put me into the room with padded walls you know I remember screaming and screaming and screaming Today George is  and back at home with his parents two younger siblings and a dog named Tressel They live in a small singlestory house within commuting distance of Manhattan When George answers the door its clear hes grown into a big sturdy guy He wears rimless glasses and slightly rumpled clothes His handshake is surprisingly gentle Georges passion is movies which   on his blog He has even written a couple of scripts One is a Western Its about redemption and whether people can find it or not he says Sitting on the living room couch with his mother Cydney McCann George explains how his own redemption came in the form of an inquisitive psychiatrist and the experimental use of a drug called ketamine Georges struggles with fear and rage started before he could talk His mother realized early on that her son was nothing like his cousin the same age I remember when they turned  my sisterinlaw saying to me Oh isnt  great Theyre so cooperative she says And I remember saying No not here  Georges tantrums were extreme A simple no could touch off hours of screaming and biting and kicking Cydney says Her sons anxieties were also extreme By the time he went into kindergarten he was so nervous about everything she says He would be afraid to get on the bus He was afraid of the bus driver He was afraid of the school He couldnt go to peoples houses He couldnt have a play date At home his tantrums grew into rages Cydney says Then once the episode was over her son would apologize and feel intense shame and guilt She realized just how desperate he had become one day when he was  I found him in his room and he had tried to hang himself by the curtain rod she says He took a scarf and tied it on the curtain rod and had tied it around his neck and tried to hang himself Cydney began taking her son to psychologists and psychiatrists They told her he had obsessive compulsive disorder and ADHD Eventually during his stay in the psychiatric hospital at age  he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder All the diagnoses came with drugs Zoloft Paxil Ritalin I remember a lot of pills with different colors George says But they didnt make him much better And some made him worse Cydney McCann remembers trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy by having the whole family including George sit down together for dinner But something always happened she says Either he would fly off in a rage and leave the table or one of the other kids would get upset and get scared and leave the table or get mad and leave the table We literally never completed a meal By the time George was a teenager hed become the patient of   a psychiatrist who was studying kids with similar problems Papolos is director of research at the   and a researcher at the   Hes also the author of   Papolos believes children like George have a subtype of bipolar disorder that he calls the fear of harm profile Thats a controversial idea The mental health world is debating which children should even be called bipolar And theres no consensus on what to call kids like George McCann But Papolos says studies suggest there are hundreds of thousands of them  though many have milder symptoms than George There are several core characteristics of these children Papolos says One is a variety of sleep disturbances including frequent and terrifying nightmares Theyre all about pursuit or abandonment he says Some animal chasing them A shark biting into their leg and they feel the blood and the pain George McCann had a lot of dreams like that including one in which his father survived a terrible car accident only to be shot dead Another characteristic of kids like George Papolos says is an extreme reaction when anyone tries to control their behavior They may very well be very aggressive particularly at home and particularly where theres any limitsetting because limitsetting is experienced as a threat to them he says Theyre functioning on a very primitive fightorflight level When these kids do become violent its not premeditated Papolos says Theyre not potential mass killers Theyre responding the way an animal might defending its territory That certainly described George as a child says Cydney McCann The reaction would be like an instantaneous thing she says George describes his response as zero to  in a millisecond But after such an episode is over these children can be sweet and loving Papolos says Theres one more characteristic of the fear of harm profile thats not about behavior at all These children   Papolos says especially at night Once again George McCann fits the profile He says he often put an ice pack on his head to help him get to sleep After studies showed that these children seemed to be a distinct group Papolos began wondering whether there might be a better way to treat them He knew the usual drugs for depression and anxiety and mania werent enough So he began looking for a medicine that could reduce fear and simultaneously lower body temperature And lo and behold there were animal studies showing that ketamine did just that he says Ketamine is approved as an anesthetic Its also a club drug that can cause outofbody experiences And research in the past few years shows that ketamine   often in   Papolos thought it just might help the fearful children he was studying He had a particular child in mind a yearold girl who had severe nightmares night terrors separation anxiety and psychotic symptoms And by chance this little girl was scheduled for a dental procedure that can be done using an inhaled form of ketamine as the anesthetic She got ketamine and for two weeks she was completely asymptomatic Papolos says We had never seen anything like it before That was five years ago Today the girl is still taking ketamine and is still free of symptoms Papolos says After a number of   Papolos discussed the drug with George and Cydney McCann By this time George was in high school and his moods were less extreme But fear still dominated his life He was terrified by subway rides He was too frightened to drive a car So when Papolos offered the drug Cydney McCann wanted George to try it She didnt want the disorder that had shaped her sons childhood to hold him back as an adult But George who still lived in fear of so many things was afraid to try the new drug Im going to become some kind of addict he remembers thinking Im going to die the first time I take this Its going to change who I am But in  George did try Papolos ketamine treatment He says hell remember the day for the rest of his life I think we did two puffs and I remember I sat up and I just started laughing he says Then his mother picks up the story You said you had an internal feeling of calm that you had never had before in your life And when we came home that night that was the first night that we ever all had dinner at the table without somebody leaving Papolos has treated about  young people with ketamine so far and says all but two have had dramatic responses Interestingly he says the two whose behavior did not change were also the only patients whose overheating problems werent helped by the drug Its a surprising and provocative result But the research is still in its very early stages The number of patients treated so far is small and the approach is so new it hasnt been tested by other researchers yet Papolos says hes hoping a   will help persuade other researchers to try the drug on other children In the meantime George McCann continues to inhale a prescribed dose of ketamine every third day The fear and anger that once dominated his life are gone he says adding that his mind is free now to work on that movie script about redemption
