A large review of available data has confirmed what many experts have long suspected Taking small amounts of aspirin over long periods of time reduces the risk of colon cancer and certain other cancers British researchers gathered evidence from six published systematic reviews and four individual studies with data on longterm aspirin use in people   to  The analysis   found strong evidence that aspirin reduced the risk for colorectal cancer and good evidence that it also reduced the risk for esophageal and stomach cancers There were smaller or more variable effects for protection against breast prostate and lung cancers They also found that longterm use was required In controlled trials there was no benefit until at least three years of use and mortality was reduced only after five years A baby aspirin of  to  milligrams was sufficient and there was no evidence that larger doses provided added benefit  Gastrointestinal bleeding was a common and serious side effect and the risk increases with age But there was clear evidence that the benefits vastly outweigh the side effects said the lead author Dr Jack Cuzick the director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Queen Mary University of London People should talk to their doctors to make sure theres no risk of bleeding but the evidence is that everyone between  and  should consider aspirin
