 Although most people would prefer to die peacefully in a comfortable setting a new study shows that almost one in three spend some time in the intensivecare unit of a hospital in their last month of life while a similar number only get hospice care a few days before dying And  percent of those late hospice care referrals come right after an ICU stay the researchers noted People end up with these very short stays in hospice care said study author Dr Joan Teno a professor of health services policy and practice at Brown Universitys Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence RI Those short stays are difficult on the patients and the families They dont benefit from hospices psychosocial support for patients and their families Another expert put it this way I think what has happened is that were using hospice care as a last resort Its something we do when people have gotten so bad that they cant respond to any possible intervention said Dr Mary Tinetti chief of geriatrics and professor of internal medicine and public health at the Yale University School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital Hospice care should be used as a treatment for those who are focused on quality of life said Tinetti who is also the coauthor of an editorial accompanying the study Some people are going to want to access to palliative care earlier in the process The findings were published in the Feb  issue of the   The study reviewed a random sample of  percent of feeforservice Medicare beneficiaries who died in   and  Each year fewer people died in the hospital according to the study In   percent died in the hospital In   percent died under hospital care and  percent did so in  At the same time however the use of the intensivecare unit in the last month of life increased for each time period In   percent of people were in the ICU in their last month By  that number was  percent and in  it had risen to  percent During that same period the use of hospice care also increased significantly In   percent of people received hospice care at the time of their death That number was  percent in  and  percent in  In  however  percent of hospice care was for three days or less according to the study And  percent of those short hospice stays came on the heels of an ICU stay This was not what I expected to see Teno said Weve done a good job improving the numbers of people receiving hospice care but the pattern of care we see in this study suggests that hospice has become an addon treatment to aggressive care Teno said there is a complex set of reasons why this is occurring One reason can be a sudden change in health status that doesnt leave people time to prepare Another reason is that people are referred late to hospice care Patients may not understand their prognosis she said and they may have never had a discussion with their doctor about what is important to them Another issue is the way services are reimbursed There is no question that ICU care and ICU doctors are reimbursed for their services But Medicare doesnt pay for primarycare doctors or specialists to sit down with their patients and have discussions about endoflife care Teno said this type of care was initially included in the Affordable Care Act but was removed during political negotiations when the bill was making its way through Congress The study also found that people with some conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema were less likely to get hospice care than someone who had cancer Both Teno and Tinetti said the findings show that you need to advocate for yourself or your loved ones Ask the doctor what the prognosis is If its your parent or spouse talk to them about whats truly important to them Do they want every measure to be taken or do they want to just be as comfortable as possible at the end of their lives Often the best way to get your loved ones wishes honored is to get hospice care Teno said Tinetti added that there should be standards put into place for who receives ICU care Why do we have to fill out  pages of forms to get hospice care or a skilled nursing facility but not for ICU she said We need to start proactively thinking about ICU care and what role it plays in the care of the critically ill
