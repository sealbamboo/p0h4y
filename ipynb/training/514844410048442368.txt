Many health supplement companies and some medical experts have recommended vitamin E and selenium for reducing the risk for cataracts But a large new study has found they are unlikely to provide benefit though selenium might have a small effect Researchers randomly assigned  men over  to four groups of about  each Members of one group took a daily placebo those in the second took  IU of vitamin E daily those in a third took  micrograms of selenium a day and those in the fourth group took both vitamin E and selenium The fiveyear study   found  confirmed cataracts  in those who took vitamin E  in those who took both supplements  in those who took only selenium and  in the placebo group None of the differences was statistically significant though selenium showed a trend that suggests it might have a slight benefit additional research would be needed The results are consistent with earlier trials of vitamin E said the lead author William G Christen an associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston They show that for cataracts the effect is nothing But he added These are the first data on selenium alone and we cant rule out a small but still important effect
