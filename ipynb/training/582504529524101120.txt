If youre delaying your walking program to save up for a wearable fitness tracker the ruse is over A free app on your smartphone can do the job about as well as some popular wearable devices a new study has found On average steps counted with free apps strayed only slightly from observed counts and were comparable or better than those tallied by the devices according to the   published online Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn Still just about all of the tracking methods proved accurate enough for the average person looking for feedback on exercise said study coauthor Dr Mitesh Patel of the University of Pennsylvanias   at the Leonard Davis Institute I think the takeaway was that theyre all pretty accurate Patel said With the exception of one wearable device that was  lower than average the rest of them were pretty close to the mean We think for the purposes of the average person who just want to track their steps all of these for the most part will do Researchers got  students on the University of Pennsylvania campus to walk a treadmill set for  miles per hour for  and  steps They did each trial twice with two smartphones an iPhone s and Galaxy S in their pockets three wearable devices on their wrists and three other devices on their waistbands On average the appbased counters were closer to the mark than the worn devices but there were differences in reliability across the  trials The study did not rank the devices nor   they track such as calories consumed Fitbits One and Zip models were most consistently close to the observed count while the Yamax DigiWalker SW was on par with them with slightly more variability across trials according to the study The Jawbone UP and Fitbit Flex came in slightly below the average count and varied more than the apps across trials while the Nike Fuelband was  off the average and had the widest variation across trials according to the data Fitness devices are far less common than smartphones which now are the preferred device for two thirds of US cellphone users A recent   estimated about one in five US consumers has purchased a fitness tracker while only about half of them wore it daily The device alone may be enough to get some people on their feet but most will need more motivation to stick with a fitness program said Patel who studies behavioral changes In terms of actually changing peoples behavior there needs to be more than just using the device he said We have to be able to pair these devices with effective engagement strategies that help people to build new habits and use effective feedback loops
