My first tic was to shake my head violently I was in karate class and I was shaking violently All of a sudden I just started to notice that the teacher was looking at me and all the kids were wondering what I was doing I suddenly felt really strange  It was the experience of knowing that youre doing something and that you have to do it Its impossible to stop and thats very unnerving no matter what age you are Youre scared youre interested youre wondering What is this thats happening to me  I think as with anything that comes about healthwise its always going to be sort of scary and interesting at the same time Did you ever experience any violent tics where you hurt yourself of someone around you Ive have a number of violent tics With Tourette syndrome theres not just compulsive actions but compulsive thoughts as well That used to scare my mother a lot  Ive done everything from having to slap my butt or kick my own face  You know I had this tic where I touch my mouth to my knee and Im always screwing up my back Ive had two shoulder surgeries My doctor just smiles and laughs at me I probably am going to need another one because when they do the surgery they say the one thing you cant do is this reaches arm behind back to touch the top of his back Thats one of my biggest tics As you started auditioning for bigger and bigger roles did you try to hide your Tourettes from the casting directors and producers Its funny you should ask that question When I auditioned when I was younger I definitely hid it In fact I hid it from the Hollywood world as much as I could until probably my mids  Im not sure if that was a conscious effort but it was just what I did growing up It was better for me to cope that way Id just keep it bottled up then go somewhere else and have an outburst  Auditioning is one of the most nerveracking things you could ever do but you have to be so focused that you dont tic Watching you act its almost impossible to pick up on any of your ticing How are you able to keep it under wraps while filming your scenes This is a very old debate and I dont think it should be a debate but it is  People believe that if you can shut your Tourettes off for a period of time then you can always shut it off I try to explain to people that if I spent my whole life trying to control my tics thats all I would have time for  If I can just accept it and tic when I want to and have my passion project  what Im mentally physically emotionally invested in something  where youre fully focused and your body ports and mind are all moving toward this one goal youre focused and you can shut it off but only for a certain period of time Then you have to let loose  I think thats what its like for most people who let loose in other ways doing different things  But to the skeptics I would say I just wish you could walk in my shoes just for an hour to know what it feels like to have the greatest itch youve ever had and multiply that by a thousand Theres no way you cant scratch it Its impossible You have to do it  Some people unfortunately dont believe that and to them I would say Step into my shoes for a day Youve teamed up with a foundation called Jaylens Challenge to visit schools and educate kids about Tourettes and bullying Why is your work with Jaylen so important to you You know when we do these presentations there are some kids that probably tune it out but you can also see there are a bunch of kids who really get it  When I see that one kid that really gets it you see the light in their eye  they identify with Jaylen At one point in their life they have either been the bully or been bullied They look at themselves in the mirror and theyre at an age where theyre starting to learn about their own consciousness  If just one kid leaves with that much more confidence willing to talk to one more person willing to take that shot to stop a bully in his or her tracks If I see just one kid with a little sparkle in their eye having learned something that means the world to me
