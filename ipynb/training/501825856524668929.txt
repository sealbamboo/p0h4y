Rachel Swinehart has commandeered her familys living room in Cedar Rapids Iowa Its filled with large plastic tubs containing stuff like pink bedding and a coffee maker Rachel  is about to head off to Shenandoah College a small arts school in Virginia where shell study harp performance In many ways organizing her stuff is the easy part Talking about the risks of college life  thats a bit harder In recent months colleges across the country have been facing increased scrutiny over their handling of safety issues such as sexual assault And statistically speaking freshmen and sophomores are particularly at risk of becoming victims Rachels mother Robyn Swinehart has spoken with her daughter about   things Yes youre of legal age Yes youre a big girl now Robyn says But you still have to be aware of when bad things can occur and be conscious of what could happen One thing stuck with me from both my parents its like  you cant really trust anyone fully Rachel said So just be careful of who you know and who you make friends with Rachel and Robyn have talked about peer pressure and sex but they havent talked explicitly about sexual assault Neither has the Reilly family In Berkeley Calif Erin Reilly is getting ready for her freshman year at Kalamazoo College in Michigan Her parents Gail and Dennis have talked to her about partying Be careful about drinking they say Dont get a drink from someone else But Erin  is shy So while her parents want their daughter to be aware of sexual assault they dont want to scare her away from making new friends including boys I tell her that there are nice guys in this world says Dennis and usually theyre the ones that dont have a date As far as talking about sexual assault though Erin says her parents have barely grazed it Thats one thing I might be relying more on the college orientation helping them through and giving them some guidelines and things to look out for says Gail Just a few miles away in Oakland Oneida Cordova has been talking openly about sexual assault with her daughter Onaja Waki for years Onaja is heading up north to Humboldt State University Ive been getting advice from my parents my aunt friends  making sure I stay safe Onaja says Oneida tells her daughter that if she sees something going on she is supposed to report it Or you are just as guilty as the person who has done it she says And If I find out youre not doing that Im going to hold you responsible And if Onaja herself is assaulted Oneida says the rule is to call her first You must warn boys I did not come here to be assaulted and attacked and violated  she says It already seems hard to imagine your kid being violated and very few parents I talked to had investigated their childs schools policy on handling sexual assault Talking with their kids about not becoming a perpetrator seems even harder  but some families   having that conversation Ill always try to keep a clear head make the right decisions and not be afraid to help someone around me whether or not it has anything to do with me says Rae Dallett  About to be a freshman at the University of California Los Angeles hes reassuring his mother hell do the right thing His mother Cassandra tells Rae that its no excuse if a girl is drunk and it doesnt matter how shes behaving And he may hear all kinds of justifications while at school she tells him I think what concerns me the most is not falling into that group mentality she says Like Oh shes a slut or She came wearing a short skirt or She already had sex with one of the guys therefore its OK if everybody does None of that is OK and acceptable Cassandra tells her son You have to treat every single woman that you encounter like thats your mom your sister You dont have to worry about me not trying my best to keep other people out of that situation  and keeping myself out of any kind of situation like that Rae says Im also heading to college at The New School in New York City all the way across the country from my home in Oakland and all these conversations had me thinking about my own family Weve always talked openly about sex and consent One time when my brother was younger he even asked our mom How you know when its OK to kiss somebody Her solution Ask Its really easy Can I kiss you  she said It can be really sexy and hot It doesnt have to be weird You can put it into your game And even though Im gay and my twin brother is straight she tells us the same thing If you cannot talk about sex you should not have it If you cant have a conversation with someone that youre about to have sex with that is an indication that you should not be intimate physically she says Got it Mom Its awkward talking about sex with your parents  and sexual assault is way more complicated But with awareness of the issue increasing these conversations may soon show up on more parents checklists as they get their kids ready for school
