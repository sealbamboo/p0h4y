Many mothers and newborns are dying because of a lack of sanitation safe water and hygiene while giving birth leading health experts have warned  They say the lack of such basic facilities is hindering the success of other interventions to improve the health of newborn babies They have called on governments and agencies to focus more on the link between sanitation and saving lives Their report has been published in the scientific journal PLOS Medicine It has been drawn up by experts from the charity WaterAid the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine the World Health Organization and other global health bodies They say that while the importance of hygiene  for example hand washing  is being recognised in some places much less consideration is given to the complete package of safe water hygiene and sanitation In some cases sanitation  toilets and facilities to dispose of waste  is being ignored    Nearly  of health facilities in  lowincome countries do not have reliable clean water according to the World Health Organization The report suggests that many efforts to improve newborn health focus on specific measures sometimes at the expense of these basic facilities  And it argues that the lack of ways to dispose of waste safely could hamper the success of other interventions The experts behind the report say governments and agencies should pay much greater attention to the link between sanitation and saving mothers and babies lives  Yael Velleman at WaterAid said We have known since Victorian times about the importance of clean water and good hygiene at birth  Yet today tens of thousands of mothers will be giving birth in places where doctors and midwives if present do not have access to clean water  The process of giving life should not mean unduly risking death As governments work to help women and their babies survive childbirth they must not neglect these basic building blocks of health care A study in the same journal reveals fewer than a third of births in Tanzania occur in places with safe water and basic sanitation  In  one in every  women in the country faced dying in childbirth Lenka Benova of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said Nearly  women in Tanzania die each year in or immediately after childbirth  This situation is not limited to Tanzania What is frustrating is we know infectionrelated deaths are preventable with the addition of clean water basic toilets and good hygiene practice  Our hope is these findings will guide future work on UN development goals and make the provision of these services a priority when trying to improve the health of new mothers and their babies
