A Hertfordshire villages parish council has agreed to turn off a churchs chimes at night to settle a row over sleep disturbance Complaints about the bells of St Marys in Ashwell chiming every  minutes were investigated by North Herts District Council NHDC It decided they were prejudicial to health Save the Bells campaigners said the majority of villagers wanted to keep the chimes sounding None of the complainants could be reached for comment The St Marys bells which chime through its clock mechanism have been ringing since about  but stopped for  months while repairs were carried out They were fixed in June  Some residents believe the complainants moved to the village when the bells were silent In   and was legally obliged to investigate the issue The council hoped the matter could be resolved within the community without formal action Parish council chairman Peter Long said it took the decision to silence them between  and  because the council would issue a noise abatement notice if we didnt Then we would probably have to appeal and we wanted to avoid wasting public money in a legal procedure he said Mr Long added that while the complainants were outnumbered by those who wanted the chimes to stay the majority of villagers arent bothered It has now asked the archdiocese in St Albans if it can install a timing mechanism and has launched an appeal to raise the  cost Welcoming the decision NHDC said it wanted to encourage its implementation without delay Councillor Bernard Lovewell said The council is not proposing to take any formal enforcement action at this time but we are keeping a watching brief on developments But Chris Pack from Save the Bells said the parish council had been pressurised into a decision They say they are pleased there is an agreement but it is not a compromise because turning the chimes off at night what was wanted in the first place he said The parish council is now going to carry out a survey in January to get down on paper what the views are he added We are now going to campaign stronger to overturn the parish councils decision because they have just taken the approach forced on them by NHDC he said
