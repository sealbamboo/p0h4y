Not all viruses are bad for us Some of them might even help up us fight off bacterial infections someday Naturally occurring viruses called bacteriophages attack specific types of bacteria So researchers at the University of Leicester decided to try and take advantage of phages bacteriadestroying powers to treat infections with   a germ that that can cause severe diarrhea and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract Over the last six years microbiologist   has isolated hundreds of phages that can kill various strains of   Now her lab has teamed up with the pharmaceutical company AmpliPhi to try and turn phages into a product perhaps a pill that could be used in humans Theres no guarantee the approach will work and so far it hasnt been put to a rigorous test in humans infected with   Still there are some good reasons to check it out  is difficult to treat with antibiotics and is resistant to many of them Another problem is that the germ often strikes when people take antibiotics to treat other infections The antibiotics kill good bacteria along with the bad weakening the guts defenses against   Doctors are using fecal transplants and   as possible solutions But Clokie says that phages could be a useful alternative Were simply harnessing the natural enemy of the bacteria she tells Shots Unlike bacteria Clokie says phages are very specific about what they attackright down to the subspecies In fact a single phage wouldnt be able to take on all the strains of   So Clokie is working to develop a cocktail of viruses that would be able to kill the most common strains While the bacteria can evolve and try to outsmart the viruses the viruses can do the same Clokie says Theyve been involved in this arms race for thousands of years As long as they can come up with the right cocktail theres a very good chance that this phage therapy could work according to   an associate professor of bioengineering at MIT If you know what you want to kill its kind of like a silver bullet targeting that bacteria he tells Shots And delivering the phages to a persons gut shouldnt be a challenge Lu says Phages are already   for use in meat and poultry production Manufacturers sometimes spray food with phages that target   a common foodborne bacterium But using phage therapy in humans is a bit more complicated Phages were discovered before antibiotics came around Lu says And theyve been used in humans he says But the problem is they have yet to be tested in wellcontrolled clinical trials Theres also the question of intellectual property Phages are naturally occurring and therefore theyre difficult to patent which could discourage pharmaceutical companies Ultimately Lu says The science is real The stuff does work But he says Its a change in the way we think about treating infections I think thats the biggest hurdle in a way
