Hello, everyone, and how are you today? A shiny and unusually warm sun is hovering this morning over the Pharmalot campus, where we are brewing a few cups of stimulation and urging the officials mascots to settle in for a long snooze. We hope to join them any day now. Alas, there is work to be done. Most likely, you can relate, despite the holiday spirit. So as always, here are a few tidbits to help you along. Let us know if we missed anything. Meanwhile, have a smashing day and drop us a line if you hear something you would like to share…. Looking to boost growth after its proposed sale to AbbVie collapsed, Shire is considering a bid for NPS Pharmaceuticals; Amgen is charging $178,000 for a standard course of its new Blincyto leukemia drug, continuing a trend of high prices for immunotherapies; in the past few years, signs of fraud in the peer-reviewed literature have cropped across the scientific publishing world, including those owned by publishing powerhouses; and AbbVie is hoping the FDA will approve its hepatitis C treatment this month.
