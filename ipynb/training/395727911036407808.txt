New York's City Council on Wednesday voted to raise the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and electronic-vapor cigarettes to 21 from the current 18 years, adopting one of the nation's toughest such restrictions.. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has pushed for anti-tobacco measures, has said he will sign the law.. "This will literally save many, many lives," said City Councilman James Gennaro, the bill's sponsor, whose parents both died from tobacco-related illnesses. "I've lived with it, I've seen it...but I feel good today."
