A longrunning court case set to be heard in the Court of Appeal has reignited the debate over drinking while pregnant  and whether doing so to excess should be considered a crime  A council  which cannot be named for legal reasons but is located somewhere in the northwest of England  is set to argue that a child who was born with serious health defects as a result of her mothers drinking habits should be given a compensation payout for being the victim of a crime The case was given permission by the upper tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber on Tuesday to be heard in the Court of Appeal The child who also cannot be named was diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome FAS at birth She is now six years old and living with foster parents  Her mother has never been convicted of any offence but during an earlier tribunal hearing she was alleged to have maliciously administered poison so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm  a crime under section  of the Offences Against the Person Act    Health experts say only regular alcohol intake would result in babies being born with FAS which can cause facial deformities problems with physical and emotional development and poor memory or a short attention span The case has sparked a wider debate about the ethics of potentially criminalising pregnant women who turn to drink Susan Fleisher adopted a threeyearold girl who she later learned was suffering from FAS and has since set up a charity  the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome UK  to help people deal with the condition   The yearold whose daughter Addie is now  believes drinking while pregnant should never be considered a crime  No mother deliberately holds a gun to their childs head Mrs Fleisher said  I knew something was wrong with Addie when I couldnt find a bicycle helmet to fit her head It was much smaller than the average size and I had to put padding inside the helmet to make it fit It was after this that I took her to the hospital and sure enough she was diagnosed with the syndrome Mrs Fleisher believes the problem is more widespread than experts realise and blames inconsistent health advice  Current guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the consumption of alcohol for expectant mothers The Department of Health guidance says that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid alcohol altogether But then it goes on to say that if they do choose to drink to minimise the risk to the baby we recommend they should not drink more than  units once or twice a week and pregnant women should not get drunk The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also concedes there is uncertainty about how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy   However in the case of the sixyearold girl at the centre of these ongoing proceedings the mother did not adhere to anything close to these restrictions An earlier tribunal hearing found she had consumed grossly excessive quantities of alcohol and had been using drugs   The tribunal notes also explain that the mother did engage with maternity services and had no learning disabilities or other issues to affect her ability to understand the dangers to her baby of drinking during pregnancy The case has been going on for four years and solicitor Neil Sugarman representing the unnamed council says if the judge finds in its favour it could set a precedent This is an unusual and horrific case he said It centres around whether by drinking while pregnant and knowing it would affect the baby a crime has taken place  In  a hearing ruled that the mothers drinking was directly attributable to a crime of violence and so the child was eligible for a payout However   by the upper tribunal of the Administration Appeals Chamber after the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority challenged the judgement  No date has yet been set for the forthcoming Court of Appeal hearing  Mr Sugarman said his firm of solicitors was representing  other children nationally all of whom had suffered physical and mental damage from their mothers drinking during pregnancy     Janet Fyle professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives said while FAS was not common it could have devastating effects  She said It is rare But when it does happen it really does manifest itself in terms of developmental issues  The child does not reach its milestones like other children  It also has withdrawal symptoms when its born She said it was midwives job to show expectant mothers the benefits of a healthy lifestyle  including not smoking or drinking large amounts  rather than to judge them for their choices  While she could not comment on the legal case specifically she added Its wrong for a woman to consume large amounts of alcohol while she is pregnant  But lets get away from the moral judgement It is sold over the counter as are cigarettes And the law says the foetus has no legal status as it cannot live independently of the mother
