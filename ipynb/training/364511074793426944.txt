A gene that affects the brains dopamine system appears to have influenced mothers behavior during a recent economic downturn researchers say At the beginning of the recession that began in  mothers with the sensitive version of a gene called DRD became more likely to strike or scream at their children the researchers say Mothers with the other insensitive version of the gene didnt change their behavior But once it appeared that the recession would not become a fullfledged depression the sensitive mothers became less likely than insensitive mothers to engage in harsh parenting You have the same genes and with a different environment its a completely different story says   a professor of contemporary urban problems at Columbia University I think thats the most amazing part of what we found Garfinkel and four other researchers   in the   The surprising finding came about because Garfinkel and the other researchers happened to be studying fragile families in  large cities when the  recession began One of the things they were tracking was reports of harsh parenting including spanking hitting or screaming at a child he says Previous research had found that harsh parenting is more common during economic hard times so Garfinkel says thats what researchers expected to see during the  period often called the Great Recession The team was puzzled by the reports that harsh parenting despite rising initially actually declined as the recession got worse   an assistant professor of sociology at New York University suggested that the mothers genes might offer an explanation The team focused on the DRD gene because the dopamine system affects how people feel and that particular gene is known to be associated with aggressive behavior They looked at genes only from mothers because it would have been more expensive and more difficult to include fathers The results suggest that mothers with the sensitive gene were reacting not to the economic downturn itself but to the fear that things would get really bad Garfinkel says Once it began to look as if a complete economic collapse wasnt going to happen he says they seemed to relax and became less harsh than the moms with the insensitive dopamine gene That explanation fits nicely with a theory of genetics that is often explained in terms of orchids and dandelions Dandelions tend to do pretty well regardless of whether conditions are good or bad Orchids on the other hand die in poor conditions but in the right environment they thrive and become one of the most beautiful plants on the planet Garfinkel says Moms with the sensitive dopamine gene appear to behave like orchids Garfinkel says parenting badly when things look bleak but really well when things are better than they expected That conclusion is consistent with a new understanding of the brains dopamine system says   a neuroscientist at Brown University Scientists used to think brain cells in this system responded to rewards  like good news But thats changed Frank says Its now known that they dont react to rewards per se he says Brain cells increase their level of activity when the outcomes are better than expected and they decrease when the outcomes are worse than expected So if you were expecting the next Great Depression your dopamine system would make you feel better when it didnt occur But genetic studies like this one are tricky and need to be replicated Frank says One possibility is that the mothers behavior was correlated not only with changes in the dopamine gene but with other genes that might be even more important
