Workers at small companies are generally starved for choice when it comes to health insurance If their employers offer health coverage at all  and only   with fewer than  workers do  chances are there will be just one plan on the menu When the online health insurance marketplaces for small businesses open this fall that will change for some workers But many others will have to wait for at least a year The health care overhaul requires every state and the District of Columbia to establish a   or SHOP exchange to enable businesses with  or fewer workers to offer their employees a variety of good plans something   Plan choice is a big value added for workers says Linda Blumberg a senior fellow at the Urban Institute Health Policy Center who coauthored a   on shop exchanges Through the exchanges employers will be able to designate how much they want to contribute toward their employees coverage and the exchange will handle the backoffice functions such as making sure the payments get to the correct insurance company Employees meanwhile will be able to compare plans features and costs online and enroll in a plan At least thats the way it eventually is supposed to work nationwide In June though the Department of Health and Human Services   that in the  states where it is running the health insurance marketplaces it would delay things for a year giving workers the ability to choose among different plans HHS said that option would be too complicated for insurers to implement by  In the remaining states and the District of Columbia the SHOP exchanges are   to allow employers to offer their workers more than one coverage option How much choice workers have will be up to the employers and the states however In addition to offering more health insurance choices through the SHOP exchanges the health care law makes some important improvements to health insurance for small businesses Starting next year insurers will no longer be able to charge small businesses higher premiums because their workers have preexisting health conditions Small group plans sold on the exchanges and in the private market will have to provide  socalled essential health benefits that cover emergency care and hospitalization prescription drugs and doctor visits among other services Outofpocket costs will generally be capped at  for individuals and  for families Unlike larger employers companies with fewer than  workers wont be penalized for not offering coverage If a small employer doesnt offer health insurance workers can shop for individual policies on the marketplaces where they may qualify for subsidies to make coverage more affordable Subsidies will not be available to workers who buy coverage through a SHOP exchange however
