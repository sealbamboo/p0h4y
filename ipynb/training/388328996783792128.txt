Every summer my family and I stay for a few days at my best friends lake house in the Berkshires and engage in our silly rituals Jumping off the dock into Lake Garfield while shouting Kowabunga Paddling the kayak across the lake to visit the photographer whose dog once jumped onto the kayaks deck to see if hell do it again And going to the Falls We passed the occasional penned horses and llamas ignored the sign warning us that somewhere up ahead a bridge was out and turned into a grassy parking lot We could hear their roar muted by a wall of trees I turned to my yearold daughter who was sitting in the back seat of our rental car and asked Do you think youll do it this year  She nodded tentatively Her yearold brother a threeyear veteran of the falls tried to reassure her Itll be easy She smiled her confidence slightly bolstered  As the Umpachene River dumps into the Konkapot River it creates a graded set of falls Some are so mild we can traverse them with a simple step but the lower portion of the river culminates in a sixfoot drop behind which is a shallow cave Years ago we discovered that if we thrust ourselves into the falls holding our breath while withstanding the force of the water we could make it to the other side and sit in the cave breathing freely the water inches from our faces   It had rained the previous night so the rush of water was particularly heavy and cold My buddy and I stood to one side As was our routine he went first  We have been best friends since playing Little League baseball together  years ago and I would follow him anywhere without question He disappeared under the falls I waited a few seconds and followed The water was frigid and powerful but only for a few moments To make it to the cave was thrilling We emerged after a minute to find my son at the ready As he dove into the falls I turned again to my daughter asking her if she was all set She nodded and came over to me I wrapped my arms around her and we turned our backs to the falls When I count to three hold your breath and Ill pull you through  OK Yes she squeaked and closed her eyes I counted and she took a deep breath as we collapsed into the wall of water When I returned to clinic the following week I got some rotten news One of my patients a yearold man with leukemia had relapsed after having been in remission for two years  OK so whats next he asked  His wife was sitting next to him still processing that his cancer had returned He was the type of person who didnt dwell on questions of how this could have happened or what if he had tried a different therapy He also adored his wife and more than once had whispered to me conspiratorially Can you believe Im married to a girl as beautiful as her She was pragmatic and made decisions deliberately he was the romantic You need to seriously consider a bone marrow transplant Its your only chance of being cured I answered  His wife spoke up Well you told us this might happen so I did some reading She then asked a series of highly intelligent questions about the nuts and bolts of the procedure his likelihood of finding a bone marrow match complications and his chance of being cured He remained quiet When we had finished she turned to him I cant tell what youre thinking What do you want to do He smiled in a way that indicated he appreciated that she would ask so many questions on his behalf and that she cared for him enough to be bothered by his silence Awww you know Im not smart enough to understand all these big words you two are using I trust the doctor and if he says this is what I should do then Ill do it Now wait a minute I jumped in I know youre a smart guy If Im not being clear in explaining the transplant I need to start over and describe it better He smiled again Doc I get what youre saying But no matter how much I understand it I trust you and Im going to do what you suggest I fought the urge to start in again to outline each step of the transplant procedure so he could decide for himself what course to take I was also reassured that his wife was there advocating for him Because in the end arent most of our major life decisions based on simple trust Like falling backward into a waterfall
