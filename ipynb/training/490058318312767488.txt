Englands major AE units have now missed their waiting time target for  weeks in a row official figures show Hospitals are meant to see  of AE patients in four hours NHS England looks at all AE providers including smaller units such as walkin centres and overall the official  target has been met over the last year But the last time the  trusts with major units met the fourhour standard over a sevenday period was in the week ending  July last year This contrasts to previous years when the target has been met during some of the warmer months  The weekly picture in the major units is another sign of how pressure is still bubbling away in the system despite it being summer Data from all  AE units of whatever size is looked at as a whole to measure whether  of patients are treated admitted or discharged within four hours  But the government does not require NHS England to meet a distinct target for major AEs separate to the overall target The latest weekly statistics released by NHS England on Friday take in the week ending  July They once again show performance is below the  mark for major units known as Type s The number of visits to AE units have been rising for a number of years There were over m attendances last year  up  in two years But a bigger proportional rise has been seen in the number of these visits that end up with people being admitted into hospital These tend to be the most complex cases that take the most time to deal with  Of the m visits last year just under m ended up with an admission into the hospital That is  higher than two years previously Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine said A lot of this is related to the ageing population and while the percentage rise may seem small we are still talking about a lot of people  We have a drastic shortage of doctors and that is hampering out ability to cope with rises in demand We have to make the speciality more attractive The college has also called for measures to relieve the pressure on AEs including stationing GPs at units to deal with the less serious cases While Englands AE units are under pressure performance elsewhere in the UK is even worse particularly in Wales where under  of patients are seen within four hours and in Northern Ireland where it is under  Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said We are increasingly hearing from patients about problems at AE It used to be just a winter phenomenon but this shows it has become an issue allyear round She said she thought problems accessing GPs was a major factor Sarah PintoDuschinsky of NHS England said once the smaller units such as walkin centres were taken into account the NHS was doing well and meeting the  mark We are determined to maintain these high standards despite the pressure the NHS is under NHS staff should be given the credit they deserve A Department of Health spokesperson said We know some AEs are experiencing increased demand but the NHS continues to see the vast majority of people quickly and met the standard this week Were giving the NHS extra support to keep services sustainable yearround and in the longterm we want to reduce demand by looking after people better in the community Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said The crisis in AE is a problem of this Governments making It has got harder for people to get a GP appointment while social care has been cut to the bone  The result is record numbers coming through AE and thousands of older people trapped in hospital The pressure is backing up through AE ambulance response times are getting worse and waiting lists at a sixyear high If this problem is not addressed now it will drag down the rest of the NHS
