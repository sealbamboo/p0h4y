Saturday marks the third anniversary of the powerful earthquake that destroyed much of the Haitian capital PortauPrince The quake killed roughly  people and left  million Haitians homeless Despite billions of dollars in international aid and pledges to help Haiti rebuild from the disaster very little new permanent housing has been built And about  Haitians are still living in    where they face an array of health challenges Theres been an epidemic of sexual assaults on women living in the camps And residents complain that unsanitary conditions and numerous cooking fires in the cramped quarters have caused respiratory problems among the children Fears however that   would spread rapidly through the overcrowded settlements never materialized Aid workers say this was probably because of the treated water distributed in the camps When the   in January  Jacqueline Syra was nine months pregnant with her third child Her house near the sprawling slum of Cite Soleil collapsed she says killing her husband Syra along with tens of thousands of other people moved on to an abandoned military airport known as La Piste Syra never expected that   shed still be living on the runway We are not living well in the tents she says Sometimes men get in here and attack me or rob my things Her shack is a patchwork of fraying tarps that are tied together with blankets and strung over a skeleton of mismatched sticks Two motorcycle tires on the roof keep the cloth from flapping in the wind She uses the front of an old portable toilet as the door to her shelter Theres no electricity and she cooks on the dirt floor Syra shares this shelter with her three children I dont sleep well I dont eat well says the railthin yearold mother I was a fat woman and look at me now I lost a lot of weight because I cannot sleep or eat well here At its peak in  this camp held roughly  residents according to humanitarian officials La Piste is less crowded now but there are still tens of thousands of people here Women bathe naked with buckets at the public water taps Kids scurry along trashfilled ditches I dont know when Ill leave Syra says I dont know how long Im going to be here After the quake international aid agencies were busy   says United Nations spokesman   They provided Haitians with basic tarps for shelter removed most of the rubble paved roads and yes even built some housing I do understand those who think that there isnt much to show for all that has happened since  but there is a lot that has happened he says But Ngwa who works at the UNs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti does admit that some mistakes were made in the rush For example new houses were built in areas that had no sustainability in terms of jobs for the people who were supposed to move there he explains So some of them abandoned the new houses and theyre back in the camps Immediately after the quake billions of dollars were pledged by international donors to help Haitians recover Despite this only about  units of permanent housing have been built The grand plans to build back better have evaporated Instead President Michel Martelly launched a program aimed at getting people to leave the camps The government offered them a rental subsidy of  and  in cash to anyone willing to vacate several public parks  percent of the residents in all of the targeted camps agreed to the deal and moved out The overall budget for this program was  million   who directs the relocation and rehabilitation in the governments reconstruction program tells Shots He says his office initially focused on trying to repair the damaged houses of camp residents But this only affected about  percent of the camp population he says and only temporarily So after a while that  percent is replaced the camp fills back up So we came up with a rental subsidy he explains Thats only when we started to see camps that were cleared completely His program is also involved in building several dozen new houses and rehabilitating destroyed public infrastructure  roads electricity lines and sewers  in neighborhoods that are receiving thousands of the former camp residents Rose Lermonis who moved with her family into a tarpcovered shack in a public park after the earthquake should be one of the success stories of Belizaires resettlement program The yearold mother spent more than a year in what she says were terrible and terrifying conditions in the camp Then in November  she got a subsidy to rent a small cinder block hut But once that money was gone she could no longer pay the rent and had to move with her children to a room owned by her sister You see all the people who used to be in the tents are still living in misery because they dont have jobs she says If they dont have a child or someone to support them they have nothing Before the earthquake Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere As it moves on from the disaster the nation is still burdened with all the problems it had before its capital was destroyed
