Ive always thought about respect as common decency something we should do because its simply the right thing to do In the medical world we certainly need to strive for respectful behavior especially given our historically rigid pecking order our ingrained traditions of hierarchical bullying and of course a primary constituency  patients  who are often on uniquely vulnerable footing But then I stumbled across two articles in   that talked about respect as an issue of patient safety The authors a group of doctors and researchers at Harvard Medical School outlined the myriad acts of disrespect that weve come to accept as a way of life in medicine and showed how these can lead to a final pathway of harm to our patients This shift in perspective was a shock to the system When we tolerate a culture of disrespect we arent just being insensitive or obtuse or lazy or enabling Were in fact violating the first commandment of medicine How can we stand idly by when our casual acceptance of disrespect is causing the same harm to our patients as medication errors surgical mistakes handoff lapses and missed lab results At one end of the spectrum are the examples of disrespectful behavior like the volatile doctor everyone knows to steer clear of Then there are the sadly common abuses of hierarchy  the doctor denigrating a nurse the medical student treated like disposable goods Beyond these are the even more widespread passive types of disrespect the behaviors that dont ever get reported and are hardly noticed because they are so ingrained in the culture of medicine Dismissive attitudes  toward other members of the medical team toward students toward administrators toward patients  are as corrosive as outward manifestations of disrespect Lack of respect poisons the well of collegiality and cooperation the authors of the articles wrote The poisoningofthewell metaphor is apt Like pornography we know it when we see it Ask a nurse or an intern or a medical student and they can tell you with pinpoint accuracy which areas of the hospital are toxic to work in and which are not Now think of the patients who have the misfortune to be stuck in one of those toxic areas Its not just unpalatable its unsafe Doctors have to take a good deal of the blame For better or worse we often set the tone in a medical enterprise When we show or tolerate even subtle disrespect it works its way all along the chain Luckily the reverse is true Having had the privilege of working under some of the most humane and respectful doctors I have witnessed how everyday acts of decency and humility generate positive cascading effects toward other staff members and toward patients Rising tides in this case can indeed lift all boats  But these articles also make the point that disrespect comes from the medical system itself When a hospital cuts its nursing staff to the bone for example its doing much more than cutting costs Its sending the message that nurses are interchangeable widgets whose productivity can be dialed up or down like household appliances This subtle disrespect can be seen in many areas Overbooking doctors schedules Piling on paperwork Squeezing in additional responsibilities Requiring ceaseless compliance courses that must be completed on personal time The system functions because most medical professionals generally do whats required of them to make it all work Though these annoyances may seem trivial  this lack of respect undermines morale and inhibits transparency and feedback the authors write Morale transparency and feedback are pillars of preventing medical error Patients ultimately bear the brunt of this unhealthy atmosphere The solutions to a disrespectful environment are wideranging and theres no doubt that personal example starting from the top of the hierarchy is a powerful agent of change Expectations of professional conduct need to be applied equally without exemptions for the wellconnected or the powerful Confidential reporting systems for unprofessional behavior are crucial and need to be available to staff members as well as to patients and families Added to the clarion call should be patient safety The connection between disrespectful behavior to patient safety should be made explicit in our efforts since this is a rallying point that everyone can agree on Medical staff members should absolutely be holding ourselves to the highest bar of professional and respectful conduct We have no excuses for anything less But beyond this the medical system needs to reevaluate itself and the way it respects  or disrespects  its own workers and by extension its patients  newest book is   She is an associate professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and her clinical home is at Bellevue Hospital She is also editor in chief of
