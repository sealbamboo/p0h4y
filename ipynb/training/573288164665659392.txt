More than bn people have untreated tooth decay across the globe a study in the Journal of Dental Research suggests Experts say it is alarming it has been neglected to this level  despite known ways to both treat and prevent it They warn that dental decay can lead to severe pain infections days off work and problems with childhood growth And the analysis shows it is not just a childhood problem Scientists say it should be seen as an adult disease too  Tooth decay occurs when acids in the mouth dissolve the outer layers of teeth It is also known as dental decay or dental caries  If not treated it can lead to problems such as a cavities gum disease or abscesses Prof Wagner Marcenes of Queen Mary University of London led an international team of scientists analysing  studies involving some m people between  and   Their global survey suggests bn people have untreated tooth decay in their permanent teeth and some m children have untreated decay in milk teeth According to UK data a third of the population had untreated dental decay in  In Lithuania one of the hardesthit countries the proportion was more than double this at  Their work predicts more than m new cases of dental decay every year Prof Wagner says the main reason behind this is diet  eating and drinking high amounts of sugary foods and drinks and frequent snacking  He said It is alarming to see prevention and treatment of tooth decay has been neglected at this level Tooth decay is a significant economic burden And if left untreated it leads to poor productivity at work and absenteeism in adults and poor school attendance and performance in children But the review suggests a shift in the burden of caries from children to adults  Prof Marcenes said The current perception that low levels of decay in childhood will continue throughout life seems incorrect Yet most policies are focused on children  adults are neglected He suggests health messages should should be considered in adult workplaces too  Professor David Williams an expert in global oral health at Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the research added What is clear is that this is a major public health problem  And there is a major tension here   this is a disease that is prevalent and yet preventable and is consuming budgets But the likelihood that the oral health community will be able to fight this battle singlehandedly can be challenged The international team included researchers from the University of Washington Seattle and the University of Queensland Australia
