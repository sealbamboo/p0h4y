Malaria parasites can hide inside the bone marrow and evade the bodys defences research confirms The discovery could lead to new drugs or vaccines to block transmission The research published in   fills a key knowledge gap in the biology of the disease say scientists at Harvard Carried by mosquitoes the parasite causes the most severe form of malaria which leads to more than  deaths every year globally The study found parasites that cause malaria could bury into bone marrow where they escaped the immune system and caused disease  The idea that they hide in the bone marrow while they mature has been around for decades But a team led by Prof Matthias Marti of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston pinpointed exactly where the parasites found sanctuaries in bone marrow by analysing tissue samples from autopsies We have confirmed that the parasites that cause malaria can hide in the bone marrow he told BBC News The discovery was exciting because it identified a key knowledge gap in the biology of the parasite he added The hope is that this may help scientists devise a way to target parasites hiding out in bone marrow with new drugs or vaccines  The most recent figures from the World Health Organization suggest malaria killed more than  people in  with  of these deaths occurring in subSaharan Africa
