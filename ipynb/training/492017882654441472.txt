When you kiss your husband does your dog try to get your attention And does that mean that your dog feels jealous Threatened Or are we just imagining that Many if not all dog owners are sure that their pets have feelings And weve known for a while that animals exhibit behaviors that look like jealousy guilt and shame But its hard to find out what animals are really feeling And researchers say that understanding that could give us valuable insights into human emotions too A   published Wednesday in   has brought us a tiny bit closer to proving that dogs do get jealous Psychologists from the University of California San Diego adapted a test that has been used on human infants to see whether dogs exhibit jealous behavior They videotaped how  dogs reacted to their owners ignoring them and instead petting and talking sweetly to a plastic jackolantern or an animated stuffed dog When their owners were interacting with the stuffed animals over threequarters of the dogs pushed or touched their owners The dogs also tried to get in between the stuffed animal and the owners or growled at the plush pets The dogs seemed less jealous of the jackolantern But  percent acted aggressive when their owners started talking to the plastic pumpkins Psychologist   who led the study says shes been studying jealousy for many years  but in humans The motivation that you have when youre jealous is to really break up the liaison between your loved one and your rival she told Shots The fact that these dogs seemed like they were trying to draw their owners away from the stuffed animal indicates that theyre feeling something very similar to human jealousy Harris says This is really a landmark study says   an emeritus professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder and author of   It opens the door to a lot more research on animal emotion Bekoff who wasnt involved in the research says that hes definitely seen what looks like jealousy in his work with not only dogs but also coyotes and wolves But this study is one of the first controlled experiments that tries to show it Of course the study still doesnt prove that dogs feel jealousy The problem is that the researchers didnt look at how dogs would react just to those objects says   director of the   at Yale University It could be that the dogs were jealous of the stuffed animal Santos says Or it could be that the dogs really distrusted the stuffed animal and were acting out of fear But this study does build on   that shows dogs react negatively when theyre treated unfairly she tells Shots This is a very new science We are just developing new tools to better understand animal emotions In humans jealousy can be a very complex emotion Santos says It can bring up a host of other emotions like anger and rejection And when humans feel jealous we start suspecting and speculating she says We think If my husband is talking to another woman maybe hes cheating  If we find out that dogs feel the same way she says either jealousy is less complicated because animals show it or animals are more complicated than we thought
