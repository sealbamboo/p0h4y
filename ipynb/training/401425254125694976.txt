For an elderly person a bad fall can mark the difference between between walking and wheelchair between living in ones own home and moving to a nursing home It can be a lifechanging event Or it can be more like what happened to Marjorie Keyishian In the blackout after Hurricane Sandy Mrs Keyishian toppled down the stairs in her Morristown NJ home and broke three vertebrae in her neck She spent a week in the hospital a week in a rehab facility and six months in a stiff neck collar she complains that her balance still isnt what it was But a year later at  shes back to twiceweekly yoga classes and daily minute walks through a nearby park Its important for the mind as well as the body she told me in an interview Understanding which outcome is more likely after a fall injury would be a great benefit to older people and those who take care of them Falls remain dishearteningly common despite prevention efforts About   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and  percent to  percent sustain moderate to severe injuries as a result But afterwards who gets better and how quickly Do we take those injured by falls to physical therapy and hope for the best  or start pricing motorized scooters Put grab bars in the bathroom or put the house on the market A group of researchers at Yale closely following a group of  older adults for nearly  years has monitored   and found that recovery is more predictable than we might think The big clue obvious only in retrospect People with only minor disabilities or none before the fall are far more likely to recover either quickly or gradually Among those already severely disabled the prognosis is much more grim When you read reports of how devastating a hip fracture can be its because those patients are all lumped together said Dr Thomas M Gill a geriatrician and a lead author of the study just published in JAMA Internal Medicine For doctors and patients and families its important to get an idea of what trajectory someone was on before The people in their study all over age  and living independently without disability when researchers began following them in  and  were interviewed by phone every month and visited at home every year and a half through June  During that period  fell and were hurt seriously enough to require hospitalization at an average age of  Almost half  broke a hip the rest suffered head trauma lacerations or other injuries and complications The interviewers had recorded information on their ability to perform  activities basic selfcare like bathing and dressing socalled instrumental activities like shopping and managing finances and mobility walking climbing stairs driving Based on those reports the researchers divided the group into five trajectories prefall About  percent of these older people had no disability and another  percent just mild disability Most were classified as having moderate  percent or progressive disability  percent Nearly  percent were already severely disabled before they fell And afterward The role of function before the fall is of critical importance Dr Gill said Those who have relatively high levels of functioning have a good opportunity at a meaningful recovery Only participants with no or mild disability  like Mrs Keyishian  recovered rapidly meaning they regained most of their functional ability within six months But the probability of recovering diminished with increasing disability before the fall Among those with moderate disabilities only a third recovered within a year And if you start off severely disabled youre not going to get that rapid or even gradual recovery Dr Gill said The die is cast  In this study severely disabled seniors were least likely to regain any independent function The type of injury mattered too The folks with hip fractures did worse on average Dr Gill said Its probably the most severe fallrelated injury Having a realistic sense of how likely someone is to recover after a bad fall can help doctors guide their treatment and help families know what to expect For those with scant disability before the fall you really want to be aggressive Dr Gill said They have the ability to regain much of the independence they lost With so little prospect of recovery for those with greater disability however perhaps the goals of care should shift Dr Gill suggested Palliative care  helpful in reducing the pain that often accompanies fall injuries  might make more sense while extended physical therapy might be of little help I could imagine this being a difficult reality for a physician to discuss But as Dr Gill pointed out We are obligated to provide what we know about prognosis Thats what the field of geriatrics is designed to do to engage patients and caregivers in honest discussion so we can make decisions that are informed and in the best interests of patients and families On the other hand theres Mrs Keyishian If shed been disabled before the fall and an honest doctor explained that her chances of regaining independence were slim I wouldnt have listened she said I would have been sure that if I pushed hard enough Id get it all back
