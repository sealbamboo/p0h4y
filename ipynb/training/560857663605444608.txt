Accident and emergency targets missed longer waits ambulances queuing at hospitals rising patient numbers intense pressures  yet public satisfaction with the NHS is close to a record high   Whats happening Its an interesting question at a time when the political debate ahead of the general election is reaching fever pitch The latest  polling data comes from the British Social Attitudes survey covering a range of issues which has been conducted every year since  apart from  and      It was carried out in England Scotland and Wales covering just under  adults weighted to reflect the age gender and geographic spread of the population   Its important to note that most of the interviews were carried out in August and September with some over the next two months but all before winter set in with a succession of headlines about accident  emergency problems  Those interviewed were representative of the whole population not just patients  But the survey conducted in association with the Kings Fund think tank does provide a consistent data set going back more than  years  The surveys headline finding is that  public satisfaction with the NHS rose from  to  in  the highest in any year apart from  when it was at    There was a big drop in  but much of that ground has been recovered   Satisfaction with AE services rose despite pressure on the system building from the spring More than  of those surveyed were satisfied with GPs though this was the lowest since the survey began The BSAKings Fund survey is published as successive opinion polls put the NHS at the top of voter concerns   An IPSOSMORI poll in January reported that  said health issues were very important up from  in September   Managing the economy the next most important issue trailed at    And a BBCPopulus poll this week suggested that people thought the NHS was the most important issue to be covered by the news ahead of the election ahead of the economy and immigration The big unknown is how all this plays out when voters walk into polling stations in May   If they are satisfied with the NHS might they give the coalition parties their support Or might they back the claim that to ensure continued satisfaction with the health service only a vote for Labour will suffice  If they think that health is the most important issue how will this translate into crosses on ballot papers    Its hard to work out the answers  More detailed fieldwork by IPSOSMORI reveals some intriguing views amongst British population  It found  of those surveyed lacked confidence they would receive high quality NHS care in their local area this winter   Yet  of Britons agreed that the NHS was a symbol of what is great about Great Britain and everything should be done to maintain it  So it seems people can love the NHS and still  be worried about the service this winter  One thing is clear  the NHS will be a major issue out on the campaign trail  Its far from plain though how peoples views on the service will help or hinder the rival parties as they scrap for every vote
