So right now were asking Childrens Hospital to work with us to make that possible he said referring to Childrens Hospital  Research Center Oakland Sealey declined to identify the other facility Jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on December  three days after tonsil surgery The case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care On Monday a judge appointed Dr Paul Fisher chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Childrens Hospital to evaluate Jahi as an independent expert Fisher testified Tuesday that Jahi meets the criteria for brain death Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until December  and the judge encouraged both sides to work together Family attorney Christopher Dolan told reporters Thursday that Jahi would need to have tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes put in before she could be moved The most logical people are the ones in the hospital where shes sitting who have the ability to do that If they refuse to do that and insist upon moving towards this deadline of pulling the plug then well just continue to do what weve been doing he said In response to the familys statement the hospital will allow a lawful transfer of Jahis body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Childrens can legally do so wrote hospital attorney Douglas C Straus in a December  letter to Dolan Childrens is willing to cooperate in this regard even though Judge Grillo has confirmed that Jahi is deceased and that statutory patient transfer procedures do not apply here Straus wrote The hospital asked the familys attorney for the name of the facility that would accept Jahi a transportation plan for her and consent from the Alameda County coroner for the transfer since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead Straus wrote The family will also have to find a physician that would be willing to operate on the body said hospital spokesman Sam Singer In an earlier response to the family Childrens Hospital Chief of Pediatrics David Durand noted that the judge didnt authorize a transfer to another facility Judge Grillo was very clear on Tuesday December  He ruled Jahi McMath to be deceased and instructed the hospital to maintain the status quo Judge Grillo did not authorize or order any surgical procedures or transfer to another facility Childrens Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice Childrens Hospital Oakland continues to extend its wishes for peace and closure to Jahi McMaths family he said
