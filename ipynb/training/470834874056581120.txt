Children are increasingly anxious stressed out and overly worried Part of that has to do with increased pressures to excel in school sports and extracurricular activities But part of it has a lot to do with parents Like other mental and physical health problems anxiety can be inherited And some children are more vulnerable because of the way their anxious parents parent Children whose parents struggle with anxiety are  to times   to develop an anxiety disorder themselves according to   a psychologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who studies childhood anxiety Thats partly a result of how parents view the world If they see it as a scary place their children often do as well Parents are a childs role model for many behaviors including anxiety says Ginsburg So if a parent is showing anxiety jumping up on a table when they see a mouse versus reacting calmly we know children are more likely to develop fears similar to what their parents are showing Take the example of Heather Cummings and her son Noah It was difficult for Noah to go to elementary s chool He was constantly worried that he would get sick and throw up particularly at school It turns out that Heather suffered similar worries when she was a child In science Id read about a condition and think I had it cancer or diabetes for example she says If I bumped my head Id think Id get a concussion If I got hit in the temple Id watch the clock because I thought I was going to die Anxiety is a normal human emotion in the face of challenges such as taking a test or performing in public But in more severe forms it can be debilitating  that interferes with normal life activities like school work or social relationships can be an indication of a severe anxiety disorder When Noah was a toddler if he disappeared behind a tree Heather worried that he had been kidnapped I was panicstricken As Noah got older Heathers anxiety shifted and she worried more about his anxiety Both Heather and her husband Dave who live in Epsom NH found themselves constantly reassuring Noah that he was fine that he wouldnt throw up and that everything would be OK They got the school to agree to allow Noah to call home when he got worried He did five or six times a day Dave even once spent an entire day in the classroom He says I just went there to be sitting in the classroom with him my entire focus was on Noah on how he was doing Id give him a reassuring smile rub his back anything in my power to reassure him that things are going to be OK But all this reassurance and effort turned out to be exhausting for everyone By the time Noah was  the family was so overwhelmed that they knew they had to do something They had heard an expert in anxiety speak at a parent meeting and they decided to go see her By the time they arrived at the office of psychotherapist   in nearby Concord Noahs anxiety was severe Lyons says The first step for Noah was to help him understand how anxiety made his stomach ache Lyons often draws cartoons to show children how their bodies react to anxiety with an increase in stress hormones accompanied by a racing heart faster breathing tense muscles and a churning stomach Noah got the message The biggest surprise though was for Heather and Dave Lyons told them that all their efforts to help Noah avoid his anxiety were actually fueling it The way you learn how to manage life is by making mistakes or by stepping into things that feel uncertain uncomfortable or overwhelming and then proving to yourself through experience that you can manage it Lyons says The Cummingses were inadvertently suggesting to Noah that he couldnt handle it Noah had to learn how to face his fears and his parents had to help him This meant no more reassurance It wasnt easy but both Heather and Dave were committed to change So was Noah Lyons used a   called   that helps people learn how to change negative thoughts about specific experiences This therapy has been shown effective in treating anxiety disorders but can be useful as well for anyone dealing with stressful life situations Noah had to limit phoning or texting home from school to twice a week then once a week then every other week and so on until he stopped altogether As for throwing up in school Noah had to accept that he might So rather than avoiding it he had to start saying Hey if I get sick I get sick I wont like it but Ill survive  Lyons says When Lyons told Noah to think about the worst that could happen he realized that going to the nurses office and being sent home just wasnt all that bad He never did throw up in school And today two years after therapy started he no longer worries about it His parents now know what to say when he does get worried That includes labeling the worry as worry and asking Whats the worst that could happen In short the therapy worked for parents and child About a month ago Noah now  went on a fiveday school trip to Washington DC As it got closer and closer I got more and more excited rather than worried Noah says When I got onto the bus to go I was not worried at all I didnt have one worry about going on the trip And rather than being inundated with calls or texts Noahs parents didnt hear a thing On this trip we would have liked a couple more calls Dave Cummings says Its ironic that he didnt call at all its the greatest victory possible Lyons says it really doesnt matter whats provoking a childs anxiety  it could be school or getting up at bat performing in a play or singing a song in public The key she says is helping children expect it and have a plan on how to deal with it Then they can move on stronger and more capable of coping with lifes uncertainties Lyons recently coauthored a   entitled    Cognitive behavioral therapy may also help prevent anxiety from developing in the first place Ginsburg says She has studied vulnerable children who had at least one anxious parent In her   half of the children ages  to  and their parents received cognitive behavioral therapy Half did not It turned out that onethird of those who did not receive therapy developed an anxiety disorder within a year None of those who received therapy developed anxiety
