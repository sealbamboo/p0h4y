If someones heart suddenly stops beating a quick shock can be a lifesaver By the time a person can get to the hospital though its   The chances of survival are best in fact if the shock is   of a persons collapse Thats why you see   or AEDs in airports schools and malls Even someone with little or no training can use the devices which only deliver a shock when they sense an abnormal rhythm But experienced firstresponder or not whoever is going to help the victim needs to have an AED close by when someone collapses Some Canadian researchers wondered are AEDs being put where theyre needed most The short answer is probably not Researchers compared the locations of AEDs registered with the local authorities in Toronto with cases of cardiac arrests that werent related to trauma and that occurred outside hospitals There were  cardiac arrests like that around Toronto during a four and a half year period ending in the middle of  Turns out that the most likely place to have an AED is a school building  elementary secondary or university Nearly threequarters of those locations had one But schools arent hot spots for cardiac arrests Over the course of a year youd expect one cardiac arrest for every  elementary and secondary school locations for instance Wheres the action Youd find one cardiac arrest a year for every   race tracks and casinos Same ratio for jails The findings were   by the   Those findings jibe with whats already known A   from back in  showed that security personnel at Las Vegas casinos trained to use AEDs dramatically improved survival rates among patrons who collapsed from cardiac arrest Casinos at first reluctant embraced AEDs with zeal The safest place in America to suffer sudden cardiac arrest is a casino Bryan Bledsoe an ER doctor     in a  story about the dramatic reduction in deaths from cardiac arrest on the Las Vegas Strip We want to turn the entire public setting into a casino Dr Steven Brooks an ER doc at Queens University in Kingston Ontario and lead author of the latest study tells Shots We can move survival from  to  percent to  to  percent if youre in the perfect setting Putting defibrillators where the odds say theyll be needed most would be a good start Brooks says that good intentions drive the placement of many AEDs in the community Rare but tragic events on sport fields for instance are one reason AEDs are being placed in schools he says Brooks isnt opposed to AEDs in those places Theres an educational benefit for instance for children who get used to seeing AEDs and who learn what they do And the devices can save lives there when cardiac arrests occur But he says hed like to see data drive more decisions in the future Im just saying that if were looking at the risk of cardiac arrest other places are underserved
