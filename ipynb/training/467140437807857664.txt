Lithuania's parliament on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to minorsâ€”a move that could renew scrutiny of products like Red Bull and Monster elsewhere.. The small Baltic nation said it is the first country to take concrete action to ban sales to minors. "We hope that some countries of the EU that don't have a clear position will follow the Lithuanian way," Almantas Kranauskas, a Health Ministry official, said in an interview.
