Its a startling fact that since   of banks and building societies on Britains high streets   While on the face of it this seems like a stark reduction for the most part it is simply the outcome of our migration towards phone and online services over the past decades Changing consumer behaviour has forced the banking retail and travel industries to change the way they deliver services  from creating slick interactive websites we can manage our money and purchases from to increasing selfservice in stores Strikingly however health has not travelled in the same direction Less than  of us in the UK organise our healthcare online In fact the basic model for how people access their healthcare hasnt changed much in at least  years We remain fixated with the eightminute GP consultation and people still turn up to wait in long queues at surgeries in the morning in the hope of seeing a doctor This is an anachronism we have a huge opportunity to change In the process we can make the   more sustainable Take the warnings weve heard recently about primary care The Royal College of General Practitioners RCGP has said up to   in the coming year as more and more GPs come up to retirement and younger recruits become scarcer The political response from both Labour and the Conservatives has been to promise thousands of new   however realistic that is But for all the good intentions this discussion leads us down a dead end street What we need is a transformed model of delivering healthcare at scale that can be used by all of us making better use of the human resources the NHS already has In Birmingham   is pioneering what this future primary care model could look like in partnership with a GP super practice   We have launched a clinical contact centre or hub that can be accessed via the web phone or a dedicated mobile and tablet app for a local population of  In effect its a blueprint for the kind of digitallyenabled multispecialty community providers MCPs envisaged by Simon Stevens in his   Were using technology to bring patients into more convenient contact with doctors nurses and other health professionals The service is proving extremely popular with up to  callers per day already making use of it More than threequarters of the calls are answered within  seconds by call centre agents who after an initial conversation with the patient book same day phone consultations with the first available appropriate healthcare professional The healthcare professional is then able to resolve the call remotely or book the patient in for a sameday facetoface appointment Appointments are being booked throughout the day moving away from the usual morning rush and meaning people dont have to plan their whole day around a trip to the doctors But whats most remarkable is the fact that  of these callers are having their problem dealt with remotely rather than needing to come in to see the doctor The average duration of a call between doctor and patient is also just five minutes  meaning doctors can speak to far more patients in the course of a day Importantly this also frees up primary care doctors to spend their facetoface time treating people with more complex needs and this saves money down the line by reducing the number of acute hospital admissions and the need for community care This greater efficiency saves the whole NHS money While so much political focus has been about bolton extras to our existing services  more doctors here longer hours there  what we really need is to entirely rethink the way in which we deliver services so that they better meet patient demand Digital health shouldnt be an obsession with databases and records  it should be about using the technological tools we have to improve peoples access to healthcare
