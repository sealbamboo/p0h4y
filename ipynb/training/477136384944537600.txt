Kids today  theyre smoking less having less sex and fighting less often at school Theyre less likely to use drugs and theyre more likely to wear seat belts and helmets when they are supposed to The latest federal look at teenage behavior is reassuring and suggests that some safety messages are getting through to American youth On the downside kids are fatter than ever before and just a third are eating anywhere near as many fruits and vegetables as they need to stay healthy And less than a third are getting enough sleep And a very troubling new statistic shows that more than  percent of teenagers who drive cars admit to having texted or emailed while driving recently But on the whole its a snapshot of progress The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which organizes the everyotheryear survey was especially pleased about the drop in   I think its really encouraging that were seeing the lowest cigarette smoking rate ever CDC director Dr Tom Frieden told NBC News Weve actually reached the goal that the nation set for ourselves for  early So thats one of the most positive trends that we see here  down to  percent  less than one out of six kids in our high schools is smoking Thats great news About  percent of Americans smoke down from  percent in the s While smoking is the single biggest preventable cause of death in the United States  it causes heart disease cancer and lung disease  teenagers face a more immediate risk Their single biggest killer is motor vehicle crashes causing  percent of deaths among  to yearolds CDC says Another  percent of young deaths come from other unintentional injuries  percent from homicide and  percent by suicide The good news is that only  percent of the students surveyed said they never or rarely wore a seat belt when riding in a car driven by someone else  down from nearly  percent in  Frieden said public health campaigns make a difference These positive trends didnt just happen Theyre the result of hard work in communities all over the country  doing things like protecting kids from secondhand smoke passing laws that are graduated driving laws so that kids dont drink and drive he said Other carrelated behavior isnt so good The survey of more than  students taken at schools across the country showed that nearly  percent admit to having ridden one or more times in a car or other vehicle driven by someone who had been drinking in the past month Thats down however from nearly  percent in  Ten percent of teen drivers admit theyve sometimes gotten behind the wheel after drinking But most startling  percent of teen drivers said they had texted or emailed while driving a car or other vehicle on at least one day during the  days before the survey It puts not only them but every other driver on the road at risk said Dr Stephanie Zaza director of CDCs Division of Adolescent and School Health Teenagers are particularly susceptible to distraction Parents need to model good behavior Older teen drivers may do it more often  in  the CDC found that  percent of high school seniors   while driving Among all Americans  percent of drivers  on a handheld cell phone while on the road About  percent say they have texted while driving Teens can be foolhardy in other ways Nearly  percent said they skip wearing a helmet while biking all or most of the time But this is down from  percent of teens in  And while teen sex is at a low   percent down from  percent in   just  percent said they used a condom the last time This is up from  percent in  but down from  percent in  and its not good enough Frieden said Just over a third   percent  are currently sexually active Were very concerned to see the decrease in condom use Frieden said We worked hard we educated and we had a steady increase in condom use until recent years Now weve seen a slight decrease in condom use and thats concerning Teens should use condoms even if they are also using other contraception Frieden said Pregnancy is a big worry but STDs are even more likely and Frieden fears there may be a sense that well theres treatment for HIV so its not such a terrible problem There may be treatments for HIV but theres no cure People must take pills every single day for life and the virus can develop resistance to those medications And some kids are relying on   Of those who were sexually active  percent did nothing to prevent pregnancy during their last sexual intercourse On the good news side students are fighting less at school Just under  percent had been in a physical fight one or more times during the past year down from  percent in  And just  percent had even been in a fight down from a third in  The other longterm risks to health are poor diet and a lack of exercise Teens are trying but not reaching targets there the survey indicates People should aim to eat at least three servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables every single day More than  percent of the students had managed to get one fruit serving down a day for the week before the survey and  percent managed to eat one or more vegetables Only  percent hit the three or more mark Fifteen percent said they hadnt exercised hard enough to get a little out of breath in the week before the survey and only  percent had done so for five of the past seven days  another basic goal to stay healthy And as a possible result nearly  percent of the students were obese the survey found and another  percent were overweight Its not hard to guess what they were doing instead of exercising Nearly a third of students said they watched television three or more hours per day on an average school day And  percent of students played video games or used a computer for something that was not schoolwork for three or more hours a day on school days Weve seen a tremendous increase in screen time Its remarkable Frieden said We have to constantly be vigilant about technology Zaza said Kids are constantly looking for the new thing One other thing that hasnt changed for years  kids dont get enough sleep Most teenagers need nine hours of sleep a night The survey found that only  percent of students were getting eight or more hours a night on school nights
