on and on I know about the new year too from comments in the Y locker room The holiday splurges are over and the day of reckoning has arrived Overheard on Jan  Im going to work out every day Ive got to get rid of these pounds But neither the plethora of diet books nor annual resolutions are good predictors of permanent weight loss First if any of the scores of diet plans published in recent years had resulted in lasting weight loss for the growing legions of hopefuls there would have been no need for yet another batch including the ones that inevitably will arrive next December Second as one middleaged Y member who has maintained a pound weight loss for several years responded to the locker room workout pledge Exercise by itself wont do it To lose weight you have to eat less She learned that she said at Weight Watchers after nearly wearing out her body by trying to lose weight through   alone Not only does she now eat less she also eats differently having replaced many foods and snacks high in sugar and refined starches with more nutritious fare Another Weight Watchers success a friend in his late s who shed  pounds eats the same foods he always did but now eats less of them He learned to recognize satiety  a feeling that hes had enough  and to rely on that instead of a feeling of being stuffed to signal the end of his meals Clearly there is no one pathway to permanent

longer Radical abrupt dietary changes rarely stick People soon tire of the restrictions and revert to their old dietary habits Habits are not acquired overnight and you should not expect to inculcate new ones overnight either  director of the   at Baylor College of Medicine advises wouldbe dieters to first become aware of their bad eating and exercise habits and then to figure out ways to slowly change them into healthier new ones Small changes can end up making a big difference One is to avoid skipping meals Eat a nutritious breakfast every day and a wholesome snack or meal every few hours I snack on nuts midmorning and have a digestive biscuit  calories with caf con leche midafternoon The idea is to avoid becoming ravenous and losing control over your intake at the next meal Eat slowly  it takes  minutes for your brain to register satiety  and on smaller plates filled with onefifth to onethird less food than usual Fill most of the plate with foods like vegetables and salads that are rich in nutrients rather than calories Choose nutrientdense   like beans and whole grains over refined ones If however you think a meal is not a meal without potatoes rice bread or heaven forfend dessert by all means include them  but in controlled amounts Drink water or a caloriefree beverage with your meals If you drink alcohol limit yourself to one drink a day I crave something sweet after a meal and fruit doesnt always cut it My dessert favorites include a graham cracker  calories in two squares and two dark chocolate Bahlsen Afrika biscuits  calories If like me you have an oral fixation try chewing sugarfree gum Or eat a fruit like an apricot or prunes with pits then suck on the pits for the next hour or so Make physical exercise a daily activity Decide each day what to do rather than whether to do it The  members of the   members have lost an average of  pounds and kept them off for six years typically exercise for  to  minutes a day often broken up into several smaller sessions walking is their most popular activity Registry leaders report that those who have successfully maintained their weight loss typically eat a diet low in fat  percent of daily calories and high in carbohydrates with  percent of their calories from carbs like whole grains beans and vegetables Perhaps most telling is that registry members weigh themselves regularly Many like me get on a scale every day A weekly weighin as recommended by Weight Watchers is probably best while losing weight But to maintain weight a daily check can provide an early warning to cut back a little when you gain a pound or two Five extra pounds that make pants too tight are a lot harder to shed Registry members readily admit that contrary to the claims of many diet books effective weight loss and maintenance are not easy Most like me became successful when they gave up dieting and adopted a sensible eating and exercise plan they could stay on comfortably for the rest of their lives
