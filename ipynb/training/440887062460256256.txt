A troubling racial divide in   mortality continues to widen in most major cities around the country suggesting that advances in diagnosis and treatment continue to bypass AfricanAmerican women according to new research An analysis of breast cancer mortality trends in  of the largest cities in the United States shows that the chance of surviving breast cancer correlates strongly with the color of a womans skin Black women with breast cancer  whether they hail from Phoenix or Denver Boston or Wichita Kan  are on average about  percent more likely to die of the disease than white women with breast cancer In some cities the risk is even greater In Los Angeles a black woman with breast cancer is about  percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman is In Memphis black women face more than double the risk according to the research published on Tuesday in Cancer Epidemiology 
The findings were compiled and analyzed by the   in Chicago and the   which also funded the research The analysis builds on a series of studies that have identified a startling racial gap in breast cancer mortality In  a widely publicized study of the  largest cities examined the racial gap in breast cancer from  through  The new study takes a longer view and includes breast cancer deaths from  through  in  cities The more comprehensive analysis shows that in most cities  years ago black and white women faced about the same mortality risk from breast cancer But starting in  the death rate among white women began to drop rapidly in many cities while death rates among black women fell only a little Its absolutely startling and very dismal because there is hardly any health measure in the United States that hasnt improved in the last  years said Steve Whitman director of Sinai Urban Health Institute and the studys senior author Notably death rates for black and white women with breast cancer declined over all during the twodecade study period however the death rates among white women decreased twice as much as those among black women The researchers said the difference is explained by lower access to screening lowerquality screening less access to treatment and lowerquality treatment among black women Dr Whitman said the larger question is why the health system appears to discriminate against black women with breast cancer Its undeniable that this is systemic racism he said I dont mean that a bad person is at the door personally keeping women out but the system is arranged in such a way that its allowing white women access to the important gains weve made since  in terms of breast health and black women have not been able to gain access to these advances The research also dispels the notion that black women face a higher risk of breast cancer because of genetic differences While they are at greater risk for some types of breast cancers that doesnt explain the widening mortality gap developing in a relatively short period of just two decades Mathematically it cant be anything genetic Dr Whitman said How could genes change in  years The next step is to begin to study differences in the racial gap across cities in hopes of identifying the factors that contribute to the problem The cities with the largest disparities are Memphis Los Angeles Wichita Houston Boston Denver Chicago Phoenix Dallas and Indianapolis In New York the gap is far smaller While black women are still  percent more likely to die of breast cancer than white women over all both white and black women with breast cancer fare better in New York than in many other cities New York is the largest city in the country yet it only has a nominal disparity compared to Los Angeles or Chicago or Houston said Marc Hurlbert executive director of the   and one of the study authors No disparity is acceptable but New York is doing something better than other cities Dr Hurlbert said factors like the citys public hospital system and an extensive public transportation system probably play a role increasing access to breast cancer care regardless of income level However more research is needed to home in on the factors that are contributing to the racial divide Can we help cities with a wide gap learn from the cities that are doing better Dr Hurlbert said Now that we have the data and understand what is going on were going to move to trying to solve the problem
