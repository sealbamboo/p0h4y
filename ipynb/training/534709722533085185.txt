Good morning, everyone, and how are you today? We are just fine, thank you. Although there is a bit of a chill in the air and an especially blustery wind enveloping the leafy Pharmalot campus right now, despite the shiny sun hovering above. Of course, cool temperatures call for a hot cup or two of stimulation, yes? Feel free to join us. While you do so, here are some tidbits to keep you on the right track. Hope you keep warm today and accomplish great things. Stay in touch….
