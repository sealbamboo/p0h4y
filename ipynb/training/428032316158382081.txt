NEW DELHIâ€”Workers at a Ranbaxy Ltd. drug plant repeatedly fudged test results to make it appear that raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients met required standards when they didn't, according to a report by inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration.. FDA officials visited Ranbaxy's Toansa factory in the northwestern Indian state of Punjab early this month and said they discovered workers retesting "until acceptable results are obtained" and deleting evidence of failed tests.
