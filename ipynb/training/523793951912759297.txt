Moffie Kanneh is angry at the United States When I meet the Liberian lawyer he asks immediately where I am from Take this back to Washington he says I am extremely furious In the days after the death of Thomas Eric Duncan  the Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas last month  Kanneh was one of many Liberians who told me that case changed the way they see the United States Many noted how different Duncans experience in the US healthcare system seemed from white patients who contracted Ebola like Dr Kent Brantly who recovered from the disease last month NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo who is making progress in his treatment there and most recently two nurses who treated Duncan both of whom are doing well Sitting outside a small caf in Monrovia Kanneh explains that he feels US attitudes toward Liberians are tinged with both racism and xenophobia The combination of African black he shakes his head I still think if Eric was an American they would have given him preferential treatment Some people also see Duncans case as evidence that the US doesnt want West Africans to seek treatment in the United States It was a racist approach in a larger sense explains Franklin Wesseh who describes himself to me as an opposition party member and writer Hes referring to the slow response by the Dallas hospital that initially sent Duncan home despite a fever and weakness I personally think Duncan could have been saved he says sipping coffee after church on a Sunday afternoon He was given less attention It was a way of probably discouraging Liberians who contracted the disease and want to go there But while many Liberians I spoke to are frustrated by what they see as antiAfrican prejudice some within the government urge less focus on race and more on fighting the epidemic When we play the race card there will be problems says Nathaniel Toe the superintendent for Maryland County Liberia His county in the southeastern part of the country doesnt have an Ebola treatment center yet and Toe is concerned that the US could react to charges of racism by slowing down delivery of aid One of the  USbuilt treatment centers is planned for Maryland county We are being distracted he says The real issue he thinks is not racism or American attitudes toward Liberia It is access to healthcare I would like to see the intervention reach all of Liberia with the same quality of service as in Atlanta in Dallas Take that to Washington he says We need better hospitals Another government official I meet Mitchell Jones of the Liberian Ministry of Commerce and Industry echoes Toes sentiments This is not a time for politics he says Jones speaks poetically about unity and democracy We Liberians must be as one people he tells me As he talks he slides away from me on the bench we share Im sorry he says Now we are all afraid of touching of the brushing of skin even He equates the Ebola epidemic in Liberia to the  attacks in the US This is the time that we all hold together Like when Bin Laden attacked the United States it was a time for every American to hold together to fight their common enemy Liberians today our common enemy is Ebola Despite such calls for unity the Liberians I met were frustrated and angry at the US And those emotions are coloring the way they view US aid Even after Thomas Eric Duncans story fades from the headlines Wesseh says he will think of it when the US says it is committed to helping Liberia through the crisis That a Liberian citizen died of Ebola when American citizens have survived makes him feel that America may not be truly committed to helping the Liberian people America protects its interests he says Yes they are here today making sure Ebola can be kicked out of Liberia but only for their business transactions I personally am disappointed Back in the US this week Duncans nephew echoed some of the comments I heard in Monrovia In an   written for the   Josephus Weeks stated that his uncle did not have to die and that his treatment had been substandard Weeks brought up the issue of race in his opening paragraph He told the nurse he had recently been in Liberia But he was a man of color with no health insurance and no means to pay for treatment so within hours he was released with some antibiotics and Tylenol He went on to say that Thomas Eric Duncan was a victim of a broken system Some speculate that this was a failure of the internal communications systems Others have speculated that antibiotics and Tylenol are the standard protocol for a patient without insurance  Their error set the wheels in motion for my uncles death and additional Ebola cases and their ignorance incompetence or indecency has created a national security threat for our country Weeks captures what everyone I spoke to in Monrovia agreed with that Duncan had not been treated with dignity and that his death was a tragedy
