Don Benfield of Taylorsville NC makes  an hour working for a mobilehome parts business selling things like replacement doors and windows Benfield  doesnt have health insurance I havent had health care insurance in years simply because I havent been able to afford it especially with food prices how they went up he explains Benfields employer does offer health insurance coverage even though with fewer than  employees the business is not required to The insurance here through work is  a week which with my rent and other payments and everything we havent been able to afford he says If I put my wife on the insurance it shoots up to  The Affordable Care Act is expected to provide around  billion in subsidies this year to make health insurance affordable for low and middleincome people But a quirk in the law is denying subsidies to a significant number of lowincome people especially those with families Benfield has run up against this quirk To cover only himself Benfield would have to pay a little more than  a year He says he cant afford that but thats an affordable amount according to Obamacare regulations and that means Benfield could not get subsidies if he tried to get coverage on the Obamacare exchange The situation only gets worse if Benfield decided to add his wife to his employer policy Adding her would nearly triple the annual cost driving it up to  a year almost a quarter of their family income Benfields situation illustrates a flaw in the Affordable Care Act says Linda Blumberg a health policy expert at the Urban Institute A lot of people refer to this as the family affordability glitch Blumberg says All of the assessment of whether or not employerbased coverage is affordable is based on workeronly coverage and doesnt take the cost of family coverage into account Thats remarkable says Blumberg since most people want to buy family coverage not simply coverage for the family breadwinner Not getting subsidies makes a huge difference Without them the benchmark insurance plan on the Obamacare exchange would be more than  a year for Benfield and his wife But if they were allowed to get Obamacare subsidies theyd pay only around  Suzanne Shugart and her family face a similar situation in McPherson Kan Her husband works for a cabinetmaker earning around  a year He can get health insurance through his employer for a little more than  a month just for himself Thats also affordable coverage according to Obamacare rules so Shugarts family isnt eligible for subsidies in the online marketplace But the employers family coverage is too expensive for them says Shugart If he were to increase it to a family plan which would include me it goes up to about  a month which is nearly our mortgage payment Shugart says She and her husband cant afford that she says Luckily their children qualify for insurance through a state plan Thats how weve lived for the last eight years Shugart says He has insurance through work and the kids have state insurance and I just live on hope and a prayer that nothing bad will happen If Shugarts family could get subsidized coverage on the Obamacare exchange the premium for a benchmark plan would be a little more than  a month making coverage for her much more affordable Blumberg says its likely that in a more amenable political environment the family glitch would be fixed with Congress adding more focus on the affordability of family coverage But I think that because of the political volatility around this law there was never an opportunity to sit down and say OK lets make a policy change here that takes this into account  she says Blumberg says Democrats have been hesitant to open debate on the law at all because of fear it would be eviscerated during the legislative process With the Republican takeover in Congress the chance of eliminating the family glitch seems unlikely to improve anytime soon
