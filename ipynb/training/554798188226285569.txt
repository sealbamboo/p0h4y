News reports that most cases of cancer are the result of bad luck dominated the headlines at the start of the year But there has since been a lot of criticism of the reporting and some of the science itself So what should the reports have said Headlinewriters and news bulletin editors around the world just couldnt get enough of   published on  January Two thirds of cancers   reported one typical news story  and most other media outlets had    But theres been criticism of the way   some of it directed at journalists and some at the researchers themselves  To understand the study published in the journal Science it helps to understand the scientific basics of cancer The disease occurs when cells in a specific part of the body begin to mutate and reproduce uncontrollably The cancerous cells can invade and destroy surrounding tissues The researchers from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the US reported they had found a correlation between the number of cell divisions that take place in a given tissue and the likelihood that it would become cancerous They looked at  tissue types two common cancers prostate and breast cancer were not considered Some tissues are fairly stable so for instance muscle and brain tissue does not divide once its done developing explains P Z Myers a biologist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota Morris in the US So those tissues have a very low likelihood of coming down with cancer whereas things like the lining of your intestine is constantly being regenerated and sloughed off and so those cells have a high proliferative output and theyre much more likely to become cancerous The researchers werent looking at what determines why some people get cancer and others dont They were instead asking why some types of cancer are common and some are rare Why lots of people get lung cancer for example but few people get leg cancer If you smoke you greatly increase your chance of getting lung cancer of course and other behavioural and environmental factors are known to cause other types of cancer But some people who dont smoke also get lung cancer and other behavioural environmental and genetic factors do not account for all cases of cancer So how much cancer is down to random cell division error The researchers say theyve calculated that two thirds  of the differences in cancer risk among different tissues is down to cell division gone wrong  bad luck Now many media reports have simply concluded that this means that two thirds of cancer   are just the result of random haywire cell division Thats not correct But on the other hand a lot of people arent quite sure exactly what the researchers mean Statistical and scientific experts who have been blogging about the misreading of the research dont all agree about what the  figure refers to The most likely explanation seems to be that the researchers were referring to the correlation between cell divisions in different types of tissue and the tendency of those tissues to develop cancer  If you imagine plotting a graph listing all these different types of cancer with the frequency of cell divisions on one axis and the frequency of cancer on the other axis If the dots on the graph were scattered all over the place you would say that there was no correlation between cell division  what these researchers call bad luck  and cancer And if all the dots lined up perfectly there would be a  correlation between cell division and cancer And the answer the researchers have found seems to be somewhere in between the dots on the graph line up pretty well so the rate of cell division is about  correlated with the rate of cancer   But if thats the correct reading of the research several commentators have   The authors werent able to give More or Less an interview but they did say they are writing a technical paper to clarify their first paper So who is to blame for the confusing headlines Prof George DaveySmith a clinical epidemiologist at Bristol University argues that its not the journalists on the mainstream newspapers TV bulletins and news websites The headline of Sciences own editorial he points out was the bad luck of cancer The subheading added Analysis suggests most cases cant be prevented And this a conclusion he says that   In the press release from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine the authors say theyve come up with a method to quantify the contribution of these stochastic or chance factors which their method doesnt he adds  Its both in the journal and in the press release so its just not fair to attribute the misreporting of this to journalists  theyve just copied whats in the journal and in the press release In the end the amount of media attention given to this study was not justified by the findings DaveySmith says Explaining the difference in risk between the leg and the lung is of no interest to anyone and says nothing about the contribution of chance to cancers in the population Its like getting two statistics two estimates that bear no relationship to each other and because youve got a number applying that number to some other domain But while the headlines may have been misleading and the study itself has some serious critics the research does contain an important message for people who have cancer and lead a healthy lifestyle according to P Z Myers Whats important about the study is that it does say that if you have cancer  and I think this is something people who have cancer would like to hear  its not something you should blame yourself for
