The work is only in mice so far but it sure is intriguing A newly found hormone revs up production of cells that make insulin  the very kind that people with advanced diabetes lack Harvard scientists   the discovery Thursday in   call the hormone betatrophin because it stimulates the production of   in the pancreas These cells make insulin which the body needs to control blood sugar Trophin comes from nourishing in Greek When researchers turned on the betatrophin gene in the livers of diabetic lab mice the number of beta cells in their pancreas glands tripled within  days and their blood sugar went down Humans have betatrophin genes too as do all mammals So Harvards   thinks hes got his hands on something that just might get at a root cause of diabetes Im very excited about it Melton tells Shots It isnt every day one discovers a new hormone  especially one that affects the cell Im obsessed with the beta cell Hes not alone   of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston who wasnt involved in the work but is familiar with the findings also calls the discovery exciting Im sure this will stimulate a lot of work to look at effects of this protein and rapidly investigate whether this could be a new approach to treating diabetes Patti tells Shots Human experiments with betatrophin are several years off  perhaps five years Melton guesses First researchers need to make the hormone in large amounts then show it works consistently and safely in animals But at this early stage hopes are running high If Im right Melton says you would inject this hormone once a month or once a year give yourself new beta cells and they would then very accurately control blood sugars by instantaneously producing just the right amount of insulin They should reduce the complications of your disease because youre back to the normal control of your blood sugar Patti cautions that its rare theres a single unique hormone that does everything And she wonders whether people with   who are resistant to insulin make betatrophin in normal amounts If someone is insulinresistant why wouldnt he make more of this protein and respond to it Patti asks The question is Do diabetics make sufficient amounts of this hormone or not And if they do do they respond to it or are they resistant to it Melton acknowledges that his scenario of curing diabetes with periodic doses of betatrophin is the dream of what would happen Lets also remember that at the beginning of new discovery people like me are always very optimistic Melton says Im also cognizant of the fact that it could get complicated He notes that   another hormone was supposedly going to cure obesity when it was discovered in  But it hasnt worked out that way For the past decade Melton and his colleagues at the   have been pursuing a very different diabetescure strategy tricking   to morph into pancreatic beta cells That work continues and he hopes in the next year or so to report that were making bucket loads of beta cells derived from stem cells But meanwhile the group decided to explore what happens when mice are given a synthetic peptide developed some years back by the firm   that blocks insulin receptors Would mice given this peptide called S compensate by making more insulin We thought the mouses beta cells would either work harder to produce more insulin or really boost beta cell replication Melton says Luckily for them mice given S promptly started making more beta cells So then the researchers looked in various tissues  fat liver muscle brain  to see what genes were turned on What popped out near the top of the list of the most abundantly activated genes was this gene that no one had really studied that we called betatrophin Melton says Within a day or so after its release the hormone boosts beta cell replication up to thirtyfold And it doesnt seem to do anything else Thats important because it lowers the risk that betatrophin would cause unwanted side effects or even in the worst case promote cancer One intriguing discovery so far is that the betatrophin gene gets turned on in pregnant mice That makes sense since pregnancy requires a boost in insulin to enable the mother to keep blood sugar levels normal in the face of an increased carbohydrate load The Harvard researchers dont know yet if pregnant humans produce more betatrophin but they plan to find out Theyre also planning an ambitious agenda of followon experiments First they want to figure out how betatrophin works and look for the receptor on pancreas and possibly other cells that the hormone activates We dont need the receptor to pursue treatment possibilities Melton says but we would like to have it Second they want to make betatrophin in large amounts for further mouse and eventually human experiments Third they want to give betatrophin to rodents with diabetes  not just genetically induced disease but diabetes caused by overfeeding animals to make them obese the way that Type  diabetes is caused in humans They hope that giving such animals betatrophin will not only normalize their blood sugars but also prevent the heart blood vessel nerve and immune system complications that shorten the lives of people with diabetes Only that would be a true cure By the way Melton thinks that betatrophin might prevent   too the type that generally arises earlier in life after an overactive immune system destroys beta cells To do that youd have to identify people at risk of developing Type  diabetes  for instance because a sibling already had it  and monitor them for signs they were getting it too then giving betatrophin along with immunesuppressing drugs to halt the disease in its tracks Melton ticks off the pluses and minuses at this early stage On the positive side betatrophin is very robust in its activity its very specific to beta cells it improves animals handling of blood sugar and the human gene for it is virtually identical to the mouse gene Melton says On the negative side we dont know its mechanism of action and we havent yet demonstrated its safety and efficacy in humans he says There are enough positives at this point that betatrophin has already been licensed by   a division of Johnson  Johnson and a German biotech firm called   which already has  scientists working on betatrophin If Meltons wishes pan out a percentage of the huge potential profits would go not to him he says but to Harvard and his lab
