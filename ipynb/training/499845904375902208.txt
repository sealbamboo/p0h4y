When you sign up for a reporting fellowship to learn about the health of newborns in Ethiopia you expect things to be a little different from what youre used to in the US To be perfectly honest a little worse But Ethiopia actually surprised me even before I took off I did my research and it turns out that Ethiopias health care system is getting better  significantly better Its meeting international goals winning awards from the United States and more important babies are living longer and fewer mothers are dying in childbirth This is great news Maybe Ethiopia would be better than I expected I got some shots in the arm popped a few antimalaria pills and hoped for the best It was worse Now to be fair all those things I said before are true More babies are living through childbirth Infant mortality has decreased by  percent in the past  years But one in every  Ethiopian children still dies before turning  and one in every  children dies before age  Theres a ways to go Once I arrived it took me awhile to figure out what was actually happening with Ethiopias health care I was more involved in recovering from the jet lag that woke me up at  am every day and avoiding mosquitoes like the plague I was honestly a little mosquito obsessive I covered myself and each of my belongings with every repellent known to man cream spray patches bracelets small mechanized devices I needed all the help I could get  the little critters are hopelessly attracted to me Because I was having some trouble breaking out of my selfobsessed bubble Ethiopian health care didnt seem too bad at first We heard from Save the Children about all the improvements the country had made We visited a private maternityabortion clinic whose waiting room was a bunch of plastic chairs set up under a tarp outside I talked to the doctor there He said the last fatality at the clinic was more than a year ago The facility seemed clean and wellorganized and the doctor voiced confidence in his clinic The care seemed to be adequate It was the visit to Black Lion that put things into perspective Id heard about the hospital before The Ethiopian press reported a blackout in  that left seven patients in intensive care dead in  there was a sevenhour outage It didnt sound good Then theres the name conjuring a massive feral beast that chews people up limb by limb Ethiopians have a different perspective For them the hospital is pretty much the most important in the country Whatever you come down with wherever you come down with it if doctors cant treat your ailment where you are they send you to Black Lion There are fancy private clinics that cost more money and some can provide better care But for most Ethiopians the Black Lion is as good as it gets I visited in the morning on a typical day I was greeted by a broken front window a handpainted directory and crowds of people Whole families were camped out under the trees outside the main building and a thick stream of people were trying to move through the halls some with bandages and crutches others just trying to get by I was immediately aware of one problem cleanliness There are people whose job it is to keep the hospital clean They do their job but theyre no match for the people getting it dirty Whats more windows are open doors are open Its very openair Thats great for a market bad for a hospital The Ministry of Health doesnt collect statistics on hospitalacquired infections but several isolated studies have been done and the number hovers around a  percent infection rate In the US the rate is  percent The first place I visited was the neonatal unit on the sixth floor of the eightstory building With  patients and  beds the place was full Well I thought it was full but head nurse Berhena Mulat said they could usually treat many more Three to a bed was capacity Mulat was the first person I met at Black Lion Shed seen a lot of patients  and a lot of journalists visiting to report on the state of Ethiopias health care I asked her one of the questions we journalists ask when we want to know whats wrong What are you missing I asked What do you need here to do your job Youre a journalist she said It was true Mulat had a pretty good idea what journalists do  and what they dont do They dont hand out money and supplies to hospitals If you dont help me why do you ask me Ouch Once I recovered from the punch in the gut I realized what she was saying Other journalists had been here before They hung around asked some questions and then left never to be heard from  at least by her  again And Black Lion stayed the same Being the tenacious journalist I am I did convince her to answer my question  eventually And so I became aware of Major Problem No  a shortage of basic supplies Heres a shopping list Infants who are not too small or who have a case of jaundice  thats who Black Lion can help But for anyone who requires surgery Mulat says The outcome isnt good Downstairs in the pediatric unit parents were pushed out on the sidewalk in the garden corralled behind metal bars waiting Its hard to even squeeze into the hall to talk to people but I managed Thats where I met Zelem Abdissa He was a little easier to spot a full head above the crowd Hes one of the main pediatric nurses Kids come to Black Lion from all over the country he told me Abdissa does his best to help them but sometimes he cant If they cant afford its difficult to help One boy came with a collapsed lung Abdissa says thats just one of the problems Black Lion cant fix And if Black Lion cant help there is no other option The boy with the collapsed lung was referred abroad but his family couldnt afford the expense After two years in the hospital he died alone A lot of patients have been let down by Black Lion Abdissa sadly admitted He went through some files and steered me to another example Alizar Haile Gessesse lives with his sister his wife and his two children across the street from Black Lion Literally across the street His sister met me outside the hospital and walked me over I met the whole family at his house It was small modest but kind of lovely Seated Gessesse looks tall strong and very handsome But when he gets up to move from one room to another or even one chair to another his strength fails him His legs just wont cooperate He has some muscle control but not enough His condition requires him to rely on his family for everything even going to the bathroom He met me with a pile of papers in his lap He showed me all of them whole files that documented all the blood urine and tissue he volunteered with the hope that Black Lion could at least tell him what was wrong In exchange he received blood chemistry results total protein counts and these papers  papers that even now  years later he still doesnt fully understand He has learned one thing about his condition though This is more than our level more than our capacity in Ethiopia to diagnose Black Lion has no CT Scan no MRI Gessesse told me he has spent  on his treatment He was once an electrician when he first got sick his parents were alive and they could help A board of doctors told him to go abroad for treatment That was  years ago He still cant afford the trip Hes been across the street from Black Lion his condition deteriorating ever since After Black Lion I did some traveling around the country I saw some other health care facilities  fairly miserable hospitals where gardenvariety bugs commingled with patients A little farther out in the country I saw smaller clinics with one or two health care workers who were distributing birth control and teaching women about breastfeeding Those were the successes That was where Ethiopia was improving Oh that was also the place with the highest rate of malaria infection and of course I forgot my antimosquito medication Sigh Those little buggers penetrated my repellent fortress Two bites right under my fancy antimosquito bracelet But I knew I was going home Hopefully I wont get malaria but even if I do I know I wont be treated in an Ethiopian hospital which makes me a little happy and a little sad at the same time As a journalist if I cant help why do I even ask
