If youve ever gone grocery shopping while youre hungry you know the task can be a challenge Everything looks good Now new research confirms that grocery shopping when your stomach is rumbling is probably not a good idea  To hungry shoppers  may be more tempting than usual the researchers said  In the study researchers asked  people to come to their lab and to avoid eating for five hours before they came Upon arrival half of the participants were told they could eat as many wheat crackers as they wanted while the other half were not given any food  Both groups of participants were then asked to grocery shop in an online store that offered highcalorie foods such as candy salty snacks and red meat as well as lowcalorie foods such as fruits vegetable and chicken breasts  Participants who were hungry purchased more highcalorie products the researchers found On average  purchased  highcalorie products while the group that ate before shopping bought  highcalorie products  In a second experiment the researchers led by Brian Wansink director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University analyzed purchases of  people in a realworld grocery store They compared the purchases of those who went shopping between  pm and  pm an after lunch period when people are less likely to be hungry to those who went shopping between  and  pm when people are more likely to be hungry  Those who shopped between  pm and  pm bought fewer lowcalorie products compared with those who shopped between  pm and  pm buying eight products versus  products  Even shortterm food deprivation can lead to a shift in choices such that people choose less lowcalorie and relatively more highcalorie food options the researchers wrote in the May  issue of the Journal for the American Medical Association  The findings suggest people should be more careful about their choices when fooddeprived and possibly avoid choice situations when hungry by making choices while in less hungry states the researchers said  More from MyHealthNewsDaily
