If you are unable to think of a catchy creative way to present sales data or begin a newspaper column take a walk A brief stroll even around your office can significantly increase creativity according to a handy new study  Most of us have heard by now that exercise including walking generally improves thinking skills both immediately and in the longer term Multiple studies have shown that animals and people usually perform better after exercise on tests of memory and executive function which is essentially the ability to make decisions and organize thoughts although prolonged intense exercise can cause brief mental fatigue  so dont take a math test after a marathon Similarly exercise has long been linked anecdotally to creativity For millenniums writers and artists have said that they develop their best ideas during a walk although some of us also do our best procrastinating then  But little science has supported the idea that exercise aids creativity  So researchers at Stanford University recently decided to test that possibility inspired in part by their own strolls My adviser and I would go for walks to discuss thesis topics said Marily Oppezzo at the time a graduate student at Stanford And one day I thought Well what about this What about walking and whether it really has an effect on creativity With the enthusiastic support of her adviser Daniel Schwartz a professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Education Dr Oppezzo recruited a group of undergraduate students and set out to see if she could goose their creativity Gathering her volunteers in a deliberately dull unadorned room equipped with only a desk and somewhat unusually a treadmill Dr Oppezzo asked the students to sit and complete tests of creativity which in psychological circles might involve tasks like rapidly coming up with alternative uses for common objects such as a button Then the participants walked on the treadmill at an easy selfselected pace that felt comfortable The treadmill faced a blank wall While walking each student repeated the creativity tests which required about eight minutes  For almost every student creativity increased substantially when they walked Most were able to generate about  percent more uses for an object and the ideas were both novel and appropriate Dr Oppezzo writes in her study which was    But the practical import of that finding would seem to be negligible if creativity were to increase only while someone was walking Most of us cannot conduct brainstorming sessions on treadmills So Dr Oppezzo next tested whether the effects lingered after a walk had ended She had another group of students sit for two consecutive sessions of testtaking and subsequently walk for about eight minutes while  tossing out ideas for object reuse then sit and repeat the test  Again walking markedly improved peoples ability to generate creative ideas even when they sat down after the walk In that case the volunteers who had walked produced significantly more and subjectively better ideas than in their preexercise testing period  Finally to examine another realworld implication of walking and creativity Dr Oppezzo moved portions of the experiment outdoors Most people would probably guess that walking outside should be much better for creativity than pacing inside a drab office But surprisingly her study undermined that assumption When volunteers strolled  Stanfords pleasant leafy campus for about eight minutes they generated more creative ideas than when they sat either inside or outside for the same length of time But they were not noticeably more creative as a result of their pleinair walk than when they subsequently walked on an indoor treadmill facing a blank wall It really seems that its the walking that matters in terms of spurring creativity Dr Oppezzo said and not the setting Just how a brief casual stroll alters the various mental processes related to creativity remains unclear Dr Oppezzo added This is an acute effect she said making it distinct from any longterm physiological changes that exercise might produce inside the human brain It may be that walking improves mood as its primary effect she said and creativity blooms more easily within a buoyedup mind  Or walking may divert energy that otherwise would be devoted intentionally or not to damping down wild creative thought she said I think its possible that walking may allow the brain to break through some of its own hyperrational filters she said  But those are only a few of many likely explanations she said adding that she would probably go for a walk later to help her come up with other plausible theories and inventive experiments through which to test them
