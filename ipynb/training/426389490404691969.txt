Portland Maine native Hollis McLaughlins recollection of his mothers fish cookery produces a wistful expression as he takes a bite of the fish cakes given to him as part of the regular Wednesday night meal he is served free of charge at the     McLaughlins mother Kay worked for over  years on Portlands waterfront picking lobster and crab and packing sardines And she made fish cakes too for her eight children from whatever white fish was available on any particular day   But she certainly didnt use the Martha Stewart recipe that Carly Milkowski resource coordinator at Wayside Food Services a hunger relief operation tapped as the basic formula for the  fish cakes served to the  or so clients last Wednesday at Parkside   The yearold McLaughlin diplomatically refused to say which fish cake he liked better But Im having seconds of these now he said adding that hed love to have more fish in general on his plate at any of the free meals he receives weekly around the city   McLaughlin may soon get his wish thanks to an innovative new partnership between Wayside and the Maine Chapter of Hunters for the Hungry a national organization that matches up hunters who harvest more game than they can consume themselves with soup kitchens and food pantries that need proteins of all kinds to feed their patrons The Maine Hunters for the Hungry program is one of the few administered by the state government The state department of agriculture and food assistance foots the bill to process the meat which then gets distributed Since  the program has accepted bear deer and moose donations This year the total take was  pounds of game But a brandnew scheme being launched this week will bring sport fishermen into the fold  and hopefully a lot more fish into soup kitchens that help feed the hungry   Thats a big deal because despite its importance to a healthful diet fish can be hard to come by for food assistance organizations like Wayside Wayside rescues food and prepares it into meals that are served at community centers and churches throughout the city Don Morrison Waysides operations manager says his group serves up to nine meals weekly but fish is on the menu only once or twice monthly Even with the understanding that these meals are meant to be supplemental to clients whole diets Morrison concedes that rate doesnt make a big dent in the USDA recommendation of two servings of fish weekly   Morrison needs about  pounds of fish to produce the  meals that Wayside distributes to its lunch and dinner clients mostly working poor in any given week Currently he relies on periodic fish donations from Sysco local fishmongers   and   and   a communitysupported fishery   The barriers to rescuing good fish are high because of its short shelf life says Morrison Partner wholesale and retail suppliers currently work with Morrison to freeze fish for Wayside that would go off before their next retail opportunity Were getting great fish But it takes a while to add up to the volume we need he says adding that multispecies dishes like fish cakes casseroles and chowders make it to the menu most frequently   Morrison hatched a new fish acquisition plan with Jason T Hall director of the states emergency food assistance program They decided to harness the fish that gets wasted at the states many fishing derbies   There are only a couple of winners at each derby explains Hall But hundreds of fishermen are pulling up and holding onto their three biggest fishes until the end of the day when the judging takes place The losing fishes  most often brown and brook trout  are often just discarded   The pair will be setting up a tent at both the   in New Gloucester on Jan  and the Sebago Lake Rotary Ice Fishing Derby on Feb  Donated fish will be put on ice and brought to Salt  Seas facility to be filleted Its not yet known how much fish these efforts will yield but Morrison and Hall are hoping to pull in about  pounds of fish at Crystal Lake And they have both heard rumors of upwards of  pounds of fish going to waste at last years Sebago Lake event   Those are the ones we want to catch says Morrison an avid allseason fisherman and mostofthetime pescatarian   Morrison also has his eyes on the big ocean fishing competitions that take place throughout the Casco Bay region in the summer   Of course were not going to get a  tuna donated he says but getting three or four pound sharks would help feed a lot of people
