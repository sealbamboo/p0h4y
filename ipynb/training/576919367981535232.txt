Social care should be free to everyone at the end of life says a report by the Commons Health Committee which calls for better recording of what people want in their last days  said there was unacceptable variation in the care received by people in England Care minister Norman Lamb said the government was looking carefully at a policy of free endoflife social care Endoflife care is defined as people expected to die within  months Most have incurable or progressive illnesses  The health committee report based on evidence from clinicians charities and palliative care experts found great variation in quality and practice across both acute and community settings It recommended that one senior person in each NHS Trust be given responsibility for monitoring how endoflife care is delivered Committee chairwoman Dr Sarah Wollaston MP said We must make sure that specialist palliative care expertise is accessible within hospitals and community settings as well as within our hospices Around  people die each year in England and Wales  which conducts research into palliative care approximately  of deaths occur in NHS hospitals with around  occurring at home  in care homes  in hospices and  elsewhere This is despite the fact that twothirds of people say they would prefer to die at home and  say they would prefer to die in a hospice Linda Aitchisons husband Neil died from skin cancer nearly three years ago  She said his last days in hospital were undignified The problem for us was there was a wonderful team of cancer care specialists within the hospital who did amazing work but there werent enough beds in that unit up until sort of  hours before he died So he ended up for a week in a general medical care ward where staff had no training and no understanding of any needs of someone who wasnt going to get better It was very shocking for all of us as a family to deal with that Diana Stevensons father spent his last weeks with pancreatic cancer at home She said that having carers from the charity Marie Curie visiting every day helped the family give her dad the death he had wanted The reassurance that you got as a family that you had professionals coming in that you could ask questions and that would give you help was enormous So we could have gone down the hospital route but we wanted to give Dad a good death because you get one death and I strongly believe that you should make it as a good as an experience as possible As a family it sounds strange but we had a lovely six weeks together The committee said too often staff felt they lacked the confidence and training to talk about endoflife issues with patients It recommended all staff should also be given relevant training on care planning and bereavement support should be offered to families It also said it wanted the government to ensure that noone died in hospital rather than at home for want of a social care package of support Care Minister Norman Lamb said the government was examining the merits of free social care at the end of life We are looking carefully at the costs and benefits of this policy but we know that thanks to the hard work of health and care staff and carers many people already receive good endoflife care  The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the overs The care calculator covers both residential care and the support provided in peoples own homes for tasks such as washing and dressing  Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website with news stories analysis and video We are determined to improve further and by April  of clinical commissioning groups should be capable of using electronic records to share endoflife care choices across the health and care system so peoples wishes can be respected  Mr Lamb said that when this happened more people died where they wanted to be at home with loved ones However Dr Jane Collins chief executive of charity Marie Curie said the current situation had to change We see a big difference depending on the diagnosis so youre more likely to get good care if you have cancer  The majority of people say they do not get the care and support they need and still around half of people in the UK die in hospital despite this being the more expensive option and the place where most people say they would not want to die  The challenge for the next government is clear  there needs to be a dramatic improvement in access to highquality care in the community available for people early on in their illnesses so that they can live well and stay out of hospital for as long as possible
