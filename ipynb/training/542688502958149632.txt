An online contest for data scientists has produced a great leap forward in efforts to predict when someone with epilepsy is going to have a seizure The winning team used data on electrical activity in the brain to develop an algorithm that predicted seizures  percent of the time That blew the top off previous efforts says   a professor of neurology and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania who helped oversee the competition In the past he says researchers have struggled to find an algorithm that did better than chance This has real clinical potential says   acting director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke a sponsor of the contest Wed like to develop therapies that come in when they are needed instead of people taking medicine all the time Epilepsy which is often compared to an electrical storm in the brain affects nearly  percent of people worldwide The most common treatment is medication which can leave people feeling tired or dizzy Other options include surgery and a new type of implanted   that uses electrical pulses to prevent seizures A better prediction algorithm has the potential to make implanted devices more effective Ideally the devices would work a bit like a heart defibrillator  only delivering electrical current when its needed The result of the   announced at the American Epilepsy Societys annual meeting in Seattle showed the value of sharing a complex problem in neuroscience with experts from unrelated fields The winning team included a mathematician and an engineer but no doctor Neuroscience needs these people to help solve our problems Koroshetz says The contest with a first prize of  was sponsored by NINDS the American Epilepsy Society and the Epilepsy Foundation More than  teams entered via Kagglecom a website that allows researchers and companies to post data in the cloud for competitors to analyze an approach known as crowdsourcing Data came from recordings of electrical activity in the brains of both people and dogs with epilepsy Competitors had access to hundreds of hours of recordings made before and during epileptic seizures The winning team had five members from the US and Australia The US part of the team included Drew Abbot a software engineer and Phillip Adkins a mathematician who knows a lot about machine learning Both work at   a small company in California thats best known for improving the motion detection capabilities of Wii video game consoles The contest was simply another fun challenge Abbot says The hardest part he says was finding a way to detect useful patterns in a huge amount of data Adkins had previously worked on an algorithm to determine blood glucose levels using laser light But that problem required a very different approach he says Toward the end of the epilepsy competition the top teams were improving their algorithms daily We just kept jumping up the leaderboard Adkins says Hopefully we have inched medical science a step forward NINDS and the American Epilepsy Society also sponsored a second   with a  prize for detecting a seizure in progress That competition was won by Michael Hills an Australian software engineer who developed an algorithm that was correct  percent of the time
