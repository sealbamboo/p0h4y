Dr Kim A Williams the presidentelect of the American College of Cardiology often sees patients who are overweight and struggling with hypertension Type  diabetes and high cholesterol One of the things he advises them to do is to change their diets Specifically he tells them to go vegan Dr Williams became a vegan in  because he was concerned that his LDL cholesterol  the kind associated with an increased risk of heart disease  was too high Dr Williams wrote about his reasons for going vegan and his belief in the cardiovascular benefits of a plantbased diet in   at MedPage Today Veganism has grown in popularity in recent years reflected by the explosion of meatfree cookbooks and restaurants and veganfriendly products in grocery stores But the endorsement by the man who is set to become the president of one of the countrys leading cardiology associations which helps formulate health policies and guidelines did not strike a totally positive chord I didnt know it would create such a firestorm of everything from accolades to protests said Dr Williams who is also the chairman of cardiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago The response was really loud and much of it diametrically opposed One person suggested he was promoting a radical diet to his patients based on the experience of a single person himself Others accused him of trying to get the college of cardiology to encourage everyone to go vegan which he dismissed And some critics suggested that Dr Williams and the college were unduly influenced by industry which baffled him Who is the industry that promotes vegan dieting he asked Maybe the people who publish books on it But that wouldnt be considered industry I dont think Dr Williams said that his switch to veganism was prompted by a routine blood test about  years ago The test showed that his LDL cholesterol which had been  a couple years earlier had climbed to  Dr Williams who was about  at the time said he assumed that age and physical activity had played a role his once frequent levels of exercise had fallen and cholesterol tends to rise as people get older But he also suspected that his diet was not as healthy as he had thought I was basically eating chicken and fish no skin no fried food and no red meat he said I thought it was healthy But it was low fat instead of low cholesterol which is what I needed Researchers   that the relationship between the dietary cholesterol found in food and the cholesterol that circulates in the blood is complicated   from one person to the next In many people the cholesterol in food has only a minor or negligible effect on blood cholesterol levels But in some people the effect can be more pronounced which Dr Williams said was probably the case with him He eliminated cholesterol from his diet by avoiding dairy and animal protein to see if there would be any effect Instead of eating chicken and fish he started eating vegetablebased meat substitutes like veggie burgers and sausages made from soy and other plant proteins and nuts He also switched to almond milk from cows milk Six weeks later his LDL had fallen to  It seems that the response to dietary cholesterol and other changes in diet are all genetically determined and quite variable he said One person might go from  to  by going to a plantbased diet Another person might go from  to  Although LDL plays a role in heart disease it is not the only factor The plaque that accumulates in arteries consists not only of cholesterol but immune cells that invade the artery walls as a result of chronic inflammation Some   that this inflammation is the underlying problem in coronary artery disease But Dr Williams says he believes that being vegan can lower inflammation too He said his enthusiasm for plantbased diets was based on his interpretation of medical literature He   of tens of thousands of members of the Seventhday Adventist Church that found that people following vegetarian diets lived longer than meat eaters and had lower rates of death from heart disease diabetes and kidney problems And he pointed to   who found that patients who were put on a program that included a vegetarian diet had less coronary plaque and fewer cardiac events But Dr Williams said he readily acknowledged that such studies were not conclusive Observational studies like those carried out on the Seventhday Adventists show correlations but they cannot establish cause and effect And the study by Dr Ornish was a small randomized trial that in addition to diet included a number of interventions Besides becoming vegetarians the patients also gave up smoking started exercising and had stressmanagement training The extent to which diet played a role in the outcome is difficult to know Critics also point out that the Ornish diet restricts not only meat but refined carbohydrates like added sugars and white flour which have been implicated in cardiovascular disease   Dr Williams said he thought the research on the benefits of substituting nuts beans and plant protein for meat was strong but largely observational But he was not arguing that the college of cardiology should promote veganism in its dietary guidelines He said he would like to see large extensive clinical trials of such diets that pass muster first Plenty of things that looked promising based on correlations that were identified in observational studies were later found to be problematic he said like vitamin E hormonereplacement therapy folic acid and most recently the HDLraising drug niacin There is a long list of things that based on observational trials we thought were beneficial and then a randomized trial done for a long period of time showed that it wasnt he said So I approach all of this with a sense of humility and an open mind In the meantime he said he has made a habit of telling patients who are obese and plagued by metabolic problems like Type  diabetes to try exercising and eating less meat And he discusses some of his favorite vegan foods with them I recommend a plantbased diet because I know its going to lower their blood pressure improve their insulin sensitivity and decrease their cholesterol he said And so I recommend it in all those conditions Some patients are able to do it and some are not
