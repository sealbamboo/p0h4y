In  the federal government told drugmakers they had to give steep discounts to hospitals that treat a large percentage of poor patients    The law got bipartisan support and it was a boon for   and the federal government In the decades that followed the discount program has grown by leaps and bounds But this spring as the feds have been drawing up new rules for the program a pitched battle has broken out between hospitals and drug manufacturers who say the program known as   is bloated and badly regulated    The drugmakers say the law is meant to benefit patients like David Chance He turned up at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital in Portland a few weeks ago saying it was hard to breathe every time he laid down    They put a catheter in the vein in my leg that goes up to my heart injected some dye so they could see the circulation around and in the vessels around the heart he says    Chance has an enlarged heart and a valve that doesnt close properly Ill be changing my diet and on prescriptions for a little while he says    Those prescriptions include a cholesterollowering statin and a blood thinner that cost about  a month Chance works at a Portland area call center and doesnt have health insurance so the hospital is using its B funds to give Chance his first month of prescription medicine free    Yeah its great he says Id probably be having difficulties affording them otherwise    Chances case is an example of what the drug companies say B hospitals should be doing with the discounts helping poor and vulnerable patients     But heres the rub Sometimes instead of passing on drug discounts to patients like Chance the hospitals sell the medicines at higher prices to their insured patients The hospitals use the proceeds to fund clinics staff and other services that the hospitals say benefit everyone The law allows them to do that the hospitals say because its a way to stretch scarce federal resources a phrase thats in the law    OHSUs   assistant director of pharmacy services says such drug sales are justifiable under the B program because some drugs  such as those for chemotherapy instance  cant simply be handed over to patients Their administration has to be supervised by doctors and nurses which is expensive    The ones were talking about are the ones injected into your veins and they can take several hours to infuse for a single course of therapy he says This can happen for five six days a week six weeks at a time so its very intense There are side effects so its important to have a nurse there and a doctor    But hospitals are reselling all kinds of drugs to covered patients not just chemotherapy drugs says Stephanie Silverman who is with the   a lobbying group made up of drug companies and medical organizations Thats not what the program was designed for Silverman says It was not designed to provide other revenues to support the operations of hospitals    About onethird of the nations  hospitals are in the B program Drugmakers say that slice has swollen in recent years and the program needs to be better controlled    For example says Silverman many hospitals have been buying up doctor practices or clinics which havent qualified for the B program then bringing them under the hospital umbrella    Hospitals are not only trying to maximize their own B revenues theyre looking to acquire  and they are acquiring  many community oncology practices putting them in their system she says And by doing so they can all of a sudden tap into new revenues they couldnt get before    OHSUs Fazio says acquiring doctor practices is one way of keeping health care costs down I wouldnt go so far as saying there are hospitals gaming the system but this is an incredibly complex program he says I will say that there are institutions out there that maybe dont understand all the rules    For all the disagreement both the hospitals and the drug manufacturers agree that the federal government needs to clarify or rewrite the B rules A recent court decision had   whether the new rules would be released but the federal Health Resources and Services Administration that oversees B   to release those new rules this month
