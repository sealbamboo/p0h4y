Women who work out with weights an hour a week cut their risk of developing Type  diabetes and yoga or stretching exercises count too according to a study that tracked the health of almost  women Doctors have long known that regular exercise   but thats always been translated as aerobic exercise like jogging or brisk walking More recent studies have suggested that weight training or other forms of nonaerobic exercise might help too But those studies were all done in men Women this ones for you This study used data from the massive  from the Harvard School of Public Health Researchers asked  women in their s s and s about their exercise habits twice from  to  and then looked to see if they developed Type  diabetes by  They found that women who did musclestrengthening and conditioning activities had a lower diabetes risk even if they didnt get aerobic exercise For each  minutes of activity in a week the women reduced their risk of diabetes by about  percent Women who did musclestrengthening and conditioning exercise more than  minutes a week lowered their diabetes risk by  percent The biggest surprise is that yoga and supposedly lighter forms of exercise also counted The researchers dont know why but they speculate that they help prevent the loss of lean muscle mass or affect how the body uses glucose Adding in aerobic exercise helped even more Women who did at least  minutes of aerobic exercise and  minutes of musclestrengthening exercise weekly reduced their diabetes risk by twothirds Those who were overweight or obese showed the biggest benefit The   were published in   Of course this good news comes with caveats Doesnt it always The women who were exercising also tended to be making more healthful food choices and weighed less and were less likely to have a family history of diabetes Most of the study participants were Caucasian And all the womens exercise habits were selfreported so they could be fudging But the sheer size of this study which has been the source of landmark findings such as the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy makes it more likely that the results are reliable The federal government    minutes a week of moderateintensity aerobic activity for adults and at least two days a week of musclestrengthening exercise But something is better than nothing This   from the National Institutes of Health suggests starting with  minutes a day then adding in an additional five or  minutes every few weeks Enjoy
