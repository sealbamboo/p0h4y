Weve written lots lately about the potentially   and the public policy efforts to   Now comes a new   published in   which finds that Americans who consumed the most sugar  about a quarter of their daily calories  were twice as likely to die from heart disease as those who limited their sugar intake to  percent of their total calories To translate that into a calorieaday diet the big sugar eaters were consuming  calories a day from sugar  thats  teaspoons Those who tamed their sweet tooth the most by contrast were taking in about  calories a day from sugar  or about  teaspoons per day Unfortunately most Americans have a sugar habit that is pushing toward the danger zone The average American is consuming  teaspoons a day Thats about three times whats recommended says   of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine Now we should point out were not talking fruit here Researchers did not include the sugar naturally occurring in fruit or milk Instead the study focused specifically on the risks of   sugar  the refined sugars and corn syrups added to foods such as baked goods and sugary sodas So how much   sugar is OK Well the American Heart Association   that women consume no more than  teaspoons of sugar daily This is about  calories And men no more than  teaspoons or about  calories from sugar The World Health Organization says people should get no more than  percent of their daily calories from sugar And the last time the federal government weighed in on sugar was in the   which make only a broad recommendation to reduce consumption of added sugar So how best to reduce sugar Some steps are fairly obvious For example eliminating one ounce can of sugarsweetened soda can cut about  teaspoons of sugar But other common sources of added sugar can take you by surprise For example this morning I ate a small ounce cup of lowfat organic peach yogurt I chalked it up as a very healthful breakfast but when I looked at the nutrition label it had  grams of sugar You just shot most of your wad for the day Schmidt points out So yeah swap those sweetened yogurts for plain yogurt A typical ounce serving of vanilla yogurt has about  teaspoons of sugar  which is about as much as a regular size   bar Bottom line Read the labels Most nutrition labels list sugar in grams Four grams of sugar is equivalent to about one teaspoon And dont get forgot to count sugar if youre eating out There can be lots of sugar added to breakfast foods For instance stopping at Starbucks to pick up a blueberry muffin with your latte That muffin according to the Starbucks website contains  grams of sugar or roughly  teaspoons And an   at Dunkin Donuts will set you back  grams of sugar  thats more than a days worth of added sugar Theres a lot of variability in baked goods For instance another option at Dunkin Donuts the   has much less sugar  grams
