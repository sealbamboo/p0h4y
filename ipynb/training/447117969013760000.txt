Ecigarettes arent yet federally regulated as tobacco products but many cities and some states are already moving to include the devices in their smoking bans Such bans are raising a debate about whether ecigarettes should be permitted to be used in smokefree workplaces Gary Nolan was a twopackaday cigarette smoker until he switched to ecigs Now Nolan who hosts a libertarian talk show based in Columbia Mo freely puffs  or vapes as its come to be called  at work Im in a closed studio Nolan says There are no open windows I can vape in here while Im on the air in fact and people can walk in and out and not even know it if they dont see it in my hands The devices come in various cigarette or pipelike shapes and heat a chemical mixture of mostly nicotine and water Theyre often billed as a smokeless alternative to tobacco thats gentler to both the smoker and to those around them Nolan says he saves  minutes out of every hour by vaping at his desk instead of trekking outside to smoke and hes noticed that other people in his building have made the switch too They do vape in their offices and in the building Nolan says I walk around with this thing all day long Whats it like Nolan says its satisfying to him and odorless and unobtrusive to everyone he works with But there are plenty of people who disagree that ecigarettes  also known as vape pens  should be allowed in the workplace Smoking is smoking is smoking says Cynthia Hallett executive director of the   a group that organized in the s and s to support antismoking laws in the workplace Ecigarettes are definitely reigniting old debates says Hallett I feel like Im in a time machine Im having a terrible case of deja vu As more traditional tobacco companies such as Altria and Reynolds invest more in the budding ecigarette business Hallett says the rhetoric suggesting that vaping is a more healthful alternative ramps up  Gee I cant smell it so therefore its not a problem should not be your benchmark for determining whether or not ecigarettes are dangerous Hallett says In fact little is known yet about which chemical compounds are in the products and what their health impact might be In the absence of such information employers are unsure whether to limit ecigarette use in the office says Michael Wood a senior health benefits consultant for   Our recommendation is that employers should exclude ecigarettes just like they do any other form of tobacco within their policies Wood says He doesnt think most employers have policies on ecigarettes at least not yet The federal government doesnt have a specific policy yet either The Food and Drug Administration has indicated that it intends to apply the same regulations to ecigarettes and other inhalable nicotine products that it does to tobacco products and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is starting to look at the health effects of vaping Part of the problem in researching the health effects of ecigarettes is that there are so many different types of similar products that its hard to do a generalized study says Tim McAfee director of the CDCs office on smoking and health We just dont know whats in them and we dont know how much of whats in them would get out into the environment  but the assumption would be that it would says McAfee It stands to reason he says that pregnant women and former smokers should limit their exposure  including in the workplace  to the nicotine in the aerosol vapor of ecigarettes Not everyone in the ecigarette industry is resistant to the idea of FDA review or regulation I think a big problem is that where there is an absence of law theres also an absence of understanding and cultural etiquette says   president of the SmokeFree Alternatives Trade Association  president of Logic one of the countrys biggest makers of ecigarettes says he encourages more research about the science We think adult smokers should know the harm impact difference between a combustiblebased cigarette and an electronic cigarette Martin says Regardless of where the science and policy come out Martin says he does not believe ecigarettes are about to roll back the calendar I dont think youre going to see this rush back to the s he says where people are vaping in movie theaters and in planes and while theyre visiting their kid at their school And he doesnt think most employers are going to embrace vaping at work either
