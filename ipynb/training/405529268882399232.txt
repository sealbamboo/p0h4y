Soluble painkillers used by millions of people in Britain could pose a health risk because they are high in salt UK researchers are warning Some formulations taken at maximum dose tip users over the recommended daily sodium intake for an adult with potentially dangerous consequences the study authors say Their work in the BMJ looks at the outcomes for  million UK patients  It found a link between effervescent tablets and heart attacks and stroke  All medicines that contain at least mmol or mg of sodium  a component of salt  in each dose are required to declare on their labelling that the product contains sodium   The accompanying patient information leaflet provides information on the quantity of sodium and includes a warning to patients on a lowsodium diet to take the amount of sodium in the medicine into account    Compared with patients taking the same drugs without salt those who regularly took effervescent or soluble medications increased their risk of having a heart attack stroke or dying from a vascular cause by a fifth   They were also seven times more likely to develop high blood pressure or hypertension which the researchers say is at the root of the problem  Lead researcher Dr Jacob George from Dundee University said We know that high salt causes hypertension and that hypertension leads to stroke The British Heart Foundation said it was important to remember that the research applied to people who were taking these medicines every day  it did not mean that occasional use could damage your heart health  Effervescent medicines contain a substance called bicarbonate which helps them fizz and dissolve and this is often combined with sodium The study looked at  different prescribed effervescent medicines including common painkillers such as paracetamol and aspirin as well as supplements  But Dr George said many more people bought these types of treatment from chemists without a prescription He said that people needed to be aware of the risks and drug manufacturers should look at cutting the salt content of their products  In the study sodium levels in tablets ranged from as low as mmol to as high as mmol  approximately a fifth of a teaspoon  The recommended sodium intake for an adult in the UK is mmol per day  A person who takes the maximum daily dose of eight tablets of soluble paracetamol for example would ingest mmol of sodium which exceeds their daily salt allowance  If you then took in to account the dietary salt a person was likely to get from the food that they ate their overall salt intake could be dangerously high said Dr George  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA said it kept a close check on the safety of all licensed medicines We will carefully review the findings of this new research said a spokeswoman We recommend that people with questions about their salt intake should read the patient information leaflet and speak to their GP the MHRA said But Prof Gareth Beevers of Blood Pressure UK said many consumers would be unaware of the risks  It is extraordinary to think that sodium has been hiding in our medicines all this time   Without clear labelling on these products it is impossible to know how much additional sodium you would be eating so it is shocking to find you could be having more than your daily maximum from medicines alone Eating too much sodium  in any form  puts up our blood pressure which puts you at increased risk of strokes and heart attacks the biggest killers in the world
