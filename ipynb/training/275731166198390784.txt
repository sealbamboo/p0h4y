A few days ago two big names in food policy squared off for a formal debate on the following proposition  who leads the   led the antiindustry charge He was opposed by   a softspoken South African who provoked much headscratching in  when he left the World Health Organization to take a senior executive job at PepsiCo Yach recently left PepsiCo to join   an arm of a South African insurance company that promotes wellness The proposition they debated contained some hidden historical spice At the close of the debate moderator Thomas Bollyky revealed that it was lifted from a landmark international   called the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control FCTC adopted in  The words tobacco industry were simply replaced by food and beverage industry and on obesity added Interestingly Yach was one of the architects of this treaty while at the WHO So is PepsiCo really todays Phillip Morris Brownell certainly thinks so At the debate sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations and held in its posh midtown Manhattan building Brownell argued that food companies are fundamentally untrustworthy He pointed to cases in which the industry set up front groups to fight a soda tax in California and fought national guidelines that would restrict the marketing of unhealthy food to children Perhaps because Yach stood beside him or perhaps because of the pompous surroundings  David Rockefeller gazed down on the speakers from an enormous portrait on the wall  Brownell kept his rhetoric rather muted In an   that he authored earlier this year however he hinted at parallels with Munich  When the history of the worlds attempt to address obesity is written the greatest failure may be collaboration with and appeasement of the food industry The food industry can do some good things Brownell admitted when it comes to fighting hunger or promoting sustainable agricultural practices But obesity is a different kettle of fish because solving it conflicts directly with the industrys most basic imperative To sell more food All of the industrys muchcelebrated healthy eating campaigns and partnerships with public health initiatives Brownell says amount to baby steps that simply obscure this basic fact Brownell dismissed the idea that companies could also prosper by selling better healthier more expensive food Theres no evidence globally that this market will be more than a niche he said Yach for his part didnt bother trying to defend the entire industry or its current practices and products He pointed instead to signs of a future still unfolding The real parallel to obesity isnt tobacco Yach said but climate change  a problem that will demand the expertise of industry Just as energy companies once just tried to sell more oil the multinational food and beverage business model has favored quantity over quality he admitted And just as energy companies are now investing in green energy the food industry is starting to realize that this must change if if is to survive and prosper I witnessed the intensity of change while at PepsiCo for the last five years The market share of mid and lowcalorie beverages in PepsiCos lineup he said was only  percent five years ago Today it is  percent and is likely to reach  per cent within the next five to eight years And this is happening even in a recession in a climate where shortterm pressures are intense Yachs most powerful words came near the end of the debate in impromptu remarks that he added to his prepared script The debate by this time had turned to the question of whether food industry representatives should be barred from policymaking discussions related to food similar to a ban that governments have placed on scientists sponsored by the tobacco industry Yach argued that the food industry is already changing and theres more change in store if the conversation continues We have to recognize that drawing opponents into debate changes them forever he said I saw that happen in South Africa with apartheid And I dont think that obesity is a bigger problem than what could have happened in South Africa if you hadnt gone down the road of constructive engagement  We need more engagement not less
