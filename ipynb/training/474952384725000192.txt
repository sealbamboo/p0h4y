We Americans love our fried shrimp our   and our fish sticks And a lot of other people around the world count on fish as a critical part of their diet too According to the Food and Agriculture Organization fish now accounts for almost  percent of the worlds intake of protein  in some coastal and island countries its as high as  percent To keep up with the worlds growing population and its appetite for seafood we cant just rely on wild fish Already were getting more of it from aquaculture And that farmed fish production will have to more than double by  to meet demand according to a   by the   The potential environmental implications of that are pretty daunting The worlds oceans and rivers and lakes are fished to their limit says Richard Waite a researcher with WRI So the aquaculture industry has to step up he says But if aquaculture were to more than double and we dont improve the sectors efficiency its environmental impact will double as well But if its done right aquaculture can grow without taking a major toll on the environment the WRI researchers say Fish and shellfish are already among the most ecofriendly sources of animal protein Waite tells The Salt They dont emit anywhere near the amount of greenhouse gases that   and most farmed fish convert feed into edible meat very efficiently Producing an additional  million tons of farmed fish per year by  Waite says would be much easier on the planet than producing an additional  million tons of beef So sustainable farmed fish may be a great way to help feed the worlds poor the report says But largescale aquaculture can have significant environmental consequences It can take a lot of wild fish to   certain farmed fish And when tons of fish are crowded together they create a lot of waste which can   Fish farms can also be breeding grounds for disease Plus shrimp farming in Indonesia is at least partly responsible for the regions   forests It doesnt have to be that way the researchers say Theres a lot the industry can do to become more efficient Waite tells us Some are trying to boost efficiency by building fish factories on land as NPRs Dan Charles   in April Reevaluating what we feed farmed fish will also help a lot Waite adds Over the past  years farms have greatly reduced the amount of fish meal they use in their feed the report finds As weve noted a few salmon farms in South Africa are replacing fish meal with   to take fish farms pressure off the oceans And while fish farmers will naturally want to become more efficient and productive since it makes them more money Waite says it also helps when governments provide incentives to adopt sustainable practices What can consumers do The report recommends eating more seafood thats lower on the food chain Tilapia catfish carp  as well as mollusks like oysters scallops and clams  dont require as much feed Mollusks are the planets most environmentally sustainable source of animal protein Waite says They dont use any land they dont use any freshwater and they actually clean up the environment around them Overall Waite says aquaculture doesnt have to be destructive But its also not a panacea for the environment or world hunger It can be done well or it can be done badly he says
