For more than a decade scientists have been saying that a genomic revolution will transform medicine making it possible to scan all of a persons DNA to predict risk and customize medical care Well weve got the machines Wheres the revolution Getting closer say researchers at Stanford University who tested the technology on  people But not quite ready for every doctors office We were witness to the birth of this idea and now we feel like we have an unruly teenager on our hands says   an associate professor of medicine and genetics at Stanford and an author of the study Its going to take some tough love The   was published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association Wholegenome scanning uses machines to plow through all of a persons DNA looking for variations that could be associated with disease Though until now its been used rarely for diagnosing patients its becoming increasingly fast and affordable Machines are now able to run a wholegenome scan in a day or two at a cost of just a few thousand dollars Quick and affordable maybe but not necessarily accurate When the Stanford researchers compared wholegenome scans done on two different machines they found that the results matched up just onethird of the time for genetic variants that could signal a risk of inherited disease Thats not good enough we need to do better than that Ashley told Shots But he thinks thats a solvable problem especially with a technology thats improving so quickly But even if the genome scanners become more accurate doctors will still have to grapple with what all that data means When a mutation is found geneticists have to comb back through published studies on genes and disease in people and animals looking for a match If its for a disease caused by a single mutation like cystic fibrosis thats a cinch But if its for something like heart disease which involves many many mutations that vary from one person to the next its devilishly hard And many of the databases used to look for meaning have errors themselves the researchers say One of the  people in this study did have a previouslyunknown mutation that predisposed her to breast and ovarian cancer For her having her genome scanned could be life saving But for the other  there were no revelations You find a lot of stuff thats much harder to determine what do to with says Dr W Gregory Feero a geneticist and faculty member for the MaineDartmouth family medicine program He wrote an  accompanying the Stanford study titled Proceed With Care With the Stanford volunteers it took a lot of human effort to try to figure that out Each had  to  genetic variants and it took an average of an hour of expert time to try to figure out what they meant Scanning and interpretation cost about  per person the Stanford group said Still Ashley says people shouldnt dismiss genomic medicine as mere hype The worst thing would be if the hype overcame this and people said we werent delivering Theres opportunity here to transform medicine
