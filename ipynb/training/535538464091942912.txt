Diabetes is an expensive disease to treat costing the United States  billion in  according to an analysis of the diseases economic burden When the loss of productivity due to illness and disability is added in the bill comes to  billion or  a year for each American including those without diabetes Thats  percent higher than the same benchmark in  not a healthy trend The increase is being driven by a growing and aging population the report finds as well as more common risk factors like obesity and higher medical costs For a person diagnosed with diabetes the average economic burden was  a year Caring for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes cost  a year Undiagnosed diabetes costs  a case and prediabetes or having abnormal blood sugar that doesnt met the diagnostic criteria for diabetes  Those last two reflect the fact that people with undiagnosed diabetes or elevated glucose tend to go to the doctor more often Costs were generally higher in older people not surprising since it can take years for the diseases more devastating complications like heart attacks blindness and nerve damage to develop About  million people have been diagnosed with   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  million of them havent yet been diagnosed Another  million or  percent of adults have prediabetes which is more common as people age And though the symptoms of gestational diabetes usually recede when a woman gives birth both she and her child are at higher risk for Type  diabetes The researchers at the IHS Life Sciences economic consulting group combed data from multiple sources including hospital discharges private insurers and Medicare to come up with the trend lines The various data sources vary so its hardly the last word But it provides a solid look at the trend  The researchers didnt differentiate the costs of Type  diabetes an autoimmune disease and Type  which occurs later in life and is affected by lifestyle choices But in an analysis of  data found that Type  accounted for  percent of people with diabetes and  percent of the economic burden In other words the cost per case of Type  is higher but because many more people have Type  its responsible for most of the economic burden  The   were published Thursday in   The economists crunched the numbers for individual states too West Virginia had the highest rate of people diagnosed with diabetes at  percent Alabama Arkansas Delaware Florida Kentucky Louisiana and Mississippi all posted rates over  percent Alaska had the lowest diabetes rates in  at  percent followed by Utah Colorado Montana and Vermont all under  percent These grim numbers underscore the urgency to better understand the cost mitigation potential of prevention and treatment strategies the authors write In other words We better get cracking Heres just one example of how were failing to help people with diabetes just  percent of people diagnosed with diabetes in  or  were given diabetes selfmanagement training according to another  released Wednesday this one from the CDC That training typically includes getting people up to speed on treatment options healthy eating and exercise detecting and treating complications and developing personalized strategies for decision making For people who werent prescribed medication to manage their diabetes not getting diabetes management training could mean that their diabetes remains essentially untreated the report finds And these were people with health insurance Its hard to imagine that the numbers could be worse but they almost certainly would be for people who are uninsured
