When you have a child off at college you worry about his general health state of mind    and as you sign those tuition checks academic achievement But how much thought do you give to your childs roommate The college roommate relationship has been the focus of research in recent years Economists and social scientists have used randomly paired roommates to examine peer effects and the ways that student behavior may be shaped by the luck of the draw The studies show that roommate assignments can affect everything from academic performance to freshman weight gain Drinking habits can also have an impact The bottom line was we found that when youre matched with a roommate who drinks alcohol your grades are likely to go down said   a senior lecturer in public policy at Harvard and coauthor of a    When this research was originally published some parents worried about the dangers posed by social contagion in the peer group But more recent research has provided some surprising  and for parents rather reassuring  information about the way that students are affected by the mental illness of a roommate In a study published last year   an associate professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan who directs   including roommate issues and his colleagues     problems dont seem to be contagious so to speak to a large degree between roommates Dr Eisenberg told me For example being assigned to a roommate with depressive symptoms doesnt increase the likelihood of someone having an increase in their own depressive symptoms Another  study showed that   the others examined by the researchers like smoking   and sex with multiple partners were not affected by a roommates practices But even if mental health problems dont cross the room like   or   plenty of issues  whether smaller distractions or larger moral dilemmas  may be posed by life with a roommate who is struggling Imagine you are a college freshman living at substantial expense to your parents in a relatively small space with someone who has been assigned to you in the interest of broadening your horizons and building strong peer relationships  or something to that effect And you are beginning to feel that something is wrong with your roommate He seems to have stopped going to class or participating in extracurricular activities Shes losing too much weight and exercising fanatically He has stopped taking the medication that helped keep him on track through high school You think she may be cutting herself You even wonder if she might be suicidal We dont want roommates feeling they have to handle this on their own said   the director of counseling and psychological services at Cornell University A college residence hall is not a resident psychiatric ward Sometimes the appropriate response is professional help And what about parents As a pediatrician I have certainly taken the occasional call about a roommate or classmate who is doing something strange troubling or possibly dangerous and my role has generally been to say Let your roommate know how worried you are and why and tell the resident adviser Sometimes students absolutely dont want to involve the university hierarchy because theyre afraid of getting a friend in trouble And there has been criticism over   A student who feels some connection with a roommates parents may be more comfortable going for help to them  yet another reason to know and be known by your childs roommate at least a little Sometimes a student fears angering the person in the upper bunk   a research scientist at Cornell and a coauthor of the  studies researches nonsuicidal selfinjury as an expert on a   she deals with the concern that a roommate may be cutting herself advising a worried roommate to get help In a lot of cases its a friend a roommate a peer who noticed first and made the choice to tell an adult she said Their roommates often feel anger and resentment about being found out she added but in all cases theyre grateful in the long run Dr Eisenbergs research shows that more than half of college students with significant symptoms of   not to mention those who drink heavily are not getting help Thats a potential role that roommates and friends can play The intimate perspective that a roommate has can be extremely valuable in detecting problems that really put a student in danger Though a roommate cannot be responsible for treatment Dr Eells has seen the bond work powerfully to help students in trouble A roommate conveying a sense of I care about you  these social connections can be lifesaving he said The outcomes can be pretty magic
