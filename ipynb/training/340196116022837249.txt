There was great fanfare when the Mars Science Laboratory launched in November  and again when its precious cargo  NASAs Mars rover    touched down on the red planet in August  The eight months in between had drama of their own Curiosity was constantly bombarded with radiation as it traveled through space  highenergy protons thrown out by the sun and galactic cosmic rays slicing through the solar system from distant supernovas Here on Earth the magnetic field and atmosphere shield us from most of this radiation But out in the void of space high energy particles would rip into an astronauts DNA slowly increasing the risk of cancer Thats a problem for NASA and the       that have pledged to send human explorers to Mars For a long time theyve been trying to figure out just how much radiation an astronaut would experience on the journey Enter Curiosity which was handily equipped with RAD  a   The monitoring device was intended to gather radiation data on the surface of Mars But about two years before launch we started to realize the fact that RAD was tucked inside the belly of the spacecraft sort of in the same location that a future astronaut might be on a future mission says   the physicist who led the Southwest Research Institute team that designed RAD The researchers reasoned they might as well turn the device on during space flight A few days after launch RAD powered up and started collecting data A small portion of the radiation  about  percent  came from brief but intense solar storms Astronauts would be able to avoid this source of radiation by retreating to a sheltered area of their ship Just ducking down inside a room lined with food supplies would do the trick The bulk of the radiation was caused by galactic cosmic rays  beams of high energy ions that we dont know how to shield against Hassler says theres really only one way to minimize the damage caused by these rays Go quickly The shortest possible trip to Mars with current technology would take about six months During that time an astronaut would experience about four times more radiation than someone on the International Space Station An astronaut on ISS for say six months would receive on the order of maybe  millisieverts compared with the  we receive on our way to Mars Hassler says The average American is only exposed to about   An abdominal CT scan subjects a patient to   The dose from a long journey through open space is much higher Calculating cancer risk from radiation exposure is tricky but basic   suggest a trip to Mars would increase your risk of getting cancer by about  percent Double that number for round trip visit and you quickly approach the limits recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection But that doesnt discourage Robert Zubrin president of   and author of   Radiation is not a showstopper he says Its not something that the FDA would recommend that everyone do But were talking about a mission to Mars here Zubrin says there are plenty of other risks involved in a Mars mission  and theyre risks many would be willing to take He notes that about  percent of space shuttle flights ended in disaster And yet there are millions of people that if they had been offered a chance to fly on the shuttle and knowing that would have jumped at the chance Zubrin says The average person already has about a   A yearold astronaut who dreams of setting foot on the red planet might not be bothered by bumping that risk up a few percentage points What this paper does is place foursquare in front of the NASA leadership that theres no cause for delay at least as far as radiation is concerned Zubrin says We should now set our course for Mars Scientists still have questions about radiation on Mars itself They need more data to better understand the cancer risk for Mars settlers on the surface But dont worry Curiosity is working on that too
