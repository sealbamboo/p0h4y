American Journal of Public Health Bikesharing is taking cities by storm Rental stations across town give people a quick way to get around  and get some exercise But theres a catch When you pick up a bike you usually have to bring your own helmet or go without one If you ride with your hair flapping in the breeze your  A group of Canadian and American researchers wondered what effect bikeshare systems had on the likelihood of bicyclerelated head injuries And they came up with a way to look at the potential problem They analyzed data on the treatment of serious head injuries at trauma centers in five cities before and after bikesharing programs were started The data were lumped together for Montreal Washington DC Minneapolis Boston and Miami Beach Fla For comparison the researchers also looked at five cities that didnt have bikesharing during the study period including Milwaukee and Seattle The proportion of head injuries relative to all bicyclerelated injuries increased in cities after they implemented bikesharing programs Overall in cities with bikeshare programs the likelihood that that a serious bicyclerelated injury involved a head injury increased  percent There was no increase seen in the control cities The study basically confirmed our worries says   who works on pediatric injury prevention at Washington State Universitys nursing school in Spokane Shes the lead author of the study   Thursday by the   Public bikeshare initiatives are great wellness initiatives she tells Shots But without providing helmets we were concerned that we would see an increase in the risk for head injuries And we did Now a study like this one cant prove cause and effect Other factors that might have been missed by the researchers could have been at work The researchers didnt have information on individual patients and dont know whether the people who were hurt in bikeshare cities were actually using bikes they rented Also a bump seen in the graph showing the proportion of head injuries before the launch of bikeshare programs might be a sign of problems with the data The study also wasnt able to evaluate the changes in ridership over time so the absolute number of injuries couldnt be used as a reliable outcome measure in the paper Even so the results seem to add up Certainly the data are solid enough that we need to look more carefully at these kinds of programs says Andrea Gielin director of the   I think its an important study that raises some concerns that we need to pay attention to She wasnt involved in the research When were trying to promote more bicycling Gielen says we need to do that in the context of increasing helmet use
