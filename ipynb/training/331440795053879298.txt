A  new study suggests that men with prostate cancer who take statins may have a lower risk of dying from the disease than those who do not Statins are not recommended for prostate cancer prevention or treatment But researchers studied  prostate cancer patients diagnosed between  and  of whom  used statins which are given mainly to lower cholesterol They followed them for an average of six years during which there were  total deaths  from prostate cancer The study   found no association of statins with recurrence or progression of prostate cancer or with death from any other cause But after controlling for age smoking body mass index severity of disease type of treatment history of diabetes and many other variables they found that nonusers were five times as likely to die of prostate cancer as those who used statins This raises the flag that these medications may be useful for secondary prevention said the senior author Janet L Stanford a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and may warrant doing a clinical study to test in a randomized trial whether these meds can help reduce mortality
