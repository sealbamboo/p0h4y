It cant be funny I told myself The   might be fabulous  after all Ms Brooke   But oh those monologues about her mother would be unbearable  How much better to stay home and cry over doomed romance than inexorable death  But off I went to the Duke Theater on nd Street for a   one I suspect would resonate with caregivers everywhere I met Ms Brooke later for a conversation about her mother and the events described on stage Lanky in the jeans and flannel shirt she wears during performances her long hair tied loosely back she could have been any of us with little time for glamour  Among the more than  million Americans providing   at least three   Ms Brooke  her managerdirectorhusband Patrick Rains  and his sister Julie  underemployed and couch surfing  managed to find endless humor in a family crisis that unfolded from  to  as Ms Brookes mother descended deeper into Alzheimers  Ms Brooke had a lifetime of practice dealing with her mother whose florid wackiness and succession of illnesses long before Alzheimers would have sent most children running for the hills Instead the two were linked said Ms Brooke as if there were an electrical current running between us She was one of three children  the youngest the only girl and the lone skeptic in a devout family of Christian Scientists in Boston The language of the religion its lessons and allegiances never leave you once youve been indoctrinated Ms Brooke said  Those four noses it turns out are the collected prostheses her mother Darren Stone Nelson wore after untreated skin cancer had turned her into a maxillofacial work of art as Ms Brooke put it  The cure for what ailed her mother in the Christian Science view was Mary Baker Eddys unwavering belief that divine love always will meet every human need The same was true when Mrs Nelson had a uterine tumor By comparison her terrible arthritis seemed a mere inconvenience   Mom was a magical thinker Ms Brooke said So I was burdened with reality  If the material world were an illusion as she was taught then so is sickness and death Ms Brooke took her first Advil at  She has attended just one funeral her fatherinlaws  Perhaps its understandable that dementia didnt  occur to Ms Brooke as an explanation for her mothers increasingly erratic behavior until she was well down the road This was a woman who found a rainbow wig in the town dump and wore it constantly when her daughter was an easily embarrassed seventh grader It was the postman who hesitantly suggested that Mrs Nelson didnt belong alone at home anymore  An independent or assisted living facility seemed the solution as it does to so many of us Ms Brooke quickly settled her mother into a home for aged Christian Scientists in Massachusetts She visited dined with her mothers new friends each with more grievously untreated maladies than the next Mental malpractice Ms Brooke calls it now  Mrs Nelsons hygiene was wanting a common Alzheimers symptom and the staff let her get away with excuses rather than insisting she shower Now isnt a good time shed say Or Im in the middle of something Ms Brooke eventually realized that hymns three times a week is not going to cut it  Terrified and ignorant but determined and mindful she said that Im my mothers only daughter Ms Brooke brought her to New York City Home was and remains Apartment K in a rental building on upper waaaaaaay upper Fifth Avenue Ms Brooke rented an apartment on the third floor and moved her mother there I could see her window from my living room she said  Their first enormous challenge as Ms Brooke describes it in the play was dealing with her mothers painful unrelenting constipation Once just clipping her toenails creeped me out Now it was suppositories and enemas  and poetry in this terrible intimacy a transition many caregivers will recognize Before long Mrs Nelson became the crazy lady screaming down the hall  Hoping to relieve her mothers excruciating arthritic pain Ms Brooke agreed to have her undergo a knee replacement There was not a word of warning from doctors that this wasnt a great idea for a woman too cognitively impaired for physical therapy After surgery Mrs Nelson hallucinated for a week Ms Brooke recalled and attempts at rehabilitation were like scenes from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Within months of the illadvised operation a hospice team joined the crowd in Mrs Nelsons apartment  Still this hardy woman lingered from hospices arrival in October until the next January On a Saturday night the nurses said her mother was actively dying common endoflife parlance but alien vocabulary to a Christian Scientist Ms Brooke longed for her brothers lovely beautiful men But they were too steeped in their religion she said for a deathbed vigil  Mrs Nelsons caretakers read her   They watched Christian Science church services online We really tried to speak the language honor the lessons Ms Brooke said but religion seemed to have lost her power and her mother seemed more enamored of Chanel No  her favorite perfume which her daughter sprayed in the air  Monday became Tuesday Mrs Nelsons breathing was thready When her time came she really did just slip away Ms Brooke said Waiting for the undertaker Ms Brooke her husband and sisterinlaw and the caregivers sang sublime hymns and ridiculous ditties like How Much Is That Doggie in the Window A man arrived with a black body bag loaded it disinfected his hands rode down to the lobby and pushed the gurney down Fifth Avenue to his van The gurney fit easily in the elevator Ms Brooke said because long ago the apartment building had been a nursing home That detail is not in the performance but Ms Brooke said the irony isnt lost on me
