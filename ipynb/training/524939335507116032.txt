Last June, a Wall Street analyst caused a fuss among Amgen shareholders by suggesting the biotech split into two different entities. And now, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point fund has taken a stake in Amgen and written the biotech to advocate for a split. “We firmly believe that the company is at an inflection point,” Third Point said in its letter. “It is well established that disparate business units generally benefit from operating separately.”. That same Wall Street essentially agrees with this conclusion, but now appears skeptical that Amgen will consider such a move. “We do think Amgen could create considerable value by splitting into legacy and growth product companies,” Sanford Bernstein’s Geoff Porges wrote yesterday, but “we think such a split is increasingly unlikely given the stock’s strong performance in recent months.”. In a note yesterday, Porges essentially agreed with this conclusion, but appeared skeptical that Amgen will consider such a move. “We do think Amgen could create considerable value by splitting into legacy and growth product companies,” he wrote, but “we think such a split is increasingly unlikely given the stock’s strong performance in recent months.”
