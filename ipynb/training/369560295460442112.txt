Bullied children and kids who bully others have more health problems when they grow up than kids who arent part of the bullying cycle a study finds Theyre also more likely to have financial problems including difficulty keeping a job The findings run counter to a stillwidespread notion that bullying is a childhood rite of passage with little lasting harm the researchers say These kids are continuing to have significant problems in their lives years after the bullying has stopped says   an associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine and a coauthor of the   which was published in   It really is a significant public health concern Those health problems included serious longterm issues like obesity diabetes cancer disability and severe asthma Researchers tested the health of  children ages  to  in western North Carolina starting back in  Participants were assessed annually until age  and then at   and  to  years old Parents were also asked whether their child had been involved in bullying About onequarter of the children said they had been bullied Another  percent said they had bullied others And  percent said they had been on both the sending and receiving end Victims of bullying were more likely to have problems as adults and were more likely to smoke use marijuana or consider themselves to be in poor health Former bullies were not doing so great either But it was the bullying targets who fared worst being far more likely to have health problems financial or job issues and poor relationships with family and friends They were six times more likely to have a serious illness like cancer or diabetes six times as likely to smoke and four times as likely to have been charged with a felony What we saw for them was this really pervasive pattern where they were impaired across a lot of areas Copeland tells Shots OK you think but the bullies are more likely to come from unstable families with financial issues and thus are more likely to have problems Thats true Copeland says But when he and his colleagues adjusted their data to account for the childrens family situation they found that it did in fact account for a lot of the bullies problems as adults But it didnt account for the travails of the bullied who then victimized others This is not a very effective coping mechanism Copeland says And thus he says its not a surprise that they would have a hard time coping with the challenges of adult life He and his colleagues had previously shown that people who were involved in bullying as children have   as adults Now theyre going to look deeper into the question of physical health problems using biomarkers like the stress hormone cortisol to get a clearer picture of the physical cost of childhood aggression
