Take a sip of the Oaxacan Fizz at   in Los Angeles and youll discover the unmistakable taste of tobacco Thats because this cocktail is sweetened with a small amount of tobaccoinfused sugar syrup A lot of people say I only smoke when I drink says chefowner Sang Yoon We say Now you can do both Mixologists are helping tipplers enjoy tobacco even as   spread to more than half the states in the US Though some may drink the cocktail in search of a buzz mixologists say tobacco adds an unexpected flavor profile that pairs well with dark liquors Creating the tobacco syrup was a trial and error process for Yoon We took a Marlboro Lights cigarette apart and tried doing an infusion which turned out to be horrible he says We tried chopping up cigars that tasted horrifying We tried snuff which didnt work Pipe tobacco was ultimately the winner Its much sweeter aromatically and on the palate he says And it echoes the smoky elements of the San Juan Del Rio mezcal which forms the drinks backbone Loose pipe tobaccos generally lack many if not all of the approximately  ingredients which are added to most cigarette tobaccos including cancercausing chemicals like tar carbon monoxide arsenic and benzene Though there are plenty of completely additivefree pipe tobaccos on the market many do include natural and artificial flavorings sweeteners and antidrying agents to extend shelf life In general however pipe tobacco offers mixologists tobacco in its purest form with the cleanest flavor To make his sweetener Yoon adds four ounces of pipe tobacco to one quart of simple syrup and lets it steep at  degrees Fahrenheit for two hours We found that when we boiled the solution it got too aggressive he says But theres no hiding the tobacco It burns going down says Yoon Theres a little heat a little pepperyness at the back of the throat Although Im not a smoker Ive been addicted to Nicorette gum so I know what the buzz feels like I do get that stupid euphoria when I drink the Oaxacan Fizz Its no surprise that its a polarizing cocktail People who smoke cigarettes or pot love it says Yoon People who dont smoke are divided Yoons not alone in tobacco drink experimentation At PX in Alexandria Va Todd Thrasher uses a rotating cast of tobaccos  including pipe tobacco and clove cigarettes  to make a sweet tea that goes into his bourbonbased Smokers Delight Gordon Banks coowner of Bar Charley in Washington DC created a cocktail that incorporates cedar smoke and a dash of homemade tobacco bitters Its called the Stepdad because it smells like alcohol tobacco and smoke he says Its definitely a sipper featuring a smooth cognac base smoky overtones and little bite from a small amount of the herbaceous Italian liqueur cynar You can taste the tobacco bitters though the flavor is slightly mellowed by the incorporation of cinnamon clove and allspice There are a few tobaccoy spirits on the market too including   tobacco and mentholflavored vodkas and   These tobaccolaced beverages are a largely modern phenomenon according to historian   author of several books on tobacco including   But she notes that as early as  historical documents show that tobacco was used in potions by Native Americans for medical purposes to treat gastrointestinal problems South American shamans drank simple tobacco teas during rituals and for its supposedly magical qualities according to Iain Gatelys   However the author notes that overindulging in these teas could induce vomiting paralysis and occasionally death That may have been due to the nicotine which can be lethal in high doses And its a hint that the latest experiments may be risky not unlike those   we reported on in  The problem with tobaccoinfused drinks according to   a leading researcher on the health effects of tobacco at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco is that you simply have no way of knowing how much nicotine youre getting Its impossible to know what the dosage is since these guys are making this stuff themselves Glantz tells The Salt Dont forget that nicotine was used as insecticide So this is like putting pesticides  hazardous substances  into drinks For the most part the drinkable tobacco trend is so new that there havent been any major studies on the overall health effects of orally ingesting tobacco  or nicotine  in liquid form What you wont get from them of course is secondhand smoke which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes has over  chemicals in it including approximately  that are cancercausing But according to one   by researchers at Austrias KarlFranzens University Graz in the medical journal   a dose of more than  g liquidized nicotine could harm an adult And even low concentrations of nicotine causes tremor and increases in heart rate respiratory rate blood pressure and level of alertness according to the CDC The takehome message from Glantz is that drinking tobacco is not a great way to kick back and relax It would be easy to overdose with a nicotine liquid in a drink he says
