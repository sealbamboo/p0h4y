Fewer than half of people in Wales realise the NHS is the responsibility of the Welsh government according to a poll commissioned by BBC Wales Forty eight per cent knew Welsh ministers are in charge while  think it is the UK governments job There was a better understanding of education with  correctly saying Welsh ministers were responsible and  the UK government The poll marks  years since the Queen opened the assembly in   Throughout this week BBC Wales is looking at  years since devolution  throwing a spotlight on different aspects of it each day  The findings on health will throw a new light on the political row between the UK and Welsh governments over standards in the Welsh NHS   Earlier this year David Cameron said care was so poor in some Welsh hospitals that Offas Dyke was a line between life and death The Welsh government maintains its overall budget has been cut by the UK government and it is dealing with rising demand for services   It also argues that outcomes for some health treatments are better in Wales than England When the poll asked about policing  wrongly thought the Welsh government had control with  saying the UK government There have been calls for policing to be devolved to Wales with a recent crossparty inquiry into devolution suggesting powers over the four Welsh police forces should be handed to the Welsh government Overall the poll found that just  of people felt that devolution had led to an improvement in the way Wales is governed with  saying it had not made much difference And  said the southeast of Wales had seen the greatest benefits with just  citing north Wales and  mid Wales Prof Roger Scully from Cardiff Universitys Wales Governance Centre said The figures are not great in terms of public understanding of who is responsible for what   I think that it does show there is still a lot of confusion amongst people about exactly where the line for responsibility comes between London and Cardiff Bay in terms of governance We do see thing are rather better in terms of education and I think that what that suggests is where devolution actually touches peoples lives  perhaps whether they have children grandchildren or relatives in school where they see an actual difference with the way thing are done in England then people become more aware of it He added Beyond that people have some general sense that there is a devolved government in Wales there is a government in London but exactly who does what and why I think the details of that largely elude them Prof Scully added there was some evidence people became reeducated about devolved policies during assembly election campaigns
