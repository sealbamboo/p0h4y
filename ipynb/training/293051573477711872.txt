 Caffeine changes   estrogen levels and has different effects in Asian and white women a new study says More than  women ages  to  took part in the study between  and  On average they consumed  milligrams of   a day about the equivalent of one cup of caffeinated coffee Estrogen is the reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries Asian women who consumed an average of  milligrams or more of caffeine a day equivalent to about two cups of coffee had elevated estrogen levels compared to women who consumed less But white women who consumed the same amount of caffeine had slightly lower estrogen levels than women who consumed less Black women who consumed  or more milligrams of caffeine daily had elevated estrogen levels but this finding was not statistically significant said the US National Institutes of Health researchers and their colleagues The caffeine consumed by the women in the study came from any of these sources coffee black tea green tea and caffeinated soda The findings differed slightly when the researchers considered the source of caffeine individually Consuming  milligrams of caffeine from coffee mirrored the overall findings But consumption of more than one cup each day of caffeinated soda or green tea was associated with higher estrogen in all three groups of women according to the study published online in the February issue of the   The caffeinerelated changes in estrogen levels did not appear to affect womens ovulation said the researchers who followed the women for up to two menstrual cycles About  percent of US women ages  to  consume the caffeine equivalent of  to two cups of coffee a day according to the authors The results indicate that caffeine consumption among women of childbearing age influences estrogen levels Enrique Schisterman of the Division of Epidemiology Statistics and Prevention Research at the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development said in an NIH news release Short term these variations in estrogen levels among different groups do not appear to have any pronounced effects We know that variations in estrogen level are associated with such disorders as endometriosis   and endometrial breast and ovarian cancers Because longterm caffeine consumption has the potential to influence estrogen levels over a long period of time it makes sense to take caffeine consumption into account when designing studies to understand these disorders Schisterman said
