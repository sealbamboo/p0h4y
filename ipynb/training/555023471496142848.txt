aramedic Ian Whittern admits that at the end of a hour shift which has already rolled into its th hour he feels a little weary He ought to be Over the past two days he has dealt with the victims of road accidents strokes and a mugging He has driven patients into hospitals while the computer screen on the dashboard of his rapid response car flashed the grim news that there would be no beds available once he got there he spent a frustrating twoandahalf hours trying to sort out food drink gas and electricity for an elderly person because over the weekend no other carer was available to do the work And one patient died despite his best efforts to save him Like most paramedics Whittern turns up early to check his vehicle and equipment knowing that as soon as his shift actually starts he will be off on a job and almost every workday overruns sometimes by as much as two hours His first break for a cup of tea on Saturday came at pm  seven hours into his duty It is hard theres no doubt about it and getting harder all the time said Whittern who is based in Bristol and works for the   Swas The pressure is growing There arent enough paramedics and as the NHS becomes more broken up more fragmented we are left to pick up the pieces When theres nobody else to turn to we get the call even if were not the people who should be dealing with an incident The focus of the health crisis over the past fortnight was AE departments  as hospitals across England   But the pressure on ambulance crews has been extraordinary Across the country crews have been working extra shifts and extra hours The Red Cross St John Ambulance and firefighters have tried to help reduce the burden on ambulance trusts but bosses  already having to explain why they missed response targets in November  concede the statistics for December across England will make ugly reading when they are published later this month Whittern  who has worked for the ambulance service for  years said he and his colleagues were the busiest they had ever been We end up doing the job community nurses or social services really should be doing  making sandwiches brewing cups of tea for people who have nobody else He is a union official but does not attack the management or the trust They are all doing their best but the whole   system is grinding to a halt Its no wonder that its a struggle to get new paramedics and many are leaving We dont do this job for the money but because we love to help people but its becoming so challenging Other paramedics say they are worn out Neil Grigg a paramedic and operations officer based in Devon said the whole system was creaking Demand is going up year on year My staff are still fantastic but they are tired A paramedic from Cornwall who asked not to be named admitted that he found himself sobbing in his cab a few weeks ago This is a stressful job Youre dealing with life and death situations several times a day But the real stress is not being sure youre able to do the best job you can Even before the recent rush the service in the south west  like ambulance trusts all over  was under huge stress In the trusts   pdf for November real concerns are raised over the problems caused by a staff shortage in frontline paramedics the trust has  fewer paramedics than it should have and over the number of hours lost in handovers at acute hospitals  hours were lost in November alone On Saturday  December the service which covers  sq miles from Gloucestershire in the north to the Isles of Scilly in the far south west dealt with  incidents   more than the same Saturday in  and  more than it was set up to cope with Also raised in the report are response times to Red  and Red  incidents  the most serious categories Ambulance services in England are required to reach  of Red  incidents within eight minutes Overall the trust managed   better than the national average But in some areas the figure was much worse  in Wiltshire just  South Gloucestershire  and Cornwall  The pressure on the system undoubtedly means some injured people are suffering Just over two weeks ago yearold Ruby Elsworth got up from the dinner table at the Wiltshire dementia unit she lives in and slipped spilling a cup of tea over herself as she fell Staff suspected  correctly  that she had suffered a broken hip She was wet confused and in pain said her nephew Steve Grimmett Staff called for help at pm It was pm before the paramedics got there Grimmett said All that time she was lying on the floor Nobody could move her all they could give her was some paracetamol When they got there the paramedics were apologetic Its not their fault Its the system thats wrong How can we profess to be a civilised first world country when we leave a very elderly lady with dementia lying like that for so long On the same day  miles north Janet Walsh  was on her moped near Cheltenham when she clipped a kerb and hit the road hard injuring her leg and shoulder A passerby called  and then alerted her husband Christopher  To his surprise when he arrived she was still lying in the road There were six or seven people looking after her They had put a coat over her but she was in agony and crying he said Janet was going into shock Mr Walsh said it took the ambulance an hour and  minutes to arrive In that case the Swas argues that based on the information it had its response was the right one though it accepts elements of the call could have been handled better As for the other cases it apologises and points to the extraordinary strain it is under to explain the delays There are other examples In Bristol the family of a greatgrandmother said she lay on her living room floor for seven hours after falling She weighs  stone  lbs so sourcing the right equipment and crews proved difficult In Verwood Dorset an yearold woman lay on a pavement for  minutes after tripping and hitting her head Also in Dorset parish councillor Susanne Parkin  from Corfe Mullen failed to get an ambulance at all on the night she woke up with excruciating head pain I realised there was something seriously wrong she said I woke my husband up and asked him to phone an ambulance The couple described her symptoms but the operator at the  service  run by Swas in the county  did not judge it necessary to send an ambulance The next morning Parkins husband Michael found her lying unconscious on the floor A nurse from the local GP practice visited and told him to drive his wife straight to hospital where she was diagnosed as having a brain aneurysm Her family were told she had a slim chance of survival Happily she has recovered I was very lucky she said I think theres something wrong with the system Ken Wenman chief executive of the ambulance trust and a registered paramedic admits there is a problem But were doing the best we can with the resources weve got he said Last week AE departments across England were declaring major incidents Ambulances loaded with patients were sometimes waiting for hours outside hospitals because there were no beds A car park at Swindons Great Western hospital  Swass patch  briefly took on the appearance of a field hospital when the ambulance service pitched a tent to provide a extra space for patients and equipment Swas set its Reap indicator of how the service was operating at level   critical  one level short of  potential service failure Wenman and his team turned to volunteers and the private sector for help If there had been five times the number of people available they would have been able to use them Wenman said it was getting more difficult to hire and retain staff Nationally theres a shortage There are insufficient numbers coming out of university Paramedics are finding other positions in the NHS Positions that are better paid than a paramedic who might start on about  that do not always require weekend and night working During exit interviews staff tell managers they would not stay even if better wages were available The majority of those who are leaving are saying the work is becoming more and more difficult Its busier They often do hour shifts Theres very little respite in that hour shift they rarely get meal breaks they get a lot of overruns Its becoming a very stressful and tiring job Weve asked staff if we paid them more would they stay and its not the money I think staff are very tired theyve seen an increase in workload year on year and thats not been matched by an increase in ambulance resources Wenman points out  fairly  that the problems Swas faces are replicated across the country and it does better than some trusts But what changes are needed According to Wenman more resources cleverer ways of giving staff variety in their job  for example by winning contracts for other medical services so that paramedics can be given time away from the stresses of the road  and more flexibility over targets He argues that the government ought to take into account what happens when a paramedic gets to a scene  not just how quickly they get there If we arrive in seven minutes and  seconds and the patient dies thats called a success if we arrive in eight minutes and one second and the patient lives thats called a failure Christmas and the new year may have been exceptionally busy but details in Swass November performance report suggest a more worrying story the past few months were not just a blip From April to November last year AE incidents in Swass area were up  compared with  It would usually expect to face  incidents on a Saturday  but on Saturdays in November it was tackling  The unprecedented level of activity has outstretched available frontline resources the report said Whittern and his colleagues blame a range of problems from the  phone service the concern is that because most staff are not medically qualified but follow an algorithm they tend to play safe and send an ambulance out to a patient when it is not needed  though Parkin would disagree with the thesis to the pressure control rooms are under as they try to help meet government response targets Then there is the huge problem of other professionals  GPs social workers and so on  not being readily available on weekends and evenings the reason Whittern ended up organising food and power for one patient at the weekend Andrew George the Liberal Democrat MP for West Cornwall has asked health ministers to ensure that Swas receives the help it needs He too blames poor integration and lack of capacity in NHS and GPs outofhours services in mental health teams and social services departments And perhaps the  phone service  though in Cornwall where the service is also run by the ambulance trust only  of callers are referred to emergency departments compared with the national average of  George said that emergency services are too often seen as a first rather than a last resort This must be looked at when we have the luxury of more reflective time otherwise problems will reoccur not only at every future Christmas and Easter but at other times One of Whitterns colleagues has another theory Its all about common sense People dont have as much as they used to They want someone else to pick the pieces up rather than taking responsibility for themselves
