The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says  Americans are getting Lyme disease every year and the toll is growing It confirms what weve thought for a long time This is a large problem Dr Paul Mead tells Shots The bottom line is that by defining how big the problem is we make it easier for everyone to figure out what kind of resources we have to use to address it Mead who directs Lyme disease surveillance for the CDC presented the   at an international conference in Boston on Lyme and other tickborne diseases The CDC says only a th of Lyme disease cases  fewer than   are reported And to make it more complicated an unknown number of people are being diagnosed with Lyme disease who dont really have it The new estimate comes from three different ways of looking at the problem CDC scientists analyzed insurance claims for  million people over six years They surveyed labs that test for Lyme disease and they did surveys asking people if theyd had the disease The result adds up to a vexing public health problem all caused by a tick thats about the size of the period on the end of this sentence A generation ago there was no such thing called Lyme disease though it may have been lurking undetected in nature Scientists first reported it in  and named it after the location of the first cases in Lyme Conn Now its the most prevalent tickborne infection  concentrated in   in the Northeast and upper Midwest but expanding both northward to upper New York state and Maine and southward to Virginia In many areas where Lyme disease is entrenched Mead says up to  percent of blacklegged or deer ticks carry the   That translates to a substantial risk of infection for humans who venture outdoors especially in grassy and woodsy areas Getting Lyme disease is no picnic Symptoms resemble the flu  fatigue headache mildly stiff neck joint and muscle aches and fever But if not treated with an antibiotic within about  hours the infection can disseminate throughout the body causing neurologic cardiac and joint disease for weeks or months An unknown proportion of Lyme disease patients become chronically ill with fatigue that can be debilitating Mead says the CDC recognizes chronic Lyme disease as a real problem The question is whether its due to persistent infection or some immunologic effect and whats the best way of treating it he says People often dont know when they have gotten Lyme disease One telltale sign is a   around the tick bite But Mead says  or  percent of people dont get the rash  or dont recognize it because its on their scalp or somewhere they cant see So its important for physicians to have a high level of suspicion when they see someone with flulike symptoms in summer when theres not much real flu around Mead says Its mainly up to residents of Lyme disease hot spots to avoid getting it  by using insect repellents covering up when going outdoors and checking themselves for ticks when they get back inside Before  humans could get vaccinated against Lyme disease dogs still can But the manufacturer   for lack of demand Mead acknowledges its pretty hard to spot an insect thats no bigger than a poppy seed  much smaller than the common dog tick Thats one of the reasons we encourage people to shower after being in a tickinfested area he says Studies show that showering within two hours after being outside sharply reduces the risk of infection One thing in humans favor The deer tick has to suck your blood for around  hours before the Lyme disease organism is transmitted So gently removing the tick with tweezers or  better yet  washing it off before it sinks its tiny fangs into your skin is the best way to win this game
