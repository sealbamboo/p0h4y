People are often told to take lowdose aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke But that preventive remedy doesnt work for a lot of people Researchers say theyve found genetic variations that might be used to identify people who dont respond well to aspirin If the results prove out there could soon be a blood test to tell who benefits from aspirin and who needs to look for other treatments to reduce cardiovascular risk Aspirin is prescribed because it makes the bloods platelets less sticky and less apt to clump together and form blood clots Clots are a key cause of both   But its become clear that that remedy doesnt work for everyone Anywhere from  to  percent of people may not get any protective benefit from aspirin according to studies There are tests to tell how aspirin affects platelets but they need to be done within a few hours after blood is drawn and involve some tricky lab work So theyre not practical as a screening test for the millions of people who take aspirin to prevent heart attacks and stroke To find out if theres a better way to identify those people researchers at Duke University Medical Center gathered up two groups  healthy volunteers who took  milligrams of aspirin every day for up to a month and people with heart disease who already were taking lowdose aspirin  mg as part of their treatment They then tested how well the peoples blood platelets responded to the aspirin and tested the peoples genes They found  genes that were active in people healthy and not who didnt respond well to the aspirin Their platelets stayed sticky The researchers then looked for those  genes in people who had had cardiac testing at the Duke hospital They found that same genetic signature in patients who later had heart attacks or died even if they were taking aspirin Potentially you could take this  geneset signature and develop some sort of diagnostic test without all the time constraints current tests have says   an assistant professor of medicine at Duke and lead author of the study Its not clear what could help people who dont respond to aspirin Voora says It may be a question of figuring out different doses of aspirin for different people Or it could be that they would need a different drug that inhibits platelet clotting such as clopidogrel Plavix or similar medications The article was   online Wednesday in
