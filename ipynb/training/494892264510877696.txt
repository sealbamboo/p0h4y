An influential report that urges sweeping changes in how the federal government subsidizes the training of doctors has brought out the sharp scalpels of those who would be most immediately affected The reaction also raises questions about the sensitive politics involved in redistributing a large pot of money mostly from Medicare  that now goes disproportionately to teaching hospitals in the US Northeast All of the changes recommended would have to be made by Congress The   released Tuesday called for more accountability in the distribution of the federal funds earmarked for doctor training   billion annually About twothirds of that cash comes from Medicare The report also called for an end to providing the money directly to the teaching hospitals and to dramatically alter the way the funds are paid The money in question is for graduate medical education  the training of medical school graduates thats required before these interns and residents can be licensed to practice in any state We recognize we are causing some disruption said Gail Wilensky a health economist and coleader of the panel that produced the report But we think we are doing so in a thoughtful and careful way including recommending phasing in the payment changes over  years Some of the major players in medical education dont see it that way however Todays report on graduate medical education is the wrong prescription for training tomorrows physicians the   said in a written statement adding that the groups leaders were especially disappointed to see the suggestion that funding from Medicare should be shifted away from hospitals toward some clinics that even dont treat Medicare patients In its report Wilenskys panel explained why it proposed shifting funding toward community clinics writing Most if not all residencies must train physicians to treat a wide range of patients  many of whom are under age  and not eligible for Medicare coverage The American Academy of Family Physicians welcomed the proposal to move funding away from a hospitalbased system to more communitybased training sites By giving these organizations more control over how they train residents the financial investment will better align with the health needs of a community the groups president Reid Blackwelder said in a statement But the broaderbased doctor group the   reacted negatively saying Despite the fact that workforce experts predict a   of more than  primary care and  specialty physicians in the US by  the report provides no clear solution Wilensky says thats because her panel didnt agree with studies that project theres going to be a shortage of doctors Rapid changes in medical practice she says  including the greatly increased use of nonphysician health professionals such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners  might be enough to provide care to aging baby boomers and people now getting insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act And even if a shortage does occur the medical education system needs to better manage training since it now produces more specialists than primary care providers and leaves major areas of the country with too few doctors said Malcolm Cox who recently retired from running the medical education program for the   Will an unregulated expansion produce the right physicians with the right skills in the right areas of the country he said at a panel discussion of the report Wilensky who ran Medicare when Congress overhauled the physician payment system in the early s said the chances for making such changes depend very much on lawmakers from states that currently get less funding  which is most of them Given the fact that a disproportionate amount of current funding goes to institutions in New York New Jersey and Massachusetts Wilensky says shes surprised that everyone else has tolerated this peculiar distribution of funds for so long Whether change happens will depend on whether some of the havenot states are willing to say wait a minute  she says The New York teaching hospitals in particular are wellknown for their clout on Capitol Hill They are fantastically great in terms of their protection of their turf said Bill Hoagland a longtime Senate Republican staffer and now senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center People talk about the third rail of politics as not touching Social Security I have found that if you touch anything dealing with medical education you get bombarded By far the most heated criticism of the reports recommendations came from the   which represents medical schools and the teaching hospitals they affiliate with While the current system is far from perfect the IOMs proposed wholesale dismantling of our nations graduate medical education system will have significant negative impact on the future of health care said the groups president and CEO Darrell Kirsh The proposed redistribution of funding he says will slash funding for vital care and services available almost exclusively at teaching hospitals including Level  trauma centers pediatric intensive care units burn centers and access to clinical trials Still those supporting the IOMs recommendations say the way we train doctors is in major need of change The current system is unsustainable said Edward Salsberg a former top official at the   at the Department of Health and Human Services Health care is moving to the community but our system of financing graduate medical education is tied to inpatient care
