Artist and activist James Leadbitter is on a mission to design a userfriendly psychiatric hospital with the help and ideas of anyone who wants to get involved The Madlove project is borne of Leadbitters own experiences on psychiatric wards which he feels did not always offer what he needed  even though he accepts that NHS hospitals have been necessary for him at other times But with mental health trusts facing cuts they have an added pressure just to maintain what they already provide Leadbitter is therefore    drawing on the experiences and expertise of a wide array of people  So far hes heard from architects designers landscape gardeners activists mental health nurses and furniture makers  the majority of whom have been through the mental health system themselves A series of design workshops will start in September this year Then a temporary ward will be built and opened for six weeks aiming to demonstrate an alternative to the environment that patients with mental ill health have typically experienced Part art project part social health project its prompted many messages of support to Leadbitter This project stands to me as the most important form of mental health activism and radicalisation of the therapeutic field writes Arran James Crawford a mental health nurse in Glasgow On hearing about this project I was a combination of delighted that it was happening and sad that it was needed writes Harry Giles from Edinburgh Heres a selection of the ideas that have been submitted  from the practical to the creative  that people would like in their ideal psychiatric ward Many comment on the lessthanhelpful role that a hospitals typically austere decor plays in aiding recovery The interior should be more welcoming says Rowan Mataram moving away from the clinical feel so coloured pillows and nonwhite walls There should be big windows and any white walls should be covered with plants books or maybe patient artwork and poems says Mataram It would feel more like a homespace where people can get back on their feet Instead of decorating walls with artwork why not make the walls themselves a work of art One person with bipolar disorder who wished to remain anonymous wants to see a room where I can explode with colour  whether it be paint or coloured liquids And rather than permanent mess the room would be entirely washable  from floor tiles to the ceiling  complete with a drain Once the explosion is finished it can be washed away easily and can go down the drain with no lasting damage caused Filmmaker Dolly Sen suggests having a thinking room with thought bubbles painted on the walls which people can fill with their thoughts  or else an ECT machine hooked up to an EtchaSketch The arts and education are ways that people can reestablish their identity after going through a system that can really remove all sense of identity notes Mataram Its not just the inside thats important Leadbitter himself says hed like more greenery and its an idea echoed by others The hospital environment was awful recalls Lizzie from Sheffield who was diagnosed with psychosis in  She wants more research into the therapeutic benefits of the outdoors and greenery Im sure anxiety and phobias related to outdoors came from a month inside The asylum should be an open place agrees Brifischu Not locked in Not locked away The asylum should be a place to grow Make new steps I need a place to go to when the silence is too loud and a place where I can hide from everyone else Many want more options once theyre inside  from the quieter pursuits of a good library and yoga to larger spaces being made available for dance drama music and sports classes Giles envisages a quiet soft room to lie down by myself and for that to be OK  even suggesting an area of total wifi and telephone signal blackout Another suggests a therapeutic chillout room with changeable lights and temperature  complete with a big bath that is fed by a waterfall and looks like a natural lake or pool  After I have come out of a bad place and let all the feelings out I often feel dirty and unnatural  cleaning and washing is an important part of the recovery But if organised classes dont cut it one person suggests a modern take on the padded cell The anonymous contributor likes the idea of a room where everything is unbreakable It would look normal but be more like a childs soft playground like the childrens ironically called Zany Zone play areas You could throw yourself and everything around without any risk of causing further damage  you could physically let all the frustration and anger out which often helps I sometimes find after exerting all my energy I am more able to think and talk about what is actually wrong  or realise nothing is actually wrong I was just feeling too much  and then everything can be put back in its place with no harm or damage done Where does the hospital begin and end I would really like to see better availability of a halfway house writes Mataram Maybe one of the wards could serve this purpose  one of the most difficult things was the transition from hospital to home with no home support or stage to ease oneself back into life Others want greater access for nonpatients They could come in to cook for patients in a communal dining space Or people who have been through the system could come in to hold talks Giles suggests holding very targeted workshops by mad people for carers of the mad who might also be mad Various activity classes such as yoga or dance could also be available to outsiders so that people can break down the feeling of Otherness when leaving adds Mataram
