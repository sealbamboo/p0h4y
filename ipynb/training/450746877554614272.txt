We smile when were happy But how does a face strike the proper look to show say happy surprise Or happy disgust like when youre laughing at a really gross joke A new   published Monday in the   shows that we instinctively mix and match actions from the six basic emotions to stitch together more subtle expressions Scientists figured out decades ago that all people use the same set of facial muscles to convey happiness sadness anger fear surprise and disgust It wasnt always fun and games in the lab The study of facial expressions began about  years ago when a   performed a grisly experiment on a few unfortunate volunteers He stuck electrical probes inside the subjects facial muscles and then he forced particular expressions on their faces by sending electrical shocks to various muscles Make the mouth curl up and the corner of the eyes crease then voila The person looks happy These were the first   to show that flexing certain facial muscles could convey a recognizable emotion Thats insane says computer scientist   from Ohio State University of the th century experiments It must have been horribly painful No one would allow us to do this now So how did Martinez figure out which muscles get flexed during each expression without sticking electrodes into peoples faces   First he and his colleagues photographed  people while they made  facial expressions Then the team wrote a computer program to determine which muscles are flexed in each photo Specifically the program analyzed the changes in shape and texture of the volunteers faces as they shifted from one emotion to the next For each of the  emotions examined Martinez and his team found that all  volunteers used a unique combination of muscles to create that expression Then some people sprinkled in additional movements to make the expression stronger We showed that each of us creates the same emotion category in the same way Martinez tells Shots On top of that extra muscle actions may help people to convey the emotion more readily Take for instance happily disgusted You see this expression on TV all the time Martinez says Its when somebody tells a vulgar joke he says Youre laughing but also grossed out at the same time Everybody makes this expression he says Combine the smile and creased eyes of a happy expression with the scrunchedup nose and eyes indicating disgust The same idea gets applied to the other  compound emotions tested by Martinez and his team The test subjects were only Americans so Martinez doesnt know if these expressions are consistent across all cultures Nor does he know how well people can read each of the complex emotions The computer scientist thinks the study is hitting only the tip of the expression iceberg We looked at emotions that combine two simple ones What about triple ones he says Think about the feeling of despair  You feel a combination of angry sad fearful What facial muscles get used then The possible combinations are endless For example now youre finished reading this blog post perhaps your face is  bemusedly curious Are you particularly good at being happily disgusted Or sadly angry Share a selfie of your best compound emotion on Twitter with the hashtag NPRFaceOff And   will retweet the best ones y
