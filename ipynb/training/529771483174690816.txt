Wilson Kipsang the Kenyan  of Sundays   told reporters after it was over that hed had to slow down  to exercise a lot of patience  as he logged the first miles of the mile race And even with his purposely slowish  start he completed the marathon in two hours  minutes and  seconds Kipsang wasnt the only standout Kenyan in the race   placed first and second in the womens division Other Kenyans are leaders as well In September   ran only his fifth marathon in Berlin and broke the world record and the  barrier finishing in  Its impossible to measure exactly what makes for marathon gold says   a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard and the author of   But Kenyan runners may possess certain qualities that drive their ability to win Lieberman has spent years studying the evolution of running including the biomechanics and physiology of children and adults who run in rural and urban regions of Kenya He shared a few thoughts with Goats and Soda on what hes learned Its a fascinating question  why Kenyans are so fast so dominant at the moment Ethiopians are also doing extremely well But really if you really look at finishing times runners from Africa are only a little bit faster than the rest of the world just a few minutes faster over the course of slightly more than two hours I dont know a definitive answer no one does So everybody just guesses Its impossible to quantify all of the factors that make one runner better than another Its probably a combination of training determination culture and biology The area of Kenya where a lot of the best runners come from  the Western Rift Valley  is a beautiful wonderful place If there is any one factor that leaps out at me it is how many people in that region are poor and work hard There are almost no jobs apart from subsistence farming There are no factories and very few secondary schools So there are really few options for young people to better their lives They can either work hard on a farm or train to be a great runner So aspiring runners work really really hard when they train In addition most kids usually run to school barefoot which I think has some effect because it means they grow up being excellent runners because as Lieberman has written barefoot runners tend to strike with their forefoot or midfoot which is less stressful than landing heel first And the region is at high altitude All together this part of Kenya has a large population of incredibly fit runners who run barefoot and work hard They train with incredible heart motivation and intensity without any of the advantages that Americans get Aspiring runners in Kenya get no goo no gel no sports drinks They have no trainers or sports medicine experts When people train hard for years and years I suspect that has an effect on their ability to race compared to people who have it easier The efforts to find genes or other factors have mostly failed Theres no smokinggun gene That doesnt mean these genes dont exist but no one has found them  that young Kenyan kids from rural areas who do a lot of running have incredible VO maxes They have VO maxes most of us would dream to have Its probably due to a combination of factors that theyre very active and living at high altitude and perhaps some genetic component When you see kids in the morning going to school theyre often running Kids travel some seven to  kilometers a day on foot often running How many American kids run to school every day The marathon really starts at miles  to  The pack runs together up to then The folks who win still have gas in the tank at the end and are able to sprint the final miles Were studying this right now As development sweeps through Kenya in the urban areas there are more processed foods more public transportation more desk jobs Chairs all day long Weve done studies measuring fitness and strength in people growing up in towns versus those growing up in the countryside The differences are astonishing I now see signs along the road in Kenya for diabetes clinics which I never used to see in the old days Health problems are arriving as development occurs But I dont see this in the rural areas One of the fascinating things about Kenya is that few people exercise for fun When runners there retire they stop running Its a business As a result people dont jog to stay healthy as they age Weve been working on getting people there to think about running not just as a way to train but as important for everyone for health
