When Tracy Dunbrook a bioethicist in Sherman Conn tested positive for the BRCA gene mutation she was told she had a  to  percent chance of developing   in her lifetime Doctors advised her to have her ovaries removed She considered going further and having a   in which her uterus would be removed but in the end opted for the standard of care a procedure known as riskreducing salpingooophorectomy RRSO removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes Five years later she was given a diagnosis of Stage    I couldnt believe it she said I thought this is the dirtiest trick  Women with BRCA mutations often opt for RRSO But there is a debate among experts over whether this strategy is the best one for all women and many patients are caught in the middle struggling to balance conflicting information about hysterectomy as part of riskreducing surgery There definitely is an ongoing sense of confusion and women do agonize over this said Sue Friedman executive director of the group   There are a lot of gynecologists and oncologists who have a strong opinion for or against removing the uterus  a gynecologic oncologist at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center agreed We struggle with this every day About half of the carriers who undergo RRSO opt for removal of the uterus according to   a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the use of preventive surgery among women with BRCA mutations Yet there are really no guidelines or data that help a woman to make a decision for or against hysterectomy he said Indeed there is scant evidence that women with BRCA mutations are more likely to develop uterine cancer although   have   to a   uterine serous cancer Instead the worries persist largely because of anecdotal reports of cases like Ms Dunbrooks and the fact that uterine cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic cancer The lack of data leaves doctors and patients struggling to make these decisions Some doctors have seen patients like Ms Dunbrook come back years after riskreducing surgery with uterine cancer  director of gynecologic oncology at NewYorkPresbyterianWeill Cornell hospital recently treated two women who had RRSO and later developed uterine cancer The debate is really still open he said But if theres any genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer it makes sense that it could also affect any of the gynecologic organs with similar epithelium including the uterus But the evidence is just not there he acknowledged Uterine cancer is just one of the fears driving more women with BRCA mutations to consider hysterectomy Doctors know that some ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes Following RRSO a small tubal remnant is left within the uterus and some women worry that this may become cancerous   but some BRCA carriers arent taking any chances Kate Berges discovered along with her three sisters that a BRCA mutation had been passed down to them through their father All four women opted for RRSO But following the surgery when her younger sisters pathology report revealed that an ovarian cancer had already taken root in her fallopian tubes Ms Berges  a photographer from Branford Conn picked up the phone and called her doctor to schedule a hysterectomy I just wanted it all out I didnt want any surprises Women who have had RRSO with or without hysterectomy may choose hormone replacement therapy to counteract the effects of surgical   But there are a dizzying array of options that come in varying delivery systems  patches pills and creams  and there is contradictory research on both   For women who have RRSO alone hormone therapy means a combination of   and in order to prevent uterine cancer   But studies suggest that   among   Some women also experience side effects including   headaches   and breakthrough bleeding Women with BRCA mutations who opt for a hysterectomy are able to take estrogen alone in many ways a less complicated strategy but at the cost of a more complicated surgery The confusion over all of these variables is visible on the online message boards run by Ms Friedmans group Filled with comments from wellinformed women immersed in making profoundly difficult choices to overcome their odds of cancer the dilemma of whether to remove some or all gynecologic parts is an everpresent issue Reads one typical post Struggling with ooph vs hyst  please help The frustration of these women in part stems from the fact there is no way to predict what each individual will face in the future whatever her choice now  a gynecologic oncologist at DanaFarber Cancer Institute suggests taking the time to discuss the risks benefits and nuances with each patient Women should know what we know and what we dont know he said The biggest challenge is trying to make those riskbenefit decisions every day every time and get it right said   of the   Some people youre overtreating and some youre undertreating Ms Dunbrook diagnosed with uterine cancer was one of the unlucky ones I just dont think its worth taking the chance she said If I had known I would have absolutely taken it out
