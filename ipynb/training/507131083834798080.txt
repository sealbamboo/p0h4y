Doctors never told him outright he might not survive as he lay in a bed in Liberia an ocean away from his family They didnt have to I felt like I was about to die Brantly told NBCs Matt Lauer And I said to the nurse taking care of me Im sick I have no reserve and I dont know how long I can keep this up Hed been well schooled on how to treat disease from his days at Indiana Universitys medical school to his residency at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth Texas If hed contacted Ebola back in the United States there would have been many more machines and assets available to help him get better Brantly didnt have all those tools at his disposal this summer in Liberia  where hospitals shut down after becoming incubators for the disease according to Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf He did however have his ardent faith and whatever strength that his body could muster  Relying on both was his best only hope of someday reuniting with his wife and two children who had returned to the United States a few days before his diagnosis I thought Im not going to be able to continue breathing this way and they had no way to breathe for me if I quit breathing he said Yet he didnt stop Brantly kept fighting Ebola and  unlike many of those hed treated  he won The thing is while Brantly would never have chosen to contract Ebola he did choose to go to West Africa His reasoning was simple People there needed help and feeling it was Gods calling he wanted to help So in  he began a twoyear fellowship through the Christian relief organization Samaritans Purse Brantly started off practicing general medicine but when Ebola began spreading he took on the role of medical director for the groups Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia That was his job when he woke up the morning of July  I just felt a little off I felt a little warm a little under the weather Brantly told NBC adding he then discovered he had a temperature not too much above the  degree baseline His only relief was that his wife Amber and their children hadnt woken up next to him that he didnt have to carry an overwhelming mental burden of worrying if they too had come down with the disease For while Ebola can take days to incubate its only contagious when a sufferer is symptomatic  something Brantly didnt have to worry about with his family Yet the family had plenty of reason to worry for Brantly after he tested positive for Ebola  Id seen him treat these people who had already been diagnosed and I knew how it ends his wife Amber told NBC  I had the disadvantage of having the knowledge of the course of the disease I was scared She wasnt the only one According to his hometown newspaper the Indianapolis Star Kent Brantly himself told a fellow doctor at John Peter Smith Hospital that he was terrified Im praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease Brantly said in an email to Dr David McRay the newspaper reported Somehow he did   more than half of those afflicted with Ebola in this current outbreak have died  a function of how devastating the disease can be as well as a function of where it struck the hardest a place without widespread highquality health care options and cultural and social factors that may have contributed to its spread Yet Brantly made it through those first few trying weeks On August  he was whisked back on a medical plane to the United States walking into Atlantas Emory University Hospital in a white fullbody protective suit His new home was Emorys special isolation unit where his interactions with others were strictly restricted to prevent the virus from spreading Amber visited him for example though she could only see him through a glass wall and talk to him via an intercom By August   two days after Nancy Writebol an American missionary who had worked with Brantly who also came down with Ebola and got treatment at Emory  it was a different story He hugged and shook hands with nurses and doctors who he just a few days earlier hadnt been able to touch Dr Bruce Ribner the head of Emorys Infectious Disease Unit declared that he posed no public health threat and could go free Today is a miraculous day Brantly said then I am thrilled to be alive to be well and to be reunited with my family Still he realizes the fight against Ebola is far far from over And its still personal Brantly said that he learned Tuesday morning that a doctor hed worked with in Liberia  another American like him and Writebol  had tested positive for the virus After hearing the news Brantly told NBC I spent a good long while in tearful prayer
