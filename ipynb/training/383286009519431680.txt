Lots of people think of fish as brain food And theres good reason Many kinds of fish  think salmon sardines tuna  contain high levels of omega fatty acids a class of polyunsaturated fat which have been shown to fight inflammation and improve the function of our neurons So why is it that a   of older women published in the journal   finds that omegas may not benefit thinking skills or help fend off cognitive decline Well its not clear But one possibility could be the design of the study The women enrolled in the study had blood tests taken  just one time  at the start of the study to measure the amount of omegas Then they were given tests each year for about six years to test their thinking and memory skills The researchers found no differences in declines in brain sharpness among the women who had high levels of omega s in their blood compared with those with low levels of omega s So why the negative finding Well the researchers didnt know what the womens eating habits were before or after the study  or how their habits may have changed during the study So for instance if the womens fish consumption or supplement regimen changed after the time of the first blood test this study wouldnt have picked it up Thats one explanation Its also possible that the study wasnt conducted for a long enough period of time or that the age of the women made it hard to suss out potential longterm benefits The other possibility Maybe a steady intake of omegas doesnt really lead to any measurable benefits in staving off cognitive decline One other note about the study design It didnt track how participants got their omegas  whether it was through food or through fish oil supplements As study author   of the University of Iowa points out in an email most randomized trials of omega supplements have not found an effect on cognitive function He cites this   which concluded that taking omega supplements does not seem to help healthy older people fend off cognitive decline So this raises a question If you   fish rather than take a fishoil supplement is there more likely to be a benefit Theres more than a suggestion that this is indeed the case For instance a   of older folks  and older enrolled in the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that people who were eating two or more fish meals per week had a slower rate of cognitive decline  about  percent slower  compared with those who ate fish less than once a week When you eat fish there are other nutrients such as vitamin E or vitamin D that youre getting at the same time says researcher   of the Mayo Clinic In other words its the whole food as a package that may be beneficial And this seems to be the general picture emerging in human health getting nutrients and healthful fats from the foods we eat as part of a healthful diet rather than from supplements may be the way to go In fact theres increasing evidence as outlined by   that we do our bodies no favors by taking a daily regimen of vitamins or supplements
