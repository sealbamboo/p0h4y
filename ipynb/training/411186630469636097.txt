The surgeon had no prestigious named professorship no NIH grant and no plum administrative position in the hospitals hierarchy But to the other surgeonsintraining and me he was exactly who we wanted to be  A decade or two earlier he had started out like us as a lowly resident in the medical center but had finished his training elsewhere When he returned to open a practice the other doctors in town welcomed him back as one of their own But they soon discovered that he had become a surgeon like few others He finished in an hour operations that took most surgeons three or four and had few complications and enviable patient outcomes I know whom Id call if I ever needed a surgeon a friend said to me after watching the surgeon breeze through what we thought would be a particularly challenging case One day I finally gathered the courage to ask him for his secret I halfexpected him to laugh at my question or decline to respond because the real answer was that he was simply born with such gifts like an Olympiclevel athlete or concert pianist  Instead he answered without hesitation Its doing the operations over and over and over again he said He described the hundreds of operations he had participated in during his residency and the final years of training when he felt as if he were living breathing and eating surgery I could have done these operations with my eyes closed he said grinning And he added with a chuckle with one hand tied behind my back I thought of his words often over the next few years as I tried to hone my own surgical skills And recently I was reminded of them once more when I read a   assessing the skills of young surgeons trained after regulations went into place limiting their work hours in the hospital For   in response to increasing pressure from politicians unions and sleep experts the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education the organization responsible for accrediting American medical and surgical training programs has been working to cap the hours that residents work In  the council passed the strictest limits yet To maintain their accreditation residency training programs had to abide by a   that limited all inhospital work including any elective moonlighting jobs to  hours per week mandated the number of hours free of duty after different duty periods eight hours off after hour duty periods and  hours off after hour duty periods and even specified the timing of strategic napping in no uncertain terms after  hours of continuous duty and between the hours of  pm and  am While most residency programs chafed under the exhaustively detailed regulations surgical training programs   adopting the new mandates For   surgical residency had been a period of both intensive experience and increasing responsibility under the guidance of more experienced surgeons More recent research has   demonstrating the strong link between a surgeons operative skill the number of operations performed and patient outcomes With limits set on their time at the hospital young surgeonsintraining had fewer opportunities to care for patients or scrub in on operations While previous generations of trainees had the luxury of participating in at least one operation a day new trainees had only enough time to be involved in     Calculating the number of hours lost by cutting back on inhospital time   that young surgeonstobe were now missing out on as much as a years worth of experience Adding to the challenge surgery itself was changing and the number of skills that surgeons now needed to acquire was expanding as never before The discovery of new medications like antiulcer agents rendered once standard operations less common but not entirely obsolete so surgeons still had to know how to perform all the operations without getting to practice them as often Huge advances in minimally invasive and robotic surgery allowed surgeons to remove inflamed gallbladders and deadly tumors with fiber optic telescopes miniature pliers and robotic tools through incisions small enough to be covered afterward with Bandaids But they still needed to know how to wield the scalpel and operate the old way in case of complications  Surgical training programs scrambled to make up for less time and cover the everexpanding body of knowledge by creating   and offering trainees experiences in simulated operating rooms and   using   and     But as   even the bestequipped simulation labs cannot replace a years worth of lost experience Researchers sent questionnaires to the directors of subspecialty fellowship training programs and asked them to comment on the bedside and operating skills of the young surgeons enrolling in their programs These fellowships are a kind of highlevel and often prestigious surgical gap year where young surgeons who have completed the basic fiveyear surgery residency can delay independent practice to pursue an additional year or two of training  The results were abysmal Fewer than half of the young surgeons could operate or make clinical decisions on their own Nearly a third of them were incapable of performing even the most basic operations like a gallbladder removal on their own And a quarter were unable to recognize the early signs of complications  Even in areas of surgery where the young surgeons had had supplementary online learning modules during their residency they performed poorly with more than half unable to perform basic maneuvers Its hard to compensate for realworld experiences said Dr Samer G Mattar lead author of the study and a professor of surgery at Indiana University School of Medicine While some observers have criticized the study for being selfserving  most respondents also noted that the young surgeons deficiencies resolved after additional training under their auspices  the findings are consistent with previous studies   for example found that a quarter of young surgeons in their final year of residency felt unprepared to practice independently   more and more young surgeons       were choosing to extend their training by a year or two to bolster their skills  And in what may be the starkest proof of the link between experience and proficiency the failure rates on certifying oral exams administered at the end of residency have almost doubled since the duty hour changes went into effect While  percent of wouldbe surgeons failed a little under a decade ago nearly    When you take a whole years worth of inhospital experiences out of training you cant be surprised that the product is not the same said Dr Frank R Lewis executive director of the   the major credentialing body in surgery that administers the certifying exams Still few surgical leaders are eager to go back to plus hour workweeks for trainees Instead many are now focusing on making training more efficient Some have advocated specialization as early as medical school so that young surgeonstobe can begin acquiring operating skills even before getting their MD Others have worked on creating more mentoring opportunities after the completion of residency to help close the experience gap Still others believe that what may be most helpful is adding greater flexibility to the current regulations so that trainees can elect to spend more time with a patient or scrubbed up in the operating room without fear of putting their residency programs accreditation in jeopardy Things needed to change Dr Lewis said but not recognizing the potential longterm effects was dangerous Even issues that seem completely obvious and onesided can sometimes have significant consequences
