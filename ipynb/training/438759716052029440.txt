Topping the list of occupations expected to grow between  and  are personal care aides in the No  slot  new positions home health aides No   jobs and nursing assistants No   jobs  All these workers provide similar services helping clients  mostly seniors  bathe dress get up in the morning and perform other activities at home or in group homes assisted living centers rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes Put all three numbers together and you have this eyeopener More than  million new paid caregivers will be needed to meet demand over the next decade  And that may be an underestimate According to   formerly the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute in  the direct care work force  by that point about  million strong  will become   surpassing the number of retail salespeople  PHIs projections draw on the Labor Departments figures but include caregivers hired directly by consumers  a group that the government doesnt track    Where will all these new workers come from After all these are lowpaid demanding jobs with high rates of injury and frequently no benefits There isnt going to be a big increase in the work force that typically fills these jobs  poorly educated low income usually minority women  over the next  years said Joshua Wiener director of the aging disability and longterm care program at   an independent research institute   Usually big demand and a limited supply would drive up prices in the labor market But in this case experts question whether that will occur  One reason About  percent of services provided by home care agencies are paid by Medicaid and Medicare Financial pressures on both programs are enormous making it unlikely that significant wage increases are in store  Another reason wages will likely remain relatively stagnant Most middleclass families simply cant afford to pay for these services and will do without experts said  Nationally agencies charge a median  an hour for personal care aides and  an hour for home health aides according to the latest survey by   Aides take home about half that amount  Since both the Affordable Care Act and the national Commission on LongTerm Care failed to come up with a national financing program for longterm care little help is available to most families needing to pay caregivers I dont get the sense that anyone in Washington feels a great urgency to step back into the longterm care debate and come up with a new solution said Steven Edelstein national policy director for PHI What can be done about the impending caregiver crisis Organizations that represent direct care workers argue that these jobs need to be made more attractive with better supervision and training more opportunities for advancement and yes higher wages  The Labor Departments decision last fall to    a move that guarantees them minimum wage and overtime pay  is a step in the right direction but it doesnt go far enough Mr Edelstein said    The direction of Medicaid policy is to provide more services to frail seniors in the home and fewer in institutions he said Yet this wont be possible unless steps are taken to create a more stable better trained work force Filling paid caregiving jobs with immigrants is another option  indeed already one in five direct care workers today is foreign born   But there is strong political opposition to increased immigration which may limit the number of potential caregivers Cultural and language differences can also complicate the caregiving relationship Lynn Feinberg a senior strategic policy adviser at   has two interesting suggestions Family members who had previously looked after loved ones could be recruited and trained to become paid caregivers she proposed Or retired nurses social workers and other health care professionals could be encouraged to see this as valuable parttime work once their fulltime careers are over
