On a frigid night recently in Randolph NJ the Jersey Wildcats junior hockey team flew across the home rink during practice at Aspen Ice Arena sending ice into the air Hockey is known for its collisions and   arent unusual but the players didnt seem particularly worried On the backs of their heads were flashing green lights signifying that all was well Well be behind the bench and as soon as a player comes back we can look right down and itll be a nice light said the coach Justin Stanlick If the light changes color we can know that player needs to go see a trainer to get cleared The light is part of a head impact sensor called the Checklight made by Reebok The device is a black skullcap with an electronic strip and three lights on the back It blinks green when a player has sustained no head impact on the ice yellow after a moderate impact and red after a severe one The Checklight relies on an accelerometer and a gyroscope to measure the force of an impact Coaches and parents have only to look to see if a player has taken a serious blow And because the sensors are objective Reebok executives say they may lessen the pressure on young athletes to project toughness and play through a concussion Gage Malinowski a yearold defenseman for the Wildcats recently returned to practice after suffering the latest in a series of concussions during a game in February Theres not a game where I dont have at least  hits he said While chasing a puck behind the net I just turned the wrong way and he hit me from behind Gage said Five minutes later I started to get blurry and so I didnt want to risk it Other players will say Im not tough enough he added But I dont care its my head Concussions are a growing concern in youth sports as they are at the higher levels By    high school and college athletes a year sustain concussions Experts say the total tally is likely much greater While there are no easy solutions Reebok and other companies are working on hightech aids Some are developing impact sensors that can be taped into football helmets or worn as mouth guards Triax Technologies in Norwalk Conn is testing an impact sensor worn as a headband with various teams including the University of New Haven womens soccer team Reebok plans to release a headband version of the Checklight later this year Impact sensors in helmets have been previously available but typically for  or more The Checklight retails for  Experts note that these are imprecise tools insufficient by themselves to indicate a concussion Another problem is that an impact that leaves one player concussed may have little effect on another Reebok would not disclose its thresholds for determining moderate and severe collisions only that the Checklight measures linear and rotational acceleration and the duration of the impact In January the   a nonprofit organization supported by sporting goods manufacturers that aims to limit the number of subconcussive hits sustained by athletes took a stab at quantifying a concussion threshold In an initiative modeled after baseballs pitch count which limits the number of pitches thrown in hopes of preventing elbow injuries the institute released a hit count   stating that what counts as a hit is one involving more than  Gs of linear acceleration in a millisecond window But a coauthor of the paper remained skeptical about applying a definitive threshold and about counting subconcussive hits There is not a known threshold for concussions said   an exercise and sport science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has been   Parents are going to buy a product thats potentially going to protect their kid but it can be very misleading Dr Guskiewicz added The science hasnt evolved to the point where we can interpret these metrics Though the science isnt there yet the Wildcats serve as an early indication that the sports marketplace is evolving They are the first hockey team Reebok has outfitted with the Checklight as part of the companys program to seed teams At the recent practice Rich Zuckerman of Florham Park NJ watched his yearold son Steven skate with the team that he may eventually join He wasnt wearing a Checklight and this was the first Mr Zuckerman had heard of it If it works its great he said with good reason Two years ago Steven sustained four concussions over a fourday period that included a football practice two hockey games and a football game He was out for six weeks We want to see the players long term said Mr Stanlick the Wildcats coach We want to see them stay in the sport and enjoy it
