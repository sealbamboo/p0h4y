Music helps make exercise more fun After all who doesnt love dancing the night away Or how about dancing  minutes away on a Saturday morning The other advantage of Groov classes for those of us who never took a dance lesson as a child is that all that concentrating on where to put hands and feet helps us forget about how hard were working Groov founded by dancerchoreographer Benjamin Allen calls itself a dance party and unlike the oldschool pounding music that accompanied workouts this workout is dancing I even felt like I might be able to use a couple of the moves I learned The teacher of my class Donisha Brown who has toured the world with the show Stomp had enough energy for all of us Groov  am Saturdays at Blackbird Dance Studio  N Fairfax Ave and other studios and timesÂ   Theres a live DJ to enhance the party atmosphere  All of us from the dancers in the class to the klutz me got a great workout Brown taught us the dance routine in bits at half speed and then had us dance from the top at full speed Three times during the hour the DJ blew a horn to signal a brief burst of traditional exercises like pushups Completely accepting and lots of fun I was nervous about my inexperience but I neednt have been Brown offered modifications for those who couldnt do steps the most energetic way Outside the studio she said no one is watching Have fun   a class slight variations at some locations
