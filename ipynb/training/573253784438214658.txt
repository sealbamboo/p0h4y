One early morning in September  Eric Jordan was awakened by the cries of his monthold son  and that kept him from dying in his sleep As he tried to go to his child Jordan fell to the floor paralyzed The opera singer would soon learn that he had undergone a severe stroke that robbed him of his speech After awakening from surgery Jordan still couldnt speak and feared his career singing bass with the Metropolitan Opera was over But he soon made an uplifting discovery Even as he struggled to relearn to speak he could sing Six weeks after his stroke Jordan  returned to sing on the Met stage and he remains on the roster today In a voice that can sound slightly robotic as he enunciated every syllable he spoke about his journey back from his stroke After he sweetly sang a few perfect bars of Puff the Magic Dragon the sentences that followed suddenly flowed freely My baby boy woke me at  in the morning I stood up and then passed out My wife reacted quickly She saw my face drooping and my right arm dangling I couldnt speak She called  and I was rushed to New York Presbyterian Hospital Conventional treatment did not work so a mechanical thrombectomy procedure was performed That means a small device was used to surgically remove the blood clot in my brain and blood flow was restored Every hospital should have one of those devices Those three things  my son my wife and the surgery  are why Im still alive The stroke affected the left part of my brain where speech and finemotor tuning are governed The right part of my brain is the singing part My piano playing and guitar picking are helping my finemotor skills After surgery I woke up in a panic because I was supposed to perform that night and I could not even speak I used to love to talk so it was terribly devastating Five days after my stroke I began physical speech and occupational therapy My speech pathologist taught me to speak loudly and slowly and to use short sentences My coach from the Met helped me regain my full ability to sing My wife Christina is also a singer and gave me so much support I got my chance to return to the Met when another singer had jury duty When I took the stage again I was very scared but happy and thankful all the emotions you could think or feel Luckily Im still an employable singer My longterm memory is fully intact My midterm memory is OK maybe at  But my shortterm memory is shot so I take a lot of notes My speech is improving every week Im happy to say that the singer might fully regain his speech someday I sing and scat my way through the day Instead of reading childrens books to my son Gabriel I sing them I will work with medical facilities to help stroke patients learn to recover their speech through singing If they are having trouble speaking I want them to remember that they can always sing through their troubles
