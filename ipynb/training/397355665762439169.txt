My being overweight is just  I dont know why its happened to me Shack says I dont know why I continue to overeat  After dropping out of college to join the work force Shack ate out three meals a day seven days a week By his th birthday the foot computer consultant weighed  pounds He decided he wanted a girlfriend and knew it would be difficult to find one at his current size So he started working out several hours a day  In six months he lost  pounds  A short time later he met Amy While the two were dating Shack caught mononucleosis or mono For months he slept  to  hours a day and slowly regained the weight he had lost  Amy didnt care She had started gaining weight in middle school and never stopped When she met Shack in  she carried  pounds on her foot frame  The couple married after three years together When she got pregnant with their first son Sidney Amy weighed  pounds When she delivered their second son James two years later she weighed more than   We were eating out and having fun and we just kept on getting bigger and bigger Amy remembers  The Shacks really wanted a girl to complete their family but Amy had trouble getting pregnant again After undergoing infertility treatment without success they decided to become foster parents  The interview process was brutal You guys are so large what are you going to do when you die Amy recalls the agency asking Whos going to take care of the children when you pass on It was something neither had considered  On June   the Shacks celebrated their sixth anniversary at Outback Steakhouse While they chowed down on Aussie cheese fries several rounds of bread and butter salad French onion soup an ounce prime rib baked potatoes with the works and dessert the couple realized they had to make a change  We knew we were heading down a path we werent going to be able to come back from Shack says  Amy decided that she would undergo gastric bypass surgery Never a foodie like Shack she figured the surgery would be the simplest way to cut back on her portion sizes  Shack made an appointment at his doctors office to weigh in because his home scale wouldnt go past  pounds He figured he would top out at  pounds   max When the doctors scale hit  he was floored  Shack decided to use the app   to track his calories He created a spreadsheet and figured out how much he needed to eat every day to reach his goal weight of  pounds in  months  At the end of the day losing weight is really just a big math equation  calories in calories out he says Amy had her surgery the following month The next day it felt like a truck hit me she says But she pushed through the pain altered her diet to eat small amounts every couple of hours and lost  pounds in five months   Two months later Amy found out she was pregnant It was a girl  She lost another  pounds during pregnancy which worried her obstetrician But a healthy Samantha Shack was born on November    Shack saw quick results as well He restricted his calories to  a day and lost his first  pounds in a few months By September  he had lost  pounds and had reached his goal weight LoseIt called him its  ever  That should have been the end of Shacks story But while losing weight is hard keeping it off often can be even harder  Shack stopped counting his calories and tried to stick to a healthy diet without constantly monitoring it He barely noticed when the pounds started to creep back on  Since my frame is so large I dont gain weight in my stomach I gain it head to toe he explains  Over the next two years he reached  pounds then   He and Amy became foster parents and a new influx of kids reminded Shack why he had lost weight in the first place In April  he decided he wanted to do a century bike ride of  miles Between April and November  he lost  pounds in training  After the bike race he regained some then dropped some He recently started gaining again when he lost his job But hes aware of his pattern  and has a plan to tackle the extra pounds  I havent been able to find my magic bullet he said Theres usually some motivation point that makes me want to lose weight Once I hit that goal I kind of lose my motivation Amy has maintained her goal weight of  pounds for more than three years She finished a half marathon in January She stays active  when you have six kids they are your activity  and continues to monitor what she eats closely She knows people have gained back their weight even after gastric bypass surgery  Im going to battle my weight for the rest of my life she says  No ones weight loss story really has an end  The goal of a healthy lifestyle is to avoid ending the tale too soon
