A health union is to ballot for industrial action over underpayment of staff unless it gets a satisfactory response within  hours Unison said thousands of healthcare workers were affected by the introduction of a new payroll system One of the trusts admitted there had been problems with the system But Unison fears there will be similar problems for  people when the new computer system is adopted by the other health trusts on  May Many frontline healthcare staff contacted the BBCs Nolan Show to say their pay was wrong  with one individual being underpaid more than  One nurse  who is owed   told The Nolan Show staff were outraged I have been told of another member of staff who got  for a months wage she said Thats absolutely horrendous its a fiasco I have now missed bills I am robbing Peter to pay Paul My mortgage is more important to keep a roof over my familys head Now Im being classed as having a bad credit history because I have missed bills Ray Rafferty from Unison said it was the fifth month that staff had been underpaid He said staff in the Belfast trust were also being affected This month we have thousands of staff in Belfast who have either not received their basic pay or the majority who have not received their allowances and overtime for any work they have done he said It is totally unacceptable Quite a lot of staff have no pay slips so they dont know whether the pay is right or wrong They are relying on checking the ATMs or going to their banks He said from  May the trusts would lose control of their payroll departments adding Its a serious problem Mr Rafferty has called for an urgent meeting with the health minister to address the situation Noone wants to have a strike in the health service but thats what its coming to  because the bottom line is the system is failing the staff who provide the care for the people of Northern Ireland We have thousands of members who have not been paid correctly for five almost six months The minister knows about this has known about it for some time He needs to put in emergency provision to actually resolve the situation Im  demanding a meeting with him now so that we can publicly discuss this and let our members know what is going to happen to fix the problem If not then we will put it to our members   are they prepared to take industrial action over this We need people paid within the next hours Damien Maguire from NIPSA said strike action could well be on the cards Many workers are returning after the Easter break many are going to find their pay wrong again he said This system has cost tens of millions of pounds its very clear that five months into it its not working properly We are calling for the Public Accounts Committee to look into the cost of this system and why is it not working It is not fit for purpose The South Eastern Trust said there had been problems with the system but that the underpayment issue was shared by other trusts
