Researchers warn of the health dangers of too much light while we try to sleep But how did our bedrooms become so bright There are regular warnings that people arent sleeping properly Too much light from electronic devices before bedtime   in bed Excessive caffeine Now theres another potential worry  too much light in the bedroom Previous studies have linked light at night with   Now a study of  women suggests that it could cause obesity in humans The work by Oxford University researchers for the Institute of Cancer Research found that women   if their bedroom was light enough to see across the researchers found  Prof DerkJan Dijk of the Surrey Sleep Centre said people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker But have our bedrooms got lighter There has probably been a trend towards lighter rooms over the past century says Alex Goddard curator at Londons Geffrye Museum which is devoted to the history of the home The first problem is more light outside houses Houses in builtup areas are surrounded by streetlights car headlights advertising and other buildings The Royal Commission on Light Pollutions  report Artificial Light in the Environment warned that in the seven years from  to  significant areas of the UK became more intensively lit at night The commission noted that outdoor lighting in the UK was growing at an estimated rate of about  per annum A survey in October  by Harris Poll Europe Omnibus Survey found a  third of those interviewed found that light outside bedroom windows led to sleepless nights The North West of England reported the worst problems with  of respondents having difficulties in sleeping because of light pollution  But as well as the rising amount of light outside our bedrooms changing home decor trends have exacerbated the problem  Many people choose lighter curtains and there has been a general move away from curtains to blinds In the Victorian period it was all the rage to have very heavy fulsome curtains Goddard says People liked really luxuriant fabric Now they dont as its hard to clean  Today light spaces with clean lines are desirable  Guardian interiors editor Ben Spriggs agrees Blinds have become more popular And curtains are often thinner Theres been an increase in linens and sheers which provide privacy but arent lightblocking at all A lot of it is down to money  thin is cheap he says Theres also a move to clearing away the clutter from windows which is what blinds do At the turn of the millennium blinds represented  of the domestic window coverings market according to Andrew Hartley director of AMA Research which conducts research into the construction sector Now that figure is  By contrast curtains have fallen back from  to  Much of that change occurred in the early part of the last decade Hartley says that although highspecification window coverings  such as plantationstyle shutters blackout curtains and blinds for skylights  have grown over this period so too have lowerquality goods at the bottom end of the market fuelled by the rise in the private rented sector The middle part of the market has been squeezed he says In short many people decorating a bedroom may be tempted by window coverings that leave the bedroom in a state of halflight rather than true dark And inside the rooms theres a fog of light from electronic devices How many bedrooms are lit by a series of pinpoints from standby lights Then theres alarm clocks digital displays and night lights The decor has an amplifying effect Dark walls are out says Goddard Light colours and wallpaper are in which dont dampen the light Bedrooms often have bigger windows today whether from warehouse conversions or new build she argues  Property developer Sarah Beeny says she cant sleep unless its dark While some parents use blackout curtains for young children its rare to find them in adults rooms she says People invest in cheap material she says Its a great shame peoples thinking is shorttermist  they think were going to redecorate in a year or two Her top priority is a good lining when buying curtains she says  But not everyone agrees dark is good Prof Jim Horne former head of Loughborough Universitys Sleep Research Centre doubts light at night causes obesity People sleep with their eyes shut and can generally ignore what light there is he argues Its lighter in the summer than the winter but theres no evidence that people sleep fewer hours he adds  Even if people are waking up when it gets light most people fall asleep again quickly The acid test is are you sleepy during the day He suspects there may be other reasons for the obesity correlation One has to look at whether sleeping in the dark is a surrogate for something else Do people who sleep in light rooms have a fear of the dark Are they more agitated generally They could be more susceptible to putting on weight he believes More research is needed before people draw any conclusions he says The idea that we should all blacken our room is wrong he says  An emphasis on absolutely dark bedrooms could even be dangerous If its pitchblack then elderly people getting up in the night might have an accident Horne says The evidence is not yet conclusive But more studies linking light pollution in bedrooms to problems may prompt people to replace those flimsy blinds with thick curtains And allow sunstreaked bedrooms once again to become places of solemn repose
