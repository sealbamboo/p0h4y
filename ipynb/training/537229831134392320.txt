A problem freezing stem cells may have contributed to the death of a yearold girl a coroner has ruled Cancer patient Sophie RyanPalmer died in  after the frozen cells were used in a bone marrow transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital  Three other children also died but a more successful grafting of the cells would not have prevented their deaths the coroner said Eight children in total had problems after the treatment the inquest heard Great Ormond Street Hospital said tests carried out before the transplants had found no problems The court heard the hospital had been freezing the stem cells using the same method for  years  But in June  concerns were first raised after Sophie from Sunbury Surrey did not make progress after she had the treatment  In July of that year monthold Ryan Loughran from Bournemouth died Sophie died a week later on  July while fouryearold Katie Joyce from Hertfordshire died in October Fiveyearold Muhanna alHayany who had come from Kuwait for treatment died in August   All were treated at the hospital at the same time but the inquest heard they died at different times because of their differing illnesses  The treatment was stopped in October Coroner Mary Hassell ruled that the treatment may have contributed to Sophies death however it was unclear  She said the other three children were so seriously ill that the stem cell treatment would not have changed the outcome The court heard that the hospital could not find the reason why the process was no longer working but an expert from University College London found the stem cells were not maturing properly  We dont know why the method stopped working and theres no widespread consensus said Ms Hassell Sophies mother Debbie Ryan said Its a lot of dont know we dont know why which to me is not good enough not in this day and age  Great Ormond Street have been fantastic to save her over the years I wont put them down for that but unfortunately I feel that at the last hurdle they let her down badly  A hospital statement said We understand that this has been an immensely distressing process for all of the families involved  These four young patients were extremely poorly children with complex conditions and it is frustrating for everyone concerned especially their families for it still to be unclear exactly what caused the freezing problem and to what extent this might have contributed to one patients eventual outcome It said it had now reintroduced freezing of cells using an alternative method which is being closely monitored  The hospital now holds meetings every month  instead of every six months  to review the treatment  It also said it would listen to the opinion of scientists as well as consultants  The coroner added that she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report for NHS England
