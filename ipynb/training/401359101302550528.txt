One in seven  said last year that they smoked cigarettes down from  in  But the surveys found a bigger change when they asked about hookahs snus dissolvable tobacco and ecigarettes Ecigarette use nearly doubled between  and  for middleschool students from  to  and the use of hookahs by Latinos rose from  to  Among highschool students ecigarette use rose from  to  the use of dissolvable tobacco doubled from  to  and cigar use rose among nonLatino blacks from  to  Many of the cigars are almost indistinguishable from cigarettes in size shape and filter But because they are not cigarettes they are exempt from Food and Drug Administration restrictions on flavoring in cigarettes said Brian King senior scientific adviser in the CDCs Office on Smoking and Health which published the study in the agencys Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report For the moment menthol is excluded from the flavoring ban imposed by the FDA whose scientific advisory committee is evaluating the evidence on menthol and is expected to publish a report on it this month The increase in the use of the newer entrants may have several explanations Dissolvable products can be strips or orbs containing nicotine that dissolve on the tongue No odor no burn holes in sweaters no stigma of being a smoker And because they tend be taxed at a much lower rate than cigarettes or cigars theyre usually much cheaper King said The primary takeaway is these types of products deserve the same kinds of sales and marketing restrictions as traditional products like cigarettes and cigars said King King cited increased marketing efforts the availability and visibility of the products as well as the perception that they may be safer alternatives to the traditional means of getting a nicotine fix  cigarettes and cigars Ecigarette makers advertise on television something traditional cigarette makers have been banned from doing since  Are they safer In terms of ecigarettes theres not a lot of information on the longterm health impact King said Though there is anecdotal evidence that some people use them to quit smoking cigarettes or cigars that can be problematic because there is also evidence that nicotine  however it may be absorbed  may adversely affect brain development among youths he said Our general message is that any of these products are not appropriate for use he said None of these emerging products are safe alternatives to traditional cigarette use and efforts should be made to get kids to stop so we dont have a next generation of tobaccoaddicted adults He noted that  of smokers started as teenagers King said he was hoping to include questions on future surveys that would shed light on whether ecigarettes are helpful in quitting smoking or are a gateway into tobacco use A survey published in September found that one in five middleschool students who said they had never used conventional cigarettes reported having used ecigarettes Thats concerning King said In a statement the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said that while it was troubling that the rate of cigarette use remains stagnant it is even more disconcerting that teenagers are increasingly turning to other products that are produced and sold without any federal oversight The network called on the FDA to immediately assert its regulatory authority over all tobacco products A spokesman for Altria the parent company of Philip Morris USA US Smokeless Tobacco and John Middleton said the company was not trying to get kids to use tobacco products Our goal is we market to current adult tobacco consumers and support programs to help ensure that kids dont use tobacco products  whether its a conventional cigarette an electronic cigarette or smokeless tobacco said David Sylvia in a telephone interview
