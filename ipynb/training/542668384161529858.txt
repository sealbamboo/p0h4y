For years Ive been writing about the benefits of short bursts of exercise Studies and anecdotes suggest that  minutes seven minutes six minutes or even four minutes of very hard exercise interspersed with periods of rest can lead to a robust improvement in fitness But I suspect that this column is the least amount of exercise I will ever write about According   a single minute of intense exercise embedded within an otherwise easy minute workout can improve fitness and health Just one minute   This is good news for busy people who have tried unsuccessfully to fit even short workouts into their schedules The overall time commitment for intervaltraining sessions is not quite as slight as many of us might wish Consider for instance an interval session in which someone rides a stationary bike as hard as possible for  seconds followed by four minutes or so of easy pedaling If that person completes four of these intervals with two or three minutes of warmup and cooldown added at the beginning and end of the workout the entire session lasts for almost  minutes a time commitment that some people might consider unsustainable These concerns reached the laboratory of Martin Gibala a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario He and his colleagues have conducted many of the most influential recent studies of highintensity interval training and many of the scientists there regularly exercise with interval training They too had noticed that intervaltraining sessions were not quite as truncated as some people hoped and had begun to wonder if it might be possible to lower the overall time commitment But if so they wondered how low could someone go in terms of time and still gain health and fitness benefits To find out the McMaster researchers recruited a group of  sedentary and overweight but otherwise healthy men and women They focused on these volunteers because sedentary overweight people often are on the cusp of serious health issues such as diabetes which might be kept at bay with exercise but sedentary people also often cite a lack of time as their reason for not exercising They invited the volunteers to the lab where researchers took muscle biopsies and measured their aerobic endurance blood pressures and blood sugar levels Then they asked the volunteers to complete a truly timeefficient intervaltraining program using computerized stationary bicycles Each session consisted of three second allout intervals during which riders pushed the pedals absolutely as hard as they could manage followed by two minutes of slow easy pedaling The riders also warmed up for two minutes and cooled down for three for a grand total of  minutes of total exercise time with one minute of that being the intense interval training The volunteers completed three of these sessions per week leading to  minutes of weekly exercise for six weeks Then they returned to the lab to be retested Their bodies were it turned out quite different now The men and women had increased their endurance capacity by an average of  percent a significant improvement They also as a group had healthier blood pressures and higher levels within their muscles of certain biochemical substances that increase the number and activity of mitochondria Mitochondria are the energy powerhouses of cells so more mitochondria mean better endurance and fitness Interestingly the male volunteers also had significantly improved their bloodsugar control but the female volunteers had not The researchers suspect that fundamental differences in how the genders burn sugar or fat to fuel exercise might affect how each responds to some aspects of interval training But more research is needed with both men and women before scientists will be able to understand the import of this difference Dr Gibala said   In the meantime the message from the study that most of us will grasp at is of course that one minute of exercise is all you need But Dr Gibala would like people to remember that  minutes of overall exercise time is involved for a total of  minutes per week He also suspects that with this study scientists are plumbing the lowest limits of worthwhile exercise time Weve dropped from second allout intervals to second intervals he said because for many people those last  seconds were excruciating Most of us however can complete second allout efforts without wishing to cry he said Halving the intervals again however to second efforts probably would mot provide the same benefits Dr Gibala said although maybe if you did more of them it might work He and his colleagues are studying these and other questions related to interval training For now relying on one minute of hard exercise to ease you through the holidays with your health intact seems feasible he said And the exercise does not need to be cycling Sprint up stairs in second bursts he said or even run hard in place The point is that time constraints shouldnt keep anyone from exercise In the time it took to read this column you could be done with your workout
