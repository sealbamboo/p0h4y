Finally the Nigerian government is fulfilling its promise to help thousands of kids who have been exposed to toxic levels of lead After months of delay and red tape the government has    million to clean up lead in soil near   in northern Nigeria We had a glass of champagne after the announcement says   who directs Doctors Without Borders in Nigeria But its not done yet This is only the beginning of the work For nearly a year now Gayton and his medical team have wanted to treat roughly  children in the town of   for lead poisoning But the doctors didnt have a safe place to set up clinics Gayton also says it would have been useless to try to clear lead out of kids systems only to send them back to a contaminated village The release of the funds will allow soil remediation to begin around Bagega and then kids will have a safe place to return to after treatment Gayton says the contamination levels at Bagega are particularly high It may be one of the worst lead contamination sites in the world he tells Shots Lead poisoning in northern Nigeria has already killed more than  children and sickened thousands more About a decade ago as the international price of gold   toward record highs villagers started mining gold from local rock formations Unfortunately the gold deposits in this part of Nigeria run alongside veins of lead As miners crush the ore to process it they release toxic lead dust into the air Some children showed up at health clinics with blood lead levels above  or  times higher than what the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   is a cause for concern The lead poisoning has caused cognitive and developmental delays in children In severe cases kids were going into convulsions and even dying An Idahobased company remediated the soil in several villages in the state of Zamfara but the money to clean up Bagega had been   in the Nigerian bureaucracy for more than a year Doctors Without Borders physicians have been treating only the most severe cases of lead poisoning from Bagega saying that more widespread treatment would be futile if the patients immediately return to a contaminated environment Gayton says the release of the remediation money is a major step forward for helping these kids But the long delay has exacted a heavy toll By now the most vulnerable children are already dead he says
