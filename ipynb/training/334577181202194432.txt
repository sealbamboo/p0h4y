Americans are repeatedly told to cut back on salt to reduce the risk of heart disease But there are new questions being raised about the possible risks of reducing sodium too much So how low should we go Currently the government   that Americans should aim for  milligrams per day And people older than  as well as those with high blood pressure diabetes or kidney disease are advised to reduce sodium even further down to  mg per day But a panel of experts convened by the Institute of Medicine concludes in a   that the evidence on direct health outcomes does not support recommendations to lower sodium intake  to or even below  mg per day Why We asked the committee chairman   a dean and professor of public health at the University of Pennsylvania to summarize the panels findings for us The net conclusion is that people who are eating too much sodium should lower their sodium but it is possible that if you lower it too much you may do harm Strom says a lot more research is needed to better understand how ultralowsodium diets may be beneficial or harmful Strom pointed to an   of people with congestive heart failure as an example of research that has hinted that diets too low in sodium may be problematic for certain people The people on the lowsodium diet actually did worse compared to those on mediumsodium diets says Strom They had more hospital readmissions and they had a higher mortality rate He says its unclear if the results would be the same for Americans with congestive heart failure since treatments here are different than they are in Italy But he says the findings raise questions The American Heart Association which recommends a lowsodium  mg diet for all Americans released a   stating that it disagrees with the key findings of the new report And some preventive health experts are critical too The World Health Organization   that elevated blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable death which suggests that staving off high blood pressure with lowsodium diets is an important strategy Sodium reduction remains a critically important component of public health efforts designed to  prevent cardiovascular disease   of Johns Hopkins University writes in an email Appel points out that the studies that suggest that lowsodium diets are harmful tend to focus on sick populations in which illness leads to low sodium intake rather than the reverse Some groups of Americans including older adults and AfricanAmericans are especially sensitive to the bloodpressure lowering effects of cutting sodium Appel says So the strategy of aiming for lowsalt diets has tremendous potential to reduce racial disparities in blood pressurerelated cardiovascular disease The bottom line according to   director of nutrition for the Center for Science in the Public Interest is that Americans are eating way too much salt on average about  milligrams a day And we know that much is harmful she says It increases blood pressure which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke And she says focusing on the potential risks of a verylowsodium diet distracts from the more important conversation about how to get Americans to start consuming less To better understand just how much salt is found in the typical lunch out I met Liebman at a food court    Our first stop was McDonalds where it turns out burgers   as the fries  mg and up to  if you get the Angus bacon burger Liebman says Put the burger and fries together and youve already reached the recommended daily sodium intake Liebman says its a similar story at every chain from Subway to Chipotle to Pizzeria Uno McDonalds has pledged to reduce sodium  percent across its menu by  So even though the new study raises questions about potential harms of ultralowsodium diets with a food supply like ours most of us consume way too much salt not too little
