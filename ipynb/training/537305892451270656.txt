It will not surprise people who spend time in nursing homes  who live or work there who volunteer or visit family members  that residents can lash out at each other Resident A is sitting in a wheelchair in a common area yelling out said Karl Pillemer a   recounting an actual and typical example from his latest study Resident B goes over and says Be quiet stop yelling Resident A hits Resident B on the hand The nursing aide separates them then sees someone else wandering and has to leave When she does Resident B kicks Resident A and the cycle continues   Nursing facilities house people who are disinhibited who have dementia who share close quarters with strangers who may suffer pain or lose their ability to communicate in more acceptable ways On occasion some will hit kick grab bite and shove Or threaten bully and fling insults including racial slurs Or say and do things that are sexually inappropriate What may surprise people  and it certainly stunned Dr Pillemer and his fellow researchers  is how often such incidents occur Their fiveyear study presented at the Gerontological Society of Americas annual meeting in Washington earlier this month found that  percent of nursing home residents had been involved in what the researchers call residenttoresident elder mistreatment  verbal physical or sexual  in the previous month One in five We were shocked by how extensive this was Dr Pillemer told me in an interview Its a feature of nursing home life something that occurs daily that staff and residents almost take for granted Accurately tracking this kind of mistreatment presents formidable difficulties Residents can be unreliable reporters because they have dementia or poor hearing or sight or because they fear retaliation Staff members worry about what supervisors will say Besides Dr Pillemer points out they cant be everywhere at once and dont see everything Official records are haphazard and incomplete So in this study of more than  residents in  large nursing homes in New York State five urban and five suburban the Cornell team codirected by   used multiple methods to try to quantify the extent of resident aggression They interviewed almost half the residents using a survey that took nearly a year to develop and validate and also administered tests of mood and cognitive and functional ability They interviewed the aides who provide most of the handson care and provided simple coupons the aides could use to report incidents while on duty Research assistants spent two to six months in each facility observing for themselves The team also combed through medical records Its enormously time consuming Dr Pillemer said But it gives a comprehensive picture of what happens What happened was that among these elderly mean age  frail people  percent had experienced incidents of verbal mistreatment within the previous month Nearly  percent were involved in physical and  percent in sexual mistreatment And  percent experienced other forms like other residents entering their rooms uninvited or rummaging through their belongings Since even this multipronged effort probably missed cases Dr Pillemer thinks these numbers understate the problem Im using terms like were involved or experienced because the researchers deliberately didnt try to ascertain the perpetrators Often by the time someone has identified that this occurred its extremely difficult to detect who was the aggressor and who the victim Dr Pillemer said But the harm ripples beyond either party frightening other residents and staff members We expect it is quite emotionally stressful or damaging even if you arent involved to see people fighting in these close quarters and to wonder if you yourself could become a victim Dr Pillemer said The study also profiles the residents most likely to be involved Theyre a little younger than the norm and physically mobile and they have moderate  not severe  cognitive impairment Its not typically the person sitting quietly or confined to bed Dr Pillemer said Its people capable of arguing about changing the channel on the television Theyre more likely to have symptoms of depression and for some reason less likely to be AfricanAmerican And the rate of incidents is much higher in dementia units In attempting to reconstruct these altercations the researchers found that invasion of personal space is a big factor Dr Pillemer said Roommate disagreements prompted conflict Crowding and congestion also played a role When a whole bunch of people with wheelchairs and walkers are clustered around an elevator or in a hallway they start to get frustrated These findings begin to suggest possible solutions hiring more staff members training them to reduce resident conflict treating residents depression designing facilities that minimize congestion and provide private rooms Resident mistreatment aside theyre changes that would improve care and quality of life in nursing homes period What worries Dr Pillemer is not that nursing homes cant find ways to reduce residents mistreatment of each other but that they wont face much pressure to try The public already has such low expectations of nursing home conditions he said that it may be hard to generate outrage about this issue let alone action Unfortunately for nursing homes a finding like this doesnt have the same impact that it would in other care settings like child care he said Which is perhaps the saddest part of the problem
