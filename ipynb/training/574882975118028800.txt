Are people living in Rwanda really likely to live more years in good health than people in the most deprived  of England asks Anthony Reuben You would certainly think that if you read some news articles on the subject at the end of last week It was based on a   on Thursday from the Office for National Statistics which showed the inequality in healthy life expectancy across England At birth the top  of people could expect to live for  years in good health The bottom  had a healthy life expectancy of  years That year gap between the highest and lowest healthy life expectancy is quite startling but does it mean the bottom  are in a worse situation than people living in Rwanda The figures for Rwanda come from the   It tells us that in  people born in Rwanda had a healthy life expectancy at birth of  years  Incidentally that is an extraordinary improvement for Rwanda which only  years earlier had a healthy life expectancy of  And it makes it look as if Rwandans have a higher healthy life expectancy than the most deprived  of people in England But if you scroll down to the WHO figures on the UK they give a healthy life expectancy of  years which is about the same as the ONS figures gave for the healthiest  in England That suggests that the ONS and the WHO are using different methods of calculating healthy life expectancy which is indeed the case What accounts for the difference is that the WHOs survey asks detailed questions about peoples health and uses the answers to subtract years of illhealth from life expectancy figures weighted according to the severity of the ill health The ONSs Annual Population Survey just asks people if their health is very good good fair bad or very bad The WHOs methodology tends to lead to fewer people being classified as being in ill health The organisation also warns about the challenges of collecting such data in lower income countries which makes international comparisons difficult We do not know how people in the most deprived  of areas in England would come out under the WHOs methodology but they are likely to get a higher healthy life expectancy than they do under the ONS system  So we do not know whether those  have a lower healthy life expectancy than the people of Rwanda  sorry
