Let me confess  I love sugar   I dont have it in tea or coffee but Im partial to biscuits cakes sweets and fruit juice which are packed with the stuff I guess I consume way more than the current recommended limit that  of my calories should come from added sugar or the natural sugar in fruit juice I am not alone  Every age group in the UK exceeds the current guidelines So halving the sugar limit to  is to say the least ambitious  When it comes to tooth decay added sugar is hard to defend  More than a quarter of five year olds have tooth decay But on the wider issue of promoting public health the new guidelines on sugar are fundamentally about calorie control Added sugar is a major source of calories  and given that two thirds of adults and a third of children are overweight or obese  cutting sugar consumption could make a dramatic impact on our waistlines and the health of the nation Obesity raises the risk of heart disease Type  diabetes and many cancers  Sugary drinks deserve special attention according to Dr Alison Tedstone chief nutritionist at Public Health England There is something special about sugarsweetened drinks that appears to encourage overconsumption Among the  studies analysed by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition SACN was research showing an association  but no clear link  between sweet fizzy drinks and the risk of Type  diabetes Its worth pointing out that the excludes the sugar in whole fruit or milk   So if you cut out added sugar what should you eat instead   We need to reduce sugar intake but should not swap from sugar to fat said Prof Susan Jebb of the University of Oxford  A greater proportion of our plate should be fruit and vegetables and more fibrerich carbohydrates and whole grain The draft report from the SACN also recommended that the population increase our daily fibre intake to g a day for adults To do that you need to eat all of the following  five portions of fruit and vegetables two slices of wholemeal bread a high fibre breakfast cereal a baked potato and a portion of whole wheat pasta Compare that to added sugar where you can hit your limit simply by drinking a can of fizzy pop  My colleagues in the health and science unit at the BBC are a friendly bunch who have got into the habit of bringing in cakes and biscuits  many of them homemade Barely a day goes by without some calorie and fatladen goodies being offered   Today it was those butterysweet French cakes known as madeleines  Yesterday there was fruit cake and some suspiciouslooking yellow and pink marshmallow biscuits   Of course if you are active then the odd sugary treat is fine   After todays report perhaps a switch to some fruit might be an idea   But offered an apple or a biscuit with my cup of tea I know its the latter Id choose
