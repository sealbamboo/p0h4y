Across the US many parttime workers have joined the millions shopping for coverage in the new health care marketplace Some are uninsured Others are being pushed into the new exchanges because their employers  companies that include Trader Joes and Home Depot  decided to drop coverage for parttimers Jaime for example is a nursing student who lives in Redlands Calif and works  to  hours per week at a local Home Depot He asked that his last name not be used fearing repercussions at work Jaime spends almost  a year for a health insurance policy that Home Depot offers to parttimers covering both him and his wife But the company will stop offering that benefit at the end of this year because it says the coverage doesnt meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act So Jaime has been shopping for a policy on the California exchange and says hes pleasantly surprised The program would be an improvement he says because the policy costs about the same as his old plan but there are no lifetime caps on coverage like there were on the Home Depot policy Most corporatesponsored health care plans for parttime workers dont provide very good coverage says Larry Levitt senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and an expert of the new health care marketplaces And workers for companies like Trader Joes which has a fairly good health plan for parttimers may suddenly find they can do better Its very likely that these parttime workers will get a better deal in the new marketplaces Levitt says Trader Joes for example will offer cash to parttimers starting in January to help pay for their insurance and many of the workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them pay their premiums So theyre likely to be much better off Levitt says Trader Joes says it believes  percent of its parttime workers will pay less for comparable coverage in the health care exchanges But that leaves  percent who could pay more including Jane a student and mother of two Its really disheartening she says Im absolutely disappointed by it Jane who didnt want her real name used because the company discourages its employees from talking to the press works fewer than  hours a week at a Trader Joes in Austin Texas I would say that the insurance that I get through Trader Joes right now is some of the best insurance that Ive received as an adult she says Trying to match that coverage and price hasnt been easy Jane hasnt yet been able to get a firm quote from healthcaregov but says her best estimate so far has been disappointing a premium of at least  a month  a year  for her family of four Thats versus the  a month Im paying right now she says And thats not even taking into account the difference in benefits And Jane says shes troubled by the results from another calculator on the Kaiser Family Foundation website that estimates the familys annual premiums will be more than  Thats partly because the site judges that her family isnt eligible for any state subsidies As a resident of Texas either way I look at it Im getting a reduction in benefits and an increase in price by moving to the government exchange Jane says One reason may be that Texas like a number of other states has not expanded its Medicaid program Levitt says thats led to a sort of Catch In states that dont expand Medicaid Levitt says you end up with this gap group  people who are not poor enough or dont have the right family circumstances to qualify for Medicaid but ironically dont make enough to qualify for tax credits So says Levitt whether youre going to be better off in the government marketplaces can have a lot to do with what state you live in Still he says in general the exchanges will benefit parttime workers Employers are not required to provide coverage for these workers Levitt says and they are likely better off getting subsidized coverage in the marketplace And he adds its likely that the exchanges will benefit from an influx of parttime workers since they tend to be younger and healthier than average
