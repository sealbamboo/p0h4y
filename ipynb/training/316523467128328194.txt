I was not  Scientists know what causes allergies When particles of pollen pet dander or certain types of food enter our bodies theyre called antigens If your body has a sensitivity to that particle it mistakes the harmless element for a dangerous invader according to the   The particle then becomes what we call an allergen although a sensitivity to a substance alone doesnt guarantee you will develop an allergy  Allergens cause your body to produce Immunoglobulin E or IgE antibodies Antibodies are used to identify and destroy dangerous invaders Unfortunately IgE antibodies also release histamine and other chemicals that can create an allergic reaction  But what causes one person to become sensitive to these indiscriminate antigens floating through the air while another sails through life with dry eyes and clear sinuses Scientists arent exactly sure but they have a few ideas  Dr Christine Cole Johnson has been studying allergies since the early s Her research team at Henry Ford Hospital was the first to show that having a pet in the house during your childs first year of life may protect him or her from developing allergies  a finding thats since been    Her latest research suggests allergy development starts even before that  Johnson analyzed data from a group of more than  newborns who were born in Michigan between  and  and have been evaluated by researchers at  month  months  year and  years old She found that babies born by cesarean section are six times more likely to be sensitive to dust mite allergens than babies born naturally The researcher found similar results for exposure to cat and doghair allergens  Babies who are born via Csection have a different   in their gastrointestinal tract Johnson said A microbiome is what scientists use to describe the bacteria communities that reside in humans whether its in our mouths on our skin or in our digestive system Its pretty astonishing In human beings bacterial cells outnumber human cells  to  Johnson said These bacteria are important  we couldnt exist without them In the womb babies are sterile Johnson explained When they go through the birth canal they get exposed to the entire bacteria population of their mothers vaginal and GI microbiomes Through this exposure their own immune systems learn the difference between good and bad bacteria  ie what to fight off and what to use  Babies born through Csection have bacteria in their gut that more closely resembles their mothers skin microbiome Johnson said Eventually their digestive bacteria normalize but that delay could give allergen exposure time to develop into a sensitivity  Of course thats just one possible cause of allergies  or just one possible cause of many possible causes  Johnsons colleague Dr Haejin Kim an allergist at Henry Ford is looking into how genetics may play a role  Kims latest study found AfricanAmerican children are sensitized to food allergens three times more often than Caucasian children It also concluded that an AfricanAmerican kid with an allergic parent is twice as likely to be sensitized to an environmental allergen than an AfricanAmerican kid without an allergic parent  Kim said her results didnt change with the childs birth order  another possible allergy risk factor  or if the child was male or female Race alone put them at a higher risk This suggests that allergies might be genetic Kim said something scientists have long suspected  But its not like a genetic disease thats  inherited Theres no one gene for allergies or asthma Its probably a combination of multiple genes interacting somehow with the environment   Up to  million Americans have some kind of allergy    Jonathan Silverberg a dermatologist at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center in New York recently analyzed data from more than  children to determine whether children born outside the United States were as likely as American children to develop allergies  He found that foreignborn children residing in the United States had half the risk of developing allergies than those who were born here That was true for all types of allergies including food allergies although the association was strongest for asthma  Silverberg and his colleagues started the study after realizing they were seeing foreignborn children at their practice developing allergies much later in life They found that the foreignborn kids who lived in the United States for more than  years had a higher prevalence of allergies than the children who had only been in the country for a couple of years  Scientists know that environmental exposures play a role in allergic disease you cant be sensitized to something youve never been exposed to But in the past researchers have focused on allergens in the air Silverberg said such as pollen or ragweed instead of other environmental exposures These other factors could be related to a childs climate diet or geographyspecific infections   What this study shows is that theres something about what were experiencing in the US compared to many other countries that seems to really lead people to or unmask allergic disease he said  Which factor  if any  plays the dominant role is so far unclear  Its hard to make any practical conclusions from these kinds of studies Silverberg said But eventually knowing where allergies come from could help us figure out a way to prevent them or at least treat them more effectively  Then allergy sufferers will be able to frolic in the flowers and roll in the grass and eat peanuts just like everyone else
