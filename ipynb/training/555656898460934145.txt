Neurodegenerative diseases have been halted by harnessing the regenerative power of hibernation scientists say  Bears hedgehogs and mice destroy brain connections as they enter hibernation and repair them as they wake up A UK team discovered coldshock chemicals that trigger the process They used these to prevent brain cells dying in animals and say that restoring lost memories may eventually be possible  Experts have described the findings as promising and exciting In the early stages of Alzheimers and other neurodegenerative disorders synapses are lost This inevitably progresses to whole brain cells dying But during hibernation  of the connections in the brain  synapses  are culled as the body preserves precious resources over winter  And remarkably those connections are reformed in the spring with no loss of memory In experiments nonhibernating mice with Alzheimers disease and prion disease were cooled so their body temperature dropped from C to C Young diseased mice lost synapses during the chill and regained them as they warmed up Old mice also lost brain connections but were unable to reestablish them  The study   found levels of a coldshock chemical called RBM soared when young mice were chilled but not in old mice It suggested RBM was key to the formation of new connections In a further set of tests the team showed the brain cell deaths from prion disease and Alzheimers could be prevented by artificially boosting RBM levels Prof Giovanna Mallucci from the MRC Toxicology Unit in Leicester told the BBC News website This gives us a target to develop a drug in the same way paracetamol is used for a fever rather than a cold bath Memories can be restored during hibernation as only the receiving end of the synapse shuts down I asked Prof Mallucci if memories could be restored in people if their synapses could be restored Absolutely because a lot of memory decline is correlated with synapse loss which is the early stage of dementia so you might get back some of the synapse youve lost The discovery comes from the laboratory that was the   in a neurodegenerative disease It is still only an interesting concept but has attracted some praise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Dr Doug Brown the director of research and development at the Alzheimers Society said We know that cooling body temperate can protect the brain from some forms of damage and its interesting to see this protective mechanism now also being studied in neurodegenerative disease Connections between brain cells  called synapses  are lost early on in several neurodegenerative conditions and this exciting study has shown for the first time that switching on a coldshock protein called RBM can prevent these losses  While we dont think body cooling is a feasible treatment for longterm progressive conditions like Alzheimers disease this research opens up the possibility of finding drugs that can have the same effect We are very much looking forward to seeing this research taken forward to the next stage Dr Eric Karran the director of research at Alzheimers Research UK said the study was promising and highlights a natural process nerve cells use to protect themselves He added that a future treatment able to bolster nerve cells against damage could have widereaching benefits
