Over winter break Carolyn Bates a college senior and a friend each picked out five pairs of jeans at a Gap store in Indianapolis and eagerly tried them on But the growing silence in their separate fitting rooms was telling At last one friend called out Dang it these fit everywhere but my thighs I wish my legs werent so huge The response My pair is way too long I need to be taller or skinnier The young women slumped out of the store feeling lousy This exchange is what psychological researchers call fat talk the bodydenigrating conversation between girls and women Its a bonding ritual they describe as contagious aggravating poor body image and even setting the stage for eating disorders Some researchers have found that fat talk is so embedded among women that it often reflects not how the speaker actually feels about her body but how she is expected to feel about it And while research shows that most women neither enjoy nor admire fat talk it compels them In   admitted to engaging in it  Alexandra F Corning a research associate professor in psychology at the University of Notre Dame wondered whether a womans size would affect her likability when she engaged in fat talk   Dr Corning showed  undergraduates photos of two thin and two overweight women each making either a positive or negative remark about her body  Because of the stigma against heavier people Dr Corning expected that the most popular option would be a thin woman who made positive comments about her body But she found that wasnt the case The most likable woman chosen by the students was overweight and quoted as saying I know Im not perfect but I love the way I look I know how to work with what Ive got and thats all that matters The results were heartening Dr Corning said a glimmer that nearly two decades of positive bodyimage campaigns may be taking hold But she acknowledged her experiment had limitations Are the students really liking these women the most Or are they saying it because they think they should said Dr Corning They might like them more but would they really want to hang out with them Renee Engeln who directs the Body and Media Lab at Northwestern University cautioned that we have complicated reactions to confident women in general and particularly to women who are confident about their bodies Women sometimes see them as arrogant Fat talk has insinuated itself among men too Dr Engeln added though it is far less frequent than with women In addition men are more likely to   like muscular bulk or being too thin something women rarely fret about she said  But putting a stop to fat talk is difficult Dr Corning said in part because it feels airless and scripted and seems to offer the responder no avenue to change the dynamic without threatening the relationship She gave an example First friend I cant believe I ate that brownie I am so fat Second friend You must be joking  you are so not fat Just look at my thighs  The second friends reply an empathetic selfdeprecating retort to maintain the friendship on equal standing includes reflexive praise of the first friends body supposedly feeding the first friends hungry cry for affirmation Dr Corning said But to do so the second friend has eviscerated herself a    Dr Corning said that to break the cycle a person shouldnt engage But particularly for younger women its hard to say something like Hey no negative selftalk or Why do we put ourselves down Instead for adolescents she suggested Keep it light its not a moment for major social activism Teenagers can change the topic They do it all the time Ms Bates who recently graduated from Notre Dame pointed out that when you focus on clothes and make it about your body youve put your friend in a position where she cant say anything right She cant be honest because it could come off as hurtful That winter day as she and her friend drove away from the Gap feeling so deflated her friend said We always get good clothes from that store but their new pants just dont get us It wasnt that their bodies didnt fit the clothes the clothes didnt fit their bodies  Ever since said Ms Bates when the friends try on clothes that dont fit their goto remark has become This doesnt get me And taking a cue from the positiveimage primer they leave it at that
