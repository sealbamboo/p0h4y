A catastrophic situation is developing in England with many vulnerable elderly people being denied care campaigners say  An analysis by Age UK found the proportion of overs getting help had fallen by a third since  Last year under  overs got help  one in  people in that group  compared with  seven years ago The review  based on published data  estimated at least  older people were going without vital help This includes councilfunded help in the home with daily tasks such as washing dressing and eating as well as care home places Age UK blamed the squeeze on funding which had forced councils to reduce budgets by  in real terms over the past three years to bn The report  the charitys annual review of the state of social care  said this had resulted in councils increasingly rationing services Just  of local authorities now provide help to people with moderate needs compared with nearly half in  Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said The figures we have uncovered in this report are catastrophic Older people who need help and are now not getting it are being placed at significant risk and families who care for loved ones are experiencing intolerable strain She said this did not make financial sense either as being denied this type of care increased the risk of expensive hospital admissions The government is attempting to ease the pressure on the system by creating a pooled bn budget with the NHS next year to encourage greater coordination and then in  the cap on care costs will be introduced But Ms Abraham said this would have limited benefit because the system was so underfunded A Local Government Association spokeswoman said The shortage of funding is being exacerbated by increasing demand  To substantially raise the standard of care on a nationwide basis more money needs to be put into the system Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said social care was a priority for the government and the reforms would make a difference Both our health and social care services need to work differently to respond to the needs of our ageing population  we need to focus on keeping people well and living independently for as long as possible he added
