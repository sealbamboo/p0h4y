When Diane Shore got a letter that her health policy would be canceled the small premium increase for the new plan didnt bother her that much But the changes in her choices for care really bugged her My physicians will no longer be in this network of physicians or the hospitals she says Shore  owned an IT consulting business in the San Francisco Bay Area and retired when she sold it in  She wants to stick with the health care providers that shes had for years she says including the surgeon who cared for her when she had breast cancer in  I have full confidence in her she says And my primary care doctor has been my primary care doctor for  years In Shores case the problem is that the Blue Shield of California plan being offered limits her choice of doctors and hospitals to Marin County where she lives All my doctors are in San Francisco she says I live  minutes from San Francisco In fact its more convenient for me to go to San Francisco than to the hospital here in Marin County Shores experience doesnt surprise San Franciscobased insurance broker   whos trying to sort out all the new ways insurers are contracting with doctors Some health plans will have fewer doctors and hospitals Blue Shield for example says it will have half the doctors and threequarters of the hospitals next year as it has this year in the individual market Shargel thinks the changes arent clear in the cancellation letters There isnt something that says Alert Be aware Take action now to be sure this works for you or to be sure you know whats happening There needs to be a red alert she says The health plan offered to Shore was a   EPO  exclusive provider organization  plan The company says its offering these lowercost plans for the first time next year to buyers on the individual market Other insurers are offering similar plans Patrick Johnston president of the   notes that the federal Affordable Care Act requires more benefits than most insurance plans have provided up until now That includes free preventive care a limit on annual outofpocket spending and a ban on lifetime caps for medical expenses So to keep health plans affordable for buyers on the individual market one of the few cost variables to work with is doctor contracts In areas where there are a lot of hospitals some more expensive than others and a lot of doctors its only natural that a health plan will sign up some but maybe not all he says So Johnston says if youre buying your own insurance next year and want to keep your doctors you may have to shop around Transitioning might mean looking or having difficulty signing up exactly the same doctors he says Insurers are negotiating hard according to   director of the Center for Health Policy Research at UCLA saying to providers for example Were willing to pay you  a visit If youre not willing to do that we know a doctors group across the street that will accept that Kominski acknowledges that the trend of narrowing provider networks predates the Affordable Care Act but has been speeding up under the law And not just for individual policyholders its been happening for people who get insurance through work as well But hes quick to add that its necessary If we want to keep health care from becoming completely unaffordable for everyone at some point something has to give he says And in this case whats giving is the ability to choose any doctor and any hospital And he says some of the plans may have a wider variety of doctor and hospital choices but they are likely to cost more
