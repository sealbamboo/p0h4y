There are many views about what the NHS should do to cope in the current financial climate In this Scrubbing Up former Labour health minister Lord Norman Warner and Jack OSullivan head of a social policy consultancy who have written a paper for the think tank Reform set out their thoughts  including a  monthly membership fee You might think that all adults with some exemptions paying a  monthly NHS membership fee would have little impact on an organisation with a budget running at  billion a year  But its a change that just might help rescue the NHS from its combined care and cash crisis Think first about the caring side The NHS is in serious trouble   Frail elderly people those with chronic conditions or mental health problems and those developing obesity and lifestyle related illnesses often receive very mediocre care  Too many of them fail to receive help at the right time in communitybased health settings  Eventually they may be treated in hospital  a much more expensive setting  when they are sicker than they should be and when they could have been cared for earlier in less costly environments That could all begin to change by making NHS membership a key element of citizenship creating a new relationship between the state and individuals coproducing personal health   Each year you would have a Health MOT when you and the NHS would agree responsibilities for selfcare and services in the coming year  And the  a month collected with the council tax would go straight into developing impoverished local community health services  A membership scheme might also get people more engaged with how we must transform our NHS  shifting resources into merged health and social care services delivered from revamped community hospitals open  and supported by consolidated GP practices  Under our proposals specialist hospital services would be concentrated in fewer safer better equipped and more expert centres with  consultant cover and improved transport links  We know this move would save lives as has already happened with consolidating emergency stroke care in fewer London hospitals The membership fee is just the beginning of our plans to expand the tax base for health care  We must grasp this nettle because even if the care side is fixed the NHS will still need small aboveinflation rises every year  New streams of dedicated revenue are required to allow the NHS to remain largely taxfunded and free at the point of delivery but not starve other public services of resources  We suggest a host of welldocumented but currently unimplemented efficiency improvements  These include selloffs of underused assets for a  billion service transition fund to renew the NHS We also detail much tougher taxes on tobacco alcohol sugary foods and drinks and gambling to be spent only on health and care  Elderly people the biggest consumers of healthcare could contribute more albeit after they die it cannot be fair that just  of the annual  deaths lead to payment of inheritance tax   Some NHS free entitlements such as continuing care might have to be reduced or meanstested  Hotel charges for hospital stays could be introduced as in other European countries We cannot afford to ignore these issues any longer The NHS care crisis remained largely hidden in times of plenty  Now amid austerity it is exploding into a fullblown cash crisis  The NHS facing a bn deficit by  is becoming economically unsustainable given our tax base the state of the public finances changing population needs and the implications of scientific development  Meanwhile public expectations of services continue to rise  It is a perfect storm  Our study Solving the NHS Care and Cash Crisis is published today as Simon Stevens takes over as the new chief executive of NHS England It makes clear the need for strong political and clinical leadership  Our public figures must be brave backing Stevens and facing uncomfortable truths  helping us the NHS membership to see the true picture of what has to be done to save our NHS
