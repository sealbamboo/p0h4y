The acclaimed chef    winner the owner of   and operator of Atlantabased restaurants   and    lost all that weight and kept it off he says by overhauling his lifestyle  Working in the restaurant industry makes it easy to overindulge he says Imagine working a  to hour day tasting food all day long cooking talking about food being on your feet all day but not getting any actual exercise and just wanting a beer after a mentally draining shift  You get off work its one in the morning you go out talk shop and you end up eating a whole pizza or drinking a whole bottle of wine he says You do that  or  days in a row and I put myself in really bad shape  In a matter of months Blais ballooned to about  pounds  Blais says his Aha moment came when he could no longer recognize himself in the mirror  I dont know that I could see my toes if I looked down he says But there was another factor motivating Blais to shed pounds Her name was    What kickstarted my weight loss was a combination of a really joyous thing and some massive depression I lost a restaurant and I found the love of my life  my wife Blais gives Jazmin a lot of credit for his transformation A competition junkie and a former personal trainer she was and still is supportive and understanding she kept him motivated on his weightloss journey They started running together and today the oncehefty chef has completed several half and full marathons  I had to get this pretty girl I was this chubby guy and I literally had to run after this girl Blais says Shed run two miles Id be sucking wind behind her but I eventually caught up to her and proposed to her at the end of my first race  a K the Peachtree Road Race And were still together For Blais exercise took priority healthier eating and eventually cooking came a little later He stopped eating and drinking so much in a social setting which he says was easy for him Eventually he started using healthy ingredients such as raw oats hemp seeds goji berries and cocoa nibs which he now incorporates into his cooking at home and at his restaurants  Chefs are notorious for disregarding eating healthy Blais says When we hear things like glutenfree we rebel against that  Now he says he understands the value of being aware of and embracing peoples dietary needs   I feel like we have a public service as chefs in restaurants to provide people not only delicious food and a great experience but also nutrition Blais says When you can coax flavor out of healthy ingredients and not have to rely on some of the traditional ways of making food delicious it makes the experience better because you walk out of that restaurant and you feel good about yourself  Blais says the secret to making food healthy and delicious is understanding base flavors and knowing what the dish youre trying to make healthier needs Is it fat Is it salt Is it acidity  If you want to avoid using salt Blais recommends adding spinach or celery which have natural sodium in them If you want the flavor of fat without the calories go for mushrooms he says To make the patty for the Earth  Turf burger at Flip Burger Boutique Blais mixes mushrooms in with the beef for example  Those mushrooms actually give the burger a sense of fat but theres no fat in it  When cooking at home Blais tries to get his two daughters ages  and  involved in the kitchen as much as possible  Kids will eat anything that they make themselves he says Just like if they made a picture for you theyre proud to show that to you When theyre in the kitchen even if its just kind of fakestirring something theyll eat it Thats how you get your kids to eat brussels sprouts  Brussels sprouts spinach and mushroom burgers sound great in theory but Blais says even the most strongwilled of us cant keep that up every day  I dont stay away from eating bad food  just balance As a professional chef Im watching how much Im tasting during the day Portion control for me is a big deal he tells HLN  And of course you cant skip the gym even after youve achieved your weight loss goals   Its so hard to lose weight or to be healthy if youre not combining eating well with moving your body he says I dont think one can exist without the other  Blais says a variety of exercises keeps him healthy today Besides running he has recently started swimming and is considering training for a triathlon  He says the key to sticking with exercise is finding something that doesnt feel like work  When Im cooking I dont feel like I have a job  I just cook because I love to do it When I run I just do it because I love to do it Blais says So youve got to find that fitness activity that you love so much that it doesnt feel like youre going out of your way to do a job  It took Blais almost a decade to get in shape Its got to be low and slow like a good braised osso buco but he finally feels good in his body  Most importantly he now feels in control again  Its OK to have a cheeseburger its OK to eat food but its important to have a healthy relationship with the food you eat
