 The year after a womans final menstrual period  a phase classified as early postmenopause  is a time in which subtle changes in cognition occur researchers found Compared with women in an earlier stage of menopause known as the late menopausal transition phase those in early postmenopause scored worse on tests of verbal learning and verbal memory according to Miriam T Weber PhD of the University of Rochester in New York and colleagues In addition women in early postmenopause fared worse on measures of fine motor skills and attentionworking memory the researchers reported online in  It has been suggested that cognitive and memory changes many women experience in association with menopause may result from associated symptoms such as sleep disturbances and depression as well as from fluctuating estrogen levels Estrogen influences hippocampal function prefrontal cortex function and the cognitive functions subserved by these brain regions including verbal memory and executive function the researchers observed Previous longitudinal and crosssectional studies have yielded conflicting findings about the cognitive changes associated with menopause possibly because of differing staging criteria However revised criteria were recently established by an expert group that more clearly delineates the multiple stages of menopause The new criteria include the late reproductive phase during which minor changes can be seen in the length of the cycle and pattern of blood flow the early menopausal transition characterized by multiple weeklong differences in cycle length the late menopausal transition with month periods of   and early postmenopause the first  months after the final menstrual period To more clearly determine the cognitive effects of menopause across the stages of menopause Weber and colleagues enrolled  women whose mean age was  years A total of  were in the late reproductive phase  were in early transition  had reached late transition and  were in early postmenopause More than  percent were white with small numbers of African Americans Asians and Hispanics They were welleducated with most having about  years of education A battery of cognitive tests measured attention working memory verbal fluency motor skills and dexterity visuospatial skills and overall memory On selfreported questionnaires participants rated their symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as overall health A trend also was seen for women in early postmenopause to have lower scores for attentionworking memory No differences were seen on cognitive scores for women in the early menopausal transition phase compared with those in late reproductive or late menopausal transition phases There were no associations between cognitive scores and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes sleep disruptions or anxiety The researchers further compared cognitive scores according to levels of estradiol and found an association of higher levels only for fine motor skills Higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone also were associated only with improved scores for fine motor skills but this was not significant The primary finding from our study was that women in early postmenopause performed worse than those in the late reproductive and late menopausal transition stages on verbal learning verbal memory and motor tasks and worse than those in late menopausal transition on measures of attentionworking memory the researchers stated They also pointed out that the effects were independent of other factors such as mood symptoms or hormone levels which countered their expectations Taken together these findings suggest that womens concerns about their memory function during the menopausal transition are warranted and that they might experience particular vulnerabilities in the year after the final menstrual period they concluded A larger study is being conducted to more fully elucidate the patterns of change and potential mechanisms Limitations of the study included the small sample size and participants high educational attainment which may limit the generalizability of the findings Source
