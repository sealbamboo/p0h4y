Acne the scourge of many an adolescent life is getting harder to treat but  percent of teenagers have some form of it Conventional treatment includes topical and oral antibiotics Studies are now finding the bacteria that cause acne are increasingly resistant to   Alternatively there are effective laser treatments But these are costly and typically not covered by insurance Now researchers are scrambling to come up with   for acne One promising possibility involves harnessing a harmless virus living on skin that naturally seeks out and kills the bacteria that cause pimples Its every teenagers nightmare big blistery red bumps on their faces Thats what people notice first about you so no matter how great of a person you are no matter how pretty your eyes are how nice your smile is people always notice the blemishes on your face says Rohini Bagrodia a really pretty yearold with beautiful eyes a great smile  and a history of battling acne In school it meant avoiding the spotlight I would always shy away from those opportunities that would bring all the focus on me Bagrodia says She wouldnt take part in class discussions She wouldnt raise her hand And its all because of a tiny bacteria that lives on the skin UCLA dermatologist Dr   says many people dont realize its bacteria that cause acne Some people say your face is dirty you need to clean it more scrub more dont eat chocolate things like that But really its caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate Kim says For most teenagers with mild acne overthecounter products containing peroxide or salicylic acid are enough to clear up the acne But lots of teenagers end up in the doctors office and getting antibiotics This was the hardest thing for Bagrodia No matter how much she followed doctors orders diligently cleaning her face and using antibiotic cream nothing worked Dermatologist Elizabeth Martin is in private practice in Birmingham Ala and is a fellow with the   She says these bacteria like many others are mutating quickly and becoming resistant to antibiotics Over the years we have seen an increase in this antibioticresistant bacterium both in the US and also worldwide Martin says She points to   that show a tripling of drugresistant acne bacteria over the past few decades This means doctors can no longer rely on antibiotics alone Most doctors now use a combination of lowdose antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide which also kills acnecausing bacteria As Martin says benzoyl peroxide works to decrease bacteria through a different mechanism than antibiotics and it helps to prevent development of resistant bacteria When we combine benzoyl peroxide along with an antibiotic patients tend to have better clearance of their acne than when we use antibiotics alone Retinoids vitamin A derivatives can also be used early on to treat acne Typically creams they work by unclogging pores before they become large inflamed bumps A stronger form called Accutane is used for severe acne Its a highly effective pill but it can cause serious side effects including depression and birth defects So the government regulates its use Intensely focused light and lasers can also help fight acne when other treatments fail Kim is also a researcher at UCLA In the room dedicated to light and laser therapy Kim points out what appears to be a halfcylinder with stacks of oblong light bulbs Patients with acne can go right under blue light and they sit there for about   minutes and acne often improves after several treatments Kim says Its not known exactly how light therapy works to fight acne but Kim says studies indicate it destroys the bacteria Probably physically without giving it time to mutate and the other thing  the light treatment can improve the inflammation that the bacteria causes in acne she says But laser and light therapy doesnt work for everyone Its expensive and typically not covered by insurance So Kim and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh are also looking into   taking a harmless virus that lives on the skin and programming it to become a bacteria killer The virus is going to go and kill the bacteria that causes acne Its just going to break it apart and burst its membrane so theres no time for the bacteria to mutate she says Its sort of a surprise attack The approach is a promising way to get rid of acne without using antibiotics If further lab studies prove successful researchers will begin testing on people to see if viral therapy is both safe and effective in fighting acne
