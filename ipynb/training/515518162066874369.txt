Lance Shnider is confident Obamacare regulators knew exactly what they were doing when they created an online calculator that gives a green light to new employer coverage without hospital benefits Theres not a glitch in this system said Shnider president of Voluntary Benefits Agency an Ohio firm working with some  employers to implement such plans This is the way the calculator was designed Timothy Jost is pretty sure the whole thing was a mistake Theres got to be a problem with the calculator said   a law professor at Washington and Lee University and healthbenefits authority Letting employers avoid healthlaw penalties by offering plans without hospital benefits is certainly not what Congress intended he said As companies prepare to offer medical coverage for  debate has grown over government software that critics say can trap workers in inadequate plans while barring them from subsidies to buy fuller coverage on their own At the center of contention is the calculator    to certify whether plans meet the Affordable Care Acts toughest standard for large employers the minimum value test for adequate benefits The software is used by large selfinsured employers that pay their own medical claims but often outsource the plan design and administration Offering a calculatorcertified plan shields employers from penalties of up to  per worker next year Many insurance professionals were surprised to learn from a recent   that the calculator approves plans lacking hospital benefits and that numerous large lowwage employers are considering them Although insurance sold to individuals and small businesses through the health laws marketplaces is required to include   plans from large selfinsured employers are not Many policy analysts however believed it would be impossible for coverage without hospitalization to pass the minimumvalue standard which requires insurance to pay for at least  percent of the expected costs of a typical plan And because calculatorapproved coverage at work bars people from buying subsidized policies in the marketplaces that do offer hospital benefits consumer advocates see such plans as doubly flawed Kaiser Health News asked the Obama administration multiple times to respond to criticism that the calculator is inaccurate but no one would comment Calculatortested plans lacking hospital benefits can cost half the price of similar coverage that includes them While they dont include inpatient care the plans offer rich coverage of doctor visits drugs and even emergencyroom treatment with low outofpocket costs Who will offer such insurance Large wellpaying employers that have traditionally covered hospitalization are likely to keep doing so said industry representatives My members all had highquality plans before the ACA came into existence and they have these plans for a reason which is recruitment and retention said Gretchen Young a senior vice president at the ERISA Industry Committee which represents very large employers such as those in the Fortune  And youre not going to get very far with employees if you dont cover hospitalization But companies that havent offered substantial medical coverage in the past  and that will be penalized next year for the first time if they dont meet healthlaw standards  are very interested benefits advisors say They include retailers hoteliers restaurants and other businesses with high worker turnover and lower pay Temporary staffing agencies are especially keen on calculatortested plans with no hospital coverage Weve got many dozens of staffingfirm clients said Alden Bianchi a benefits lawyer with Mintz Levin in Boston All of them are using these things Advisors and brokers declined to identify employers sponsoring the plans citing client confidentiality Benefits administrators offering the insurance say it makes sense not only for employers trying to comply with the law at low cost but for workers who typically have had little if any jobbased health insurance This is a steppingstone to bring in employers who have never offered coverage and now theyre willing to come forward and do something said Bruce Flunker president of Wisconsinbased EBSO a benefits firm The plans are an upgrade for many workers at retailers staffing agencies and similar companies he said OK if I go to the hospital I dont have coverage he said But I dont have hospital coverage now And what I get is a doctor I can go to a specialist I get a script filled at the pharmacy I get reallife coverage Companies considering such plans include a restaurant chain with  workers a trucking firm with  employees and dependents a delicatessen a fur farm and firms working the oil boom in upper Midwest Flunker said Employer interest in the plans is definitely picking up pretty quickly said Kevin Schlotman director of benefits at Benovation an Ohio firm that designs and administers health coverage These are organizations that are facing a significant increase in expenses Theyre trying to do their best Because hospital admissions are rare plans paying for routine care are more valuable to lowwage workers than coverage of expensive surgery and other inpatient costs say consultants offering them Such plans come with deductibles as low as zero for doctor visits and prescriptions and copays of only a few dollars they say Emergencyroom visits cost members in the  or  range depending on the plan By contrast healthlawapproved insurance with inpatient benefits often includes deductibles  what members pay for all kinds of care before the insurance kicks in  of  or more Generous coverage of routine care is what these people want said Shnider They want to be able to go to the doctor Take care of their kids go to the emergency room In some cases employers sponsoring calculatorapproved plans without hospital coverage also offer fixed indemnity coverage that does pay some hospital reimbursement advisors say But the benefits are typically a small fraction of hospital costs leaving members with the likelihood of large bills if they are admitted Concerned for their reputations larger administrators are wary of managing benefits without hospitalization even if they do pass the calculator Our selffunded customers hand out insurance cards to their employees with Blue Cross all over it said Michael Bertaut health care economist at BlueCross BlueShield of Louisiana which has no plans to handle such coverage Do we really want someone to present that card at a hospital and get turned away There are two healthlaw coverage standards that large employers must meet to avoid paying a penalty One for minimum essential coverage merely requires some kind of employer medical plan no matter how thin with a potential penalty next year of up to  per worker Many lowwage employers are meeting that target with skinny plans that cover preventive care and not much else say brokers and consultants The calculator tests the health laws second more exacting standard  to offer a minimum value plan at affordable cost to workers Failure to do so triggers the second penalty of up to  per worker The argument over the calculator is whether plans carving out such a large chunk of benefits  hospitalization  can mathematically cover  percent of expected costs of a standard plan They probably cant Washington and Lee professor Jost said The fact that the calculator gives similar passing scores to plans with hospital benefits and plans costing half as much without hospital benefits suggests that its flawed he said Plans with similar scores should have similar costs he said On the other hand others ask why did the administration make a calculator that allows designers to leave out inpatient coverage Why didnt the law and regulations require hospital coverage for selfinsured employers  as they do for commercial plans sold through online marketplaces The law and calculator were purposely designed as they are Fred Hunt past president of the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators said in an email widely circulated among insurance pros No glitch or unintended loophole Thats baloney said Robert Laszewski a consultant to large insurers and a critic of the health law Nobody said were going to have health plans out there that dont cover hospitalization That was never the intention  I think they just screwed up
