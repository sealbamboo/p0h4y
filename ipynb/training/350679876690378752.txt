A big worry among people trying to wipe out polio is that the virus will regain a foothold somewhere to launch a comeback  someplace perhaps like Somalia Polio has paralyzed  kids in Somalia and another six in a Kenyan refugee camp since early May the Global Polio Eradication Initiative   Wednesday Before this outbreak Somalia hadnt had a polio case in more than five years There were only  polio cases around the world in  the lowest ever recorded Even in the remaining three endemic countries  Afghanistan Pakistan and Nigeria  polio was only showing up isolated in a few remote areas This outbreak in Somalia could threaten that progress The recent cases are probably just the tip of the iceberg says   from the World Health Organization The last time we saw an outbreak in this part of the world it involved Yemen most of the countries in the Horn of Africa Sudan and led to about  cases Bari says Somalia is a tough place to fight polio It has very low rates of immunization for most diseases including polio Vaccination teams cant even enter parts of Somalia because of violence Just last week Islamic extremists   a suicide attack on the United Nations headquarters in Mogadishu After a minute gun battle  people at the compound died Despite the security problems in Somalia emergency responses to the polio cases are underway Local health officials in Somalia have launched three massive vaccination drives Bari says and Kenya has already carried out two special immunization campaigns in the refugee camp When outbreaks like these occur she says the goal is to break the polioviruss transmission cycle by trying to get more than  percent of the local population vaccinated The virus is looking for children in which it can circulate Bari says The virus cant live out in the sewage or in the environment on its own So it needs human beings And it looks for people who are not immune who are going to allow it to continue transmitting This outbreak is still in its early stages she says And WHO expects to see more polio cases reported from Somalia in the coming weeks But Bari says polio workers are hopeful that the emergency vaccination campaigns are reaching enough children to slow the spread of the virus There have been  polio cases reported worldwide so far this year compared with  to this point in  But almost half of this years cases have occurred in Somalia and Kenya
