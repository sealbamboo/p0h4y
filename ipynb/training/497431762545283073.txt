Lots of highperformance athletes use interval training to maximize their fitness From runners to cyclists to bootcamp fanatics the strategy involves alternating between periods of highintensity and lowerintensity aerobic training Now a study published in the journal   finds that   may help the millions of people with Type  diabetes and prediabetes who are trying to control their blood sugar And the type of exercise involved Taking an hourlong walk each day outdoors or on a treadmill As part of the study researchers enrolled about  volunteers with Type  diabetes who were in their late s and early s The volunteers were divided into groups One group was instructed to walk three minutes briskly followed by three minutes at a more restful pace and repeat that process for an hour Another group walked at a continuous pace for the same amount of time A third group a control group kept up normal routines which didnt include daily exercise What we expected to see  was that both exercising groups would have an improvement in their glucose or blood sugar control says study author   an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen who studies how exercise affects glycemic control But thats not what happened The interval walkers did improve Their glucose disposal  the ability to move sugar out of the circulating bloodstream and into parts of the body where it can be used as fuel  improved by  percent compared with the nonexercising group And their hemoglobin   a longerterm measure of blood sugar dipped slightly too But the steadypaced walkers saw no improvement at all This was somewhat surprising considering that they were doing one hour of exercising a day for four months says Solomon So what explains the benefits of interval walking Its not exactly clear but theres a leading theory Its this switch between the intensities that we think is critical here says Solomon Youre able to work hard and then rest hard  rather than just walking at a fixed pace And during the highintensity bursts your muscles need more fuel in the form of glucose It makes sense that intervals would help people with blood sugar control says   a professor of preventive medicine at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La He explains that our muscles are the No consumer of blood sugar in our bodies So when we do things such as short bursts of highimpact aerobic activity youre pulling excess sugar out of the blood which results in healthier blood sugar levels Church says This study is small but the findings match other research on intervals which find benefits that seem to go beyond better blood sugar In a study   in   in  which also compared interval walkers with continuouspaced walkers Solomon and his colleagues found that the interval walkers lost more weight and lowered their cholesterol levels There are a number of studies that have shown that when you increase the intensity of aerobic exercise in the form of doing intervals theres additional benefits beyond just the calories burned Solomon says There are still unanswered questions he adds such as can interval walking cut the risk of strokes or other health problems that are associated with diabetes We really need to understand how this has an impact on the longterm health of these patients with diabetes Solomon says
