Whats more fun getting hold of some of the coolest new athletic technology or giving it as a gift You could end up buying two of each of these noteworthy innovations  A ounce D Bluetooth motion sensor that attaches to any golf club and instantly shows you a video animation and metric analysis of your actual golf swing so you can identify problem areas and make adjustments Images are stored for later viewing  It works showing you what your swing looks like and providing valuable analysis including your swing speed whether the swing was insideout or outsidein or whether the club face was open or closed It can be used with or without a ball and on or off the course Pro tips are provided too Setup is simple download the app set up a profile and password at swingtipcom then instantly clamp the inchlong sensor and around a club shaft  or higher Apple iOS or  Android or higher is required  Although our tester loved the concept he felt that the recording function was too limited Instead of labeling each swing with the specific club used ie a  iron versus a  iron you are given a choice of the categories wood iron or driver The problem You swing each club differently So when you get back home replay your swings and see  pm iron it doesnt help you much if you cant remember what club you were using     Sunglasses that have a stealthy hidden megapixel video and still camera built into the bridge  A great idea ingeniously executed A very stylish natural unobtrusive place for a camera You dont have to stop to fish out equipment The control buttons are simple and effective  one for video and one for stills each a simple onoff The p HD MP format video is fine quality with decent stills despite a soft focus It records at  frames per second A miniUSB port connects to your computer for charging  This camera really needs a fisheye lens for a wider field of vision its standard  degrees is not enough I found that I was looking down at the ground too much while mountain biking and trail running and even after I learned to keep my head up there still wasnt enough sky in the frame The  GB capacity is quite small you run out of storage very quickly Another design flaw is that the blue onoff light and flashing red video light which are located on the left arm were not visible to my eye I had to pull the sunglasses forward to see them  a hassle Of course you cant view the video until you load it on your computer      Skintight moisturewicking antiodor nylonLycra athletic shirt that uses reinforced shoulder and back fabric panels to improve posture by pulling your shoulders back and allowing you to achieve a more natural vertical nonkyphotic posture  Simple and effective The reinforced panels exert some rearward pull on shoulders The styling looks good enough to wear in the gym and comfortable enough to wear as a base layer Note The shoulder pull seems to be much less pronounced than that of a competing product AlignMed which was favorably reviewed in this column two years ago it lets you use Velcro straps to yank your shoulders rearward  Theres no real science backing the companys assertions that the product reduces athletic injuries and stimulates muscles but it does feel good   tank  Tshirt  long sleeve     The firstever device that calculates your cycling power output from your heart rate and a secret algorithm all at a fraction of the cost of a standard power meter which measures the force you put on the pedals and can run  to  Includes a chest strap which you pair with your own compatible bike computer  Although not able to provide momentbymoment accuracy as with a true power meter PowerCal provides a good approximation of your power output over an entire workout The algorithm uses your heartrate variation and actual heart rate to come up with a power value It is ANT compatible simple to set up easy to use and displays real data in real time I love that you can use it on your road bike mountain bike or on a spin bike at the gym allowing relative comparisons  Cannot accurately measure short hard efforts such as surges or intervals like a true power meter
