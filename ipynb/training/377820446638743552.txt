Evonne Derrico gave birth to two boys and three girls Friday at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa, Ariz. . The babies' names all start with the letter "D" in keeping with family tradition. Babies Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician and Daiten all weigh less than 3 pounds and are in the neonatal intensive care unit. . Evonne Derrico and her husband, Deon, already have a 7-year-old daughter, a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old twin boys.

Hospital officials say the 33-year-old mother carried the babies to 32 weeks gestation. The average for quints is 28 weeks.
