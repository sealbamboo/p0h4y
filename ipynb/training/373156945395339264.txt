Theres no question that dealing with mortgages car payments and other bills takes up time and energy But having a tight budget may also zap our ability to think clearly scientists   Thursday in the journal   In a series of clever experiments involving farmers in India and shoppers in New Jersey scientists found that people are worse at solving puzzles  similar to those on the IQ test  when theyre first reminded of money problems Financial constraints capture a lot of your attention says   a psychologist at Princeton University who helped lead the study Then theres less bandwidth left to solve problems Your cognitive ability starts to slow down just like a computer And the effect is   After a quick reminder about money issues peoples performance on the puzzles drops down by at least a quarter  or approximately the same mental hit a person takes after staying up all night In the study Shafir and his colleagues approached people at a shopping mall in Lawrenceville NJ and asked them how much money they earn We had a pretty good selection of middletolow income Americans Shafir tells Shots The lowest salaries were about  and the average was about  Before the participants started the puzzles they answered a question about money A persons car breaks down and they need X dollars to fix it Tell me what are the options they have available People with lower incomes did just as well on the tests as those with higher salaries when the amount of money required to fix the car was low like  But when the scientists raised the amount to  the less affluent participants performed worse on the puzzles The money question tickles that part of the brain that has to do with your own finances says   an economist at Harvard University who also led the study Then you start thinking Gee how I am going to pay rent this month  And that interferes with your ability to think through a problem he says The team found a similar trend with farmers in southern India who get paid only once per year Right before the sugarcane harvest the farmers are financially strained Immediately afterward theyre flush again It turns out that just before harvest the farmers performed worse on the IQ puzzles than they did after receiving their money If you just look on paper at their income these people in New Jersey and India arent in poverty Mullainathan says But theyre financially stretched The mechanism that were looking at is more about being financially stretched than in poverty About half of Americans fall into this category Mullainathan says People are worried each month about getting all the bills paid Just realizing the effect exists could help people to counter it he says If youre making a decision that actually requires you to sit down and think you should probably wait until your mind isnt taxed by financial problems he says Mullainathan and Safir say the studys findings could have broader implications Theres an ongoing heavy debate about why its difficult for the poor to get out of poverty Safir says Were giving a new perspective to that question In many instances its not that the poor arent as smart or capable of planning compared as richer people he says Rather being poor takes up more mental capacity When the poor focus on something they manage their dollar better than the rich do  Shafir says But while theyre doing that very well they have less attention to focus on other things
