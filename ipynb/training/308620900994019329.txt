In the quest for better cancer medicines vaccines that treat rather than prevent disease are getting lots of attention More than  clinical trials have tested therapeutic vaccines in cancer patients but the results have been   A recent study in mice suggests that changing a traditional ingredient in the vaccines could make a big difference A typical therapeutic vaccine against cancer contains a cancerspecific peptide or protein fragment that is injected under a patients skin The peptide serves as a red flag for the immune system If all goes well the patients immune system recognizes the peptide as something to be attacked and boosts the population of cancerfighting Tcells in the bloodstream For such vaccines to work against the cancers though these cells have to find their way to tumors This migration might not be happening as expected in traditional human cancer vaccines says   an author of   in the latest   and an assistant professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Cancer vaccines typically include a substance called IFA short for incomplete Freunds adjuvant Adjuvants are chemicals added to vaccines to stimulate an immune response IFA is a mineral oil that is not biodegradable by the body says Overwijk This was thought to be helpful in cancer vaccines because the longer the vaccine sticks around in the body the greater the immune response and the more Tcells that can be produced Overwijk says But when mice were injected with an IFA vaccine against   the study reports that most of the Tcells in the bloodstream went to the site of the vaccine injection  not the tumor The body doesnt know how to deal with the mineral oil in IFA and the body cannot get rid of that big blob of vaccine  that sits under the skin The Tcells go back and try to kill the oil but they cant he says When the oily IFA was replaced with water or saline  substances easily processed by mice and men  the Tcells migrated to the tumors and began to destroy them If these results hold up in humans they could lead to a shift in the approach to making therapeutic cancer vaccines because most clinical trials now are testing vaccines that use peptides and IFA This finding applies to all of those  its not limited to a certain cancer type Overwijk says The results of this study confirm the findings of others in the field and could be an important addition to cancer vaccine research says   a tumor immunologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa Florida who wasnt associated with the study Though one word of caution is that obviously the skin and the subcutaneous tissue of a mouse is a lot different than in a human so its a little hard to extrapolate But within the reasonable limits I have some confidence Weber told Shots Overwijk and collaborators at the University of Virginia expect to start a human clinical trial using saline or waterbased cancer vaccines sometime this year But he says these nonIFA vaccines have problems too While it is better than the IFA we think water may actually be a little too ephemeral Too short and you dont get the activation of the immune system Overwijk says Another barrier is the difficulty in tracking human Tcells via biopsy  a process that wasnt necessary in mice where the cells could be fluorescently labeled Though there are plenty of unresolved issue in cancer vaccine research Overwijk says that these results could be important for improving future clinical trials Its an eyeopener he says a kind of Aha moment after years of using these same vaccines
