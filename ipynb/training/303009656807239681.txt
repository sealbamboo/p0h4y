 Its possible that a serious mosquitoborne virus  with no known vaccine or treatment  could migrate from Central Africa and Southeast Asia to the United States within a year new research suggests The chances of a US outbreak of the   CHIKV varies by season and geography with those regions typified by longer stretches of warm weather facing longer periods of high risk according to the researchers new computer model The only way for this disease to be transmitted is if a   and a few days after that it bites a healthy individual transmitting the virus said study lead author Diego RuizMoreno a postdoctoral associate in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University in Ithaca NY The repetition of this sequence of events can lead to a disease outbreak And that RuizMoreno said is where weather comes into the picture with computer simulations revealing that the risk of an outbreak rises when temperatures and therefore mosquito populations rise The study analyzed possible outbreak scenarios in three US locales In  the New York region is set to face its highest risk for a CHIKV outbreak during the warm months of August and September the analysis suggests By contrast Atlantas highestrisk period was identified as longer beginning in June and running through September Miamis consistent warm weather means the region faces a higher risk all year Warmer weather increases the length of the period of high risk RuizMoreno said This is particularly worrisome if we think of the effects of climate change over average temperatures in the near future RuizMoreno discussed his teams research  funded in part by the US National Institute for Food and Agriculture  in a recent issue of the journal   CHIKV was first identified in Tanzania in  the authors noted and the severe joint and muscle pain fever fatigue headaches rashes and nausea that can result are sometimes confused with symptoms of   Few patients die of the illness and about onequarter show no symptoms whatsoever Many patients however experience prolonged joint pain and there is no effective   leaving physicians to focus on   relief Disease spread is of paramount concern in the week following infection during which the patient serves as a viral host for biting mosquitoes Infected mosquitoes can then transmit the virus and cause a fullblown outbreak The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became aware of the growing threat of a global outbreak in  and  following the onset of epidemics in India Southeast Asia Reunion Island and other islands in the Indian Ocean In  public health concerns mounted following an outbreak in Italy To assess the risk of a US epidemic the authors collected data concerning regional mosquito population patterns daily regional weather and human population statistics They ran the information through a computer simulation designed to conservatively crunch the numbers based on the likelihood that an outbreak would occur in the coming year after just one CHIKVinfected individual entered any of the three test regions The results suggested that because environmental factors affect mosquito growth cycles the regional risk for a CHIKV outbreak is to a large degree a function of weather The authors said that public health organizations need to be vigilant while advocating for regionspecific planning to address varying levels of risk across the country However Dr Erin Staples a CDC medical epidemiologist based in Fort Collins Colo said that although the study was carefully and nicely done the investigations focus on the role of temperature in CHIKV outbreak risk should not negate the importance of other key factors such as human behavior Were aware of the potential introduction and spread of this virus as well as several other mosquitoborne diseases she said Weve been working to create and prepare a response to the risk that this virus could expand into the US Similar to the messages we give for   we believe that prevention is the most important thing to focus on Staples said That means wearing long sleeves and pants using air conditioning or making sure your screens are intact avoiding standing water and using mosquito repellant Because if CHIKV were to be introduced into the US the best way to prevent a spread is to   in the first place
