At  they were viewed by classmates with envy admiration and not a little awe The girls wore makeup had boyfriends and went to parties held by older students The boys boasted about sneaking beers on a Saturday night and swiping condoms from the local convenience store They were cool They were goodlooking They were so not you Whatever happened to them The fasttrack kids didnt turn out OK said   a psychology professor at the University of Virginia He is the lead author of a new   that followed these risktaking socially precocious cool kids for a decade In high school their social status often plummeted the study showed and they began struggling in many ways It was their early rush into what Dr Allen calls pseudomature behavior that set them up for trouble Now in their early s many of them have had difficulties with intimate relationships alcohol and marijuana and even criminal activity They are doing more extreme things to try to act cool bragging about drinking three sixpacks on a Saturday night and their peers are thinking These kids are not socially competentÂ  Dr Allen said Theyre still living in their middleschool world As fastmoving middleschoolers they were driven by a heightened longing to impress friends Indeed their brazen behavior did earn them a blaze of popularity But by high school their peers had begun to mature readying themselves to experiment with romance and even mild delinquency The cool kids popularity faded  a professor of educational psychology at the University of WisconsinMadison who writes about adolescent peer relationships and was not involved in the study said it offered a trove of data The finding that most surprised him he said was that pseudomature behavior was an even stronger predictor of problems with alcohol and drugs than levels of drug use in early adolescence Research on teenagers usually tracks them only through adolescence Dr Brown added But this study following a diverse group of  subjects in Charlottesville Va starting at age  continued into adulthood at  Researchers took pains to document the rise and fall in social status periodically interviewing the subjects as well as those who they felt knew them best usually close friends About  percent of the group fell into the cool kid category at the studys outset A constellation of three popularityseeking behaviors characterized pseudomaturity Dr Allen and his colleagues found These young teenagers sought out friends who were physically attractive their romances were more numerous emotionally intense and sexually exploring than those of their peers and they dabbled in minor delinquency  skipping school sneaking into movies vandalism As they turned  the study found that when compared to their socially slowermoving middleschool peers they had a  percent greater rate of problems resulting from alcohol and marijuana use and a  percent higher level of actual use of those substances They also had a  percent greater rate of adult criminal behavior from theft to assaults Many attributed failed adult romantic relationships to social status they believed that their lack of cachet was the reason their partners had broken up with them Those early attempts to act older than they were seemed to have left them socially stunted When their peers were asked how well these young adults got along with others the former cool kids ratings were  percent lower than the average young adult The researchers grappled with why this cluster of behaviors set young teenagers on a downward spiral Dr Allen suggested that while they were chasing popularity they were missing a critical developmental period At the same time other young teenagers were learning about soldering samegender friendships while engaged in dramafree activities like watching a movie at home together on a Friday night eating ice cream Parents should support that behavior and not fret that their young teenagers arent popular he said To be truly mature as an early adolescent means youre able to be a good loyal friend supportive hardworking and responsible Dr Allen said But that doesnt get a lot of airplay on Monday morning in a ninthgrade homeroom Dr Brown offered another perspective about why the cool kids lost their way The teenagers who lead the social parade in middle school  determining everyone elses choices in clothes social media and even notebook colors  have a heavy burden for which they are not emotionally equipped So they gravitate towards older kids he said And those older teenagers themselves possibly former cool kids were dubious role models he said In adolescence who is open to hanging out with someone three or four years younger The more deviant kids Dr Allen offered one typical biography from the study At  the boy was popular He had numerous relationships kissed more than six girls flung himself into minor forms of trouble and surrounded himself with goodlooking friends By  he was a highschool dropout had many problems associated with drinking including work absenteeism and arrests for drunken driving He is unemployed and still prone to minor thefts and vandalism But as Dr Allen emphasized pseudomaturity suggests a predilection it is not a firm predictor A teenage girl from the study initially had a similar profile with many boyfriends at an early age attractive friends and a fondness for shoplifting Yet by  Dr Allen wrote in an email shed earned her bachelors degree had not had any more trouble with criminal behavior used alcohol only in responsible ways and was in a good job  a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies adolescent social development said that while teenagers all long to be accepted by their peers   suggest that parents can reinforce qualities that will help them withstand the pressure to be too cool too fast Adolescents also appreciate individuality and confidence he said Adolescents who can stick to their own values can still be considered cool even without doing what the others are doing
