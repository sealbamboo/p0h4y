In  Phillip Kunz and his family got a record number of Christmas cards In the weeks before Christmas they came daily sometimes by the dozen Kunz still has them in his home collected in an old photo album Dear Phil Joyce and family a typical card reads we received your holiday greeting with much joy and enthusiasm  Merry Christmas and Happy New Years Love Lou Bev and the children The cards from that year came in all shapes and sizes but the basic message was the same The writers wanted Kunz to know that he and his family were cared for and also they wanted to share their own news They included pictures of family members and new homes and smiling graduates with freshly minted diplomas It all seems pretty normal except for one thing Kunz didnt know any of them Kunz was a sociologist at Brigham Young University Earlier that year hed decided to do an   to see what would happen if he sent Christmas cards to total strangers And so he went out and collected directories for some nearby towns and picked out around  names I started out at a random number and then skipped so many and got to the next one he says To these  strangers Kunz sent his Christmas greetings handwritten notes or a card with a photo of him and his family And then Kunz waited to see what would happen It was just you know a shot in the dark he says I didnt know what would happen But about five days later responses started filtering back  slowly at first and then more until eventually they were coming   at a time Eventually Kunz got more than  replies I was really surprised by how many responses there were he says And I was surprised by the number of letters that were written some of them three four pages long Why would someone send a threepage letter to a complete and total stranger Why did so many people write him back at all  is an emeritus psychologist at Arizona State University who studies how our behavior is affected by social rules that were only vaguely aware of but which have incredible power over what we do What happened to Kunz he explains is the direct result of one of the rules that most interest him the rule of reciprocation The rule he says is drilled into us as children We are obligated to give back to others the form of behavior that they have first given to us he says Essentially thou shall not take without giving in return And so if someone passes you in the hall and says hello you feel compelled to return their greeting When you dont you notice it it makes you uncomfortable out of balance Thats the rule of reciprocation Theres not a single human culture that fails to train its members in this rule Cialdini says This is probably because there are some obvious benefits to the rule of reciprocation its one of those rules that likely made it easier for us to survive as a species But whats interesting about all this is how psychologists like Cialdini can actually measure the way the rule affects how we behave in all sorts of situations Exhibit A those little preprinted address labels that come to us in the mail this time of year along with letters asking for donations Those labels seem innocent enough but they often trigger a small but very real dilemma I cant send it back to them because its got my name on it Cialdini says But as soon as Ive decided to keep that packet of labels Im in the jaws of the rule The packet of labels costs roughly  cents Cialdini says but it dramatically increases the number of people who give to the charities that send them The hit rate goes from  to  percent he says In other words the number of people who donate almost doubles You can see the same thing when it comes to tipping If a server brings you a check and does not include a candy on the check tray you will tip the server whatever it is that you feel the server deserves But if theres a mint on the tray tips go up  percent Cialdini says According to Cialdini the researchers who did that study also discovered that if while delivering the tray with the mint the server paused looked the customers in the eye and then gave them a second mint while telling them the candy was specifically for them tips went through the roof Servers who gave a second mint got a  percent increase over their normal tip Many decades ago Cialdini noticed a similar phenomenon when he studied   in the US He says that in the late s the religion was really struggling financially it seemed strange to many Americans so it was hard for them to raise money But then they hit on a solution In airports and other public places they would simply give the people passing by what they described as a gift a flower a book a magazine Then after the person had the gift in his or her hand they would ask for a small donation Cialdini says he spent days in different airports observing these transactions watching as recipients struggled to come up with the right solution You would see many of them with frowns on their faces reach into a pocket or a purse come up with a dollar or two and then walk away angry at what had just occurred recalls Cialdini But they would give he believes because of the rule of reciprocation For years he says the Hare Krishna religion raised millions of dollars this way There are really dozens of ways that the rule of reciprocation affects us some of them good some of them bad For example politicians like the rest of us are subject to the rule of reciprocation And so when organizations or interest groups give them money though they might believe that money wont influence their decisions its sometimes hard for them as it is for us to be immune Cialdini believes you can also see the rule operate in the medical profession You find doctors more willing to prescribe medication based on what gifts favors and tips they have been given by one pharmaceutical company or another he says This doesnt mean that the rule of reciprocation affects all of us all of the time Cialdini says different situations trigger different people differently But it is powerful One of those invisible powerful things that can subtly shape how we behave even years after someone has given us something Consider the case of Phillip Kunz the sociologist who decided to send Christmas cards to random strangers For years his family got cards from the people he contacted in  We got cards for maybe  years he says
