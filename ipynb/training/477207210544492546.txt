A yearold paraplegic literally kicked off soccers World Cup competition in Brazil on Thursday using a mindcontrolled exoskeleton that looks as if it came from the Iron Man movies The organizers of the international   said the symbolic soccerball kick was performed during the World Cups opening ceremonies in So Paulos Corinthians Arena by Juliano Pinto Hes an athlete from Galea in Brazils So Paulo State who lost the use of his legs after a car accident in  Seven other paralyzed patients who volunteered to go through months of training for the task watched from the sidelines We did it the projects leader Duke University neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis   Nicolelis spearheaded a team of more than  scientists to create the exoskeleton  an effort that he says cost the Brazilian government  million over the past two years Was Pintos few seconds of fame worth the cost Probably not if were just talking about a kickoff that took a couple of seconds to complete But the projects researchers said the advances made in the course of the yearslong effort  and the exposure given to the next generation of braincontrolled prosthetics  could be priceless The World Cup demonstration is ceremonial as we have only a moment to show a kick Sanjay Joshi a roboticist from the University of California at Davis who was involved in the Walk Again Project told NBC News via email from Brazil But maybe that kick will inspire a child somewhere in the world to become a doctor engineer or scientist Joshi said the projects longterm aim is to bring together neuroscience engineering and medicine to build braincontrolled devices that can change the lives of paralyzed patients Nicolelis struck a similar tone in a   It is only the beginning of a future in which people with paralysis will be able to leave the wheelchair and literally walk again The system blends the hardware of a batterypowered Iron Man exoskeleton with a control system thats guided by brain waves Pinto wore an electroencephalogram EEG cap dotted with electrodes which picked up and magnified the faint electrical signals emanating through his skull Sensors were built into the suit to detect muscle movements At first Nicolelis considered using brain implants to control the suit but he and his colleagues quickly determined that the EEG cap was less intrusive and more manageable During the training period Pinto and the seven other subjects learned to think about moving their feet in such a way that the corresponding signals from their brains and muscles would register with the computerized guidance system The exosuits wearer received feedback from the feet in the form of buzzing vibrations felt on the skin All eight patients learned to walk using the suit and one overachiever took a total of  steps to the awe of everyone present   At the World Cup ceremonies all it took was a tap from Pintos roboleg to send the soccer ball rolling Meanwhile assistants stood on either side helping to steady the bulky suit The moment passed so quickly that many TV viewers missed it In the wake of the World Cup kickoff experts who werent involved in the Walk Again Project debated whether the effort scored a winning goal The demo did not advance the state of the art Jose ContrerasVidal a biomedical engineer at the   told NBC News in an email Certainly our   was the first and remains the only braincontrolled exoskeleton to allow spinal cord injury patients to walk overground unassisted and we have been able to do so with about  percent of the funding Dr Nicolelis has received to develop their exo ContrerasVidal said one of the metrics for evaluating the return on investment should be the number of Brazilian scientists and students who benefit from their involvement in the Walk Again Project I suppose the infrastructure will remain in Brazil which is good ContrerasVidal wrote What matters now is what the plans are for the future Clinical longitudinal trials must be done with patients once the system is completed and validated Dr Nicolelis is not known for working with EEG and walking robotics and thus expertise in these areas would need to be developed and retained in Brazil to continue the project We hope he succeeds Anil Raj a research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition agreed that the projects real value depends on what comes after the kick A successful kick is a demonstration event but the technological development needed to be able to attempt the demo is the contribution to the future of exoskeletons for those with spinal cord injury Raj said in an email  million for training eight patients and building a novel exoskeleton and braincontrolled interface seems to me to be a reasonable expenditure
