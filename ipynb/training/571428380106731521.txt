When we talk about the steps you need to take to get healthier they often involve buying new things workout clothes fitness equipment ingredients for healthy recipes and the list goes on But becoming the healthiest version of yourself also means throwing away the stuff thats holding you backand we dont only mean junk food Get your recycling or garbage can ready Go through your collection of foodstorage containers and toss anything made of clear rigid plastic and stamped with a  or pc stands for polycarbonate These are the types of containers that may   says Sonya Lunder MPH a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group who also advises tossing warped or cracked containers While manufacturers have take BPA out of many of the newer polycarbonate containers old ones still probably have it And multiple trips through the dishwasher can up leeching of theÂ chemical Lunder also cautions against heating any type of plastic in the microwave because of chemicalleeching concerns Glass is safer in general she says Though some companies have recently announced theyre phasing out phthalates which are used to help fragrance linger longer many   solids sprays and plugins still contain this type of chemical which in large doses may have harmful effects on reproduction or development These products are simply chemical perfumes that you put in the air says Lunder who argues that its much healthier to take care of the root cause of a smell than mask it with chemicals Antibacterial soap is no more effective at   than the regular stuffand they may not be safe according to a  FDA report Triclosan the active ingredient in antibacterial cleansers has been shown to alter hormone regulation in animals and theres also concern that the chemical may contribute to antibiotic resistance If you havent already you may want to reconsider your  especially if youre trying to lose weight A muchbuzzedabout study published in the journal   found that noncaloric sweetenerssuch as saccharin SweetnLow sucralose Splenda and aspartame Equal may   that play a key role in healthy metabolism Researchers found a link between these sweeteners altered gut microbes glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome both precursors to Type  diabetes in mice and humans Most   should be replaced every  to  miles says Jason Karp MD exercise physiologist and author of   For a runner who logs  miles a week thats about every three months When shoes wear down they lose their cushioning and are less capable of absorbing the impact of your foot landing with each step so more force is transmitted to muscles bones and tendons putting you at risk for injuries he explains If youre not a runner replace them about every six months or as soon as you notice that the tread is looking worn out If youre brushing in the morning and the evening like youre supposed to then your toothbrush bristles are probably becoming frayed and worn faster than you realize In my experience bristles start to fray after about two months of use so I recommend my patients replace their brushes every three months says American Dental Association spokesperson Ruchi Sahota who is a practicing dentist in California Wornout brushes are less effective at   and fighting off decay In the end we are what we think about and what we think about is heavily influenced by what we keep around us says motivational speaker and life coach Gail Blanke author of   She calls the things that neither serve a specific purpose nor exist to make you feel good life plaque The more life plaque we   the less we can focus on what we really care about she explains Not sure where to start Toss things that annoy you every time you see them like socks that have lost their match or your overflowing kitchen   No matter what you decide to throw out or donate your goal is to whittle the physical objects down to only items that help you feel energized and accomplish your goals Take a peek in your closet How many items have you not worn within the last year Many people whove lost weight keep the bigger sizes around in case they regain it while others hold onto the size  jeans they wore in high school thinking maybe if they diet theyll fit again In either case seeing these items every day can bring on anxiety Thats not how anyone wants to feel when getting ready When it comes to highly perishable food that contains animal ingredients the rule of thumb is to   or freeze after three days says Michael P Doyle PhD director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia Listeria is linked to scary things like meningitis miscarriages and even death he says It can grow to millions at refrigerator temperatures in under a week Liquid makeup including mascara can harbor a lot of germs says Thomas Steinemann MD an American Academy of Ophthalmology spokesperson who practices in Ohio Thats why he recommends   two to three months after opening Each time you use mascara you are brushing it and any germs onto your lashes he says Youre also contaminating the brush with even more bacteria present on your skin or eyelashes then plunging it into a moist roomtemperature environment which encourages bacterial growth One of the primary functions of eyelashes is to keep debris and germs from entering your eye so its important to keep the makeup you put on them as germfree as possible he adds Using a dirty lens case is one of the primary risk factors for getting   says Dr Steinemann who recommends replacing you lens case at least every three months as well as cleaning airdrying facedown and using fresh solution daily Even if you care for your lens case fastidiously a grimy biofilm builds up on the surface thats a magnet for dirt and germs he explains If you dont change it out for a new one youre putting yourself at risk for a potentially serious eye infection like a corneal ulcer that can become infected andeven when healedresult in a scar that could affect your vision he adds Dont mess with your eyes people Spices that have been hanging out in your cabinets for years probably wont make you sickbut they wont   to your food which is key when youre trying to cook healthy meals that dont go overboard on fat or calories Fresh spices can mean the difference between bland meals that makes you consider giving up on your goals and ordering delivery and amazingly flavorful food thats good for you and satisfying When it comes to sunscreen the expiration date really does matter says Beth Lange PhD chief scientist at the Personal Care Products Council The chemicals that block the sun break down over time so no matter how much you slather on its not going to   from aging or cancer risk Anything thats used around your mouth collects a lot of bacteria quickly and the longer the bacteria sits in a moist tube the more it grows This increases your chance of infection if it gets into a cut or crack on the delicate skin of your lips For this reason experts recommend that you throw out lip gloss or other lip makeup no more than six months after you open it and begin using it or by the expiration date whichever is sooner If you have an air purifier at home you get a gold star HEPA filtered air cleaning devicesthe most efficient kindare important because according to the EPA indoor air quality is  to  times worse than outdoors says Philip Tierno PhD a microbiologist with New York University In fact the average  square foot house can accumulate  pounds of dust  dust mites per ounce One in five Americans   or asthma which can be exacerbated by dust mold and bacteria in the air so a good filter system goes a long way he adds Just dont forget to replace the filter every so often or you could actually be growing mold and bacteria and blowing contaminants back into your air How often depends on what kind you have so check with your manufacturer and use common sense One telltale sign it needs to be tossed is a musty smell Whens the last time you went bra shopping The elastic in bras can get stretched out over time the washing machine speeds up this process which means less support for your girls Replacing a bra whenever it no longer lends comfort and support will help reduce back pain in heavier women and can slow the natural process of aging in breast tissue says breast specialist Kristi Funk MD That natural process of aging is sagging Slicing and dicing on plastic cutting boards scores the surface those lines you begin seeing after the first few times you use one Once bacteria get into these tiny grooves and begin to grow they can be very difficult to get rid of says Doyle He recommends switching to wooden   because wood contains resins that are naturally antimicrobial Translation when you score a wooden cutting board and bacteria seeps in it dies instead of thrives You dont need to toss your iPhone or Android out completely phew but you should definitely unplug from time to time Mounting research indicates that information overloadwhat happens when you use smart devices constantlyis linked to depression and anxiety Recent studies suggest that this is particularly true for people who are overly attached to their smartphones and tablets and for those who use multiple devices at once which experts call media multitasking Power down and stow your devices in a drawer at least a few times per week to give your brain a break ideally on a set schedule for example weekdays after  pm or weekend mornings before noon Global studies show that the average person sits  hours a day and some estimate people sit up to  hours a day says Robert Emery professor of occupational health at the University of Texas School of Public Health Excessive sitting impacts the bodys metabolic system and can lead to obesity high blood pressure diabetes cancer and depression But its not as simple as putting in more time at the gym which may not even reverse sitting disease adds Emery The American Medical Association recommends switching to a standing desk for work as an excellent way to combat the health issues associated with   Studies show the kitchen sponge is   in the average American household says Tierno While some experts recommend microwaving sponges daily to zap bacteria Doyle recommends skipping them completely When you use a sponge to clean meat juices which can contain   like salmonella and it stays moist at room temperature they grow quickly and studies show even the dishwasher doesnt kill them He advises using a washcloth to clean dishes instead grabbing a clean one every few days and throwing the dirty ones in with your laundry Because its thinner a washcloth dries quicker than a sponge between washes which helps significantly slow bacterial growth he explains
