Hot weather kills more Americans than all other natural disasters combined and the casualties continue to climb despite decades of warnings about how to recognize the signs of heat stress and take prompt corrective action With   some experts predict everworsening summer heat waves and even more related illnesses and deaths The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that excessive heat caused by climate change   As carbon pollution continues to rise the number of dangerously hot days each summer will increase even further leading to a dramatic increase in the number of lives lost the council reported Extreme heat claims an average of  lives each year but the real incidence is likely far higher In addition about  people die from illnesses made worse by heat the council estimates Death rates from many causes rise during heat waves that are related to heat but not reported as such said Dr Christopher B Colwell director of emergency medicine at Denver Health Medical Center Lots of deaths that occur during heat waves are attributed to natural causes like heart attacks kidney disease or   Especially at risk are the elderly young children athletes of all ages and weekend warriors whose bodies are not adapted to heat stress As common as the problem is its not common enough to grab peoples attention until it hits close to home Dr Colwell said in an interview Even a highprofile death like that of    a Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle who suffered   after a summer morning practice in  has not prompted all coaches to take necessary precautions Many coaches have held practices in the heat for years and no one died so they think a bigger deal is being made of the problem than it really is Dr Colwell said In the six years before Stringers death  high school and college players died from heatstroke according to researchers at the University of North Carolina Too often a player suffering from heat exhaustion the first stage of a potentially lifethreatening heat illness is sent back on the field after a brief rest instead of being benched for the day or longer While deaths of healthy young athletes tend to be well publicized the elderly are much more likely to succumb to extreme heat Dr Colwell explained that with age the bodys ability to cool itself declines Among other changes blood vessels dont dilate as readily to allow heat to escape a problem made worse by conditions like   and   Many older people without airconditioning or fans may not know when to get out of the heat or they may be physically unable to leave an overheated dwelling  a common problem among the elderly as well as among younger people who exercise strenuously raises the risk of heat illness by diminishing the bodys ability to lose heat Medications taken by many older people also increase their vulnerability to heat stress among them beta blockers prescribed for   and anticholinergics used to treat lung problems and   Other drugs too can contribute to a hypersensitivity to heat including lithium tricyclic   antihistamines and antispasmodics Recreational drugs like cocaine   PCP and alcohol can be a problem as well Heat illness often occurs several days into a heat wave as the effects on the body accumulate The body normally operates within a rather narrow temperature range If body temperature rises above  degrees Fahrenheit enzymes begin to break down and normal metabolic processes are disrupted When Stringer collapsed his temperature registered above  degrees Heat radiates from the body when blood vessels are maximally dilated and the air temperature is lower than body temperature But the most effective natural coolant is sweat as it collects on the skin and evaporates it draws heat from the body The risk of heat illness rises with the heat index a combined measure of air temperature and relative humidity When the humidity is high or too much clothing is worn sweat simply rolls off the skin without evaporating and cooling it Coaches take note depending on athletes ages intensity of activity and degree of acclimatization you should consider canceling practice and games when the heat index exceeds  experts say City dwellers are most at risk during heat waves because paved surfaces tall buildings and minimal tree cover enhance heat absorption creating a heat island Heat illness is a form of   defined as a rise in core body temperature But it does not respond to feverreducing medications making it extremely important to recognize heat exhaustion an early sign of trouble Common complaints include fatigue   weakness   nausea and   Dr Colwell explained that the brains cerebellum is especially sensitive to heat which explains the early signs of a heatstroke unsteady gait confusion and   Heatstroke characterized by a rise in body temperature above  degrees has a death rate as high as  percent Symptoms typically include a change in mental status like     or even   Among the elderly heatstroke most often develops gradually over several hot days But among otherwise healthy people engaged in strenuous exercise it tends to occur suddenly within minutes to hours which demands particular attention to early symptoms
