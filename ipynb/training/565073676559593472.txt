Filled with goodwill unfathomable optimism and a slightly heavy heart you embark on a health kick   With all the walking running cycling and gym activity you intend to do obviously you need an activity tracker a small trusty device that you can wear  to monitor every footstep every mile clocked up every calorie burned and even the quality of every moments shuteye Youll believe what it says I mean why wouldnt you  Millions of these things have been sold and youre not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results  And thats why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you Ive spent a full week wearing four of the latest and bestknown trackers to see if they all came up with the same results  My findings They dont This isnt about which device presents your text messages to you or comes in three shades of pink but about cold hard data  The Garmin Vivosmart Fitbit Charge Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock  At their worst one day saw a variation between them of  in distance covered and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of  calories burned  thats more than an entire days calorie intake for someone of my build Both companies are united in saying that its not the figures that matter but the pattern  Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern he says Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day week to week Because its that trend thats going to make you healthier Its a sentiment echoed by Jawbones head of international partner and product development Jorgen Nordin Whats important really is that our system is all about getting better becoming a better version of yourself he says  And maybe there is something in that  Goodwill good intention motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being  Yet rely too much on the tech inviting in thirdparty apps inputting what youve eaten and taking the figures as gospel and you may just find it all going the wrong way  But surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you Well Misfits medical director Matthew Diamond explains its not an exact science Variations in algorithms the sensors used the characteristics of the individual wearing the device like height and gait as well as wearing position can result in observed differences he says   Thats not dissimilar to Mr Joness view  he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm  Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heartrate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to  Garmins activity trackers are all about motivation nudging the user to make healthier choices says Chrissy Winchcombe Garmins marketing executive of wellness  You can also use it with a heartrate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly some with looks to replicate mere watches Others like the Swarovski crystal solarpowered Misfit  tracking abilities aside  would put JLos bling to shame But providing stats and prompting do more exercise notifications are just the start of their makers ambitions With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you says Jawbones Jorgen Nordin For example youve been out running you come home Your house knows youve been running not just because of the temperature of your skin but it also knows youve been sweating based on sensors Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler  If youre in a house with a boiler connected to your shower that could be turned on as you walk into your house  Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes  For most of us though the simple question now is more likely to be Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then  Sensors are still improving and as weve seen we cant expect military precision but this is a personal choice Will I be laying mine to rest No chance It makes me think more about my activity It makes me walk instead of getting the bus  It makes me feel smug at the end of the day usually  My husband I can compete over footsteps  dont worry we have the same device And now maybe Ill work that extra bit harder just in case its going easy on me
