Theres just one problem with that sense of satisfaction the data doesnt back it up According to a   ALA nearly  million Americans live in areas where smog and soot particles have led to unhealthy levels of pollution That means that for almost half of all Americans simply breathing can be dangerous  Even worse the report shows that some aspects of air quality have been deteriorating over the past few years in many cities  from  to  ozone worsened in  of the  biggest metropolitan areas including cities like New York and Chicago  Air pollution is not just a nuisance or the haze we see on the horizon its literally putting our health in danger Bonnie HolmesGen senior policy director of the ALA in California   Weve come a long way but the status quo is not acceptable The news is far from all bad Thanks in part to the retirement of a number of older coalfired power plants levels of particulate pollution  soot in other words  have been dropping in recent years with cities like Philadelphia and Indianapolis recording their lowest levels yet And historically were far better off  as Brad Plumer   over at Vox air pollutants as a whole have fallen  since the Clean Air Act was passed in  even as the economy population and energy use have all risen But as the ALA report makes clear some of that progress is being lost in part thanks to climate change  one environmental challenge were very much not meeting Rising levels of ozone pollution have been linked to warmer temperatures which will make it that much tougher to fight smog in the future  And the government could have done more  in  President Barack Obama went against the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and rejected a proposal that would have tightened the ozone standard to between  and  parts per billion The level is currently at  ppb set by former President George W Bush who was not exactly known as an environmental paragon Those regulatory battles matter because its becoming increasingly clear that healthy air is a moving target The more scientists learn about the health impacts of air pollution    even at comparatively low levels  Last October the World Health Organization WHO officially   connecting it directly to lung cancer as well as bladder cancer  And bad air doesnt just hurt the lungs  a raft of studies have connected air pollution especially soot to cardiovascular disease   Even autism has been  to pollution  In March the WHO   that outdoor air pollution caused  million premature deaths globally in   nearly three times the number of people who   each year from tuberculosis Climate change gets most of the environmental attention with reason  its effects are already being felt and it has the potential to radically change our world for the worse But air pollution is sickening and killing millions of people around the world right now And unlike global warming the technological and regulatory solutions to conventional air pollution already exist  Thats why it was good news Tuesday when the US Supreme Court   The decision excited greens because it indicates the court will eventually back even more controversial carbon regulations that the Obama White House is busy formulating now but the regulation that was upheld  the CrossState Pollution Rule  will prevent an estimated  deaths a year from conventional air pollution once its in place Air pollution remains stubbornly difficult to eliminate in part because of the vagary of the wind itself which separates the victims of pollution from its source  As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg   in her decision yesterday quoting from the Book of John The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound therof but canst not tell where it cometh and whither it goeth  But if we cant control the air we can control what we put into it  and protect ourselves
