I started distance running in  because in the short space of six months the person I was dating left me for another woman I bought a house a rash decision and my grandfather died  I did not handle this well As I was helping my mother pack up her parents house I found myself too drained to move and lay down on the floor and sobbed My mother suggested I try therapy I signed up for a mile race instead Training for the Ocean Drive Miler became my release valve When I was running there were no phones no texts no emails On the road work crises could not reach me While pounding out miles in the pouring rain I was grateful that it was raining so no one could see me cry  When I ran all I thought about was running put one foot in front of the other tackle the mile ahead instead of worrying about the entire distance to be run I had done a few kilometer races but this was different This time I was running five six miles at a time building my strength and speed until one cold March day when I ran  full miles from Cape May NJ to North Wildwood falling into my mothers arms at the end As the recession bloomed I kept running I tried not to worry about everything going wrong at once  with work and with the house which was suddenly worth a lot less than what I paid for it Instead I ran down one problem at a time  Running continues to be a balm  It was over a year ago that I broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years the man I thought I was going to marry While I packed up my life to remove all traces of myself from his home I made sure to put a copy of Hansons Marathon Method in a box that was coming with me not one going into storage  The method developed by the brothers Keith and Kevin Hanson is intense The schedule called for running up to  miles a week Tempo runs stretched to  miles The first speed session which came in Week  required running more than seven miles of intervals On a weekday  I cant do this I told myself then drove to the library photocopied the schedule and started training for the New Jersey Marathon even as I kept telling myself I wasnt good enough for such a difficult schedule too fat too slow too inexperienced too sleep deprived  I didnt stop though knocking down one workout at a time crossing them out on the photocopy with a felttip pen as I went I craved soreness in my muscles and pain It was both my penance for failing again in a relationship and a reminder that yes I was still alive and could feel something other than grief  I refused to retreat to a treadmill in bad weather and instead ran miles in sleet and freezing rain When I couldnt find my running hat because it was packed into a box in storage I ran outside in falling snow anyway flakes stinging my eyes as I went  I welcomed the exhaustion of logging    miles a week because it meant that instead of worrying about what was next and staring at my bedroom ceiling at  am I slept Soundly  Exercise after heartbreak is not a new idea Its not even a new one in my family In  after my parents divorce my father lost  pounds just by showing up regularly at the gym Exercise makes us feel good Studies show it releases endorphins increases energy levels improves mood  For me the benefits went beyond brain chemistry Running loosened my depression while giving my life structure The hard work hurled me forward Depression could follow me around like a sad little rain cloud but it couldnt rain on me if I kept moving  What are you running from my mother asked one night over dinner I had moved in with her temporarily after the breakup No I corrected her Its something Im running to  By the time I crossed the finish line at the New Jersey Marathon last May I was smiling  something I had started to do a lot more by then During those long lonely miles on the road I had started putting myself back together again  Im signed up to run another marathon next month this one in Charlottesville Va Im using the Hansons marathon method again to train The first week of the program started around what should have been my wedding day The challenge doesnt feel the same though I have lost my lust for crushing miles The sad little rain cloud has disappeared I have impossibly it  seems moved on  Now the miles are just miles instead of a method to throw off the albatross from around my neck I dont crave the pain  The work is still difficult tempo runs stretching to two hours neverending interval sets long runs logged on dreary winter mornings  Running keeps moving me forward With a gentle push rather than a shove its leading me to the next chapter Jen A Miller is the author of
