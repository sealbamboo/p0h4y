The NHS in England narrowly missed its fourhour AE waiting time target last week official figures show Figures for the week up to January  show  of patients were seen within four hours  below the  target It comes despite a drop in attendances with visits down by over  compared to a normal winter week In theory this should have made it easier for AE departments to meet the target to treat discharge or admit people within four hours Once the more minor centres such as walkin centres and minor injury units are discounted performance was even lower at  The data shows that two thirds of the  trusts that run the major AEs missed the target The overall target was missed in the first two weeks of December but then returned above the  mark in the week leading up to Christmas and during the Christmas week Dr Barbara Hakin deputy chief executive for NHS England said there were many positives to take from the figures The first few weeks of the calendar year are generally the toughest for the NHS but this weeks figures are over a percentage point better than the same week last year  This is hugely encouraging for patients and follows an excellent performance over the Christmas holiday period She added All this suggests that the NHS has prepared well and pulled out all the stops on behalf of the public I want to thank the frontline teams from across the NHS  who made this happen  they should be given the credit they deserve  Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said the figures showed a worrying slump in AE performance He added Experts warned the government about the AE crisis but they refused to listen Just weeks after ministers said the crisis is behind us patients have experienced the worst week in AE so far this winter But a spokeswoman for the health secretary Jeremy Hunt said that was disingenuous  She added The NHS has never met its AE target at this time of year including when Andy Burnham was health secretary
