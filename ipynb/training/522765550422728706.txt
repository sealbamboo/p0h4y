How can health workers stay safe while treating an Ebola patient The CDC is embroiled in a controversy over that very question After the infection of two nurses at a Dallas hospital the agency is facing criticism about whether initial guidelines provided to US facilities were stringent enough Yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted the strictest possible standard when developing a training program for clinicians headed to West Africa consulting closely with the aid group   The course runs three days every week through January with about  students per session The venue is a former US Army base in Alabama thats been rigged to look just like an Ebola treatment center in West Africa Theyve got the same orange mesh fencing used to mark off highrisk areas barrels of disinfectant solution and to stand in for patients plastic mannequins laid out on cots One of them is posed to look as if hes vomiting into a bucket And the curriculum Lots of detailed instructions on how to put on and take off the personal protective gear medical workers must wear of course But when I visited I also saw how the instructors spend lots of time teaching students how to do ordinary medical tasks in the extraordinary circumstances of an Ebola hospital They break the tasks up into three days of lessons Heres a sampling This activity is especially dangerous so precautions are key says   the CDC medical officer heading up the course Its a very simple medical procedure and something every clinician knows how to do and has probably done tens if not hundreds of times But it gets complicated with an Ebola patient because contact with blood is one way the virus can get transmitted to a health care worker Like other bodily fluids from an Ebola patient such as vomit and waste blood can have very high levels of the virus The consequences can be severe if theres an error or lapse in procedures he says  And there are quite a number of materials syringe vial BandAid etc In a regular medical setting like a doctors office you can always leave the room to get a missing item But in an E bola ward if you realize you left a tool in the lowrisk area youll lose a total of  minutes just taking the suit off to leave then suiting up again to get back in  You and your partner are responsible for continuously monitoring each other  for exposed skin the other person might not notice for instance or for slipups in procedure And youll often need two people to carry out the extra precautionary steps required when working with Ebola patients  Your suit wont protect you from a needlestick injury You can wear three or four or even  pairs of gloves but a needle will go through all of them Jhung explains So if you think the patient is going to be moving around too much perhaps because theyre undergoing a seizure or theyre in so much pain you might choose not to draw blood at that time The minute youve pulled it out of the patient drop it into the sealed disposal container This is standard practice in any setting says Jhung But if youve done it  times you might get a little nonchalant So we really emphasize it Not disposing of a sharp  thats medical shorthand for pointy objects like needles  immediately is one of those small errors that could be catastrophic in this case Thats the percentage aid groups working in West Africa have settled on as sufficient The washing should take place right after youve put the BandAid on the patient You dont need to wash for that long  the chlorine solution kills the virus on contact But you do need to make sure the solution reaches every part of your gloved hand including in between fingers to get at any blood that may have spattered on your hands as you pierced the patients skin or bandaged it  With a waterresistant marker write identifying information on the tube of blood youve just drawn then hold it out so your partner can spray the vial with chlorine solution Spraying must always be done close to the ground to ensure contaminated fluids hit by the spray dont dislodge and fly into anyones face Your partner will hold  open a plastic bag Drop the tube of blood into it  In theory it should be free of the virus But the entire highrisk area is considered to be potentially contaminated  particles of a patients vomit or blood may have landed on the box of trash bags and gone unnoticed for instance And the gloves that you or your partner are wearing may still have some bodily fluids on them So you cant be too careful Take a second plastic bag and spray the inside  just in case that first bag wasnt sprayed as thoroughly as necessary Then drop the first bag into the second bag  Thats a precaution  in case it came into contact with contaminated fluids as you were walking the bag to the lab Possibly along the way to the lab someone could set the bag down to take care of a patient in an emergency situation or they could bump up against a patient says Jhung So spraying the bag one last time before handing it over to the lab is just a good practice to get into A lab worker will hold open a third bag for you to drop the second bag into Technically a sanitation or hygiene worker performs this task not a clinician But clinicians need to know the basics in case they need to pitch in  and so they can tell if the facility theyre working in is following proper safety procedures  Thats a phrase that CDC instructors tell their students to remember The takehome point is that if theres any doubt about what you should do about a spill you should put chlorine solution on it says Jhung But he adds that its important not to use too powerful a spray  you dont want to send fluids flying around Better to gently pour or spritz the chlorine solution onto the affected area This is the first step to take regardless of where the vomit has landed floor bed linens etc After about  to  minutes the liquid portion of the waste should be decontaminated  They allow for less fine motor movements than the exam and surgical gloves worn during medical procedures But dishwashing gloves are stronger and less likely to tear  Jhung describes a chuck as a large cloth with the consistency of a diaper First moisten it with chlorine solution then lay it on top of the solid waste Wait  to  minutes so that some disinfection can take place  Put the cloth with the bits in a plastic disposal bag Close the first bag spray the outside and place it in a second bag  Spray the outside of the second bag with chlorine solution and walk it over to the hospitals waste disposal area  often an incinerator  The liquid portion of the waste can now be mopped up with paper towels  as long as the liquid has been thoroughly covered with chlorine solution for  minutes any virus in it will have been killed  Any paper towels used should be placed in a plastic disposal bag and taken to the waste disposal area  Interviewing a patient requires less protective gear than treating a patient Eyes need to be covered with goggles or a clear mask and youll need to wear gloves But a headtotoe suit is not required as long as you can remain at least  feet away from the patient If the patients symptoms and history suggest Ebola you need to suit up fully before escorting the individual into the suspect case area As with cleanups dishwashing gloves should be worn for this job If the person cannot walk on his or her own power you will need four people and a stretcher The team will lift the patient onto the stretcher  Use a chlorine solution to spray the area where the patient was standing or lying as thoroughly as possible so as to cover any bodily fluids that may have run off of them  Then immediately hand the stretcher over to hygiene workers who will need to decontaminate it with chlorine spray before it can be used again  Jhung says you are most likely to dislodge gear and expose skin when you are carrying a person or helping him onto a bed Even if you have no reason to think you touched an Ebola patients fluids if you notice any skin showing or any tears in your suit or gear at any time while you are in the highrisk area you and your partner must immediately exit the highrisk area and take off your suit in accordance with the usual careful removal procedures taught in the course Jhung stresses that this class is just an introduction to the basics Aid groups that run Ebola treatment units like Doctors Without Borders and International Medical Corps require clinicians to work under the close supervision of a mentor at a real facility for several weeks before they are considered fully trained
