 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it would seek regulatory approval later this year for an experimental cystic-fibrosis drug that helped produce a statistically significant improvement in patients' lung function compared with placebo in two late-stage studies.. The studies tested Vertex's experimental drug lumacaftor in combination with its currently approved therapy ivacaftor, known by the brand name Kalydeco, in cystic-fibrosis patients ages 12 and older with two copies of a rare genetic mutation.
