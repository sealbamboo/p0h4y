Boy its a good time to be a darkchocolate lover Weve noted before the growing   that a daily dose of the bitter bean may help reduce blood pressure There also seems to be a link between a regular chocolate habit and   Now scientists are offering an explanation for just why cocoa powder may be good for the heart and waistline The magic may reside in our microbes The friendly bacteria in our guts can gobble up cocoa powder and turn it into compounds known to help the heart food scientists from Louisiana State University   Tuesday at the American Chemical Society meeting in Dallas The critters also convert the cocoa powder into molecules that reduce inflammation and help tell us when were full These are good compounds to have in your gut says   who led the study They can get absorbed into your blood and protect cells in your blood vessels from stress he says For centuries people have been attributing a vast array of   to eating chocolate from curing infertility and fatigue to fever and dental problems But so far the links to lower blood pressure and heart health have been the strongest  and one of the few benefits to pass muster in the eyes of science I was holding out for scientists to prove chocolates aphrodisiac effect Finley jokes But its the cardiovascular benefits that will probably pan out Our findings are one more brick in the road to proving that one Of course Finley is talking about cocoa powder here The stuff that has no sugar and milk in it Our results dont translate to a Hershey bar he says But cocoa powder goes well with many foods I put it on my oatmeal every morning with berries Cocoa powder is packed with potent antioxidants called   These healthful molecules are also found in dark berries and black tea And theyre known to help the heart and possibly prevent cancer But theres one major problem with many polyphenols Theyre so large that they dont get absorbed into the blood Thats where the critters in your gut can help out Finley says Previous studies have found that gut bacteria like to feast on polyphenols from blackberries and tea So Finley wanted to see what the bugs would do with the polyphenols in cocoa powder He and his students passed the cocoa powder through a device that mimics the human gut First it treats the cocoa with enzymes like the ones in your stomach And then the remaining material goes through an artificial colon Its a rather yucky way of mimicking peoples lower gut Finely says Its just a mixture of fecal matter We pay people  to give us a sample We get a lot of graduate students to volunteer Sounds gross but those donations are teeming with life  trillions of bacteria that see the cocoa powder as a fivestar dinner The microbes break down the polyphenols into smaller molecules that are more likely to make it across the gut into the blood Finely says Those compounds are the good ones that help reduce inflammation and stress in the blood vessels And the friendly bacteria dont stop there They also feasted on the fiber in cocoa powder Finley and his team found The microbes break down the fiber into   which get absorbed and can have an effect on satiety he says Of course Finley and his team have to confirm their results in real digestive tracts The next step is to give people cocoa powder and see if we can find these metabolites in the blood he says Those types of experiments are critical to figuring out exactly whats in chocolate that makes it healthy for the heart says   a food scientist at Pennsylvania State University who wasnt involved in the study Thats the big missing link right now Lambert tells The Salt We know now that gut bacteria can break down cocoa into compounds that have beneficial cardiovascular effects he says But we dont know yet if these are the critical ones inside the blood In the meantime Ill keep indulging my gut bacteria with a few cubes of extra dark chocolate each day Seems like a winwin situation for both of us
