 has set up more than  schools in Kenya over the past four years and plans to open  more in January Using a schoolinabox model Bridges founders say it gives primary schoolkids a quality education for roughly  a month We believe that we can be educating at least  million pupils around the world that come from families who live on less than  a day says Bridge cofounder Jay Kimmelman We believe that we can give them an education  thats truly globally competitive Primary school in Kenya starts at age  and runs for eight years Its officially free for all children but parents regularly complain that government schools are overcrowded understaffed and ineffective Teachers often dont show up and parents are often expected to pay bribes to keep their kids in the free schools What we are trying to do is provide parents a real option Kimmelman says To accomplish this Bridge has set up a highly structured technologydriven model that relies on teachers reading standardized lessons from handheld tablet computers On the surface the Bridge school on the western edge of Nairobi looks much like other schools in poor parts of the developing world The simple buildings are made of sheet metal and rough timbers Theres no electricity Rows of wooden desks face a blackboard in the sixthgrade classroom The teacher glances back and forth from her black tablet to the students in front of her as she runs through an English lesson Very good she announces as reads the directions from the tablet Give them a super cheer she continues and the students shout in unison Super The ereader not only delivers the lesson script to the teachers but it also acts as an electronic time sheet grade book and supervisor The tablet tracks what time the teacher arrives what time she leaves and how long she spends on every lesson The administrative side of the entire school can be run off a smartphone says David Mwangi the manager of a Bridge school in Nairobi He can admit new students submit test scores and send payroll time sheets back to Bridges central office in Nairobi all from his cheap Chinese smartphone Tuition collection is also automated Parents pay their monthly school fees through Kenyas mobile money system   which allows people to transfer cash via text message The exact same lesson being taught in this classroom is being taught in every other sixthgrade class at Bridge schools across the country says Bridge cofounder Shannon May If you were at one of the other  locations right now youd be seeing the exact same thing she says In some ways it is kind of the magic of it That magic of standardized lesson plans changes the role of the teacher It allows Bridge to hold down costs because it can hire teachers who dont have college degrees It also allows Bridge to rapidly expand and bring in more customers Thats Bridges goal Its target customers are the hundreds of millions of parents around the world who live on  day and yearn for better schools for their children To keep tuition costs low Bridge depends on large class sizes Their ideal class size is  to  kids but the classes can get upward of  students Over the past four years Bridge has grown to be the largest chain of private schools on the continent And some advocates for universal education find this troubling There are other private schools across Africa seeking to teach the socalled poorest of the poor but their models and size are quite different from those of Bridge If somebody suggested that kind of an educational model in this country they would be laughed out of the educational community says Ed Gragert the US director of the   which advocates for increased access to education in the developing world Thats not how kids learn best he says Kids learn by interacting with each other It seems like we are going back for the sake of somebody making a profit to where a robot could teach that class He says however he does admire the rigor of the Bridge model School is in session from  am until  pm five days a week On Saturday classes run from  until  May bristles at her teachers being called robots but she does acknowledge that Bridge has a fundamentally different view of the role of its teacher They are not content producers May says of her teachers Instead Bridge hires experts to script the lessons the teachers role is to deliver that content to the class May says the traditional model where teachers are expected to be experts on everything doesnt make sense  particularly in a place where teachers may have had poor educations themselves What the child is able to learn is always limited by what the teacher knows she says So you can never have the child leapfrog previous problems within that town city or country She also says its crazy to have fourthgrade teachers in schools attempting to reinvent the wheel on how to teach fractions Other critics of Bridge say the private school chain is undermining the public education system by siphoning off kids from the most motivated families But May says her company is helping to solve one of the biggest problems facing the poorest of the poor  the lack of access to decent education And in a field that has long been the domain of governments churches and nonprofits she takes an unabashedly capitalist approach I think theres something really important about approaching this problem from a forprofit perspective she says The forprofit model forces each school to contain costs and May says it makes Bridge accountable to its paying customers the parents Our customer can put us out of business They can say This isnt good I dont want it its not useful It has no value to me Thats not how I want to spend my  shillings about  this month This is a power that poor families certainly dont have over the bureaucratic Kenyan public schools Its also a power they cant wield if their school was being run by some distant international donor Bridge is already raising private capital to fund its planned expansion outside of Kenya The company is looking to move in to Africas most populous nation Nigeria According to UNICEF Nigeria has roughly  million primaryschoolaged children who dont go to school at all
