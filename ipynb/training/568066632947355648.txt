Its like a rugby international  with politicians from Westminster and Cardiff tearing into rucks and mauls in the increasingly acrimonious health debate Each side has found data to back up its claims with the Conservatives anxious to show that the Labourrun NHS in Wales is in decline and the Welsh administration accusing the Tories of distorting the facts But away from the political playing field what is the truth about the NHS in Wales  As always it is a complex picture not easily reduced to simple conclusions and soundbites The political parties however are likely to continue to exchange blows over the issue as the general election approaches The latest accident and emergency waiting times reveal that Wales is still lagging behind England   The figures for January show  of patients being seen within four hours up from  in December but still well short of the  target   In England the comparable figure was  January data for Scotland and Northern Ireland is not yet available   Ambulance response performance in Wales has also fallen short of the equivalent figure in England  Another batch of health data today though looks more favourable for Wales   The proportion of cancer patients whose treatment began within  days of being referred by a GP rose to  in the final three months of  That compares with  of patients in England The Welsh governments target is  while Englands is  Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies sheds new light on the decisions made by the different administrations    The IFS says that between  and the current financial year health spending in England rose by  while the Welsh government cut its health budget by    But for social care provided by local authorities there was a sharp drop in England of  while in Wales the equivalent budget was reduced by just     Cardiff in effect had decided its own tradeoff between spending on the NHS and social care which was different from Englands   The Welsh government argues that protecting social care spending as much as possible has allowed more efficient transfers of patients back to the community from hospital beds   Data on delayed transfers of care analysed by the Nuffield Trust reveals contrasting stories in England and Wales They were up by a third in England between  and  but down slightly in Wales over the same period A familiar argument in Wales is that a legacy of industrialrelated diseases and deprivation in some areas has created a bigger challenge for its NHS than for the health service in England   The Nuffield Trust has pointed out that because of these factors a direct comparison between Wales and England is not useful   Better says Nuffield to compare Wales with the north east of England where spending per head on health is higher than in Wales  The debate will continue until polling day and beyond although it may be less intense after May   It is worth noting that the general election in  is all about electing parties to run health policy in England   Elections for the devolved administrations and who runs their health services wont take place till next year
