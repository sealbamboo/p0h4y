Why didnt my brother survive Why didnt anybody you know why me asks Cecelia Cichan the sole survivor of a  plane crash in Michigan These kinds of unanswerable questions reflect our natural inclination to look for meaning in experiences and to have our life stories make sense said Dr Charles Raison   Disasters that take the lives of everyone involved except for one may leave a survivor feeling guilty for receiving the gift of continued life when no one else did They might not believe they deserved it Raison said  Survivor guilt can be an immediate response to a tragedy and the extent of the feelings depends on the individual Russell Jones a psychologist at Virginia Tech who helped counsel victims at the school after a shooting rampage in  has said Being the sole survivor of a tragedy is likely even more difficult than being one of several Raison said  In working with patients who fought in the Vietnam War Raison observed that their survivor guilt was linked to their perceptions of their own actions at the time when others died They felt worse if they regretted their actions or didnt feel they had done enough to help others  If they had lost their nerve at a key moment or if they had done something they felt ashamed of it ate them alive for the rest of their lives he said  He added If you survive something while heroically trying to save everybody else youre going to have a different feeling about it than if you took the last seat on the lifeboat so to put it Survivor guilt can be an expression of grief and loss according to Melissa Brymer director of terrorism and disaster programs at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute in Los Angeles Sitting back and taking time to process the event can help survivors cope Jones said Seeking support from friends family and community or faith leaders can help an individual work through difficult feelings But if theres lingering guilt and anxiety Jones recommended consulting a mental health professional A survivor may experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression that requires formal treatment Classic PTSD symptoms include intrusive thoughts flashbacks and nightmares People may avoid anything that reminds them of the event and have difficulty paying attention It may be paired with depression and suicidal feelings These symptoms can lead to fullblown PTSD over time especially if a person has a history of mental illness Previous trauma stress loss of financial stability and grieving the loss of family and friends are also risk factors Jones said About  to  of people who experience trauma develop severe PTSD symptoms that persist and require professional help Jones said   interviewed survivors of the  Piper Alpha disaster in which an oil rig in the North Sea exploded killing  people More than  years after the event seven out of  people met PTSD criteria  Features such as physical injury personal experience and survivor guilt were associated with significantly higher levels of posttraumatic symptoms the study authors wrote  With support people generally do well Jones said For some people survivor guilt is just part of working through complex feelings after experiencing a traumatic event involving deaths and a way of mourning But it may become allconsuming and impede functioning If theyre having changes within their behaviors or in their emotions or with their relationships with others then we want to make sure that people get help Brymer said Unfortunately people who need help often dont seek it Jones said So often theres stigma attached to getting help from a mental health professional Jones said Therefore they go without seeking treatment oftentimes until they reach a breaking point There are several treatment strategies that have been shown to help people with survivor guilt and PTSD symptoms Theres no onesizefitsall approach Raison said  One strategy involves exposure Jones said Getting people to talk about the event and assimilating the event into everyday living are key Jones said Therapists may also take the individual back to the setting where the tragedy occurred and allow the person to express his or her thoughts feelings and emotions But this technique may make some individuals with PTSD more traumatized Raison said Instead he recommends that therapists try to reframe tragedy as an event that can be empowering  Some people may benefit from viewing their survivorship as a positive gift one that has a meaning in the context of a life story Raison said This may especially be helpful for people of faith who may believe there is a divine purpose in their survival  But others may reject the idea that they survived for a reason Raison said A cognitivebehavioral approach would help the person examine his or her own beliefs that underlie their haunting feelings of guilt and challenge irrational thought processes he said  If theyre still really suffering survivor guilt its sort of helping them reframe it where they recognize that its not their fault they survived its not their blessing they survived it just happened he said  Secular survivors may also come to view the traumatic experience as something that gives them a deeper reason for living  One coping strategy is to do something meaningful for someone else Brymer said Organizations that help people who have survived violence or natural disasters or advocacy groups may be good options for people who are trying to move on from a tragedy If someone has died is there something that you can do thats meaningful and representative of that person she asked Is there something you can do so youre unstuck so you can do something powerful and meaningful for someone else Ky Dickens director of Sole Survivor  that there is a misperception that a survivor is lucky and that he or she is a miracle with a life purpose  an attitude that puts undue pressure on them she said  Survivors she said are victims too
