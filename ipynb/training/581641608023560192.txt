All hospitals in England will provide a truly sevenday NHS by  under a future Conservative government David Cameron has said At the partys spring forum Mr Cameron said that more hospitals must provide toplevel treatment at the weekend starting with emergency care In a wideranging speech he said his partys message to various sections of the population was Were with you Labour said Tory plans for extreme spending cuts threatened the NHS It has put the health service at the forefront of its own election campaign with leader Ed Miliband promising on Friday to cap the amount of profit private firms can make from the NHS in England This spring forum is about fighting back against Labour on the NHS Polls show a clear large consistent lead for Ed Milibands party on the NHS It is the foundation stone of Labours campaign But the Conservatives are desperate to chip away at it with promises of protected realterms increases in funding and an extra bn a year The Conservatives are committing to providing full weekend hospital care in England    The big question of course is Where will the money come from but this is about politics This is an attempt to try to neutralise the NHS and enable the Conservatives to return to what they want to be talking about  the economy  Speaking at the forum in Manchester Mr Cameron warned that figures showed patients were more likely to die if they were admitted at weekends According to the Conservatives official studies suggest mortality rates for those admitted on Saturdays and Sundays are  and  higher respectively than for those admitted on Wednesdays For years its been too hard to access the NHS out of hours But illness doesnt respect working hours Heart attacks major accidents babies  these things dont just come from nine to five Mr Cameron said At weekends he said some of the resources are not up and running The key decisionmakers arent always there With a future Conservative government we would have a truly sevenday NHS Already millions more people can see a GP seven days a week but by  I want this for everyone with hospitals properly staffed especially for urgent and emergency care so that everyone will have access to the NHS services they need seven days a week by   the first country in the world to make this happen During his speech Mr Cameron also reiterated a number of election campaign pledges including Andy Burnham Labours shadow health secretary said the plans were not credible without investment in extra NHS staff With the NHS in increasing financial distress David Cameron must set out clearly how it will be paid for he said The Liberal Democrats said NHS England already had plans to open hospitals and GP surgeries seven days a week while UKIP said the Tories had degenerated the NHS beyond all recognition during the last five years in government Dr Mark Porter chairman of the British Medical Association said that the Conservatives funding commitment was not even enough to maintain existing services and that a funding gap of up to bn a year was predicted to open up He said Without a detailed fullycosted plan to provide the staff and resources needed to deliver more sevenday services this is at best an empty pledge and at worst shameless political gameplaying with the NHS ahead of the election The Conservatives have pledged to guarantee a realterm increase in funding for the NHS during the next Parliament extending the ringfence in place for the past five years Labour has said it will spend bn more than its opponents Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said government reforms of the NHS were saving bn a year but that the NHS will need more money  He added that the NHSs own sums suggested the predicted bn annual shortfall could be reduced with efficiency changes and were backing that plan New clinical standards set out in  require hospitals to provide sevenday access to diagnostic tests such as Xrays ultrasound MRI scans and pathology as well as providing access to multidisciplinary teams which include expert nurses and physiotherapists In its blueprint for services over the next five years published last October NHS England said hospital patients should have access to sevenday services by   where this makes a clinical difference to outcomes
