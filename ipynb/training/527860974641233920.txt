Becca Levy a psychologist at the Yale School of Public Health has been measuring the impact of stereotypes about old age for close to  years They have potent effects she and her colleagues have found The researchers developed an image of aging scale to determine whether subjects are likely to see old people as capable and active and full of life or as grumpy or helpless or other negative attributes Theyve used the scale to measure how much those descriptions match older peoples own selfperceptions Over and over theyve found that   as they age from those with more negative stereotypes even when the groups are similar in other ways including health status Older people with more positive views of aging do better on memory tests They have better handwriting They can walk faster Theyre   Those with more positive selfperceptions of aging   by an average of  years Other kinds of stereotypes about race and gender have also been found to influence behavior But can you help older people to acquire those positive views In their latest study Dr Levy and her colleagues tried to strengthen positive age stereotypes and make them last and then see what effect they had on physical strength Negative stereotypes about age like those groanworthy insurance ads about an older woman who cant quite seem to grasp the Internet are of course rampant Children as young as  or  have already taken them in Dr Levy told me in an interview Then theyre repetitively reinforced By the time those preschoolers become old themselves theyve had decades of exposure Yet the researchers have now reported in the journal Psychological Science that an   That leads in turn to stronger physical functioning The effects were still evident three weeks after the intervention ended Heres how it worked with a group of  older adults average age  living New Haven Conn Once a week over four weeks these volunteers were exposed to whats sometimes called an implicit association exercise Some in the group saw positive words associated with aging  like wise creative spry and fit along with old and senior  flashed on a laptop screen so briefly that while the brain registered them people couldnt tell what they said Perception without awareness as Dr Levy put it The sessions lasted about  minutes Other subjects engaged in an explicit exercise in which they were asked to write brief essays about active older people The researchers controlled for age sex and health As expected followup tests showed that the implicit intervention significantly strengthened positive age stereotypes and selfperceptions of age Then one week and three weeks after the final session participants were given physical tasks repeatedly standing up from a chair and sitting down walking across a room holding poses that challenge balance The group exposed to implicit positive messages showed significant improvement in physical function compared to their status before the experiment began Those who participated in the explicit intervention and wrote essays showed no improvement In fact the people who underwent four brief exposures to implicit positive messages showed greater physical improvement than a group of a similar aged enrolled in a different study that actually exercised for six months In earlier studies using a onetime experience the researchers had influenced aging stereotypes for perhaps an hour This is the first time theyve been able to show that such influences may last and have physical effects for weeks The implicit approach may have more impact than explicitly positive messages Dr Levy said because it thwarts resistance People have encountered negative stereotypes for so long in media and marketing and everyday conversations that people build up ways to hold onto them she said Implicit interventions can bypass that Im wondering how long such results might last  a few months a year or two  and whether participants might need periodic tuneups reexposure to the implicit messages Nobody knows yet Im also wondering what social scientists might do with this knowledge Should swathes of the population at all ages be exposed to implicit sessions that boost their positive stereotypes of age I could imagine them embedded with permission in movies or video games or flashing on our cellphones Id be interested in your ideas Thought manipulation can sound fairly creepy but arent age stereotypes also a form of thought manipulation And creepy
