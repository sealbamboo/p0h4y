Foster Farms a chicken producer in California just cant seem to stop bleeding bad news On July  it   several batches of chicken products because a chicken breast from one of those batches is blamed for poisoning someone with salmonella bacteria The recall came on top of an   of salmonella thats been going on since October  Some of the  cases reported in  states and Puerto Rico have been linked to Foster Farms chicken products And lets not forget last fall when US Department of Agriculture food safety officials   to shut down a Foster Farms processing plant in Fresno Calif because of salmonella contamination But heres the paradox Foster Farms may now be one of the countrys cleanest safest sources of chicken products Thats according to the USDA which has been testing chicken parts that are processed at Foster Farms plants After the USDA threatened to shut down the plants in October the company called in food safety experts and set up new   to eliminate salmonella contamination Its made a difference the government says At Foster Farms plants fewer than  percent of chicken parts test positive for salmonella At other companies its typically about  percent In midJune in fact Foster Farms   this success at a meeting to mark the companys th anniversary Company officials were joined by government officials who sang the companys praises Sen Dianne Feinstein of California called on other chicken companies to follow Foster Farms example David Acheson former chief medical officer of the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service and a former associate commissioner for foods at the Food and Drug Administration praised the company for being willing to devote the time and resources to becoming a world leader in food safety This latest recall and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports that Foster Farms chicken is linked to a wider salmonella outbreak now are raising questions about how effective the companys safety push effort really has been Theres a possible explanation for the conflicting reports from Foster Farms Its possible that the recent spate of bad news reflects Foster Farms earlier operations before the recent improvements The July recall for instance covers chicken products that emerged from a Foster Farms plant back in March Similarly even though the CDC continues releasing updates on a large salmonella outbreak with  people sickened most of those people actually got sick many months ago In addition even though the CDC has linked this salmonella outbreak to chicken from Foster Farms a USDA spokesman says its possible that the outbreak may come from multiple sources Some of the cases of salmonella poisoning for instance have been reported in places where Foster Farms doesnt even distribute its chicken According to a statement from the USDAs Food Safety and Inspection Service because our intensified sampling at Foster Farms facilities is showing low levels of Salmonella  FSIS has been investigating whether illnesses are being caused by other sources Finally even though Foster Farms has reduced salmonella contamination at its plants it hasnt managed to eliminate it completely So theres still a risk that the bacteria make somebody sick Maybe Foster Farms was just really unlucky
