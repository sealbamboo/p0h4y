Trulah Goin Mills had developed dementia and couldnt be left alone in the house but when she and her husband Lewis moved into an assisted living facility in Boise Idaho in  one lifelong quality remained intact She was a sexual kitten said her daughter Glenna Mills She loved her man She sat on his lap They held hands all the time One night a staff member heard a thunk from their studio apartment went in to check and found Mrs Mills then  on the floor It was clear that theyd been doing something sexual said her daughter The whole staff heard about it and thought it was hilarious Luckily the senior Millses thought the incident was pretty funny too And because theyd been married since  there was no question of trying to discourage their sexual behavior separate them or report them to a disapproving family  all actions that  administrators and staff have been known to take with couples in assisted living who arent married at least not to each other especially if one person shows signs of cognitive decline The Millses treasured their intimacy almost until they died last year Yet Glenna Mills said her parents experience shows the difficulty of maintaining let alone developing a sexual relationship in assisted living  One thing they really hated was they didnt have any privacy she said Anybody taking care of them could walk in She still wonders about that nighttime topple Did someone deliberately enter their space because they heard something they didnt like hearing Moreover the staff members could be condescending to couples finding ardor cute as long as it didnt go too far When it amused them  Its so sweet Glenna Mills said When people said I cant believe theyd still be Doing It you knew what the undercurrent was what they were visualizing Old bodies ewww Much as their families and caregivers might prefer to see older adults as asexual   In  a federally funded survey found that   Rates of sexually transmitted diseases among older people are climbing True assisted living residents are often less physically and cognitively healthy than those living independently And the population skews so female that a simple lack of male partners can create for heterosexuals a barrier to sex But any assisted living administrator can tell you stories from the delightful because love knows no age limits to the disturbing exploitation doesnt either Ascertaining whether encounters are consensual who is capable of consent how to balance couples privacy with that of other residents  these issues have not been thought through said Ann Christine Frankowski of the Center for Aging Studies at the University of Maryland Baltimore County But people are beginning to talk about it Some assisted living complexes have done more than talk The Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx   in its care in  The Sunrise chain with nearly  facilities nationwide adopted a policy in  though the company declined to let me read it But most such centers have yet to grapple with such questions said Karen Love a longtime advocate for improvements in assisted living Dr Frankowski has conducted observational studies in  Maryland assisted living complexes in the past few years None of them have formalized policies to deal with sexual behavior she said That leaves the response up to the staff mostly aides whove had little to no training in this sensitive matter And to families who may be well still shocked that their parents are having sex said Daniel Reingold president and chief executive of the Hebrew Home He recalled the reaction of the families when two residents fell in love A daughter on one side thought it was great that Mom was happy and a daughter on the other side was appalled and disgusted and thought we needed to keep these people apart But the Hebrew Homes policy declares that emotional and physical intimacy remains a normal and natural aspect of life and requires staff to set aside personal biases and support consensual sexual behavior On occasion administrators have moved people into single rooms for privacy or provided condoms or drugs like Viagra The policy forbids nonconsensual acts or a public display that has a negative impact on the community The greatest number of complications come up with cognitive impairment Mr Reingold said In assisted living a significant proportion of residents have some degree of cognitive loss even if theyre not diagnosed with dementia Can they consent Yes the Hebrew Home has decided It trains staff to ask people about their relationships  how they feel whether they are comfortable  and to rely on body language and facial expressions when people are nonverbal You can tell when an older adult wants something or is repulsed Mr Reingold said At the same time dementia can cause sexual aggression or reduce inhibitions The Hebrew Home required one family to hire a roundtheclock aide to prevent a serial exhibitionist from flashing women In another complex Dr Frankowski reported a man accustomed to masturbating on his couch had to be led from the communal living room to the privacy of his own apartment This kind of measured response requires not only policies and leadership but also given high staff turnover continuing education The Sunrise in Old Tappan NJ retrains its staff in sexual guidelines twice a year said its executive director Colleen Varnum They understand that this is OK this is good this is what residents want this is what we want Elsewhere however administrators and staff still show discomfort with sexual activity beyond handholding or cheekkissing Dr Frankowski has found I hear the word appropriate a lot she told me  She has seen aides separate couples move them to different dining tables or floors steer them to different activities She met a married couple required to have separate beds in their apartment She has heard staff members joke about walking in first and knocking later or threaten to call residents families when they see sexual expression Gay and lesbian residents she said remain an invisible population Yet sex goes on anyway of course in a population whose sexual values were formed in the s and s You hope the industry recognizes that the people who will move in  years from now may have different ideas At the complexes where she does research Dr Frankowski said Staff members already laugh about it Oh my God when the boomers get here what a place this is going to be
