
 The smoking rate among adults in the United States has dropped again an encouraging trend that experts on smoking cessation attribute to public policies like smokefree air laws and cigarette taxes as well as media campaigns and less exposure to smoking in movies Eighteen percent of American adults were cigarette smokers in  according to a   released last week by the National Center for Health Statistics down from  percent the previous year From  to  the rate dropped to  percent from  percent the first statistically significant change over multiple years since the period spanning  to  when the rate fell to  percent from  percent The fact that were below this theoretical sound barrier of  percent is important says Stanton A Glantz a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco and director of the universitys Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education This data shows that the whole premise that there is this hardcore group where no matter what you do you cant get them to quit is just not true Doctors and researchers who study smoking cessation point to a number of factors that may play a role in the latest drop Now there is a strong evidence base about what works and what doesnt work Dr Glantz says  School education programs for example dont appear to be very effective most likely because schools are difficult places to change social norms and it is hard to do the programs well given all the other demands in the school day he says But educating people about the tobacco industrys marketing efforts can have a big impact We now have empirical evidence that people who dont like the tobacco industry are about five times as likely to quit and a third to a fifth as likely to start he says Dr Richard Hurt a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn where he directs the Nicotine Dependence Center says that two public policies have had significant effects on smoking cessation increasing the price of cigarettes and creating smokefree workplaces They reduce the number of cigarettes that people are smoking usually between three and five cigarettes less per day for heavier smokers he says and increase the chances of a smoker stopping smoking Since children cant as easily afford cigarettes and dont see smoking as the norm when it is banned in so many public places these policies also decrease the chances of your child or grandchild ever starting to smoke he says People smoking less is a really important part of the story says Dr Glantz The overall pattern were seeing both nationally and in places like California where the prevalence of smoking is now down to  percent is as smoking goes down the remaining smokers are becoming lighter smokers intermittent smokers or not even smoking every day And as you smoke less and less it becomes easier to quit He also notes the importance of smoking bans When you create smokefree workplaces bars casinos and restaurants it sends a strong message that smoking is out he says It also creates environments that make it easier for people to quit smoking Dr Mary OSullivan director of the Margarita Camche Smoking Cessation Program at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan said In New York weve gotten it down to  percent and one of the big reasons is price Here its  a pack Even our schizophrenia patients who are the most addicted who used to smoke two and three packs a day even they are smoking less because of the price She says that many of her patients who are trying to quit head to city parks where its been illegal to smoke since  people caught smoking in parks face a  fine Richard Grucza an associate professor in psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine who studies tobacco policy cited the centperpack federal tax increase that took effect in  as well as laws that ban indoor smoking cigarette vending machines the sale of packs of fewer than  cigarettes and the distribution of free cigarettes as major contributors to declining smoking rates For cigarette and tobacco taxation its very clear the effects get larger over time Dr Grucza says noting the same is true for indoor air laws He argues that such policies are particularly successful because they are a universal intervention something that affects everybody as opposed to say a smokers hot line that only certain people might call According to these experts also at play may be increasingly graphic ad campaigns including the  campaign begun last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and fewer incidents of smoking in popular movies Research shows that the more times a young person sees smoking in the movies the   and from  to  young people saw far less smoking in PG movies Many of those youths are now adults and would have been captured by the new report though smoking in movies has since increased The cigarette smoking rate among young people has been declining slowly but steadily over the last decade and the latest estimates were  percent for high school students and  percent for middle school students Dr Reid Blackwelder presidentelect of the American Academy of Family Physicians sums up the current confluence of reasons Its harder and harder to avoid the message that smoking is a major health risk Its easier and easier to find ways to quit Finally its just becoming more expensive to keep smoking He says that prescription drugs along with counseling can help people quit if the patient is motivated and if the benefits outweigh possible side effects but he cautions that we cant say that those are the reason the rate has declined Instead he says the reduction has more to do with having a strong relationship with ones doctor and being able to have an ongoing conversation about smoking The CDCs newest smoking cessation campaign Talk With Your Doctor is about just that leveraging the finding that a smoker is more than twice as likely to quit if given advice and support from a doctor Im going to bring it up every time Dr Blackwelder says Ill ask What would it take today to prioritize giving up smoking cigarettes Then Ill be there when you do make the decision and Im going to mobilize resources for you
