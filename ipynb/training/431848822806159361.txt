An effective new medicine is developed as a cure for a major disease The drug company prices the medicine at tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment How can the diseasecuring medicine be made accessible to patients who need it most of whom live in low and middleincome countries Its well worth watching as drugmaker   tries to solve this riddle for Solvadi a newly approved drug for the deadly liver infection   that afflicts more than  million people around the world Solvadi sells for   in the US That price means a threemonth regimen for hepatitis C costs  More than  million Americans are infected with hepatitis C Many of them are poor or incarcerated In the US Gilead says it will rely on insurance coverage plus giveaway patient assistance programs for people who arent insured Sensitive to anger over its pricing decision in the US Gilead is talking to generic drugmakers in India about a licensing deal that would set the price at  per treatment course or  percent of the US price for  lowincome countries Even so activists are very unhappy with Gilead Its not yet clear whether the pricing deal would include middleincome countries such as India China and Egypt which have particularly heavy burdens of hepatitis C And activists say that  is unaffordable to all but the wealthy in most low and middleincome countries where governments insurers or global payers arent covering hepatitis C treatment We think a  price tag although a discount from US prices is not going to get the job done says   a policy director of Doctors Without Borders Its a discount from a price we think is absolutely outrageous The way we look at it is how much does this drug cost to make and what is patients ability to pay Solvadi can be   Malpani and other critics say perhaps  to  for a week treatment course We know from our experience treating HIV over the past decade and a half that treatment needs to be simple and affordable Malpani says in a Doctors Without Borders   Full hepatitis C treatment needs to be available for no more than  per person For its part Gilead holds out the possibility that the price of a hepatitis C cure could fall below  if Indian generic producers that license Solvadi decide to lower their price on their own because of competition Well be working probably with three to five different companies Gregg Alton of Gilead    We leave it up to the Indian companies to bring the price down should they choose to do that Moreover Alton says the  price point is substantially less than what it currently costs in places such as India to treat hepatitis C with inferior drugs And Solvadi will be more effective less toxic and easier to use and without sideeffects he adds The company hopes to announce voluntary licensing deals in the next couple of months Alton says with market availability in about two years Malpani thinks the California companys hurry to sign licensing agreements with Indian generic drugmakers has a lot to do with a legal challenge filed last November against Gileads patent application for Solvadi known generically as sofosbuvir The nonprofit group IMAK or the Initiative for Medicines Access and Knowledge filed the patent challenge And it   Solvadi as based on old science with a known compound Thus IMAK asserts the drug does not meet Indias stringent requirements for patentability We think theres a strong claim to invalidate any patent case Malpani tells Shots Meanwhile he says voluntary licensure is a way for Gilead to protect itself from patent problems Its completely an end run he says For one thing voluntary licensing agreements can contain a clause barring generic companies from challenging patents And if it turns out that Gileads patent claim fails those genericmakers that arent bound by voluntary licensing agreements could offer Solvadi at whatever price they chose without paying royalties to Gilead Critics are also upset that Gilead reportedly plans to restrict its voluntary licensing agreements to sales in  countries  far fewer than are covered by such agreements for HIV drugs Law professor   at Northeastern University in Boston an adviser to   or Health GAP notes that Gilead allows generic manufacturers to sell its HIV drugs in over  countries So why not a similarly large number of countries for the hepatitis C drug Baker tells Shots An important question to ask is what are their access intentions for countries that have high hepatitis C burdens For instance  percent of people in Egypt are infected with the virus the World Health Organization   while  percent of Chinese have hepatitis C The Solvadi pricing issue is very important in the struggle to ensure access to new medicines for those who need them most and can afford them least Baker says The system is broken now he says Why cant we have a system that ensures that research and development is paid for without needing to recoup those costs through high prices  most of which is not plowed back into RD Brook favors an idea gaining currency among critics called   in which governments support pharmaceutical research and development as public good At the same time drugmakers largely confine themselves to manufacturing marketing and distribution But such a farreaching reform is not likely to happen overnight For the foreseeable future pricing of new drugs such as Solvadi will be hammered out through a complex process of business decisions activist pressures legal claims and the politics of affected countries
