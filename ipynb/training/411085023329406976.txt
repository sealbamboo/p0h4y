The shooting in Newtown Conn last December has left families of the  victims most of them children struggling to heal in different ways Jeremy Richman and Jennifer Hensel are one such family They lost their only child yearold Avielle in the shooting In the year since theyve responded as any parents would Asking why such a tragedy could have happened But they also responded as the two scientists they are They immediately threw themselves into trying to answer the question The foundation theyve started is dedicated to supporting research into the forces that increase a persons risk of violence and aggression As much as they hope their work will help society avoid another tragedy its also helping them to heal and move on from their own loss Even before she was old enough to say it herself Avielle Richman was totally into her name She loved that no one else had it  and decided that everyone and everything else deserved a unique name too She named everything Richman says She named our trees Maeve and Efford And our gargoyles on the house she named Grolig and Galen At home in Sandy Hook Avielles parents are surrounded by their late daughters creativity from the three identical baby blankets she named Pink Blink and Basil to her pet fish Khaihawana Punk The couple laugh just remembering the day Avielle gave the fish its name Perhaps thats a sign of healing  that one year out a memory can bring a laugh But just as often it doesnt In my office theres a great triptych of her smiling and then busting out laughing because her brand new kitten was biting her feet Richman says One minute it just busts me out laughing and then the next minute it just breaks my heart because I miss her so much The anniversary of the shooting and the holidays are relentless reminders to the couple of all they had and so suddenly lost A year ago we were going to go see the Christmas Spectacular at the Radio City Music Hall Hensel says We were talking about going sledding being with family for the holidays Then like  other families they found themselves tormented by the same question Why Why would somebody do this Its unfathomable Why would somebody want to kill my child Hensel says Why would somebody want to kill as many as they possibly could The question was why With his training in neuropsychopharmacology and her background in infectious disease the couple is pushing for more integrated research  examining both nature and nurture  to understand the biochemical and external factors that drive violent behavior To that end Richman and Hensel launched the   shortly after the shooting It is our responsibility to be outraged to take action to ensure this doesnt happen again Richman said at a press conference in Connecticut in January With this foundation it is our hope to honor our beautiful Avielle and others who have fallen to such senseless violence Understanding the underpinnings of violence Richman and Hensel hope will eventually lead to treatment for people with violent tendencies The foundations tagline You   imagine is a nod the couple say to whats possible  and to the need for people to not turn away Everywhere that we went in the beginning people were all like I cant imagine what youre going through I cant imagine  Richman says But they   imagining it Thats the terror theyre feeling when they say those words And we   to imagine it Because otherwise we cant drive change innovation ideas Richman and Hensel dream of advances in brain imaging that might one day enable routine brain checkups much like the way doctors measure blood pressure Theyve been meeting with lawmakers in Connecticut and Washington DC as well as Vice President Joe Biden to lobby for more awareness and training that they say could help identify those prone to violence like the gunman at Sandy Hook and elsewhere The shooters were not in their right minds Richman told one legislative committee earlier this year Upon reflection those who crossed paths with these individuals consistently express the sentiment There was always something not right about that guy  Richman and Hensels work is a means to an end but also they say an end in itself No question We need a reason to get out of bed every day And its not so easy and so obvious to pull out of that despair Richman says And while they feel lucky to have the language and lens of science to help them find answers theyre also quick to concede that there are questions science can never resolve like Why Avielle or What if You just cant go there says Richman Its a circular path into nowhere Spiraling even to a place that doesnt help adds Hensel Its not a place of beauty I can tell you that and its not a place of hope and thats where we have to move forward From California to Colorado and Connecticut local fundraising events have brought in donations from  to tens of thousands for the foundation The pair says the outpouring helps their healing  one example of what they call the bits of beauty theyre constantly looking for as an antidote to their pain Anything that would blanket my brain with something good says Hensel and this foundation does that for me Back home a dog and two cats fill the house as do many pieces of Avielles artwork framed and named like The Life With Stripes and The Life with Polka Dots It Lives In Water Also framed are a few favorite photos of Avielle with her brown curly hair and a spitfire spirit as big as her grin She was very happy and wanted everyone else to be too Richman says Time is supposed to heal but one year later Richman says they miss Avielle even more At some point in every day your breath catches in your throat he says I cry every day Jen does every day No one can bring Avielle back or lessen their grief Their hope now Richman and Hensel say is just to spare another parent the same
