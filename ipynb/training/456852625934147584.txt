Shara Yurkiewicz is a med student Shes doing rounds now moving from department to department Much of what she sees shes seeing for the first time Not yet a doctor there are moments many moments when she has the eyes of a patient She gets scared She feels helpless Shes too involved Shes at that place in her training where everything is so sharp so new she feels the full fresh stab of it and sometimes very privately she bleeds This is one of those moments which with her permission I am reblogging in full from her wonderful online column at   By Shara Yurkiewicz Its okay that you dont remember me My name is Shara and Im part of the surgical team Im checking to see how youre doing after your surgery Do you know where you are right now Actually youre in the hospital You had surgery a few hours ago for a broken hip You used to be able to walk before you broke it so it was important to fix it as soon as it was safe to Were not sure how you broke it either You said you couldnt remember falling or even having much pain Your daughter noticed swelling in your leg a few days ago and brought you here She went home for a bit but shes been here with you the past few days We waited a few days before the surgery to make sure you were medically ready You had some fluid in your lungs when you first arrived so we gave you medications to help get rid of it It probably wasnt related to what you ate or drank You were eating a lot though Youre the only person Ive ever seen with a broken hip with that good of an appetite Do you remember the last thing you ate before your surgery It was a big chocolate chip cookie I was there during the surgery Im still a student so I didnt do much But you can learn a lot from watching Thank you for letting me watch I was there when they wheeled you into the room Your surgical cap was too big for you and it kept falling off We asked you your name and you said it All three names We didnt even ask you for the middle one because we didnt know you had one We then put you to sleep You took deep breaths through an oxygen mask before we turned off your consciousness and paralyzed your body I held your hand as you closed your eyes The nurse whispered to you that everything would be okay We fixed the bone It took a few hours because your bone is fragile There was bleeding but thats normal Bone bleeds a lot We gave you blood and fluids to replace what you lost Did you know that many surgeons play music during operations It was going so smoothly that we were humming along to Who Says You Cant Go Home It was during the bridge of the song that your blood pressure suddenly dropped The anesthesiologist called it out I looked at the monitor and saw numbers flashing in red There was a lot of red actually Blood in the wound blood in the suction container blood in transfusion bags bloody footprints on the floor No more than with any other patient But I think somewhere along the way I learned to take the sight of liters of blood for granted I was scared I stopped watching them stitch and stared at the monitor which suddenly seemed like my closest connection to you They called out the medications they were giving you to raise your blood pressure After a few minutes it worked Your blood pressure slowly climbed to green numbers I was still shaking as I silently willed the numbers to stop bouncing around But the numbers stubbornly drifted down Even though they were keeping up with the fluids Even though you were on medications that force your blood vessels to clamp down and your heart to beat harder The red returned and was unrelenting Your blood pressure was too low your heart rate too high the tracing of your heart rhythm irregular and nonshockable We can be done in ten minutes the surgeons said Ive never seen surgeons work so fast Theyre usually so particular about their stitches getting the perfect angle and length for each one Ive also never seen so many anesthesiologists at the head of an operating table Ive never seen an ICU bed booked so quickly Ive never seen someone lose their carotid pulse Apparently its rare to die on the operating table They almost always get you to the ICU first Twice in eight years said the anesthesiologist Once in fifteen years said the surgeon Once in eighty years for you I couldnt bring myself to touch your hand again I watched though I watched as the room slowly cleared and people tried to figure out what to write and who to call I watched as they kept your eyes shut and handled your body just as gently as they had a few hours ago I listened to the final zip of the body bag I dont know who had the time to switch off the radio but Im glad they did I listened as the nurse asked God to rest your soul I watched you leave in a different kind of bed to a different place Im not sure where You can learn a lot from watching Thank you for letting me watch We fixed your hip sir Scientific American Los Angeles Times Discover The Best Science Writing Online
