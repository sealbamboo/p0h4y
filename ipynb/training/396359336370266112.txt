Although the origin of agriculture transformed our diets farmers also had to toil long hard hours Until recently all of us were athletes   Today most Americans seldom if ever have to do much physical work Cars elevators escalators shopping carts and other laborsaving innovations allow us to exist for days without ever significantly elevating our heart rates or breaking a sweat Few jobs require physical activity and most of us have little inclination to exercise in our spare time  As a result a majority of Americans   the Surgeon Generals   to exercise at least  minutes per week  Being physically inactive is not only abnormal it is also pathological because the old adage use it or lose it is really true Our bodies evolved to require the stresses inherent in physical activity to grow and function properly and our bodies never evolved to cope with persistent inactivity  Moderate exercise is vital for developing a strong and healthy circulatory system durable bones safe from osteoporosis a vigorous immune system a properly functioning brain and more Almost every organ and body system   and is compromised by its absence  No health problem illustrates the benefits of exercise more acutely than heart disease which afflicts more than  million Americans and is our nations   Yet of all the diseases we face heart disease is one of the most preventable and treatable through exercise  Men who are unfit but then improve their fitness lower their rate of death from heart disease by about    Because treating a patient with heart disease costs   extra per year we could save almost  billion a year by getting just  more Americans to exercise moderately Those savings are actually a big underestimate since   physical activity also substantially reduces the prevalence and severity of many other costly diseases including Alzheimers breast cancer and colon cancer To be sure exercise is not a panacea Regular physical activity does not guarantee good health and it has only limited effects on weight loss  Yet even though exercise wont solve the obesity epidemic it confers so many health benefits regardless of ones weight the question we should ask is not whether more Americans should exercise but how can we help them do it   Again the human bodys evolutionary story provides useful answers We evolved to be physically active not because we wanted to but because we were obliged to  Our Stone Age ancestors who struggled to survive had no alternative to being active for many hours a day but they also benefited from taking it easy whenever possible to avoid wasting scarce energy  Even though cars elevators and shopping carts are recent inventions the instincts to use them are ancient and powerful As a result we need motivation to exercise  How can we help each other exercise In the case of children exercise needs to be fun playful and as much a daily priority as brushing ones teeth and getting enough sleep  It also needs to be mandatory Just as we mandate car seats for children and prohibit minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco we need to implement regular meaningful levels of fitnessbased physical activity in school By failing to do so adequately we are robbing millions of children of healthy futures and we are guaranteeing enormous future medical bills What about adults Although adults have the right to be inactive most of us wish otherwise but we require nudges from friends families health care providers businesses and other social institutions including government  On the local level we need communities to promote nonmotorized transportation and to encourage fitness activities like walking cycling jogging and soccer Businesses both large and small need financial incentives to encourage employees to exercise and to build the infrastructure necessary for people to do so safely and conveniently  Doctors health care providers and insurers should be rewarded for helping patients become more active In short promoting fitness has to become a collective responsibility   Can we do this If history is any guide the answer is yes Through collective action over the last  years   as well as the number of Americans who die in motor vehicle accidents  Finally can we afford not to become more active Because of many advances Americans no longer need to be physically active to survive on a daytoday basis but our Stone Age bodies still require exercise to thrive as we age For the sake of our bodies our economy and our country the consequences of inaction are too great to accept
