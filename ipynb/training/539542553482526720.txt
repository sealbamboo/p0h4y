For Nontando Kewana watching a sister die of  was enough Living with a young daughter in the Nyanga township in Cape Town South Africa where nearly  percent of the population is HIV positive Kewana wanted control of her own body her future her life In Nyanga it is generally the men who decide when to have sex and the men who control the use of condoms the main source of   Kewanas sister was infected after her husband slept with other women and did not use a condom So Kewana  joined the vanguard of a new kind of feminism one that is gaining a hold in the   She decided that to protect herself she would help find new technologies meant to give women control over their own bodies and protect themselves from contracting the deadly virus Kewana became a participant in an ongoing study testing whether a leavein vaginal ring could be used as HIV prevention medication Its one of many technologies HIV scientists are developing with hopes of creating preventative medications controlled by and for women In America we think about HIV as we experience it which was primarily in men who have sex with men said Dr Sharon Hillier a professor of Obstetrics Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh whose work has focused on developing tools to help women reduce their risk of contracting HIV Globally weve come to understand the face of the epidemic is young women  The female face of the epidemic has challenged HIV researchers and scientists to start thinking like feminists Its a womenoriented approach Hillier said For Kewana that means going to a Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation clinic once a month to be tested for HIV and to have her vaginal ring changed Kewana found out about the clinic from a friend in  around the same time her older sister died A lot of people were dying outside because of HIV but we arent taking it seriously she said People thought that if they got it HIV maybe they wouldnt be healed but they would still live long but that is dangerous because I saw my sister say shes fine but the following day shes not because of AIDS That is why I came to the clinic Kewana remembers her sister calling her family together to tell them her status She had HIV a long time but never told us Kewana said By the time her sister did she had developed fullblown AIDS and was growing too weak to hide her illness Watching her sister battle the deadly virus until her final days a year later sparked a light inside Kewana  she knew she wanted to make a difference for women like her sister who may not be able to control their status As a trial participant Kewana receives regular checkups and screenings injectable birth control and condoms along with her vaginal ring However Kewana does not know if the ring she has been given consists of antiretroviral medication or a placebo She will not know until the study ends in  Even if I dont have the medicine I dont care Kewana said Heres something that maybe could help me I have a baby to protect and to feed Im a mother so I never want to leave my baby behind Hillier said that innate drive makes women the perfect target for stopping the spread of HIV Women are much more accustomed to getting screenings and checkups for family planning or cervical cancer as opposed to men Hillier said The goal would be to develop longlasting products containing antiretroviral medication that are not necessarily visible to or controlled by men These products would not be limited to a vaginal ring but may also include pills preexposure prophylaxis which has already been FDA approved in the United States or vaginal gels In the past decade most advice for women to protect themselves has been to obtain from sex use condoms or be faithful Hillier said But what we know is that women cant always negotiate condom use so we have to provide them an opportunity to control prevention and put it in the hands of women early on by providing them with a broad range of options that work in their lives The ring study will end next year Kewana said that when the next HIV prevention study starts she would like to be the first to sign up and maybe someday she will be running HIV trials herself I want to work in a clinic she said Maybe there are some people who dont take HIV seriously but its something that kills
