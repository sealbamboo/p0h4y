Our guts are at the height of their glory Most healthconscious humans accept somewhat blindly that our gut bacteria  or the gut microbiome  are key to our overall health and ability to fight disease Thats what fuels the  billion North American probiotics industry and spurs about  companies to search for the next fermented concoction promising to nurture those good bacteria And its a tall order Microbiomes comprise the  billion bacteria that live on our skin and in our mouths noses vaginas and intestines outnumbering our human cells by  to  according to the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project Our gut microbiome rightly gets the most attention There is evidence linking it to diseases such as colitis and inflammatory bowel disease but also to obesity autoimmune diseases like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatoryrelated conditions Still most of us dont understand how it rules our immune system Enter Stanford microbiologist and infectious disease physician David Relman Think of the gut microbiome as a community that for millions of years has taken advantage of the environment weve created for them in our bodies Relman said and that in turn is helping us humans take advantage of our time on Earth Its all about the microbiota adapting to untoward challenges and learning how to protect us and us them For example he said when humans are exposed to arsenic our microbes use their genes and proteins to convert it to something less toxic  or more toxic it can go either way  and we dont know exactly why But we do know that there must be some advantage to the microbiota or they wouldnt do it And the bacteria in our gut have specific jobs said Dr Alejandro Junger author of Clean Gut The Breakthrough Plan for Eliminating the Root Cause of Disease and Revolutionizing Your Health The gut flora train and interact with the neurons in the immune system and give them signals to be alert strong and protective Healthy bacteria aid in detoxification Junger said There also is evidence that bacteria play an important role in the integrity of the intestinal wall which if it becomes hyperpermeable leads to leaky gut syndrome in turn linked to chronic inflammation  because our bodies attack these foreigners that get into our bloodstream  and disease So our quest for a healthy gut environment appears to be wellfounded New York Dr Raphael Kellman talks about how food fits into that in his book The Microbiome Diet Anything that changes the microbiome  for instance our Western diet of unhealthful highly processed food full of chemicals and hormones  can stress the immune system and in turn affect the microbiota he said This is an ancient system that has evolved to be incredibility elastic and is the key to our survival But there is so much we really dont know Some scientists feel that a return to a clean old and healthy microbiome is the secret to modernday health going so far as injecting the feces of Hadza villagers in Africa into their own bowels to try to replicate the richly diverse and buggy bacteria  the Hadza eat the stomachs of their prey  that live there For one specific dire disease  an infection of   that causes severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon  fecal transplant is shockingly successful Relman said These are people who are close to death and current therapies can do nothing But for other lessextreme conditions it doesnt seem to work as well I think the answer is you have to start with a microbial system thats unstable and in great turmoil so that it is receptive to the transplant Otherwise the existing bacteria will fight the bacteria thats introduced and they will win Indeed Relman isnt so sure our quest to return to the gut microbiome of our huntergatherer ancestors is a good idea There would be a huge tradeoff because if we could put those ancient microbiota in our gut wed be in a real jam  we would no longer have all the newly acquired functions life on modern Earth requires us to have The experts agree on a few things I would be happy if people would stop using antibacterial soap said Marlene Zuk a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Minnesota Its very clear that trying to clean everything constantly is not only purposeless it might be downright bad for us Antibiotic overuse also has the sweeping effect of wiping out the good bacteria with the bad Experts suggest limiting antibiotic use and taking a probiotic along with the antibiotic A diverse diet also seems to be key including probiotics and fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut In short think more dirt and more diversity
