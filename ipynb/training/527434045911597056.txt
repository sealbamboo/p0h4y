The president of the World Bank has  in the battle against Ebola invoking their duty under their oath to help patients  But is there such an obligation Medical ethicist Dr Daniel Sokol says we should expect some healthcare staff to refuse to go to work wherever Ebola patients are being treated In all major Ebola outbreaks medical staff have fled health centres leaving dying patients behind This one is no exception   Seeing colleagues succumb to the disease many doctors nurses and laboratory technicians have failed to turn up to work putting even greater pressure on those who remain   If several cases of Ebola emerged in the UK it would be naive to assume that no healthcare worker would refuse to work In  I worked as an intern in clinical ethics at a hospital in Toronto  That was the city most affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars outside Asia with about  people infected   Of those about half were health workers  Posters lined the walls of the hospital hailing the staff as heroes  In reality many of them were stigmatised by the community  Some healthcare staff in Toronto did not turn up to work out of concern for their own welfare and that of their family and some complained that their colleagues in the nearby hospital received danger pay for treating Sars patients when they did not This was one of the foremost hospitals in the world with superb facilities and highly trained staff  The case fatality rate was about    In the current Ebola outbreaks health workers are also affected but in contrast to the Toronto situation the medical infrastructure in the affected African countries is poor and hospitals understaffed  The case fatality rate is about    Staff face a threat of ostracism or violence from a hostile local population  Many workers are paid very little or in some cases have received no pay for months   During the Ebola outbreak in Uganda in  there was mass protest at St Marys Hospital in Lacor   After the deaths of several hospital workers about  staff assembled in front of the hospital threatening to leave   Dr Matthew Lukwiya the hospitals medical superintendent persuaded them to stay  Soon after Dr Lukwiya contracted the disease after caring for an infected nurse without protective goggles and died Given the high risk poor working conditions and stigma attached to caring for Ebola patients it is not surprising that many healthcare workers have fled the hot zones and others are reluctant to join the fray The Hippocratic Oath which dates from the th century BC is silent on the issue of doctors helping people in times of plague and epidemics  Further only a minority of doctors now recite the oath upon qualifying The UKs General Medical Council   that You must not deny treatment to patients because their medical condition may put you at risk   Given the UKs resources Ebola is unlikely to create a high level of risk to health workers  In the affected parts of Africa where even rubber gloves may be in scarce supply the situation is very different In return for the onerous duty imposed by the GMC doctors in Britain expect hospital authorities to provide suitable training equipment and pay   Yet for many of the doctors battling the Ebola outbreak none of these reciprocal duties has been fulfilled Clinicians have a duty of care towards their patients but this duty has limits   There are a number of factors that determine these limits  One is the level of risk to the clinician   Working in illequipped and understaffed hospitals the risk to clinicians may be far higher than in a modern hospital   Another is the likely benefit of turning up to work for the patients  There is no cure for Ebola and some health centres do not have the drugs and equipment so readily available in the Western world   Another factor is the duties to other patients including future patients  Ebola has not stopped people suffering from other diseases and injuries   A doctor who dies or falls ill with Ebola cannot care for patients  There are only about  doctors in Liberia for a population of over  million  The loss of even a single doctor is a public health disaster Finally clinicians may have other moral duties to their family and community  A doctor is not just a doctor but may also be a father son brother carer community leader and so on  Each of those roles will bring moral duties  Should a doctors duty to an Ebola patient trump his duty to his own children There are some acts that go beyond what duty requires  Many clinicians caring for Ebola patients in dreadful conditions despite high risks to themselves are acting beyond the call of duty They deserve praise As for the others who have decided to stay away we should be slow to criticise them without an appreciation of their individual circumstances
