People with a depressive illness are three times more likely to commit a violent or sex crime than those in the general population a study suggests The Department of Psychiatry at Oxford University examined the criminal records of  Swedish people after they were diagnosed with depression Some  of men and  of women had convictions   of men and  of women in the general population did so The researchers say the issue has not been given enough attention by doctors The study which is published in the Lancet looked at convictions for sexual offences and crimes such as murder assault and robbery The findings on people with depression were compared to a sample of  people with no history of depression When the researchers took into account previous histories of violence selfharm psychosis and substance misuse they still found a link between depression and violent crime  although the risk was found to be smaller Lead author Prof Seena Fazel said We wanted to determine whether there was an increased risk of violence in individuals with clinical depression and without other factors which are known to contribute to this risk One important finding was that the vast majority of depressed persons were not convicted of violent crimes and that the rates reported are below those for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and considerably lower than for alcohol or drug abuse There is considerable concern about selfharm and suicide in depression she added We demonstrate that the rates of violent crime are at least as high but they dont receive the same level of attention in clinical guidelines or mainstream clinical practice Marjorie Wallace chief executive of the UK mental health charity Sane also pointed out that it was very rare for people with  depression to commit crime  However she said This study does however show how important it is for professionals not to ignore those strong feelings and make clear people can come to terms with how they feel and recover
