The lowest number of polio cases ever recorded in the world during one year was  And  was on track for an even lower number But this was a year when polio pushed back Hard The virus reappeared in   and Syria It showed up in sewer systems in   It spilled out of Nigeria into Cameroon Pakistan saw a spike in cases Even so global health officials are still confident that polio can be eradicated soon Yes there were disappointments in  says   a spokeswoman with the World Health Organization in Geneva If you look just at the number of cases of course we have a large rise in cases over  to   more than a percent rise in cases Bari says We have eight countries reporting polio as opposed to four last year at this time Polio had hit a historical low in  with only  cases reported worldwide New outbreaks this year in   surpassed that all by themselves So how much of a setback is this to the decadeslong multibilliondollar polio eradication effort I think its a huge setback when your child has been paralyzed for life Bari says When you live in a country like Somalia or Syria where possibly youre in a conflictaffected situation this is the last thing you need This is the last thing any parent needs The outbreaks in Somalia and Syria are unfortunate spillovers Bari says from the three countries where polio transmission has never been stopped Afghanistan Pakistan and Nigeria There was some progress in these places this year The number of cases in both Afghanistan and Nigeria fell significantly Pakistan on the other hand saw things go in the opposite direction In addition militants have made it impossible for vaccinators to immunize children in the tribal areas in the north of the country Despite the overall rise in polio cases this year Bari says theres been progress on several fronts For the first time in history we have only one type of polio All these cases are polio type  And this has never happened before she says We havent seen type  in more than a year now Not to get too technical but there are three strains of the poliovirus each requiring a different vaccine Type  was last seen in  This year   dropped off the map leaving just type  polio for public health officials to contend with Polio eradication is finally within reach says   dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health If you look at where we are its incredible what weve accomplished And were almost there We cannot stop now he says If polio is wiped out it would be only the second human disease ever eradicated The first was smallpox officially eradicated in  We know that at the very end of any campaign like this the last few countries the last few cases are always much much harder than the preceding  or  percent Klag says So far billions of dollars have been spent in the eradication drive The expectation is that it will take   to stomp out the last few cases and ensure that polio doesnt stage a comeback The challenge now is to sustain the political will for such a massive global campaign all the way to the end But not everybody agrees that eradication is worth the cost Last year   a health policy researcher at City University of New York came out with a book called   He calls the whole polio eradication movement a failure driven by the egos of Western health officials  consuming resources that could be better used elsewhere Muraskin argues that the world would be better off trying to contain polio at low levels and focusing on other simpler health challenges Putting money into routine immunization systems thats not attractive he says Thats boring No one is going to get a statue built for strengthening routine immunization systems So far Muraskin is an outlier in a sea of voices pushing to stamp out polio once and for all Polio eradication campaigns however do sap scarce resources in places like Nigeria and Pakistan And if the polio eradication effort drags on indefinitely more critics of the strategy are likely to come forward
