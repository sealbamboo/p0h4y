There are a lot of psychiatric and psychological issues for men who believe theyre not normal says Gordon Muir one of the studys authors Researchers at  with more than  men who underwent penis size measurements by health professionals using a standardized procedure The average mans lengths were  inches flaccid  inches erect the average circumferences were  inches flaccid and  inches erect In a time when men are bombarded with ads for bogus penis enhancers and images of porn star penises its refreshing to see a scientific study assert penile dimensions that are refreshingly normal says   a nationally recognized sex and relationship expert In the world of porn even penises that meet the baseline for normal are often tagged as small so hopefully men who worry about their size will get this corrective message Men may approach a doctor with concerns about their penis size despite their size falling within a normal range People have reallife problems because of this says Muir We see guys get to age  whove never had a relationship before because they believe theyre abnormal and now doctors can tell them theyre normal More than anything Muir says he hopes to dissuade any man who feels inadequate from going under the knife Doctors prey on them for surgeries when they dont need it he says Its a bit like having a size  shoe and wanting a size  You cant make the foot bigger its a very complex set of bones If you try to make the penis bigger you stop it working most of the time Most of them start off with a psychological problem with an average or slightly small penis They have surgery end up  poorer with a deformed penis and a lot more psychological trouble  According to a prominent  study by the University of California titled Penile Length in the Flaccid and Erect States only  of the male population should be considered candidates for penile augmentation Furthermore the most extreme condition referred to in the study as micropenis affects only an estimated  of the male population Comparing ones self or ones attributes against others is a doubleedged sword and may confirm perceived inadequacy write the authors of the latest study It is especially problematic in those with body image problems Some may understand that by definition half the population must be below average in a normal distribution What is not known is if those above the th percentile were more likely to be reassured and satisfied than those below the mean and whether those below th percentile are more likely to remain anxious or dissatisfied  Correlations between penile dimensions and other bodily measurements such as weight finger length or foot size were shown to be inconsistent or weak except for the slight but significant correlation between penis length and height  If one thinks about it generally speaking tall people have larger hands hearts jaws  and this is a reflection of that says Muir But were talking millimeters of difference not centimeters or inches It was also refreshing to see in this study that many of the ethnic and cultural stereotypes around penis size  for example that Black men have larger penises and Asian men have smaller ones  were not supported says Kerner Its those sorts of messages that get internalized and affect sexual selfesteem Previous studies that have asked about the importance of penis size have shown its a much less important issue for woman than it is for men In a    of women said they were satisfied with their partners penis size while just  of men said they were satisfied with their own penis size The average vagina is just three to four inches deep so most guys are doing just fine with their average dimensions says Kerner In my experience as a sex therapist when size matters its generally because a guys penis is too large rather than too small and that can lead to painful sex  Regardless of size most intercourse positions fail to directly stimulate the clitoris the epicenter of the female orgasm says Kerner Men who care about their female partners sexual satisfaction should worry less about their penile dimensions and more about getting cliterate The most recent studys authors acknowledge that some of the volunteers may have taken part because they were more confident with their penis size than the general male population Confidence to take part in size measurements may bias the measures to the larger end of the distribution they write Equally there may be a bias towards the smaller end of the distribution if the full stage of genital development had not been reached in some men under  years old as some participants were
