Forty extra nurses are to be appointed after a review of staffing levels at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast The additional jobs will be in the accident and emergency AE department and the acute medical unit AMU Eighteen of the nurses are already in post and the remaining  are expected to start over the next few weeks A further four will be appointed soon The health minister announced the posts as he updated the assembly on of a review into AE care at the hospital The review was ordered after a  at the RVHs AE department in January At one stage during the incident  people were waiting on trolleys and staff described the situation as horrendous An investigation is also under way into five deaths in which delays in treating the patients may have been a contributory factor in their deaths However the BBC understands that figure could rise after another family was contacted a day after the BBC reported that an elderly woman had died at the hospitals emergency department last month where a delay in treating her could also have been a contributory factor  The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority RQIA review is due to report in April It is also working on a wider review of accident and emergency care in Belfast and the rest of Northern  Ireland The minister Edwin Poots said the new nursing jobs   in AE and  in AMU  was one of a number of steps the Belfast Trust had already taken to improve services ahead of the report In a written statement he said It is important that the public is aware of this work and action already taken so that it can have confidence in the services being provided in our emergency departments and across health and social services more generally Mr Poots said there were no easy solutions to the problems and added I am under no illusion that it will take time to make a difference  I dont expect change to happen overnight  but I do expect progress to be made  It is clear that there has been progress to an extent but much more needs to be done and we need to maintain the momentum that has been built The chair of the assembly health committee Sinn Fins Maeve McLaughlin welcomed the measures but said more needed to be done to restore public confidence in the health system The announcement by the minister of health Edwin Poots of a number of measures to offset the pressures currently faced by the AE department in the RVH is to be welcomed They are long overdue she said However the minister still has a huge hill to climb in terms of restoring public confidence in the health system A public sector union spokesman said the announcement of more nurses was too little too late Ray Rafferty of Unison who works in the RVH told   programme This is something weve been highlighting for  months I think the minister needs to own up here and say that he has let the service run down that there is a shortage of beds and its more than just a question of supplying  nurses to resolve the problem The Commissioner for Older People Claire Keatinge said elderly people in Northern Ireland had become fearful of going to emergency departments Ive been very concerned about the treatment of elderly people right across accident and emergency departments right across Northern Ireland she said Too often we hear of elderly people who are left on trolleys far too long who dont think they have received dignified treatment She added that she had asked the minister for an assessment to be carried out on elderly patients experience of AEs across Northern Ireland but had yet to receive a reply Maeve Hully of the Patient and Client Council welcomed the additional nurses but said Its just not about fixing emergency departments The whole system needs to be reviewed When you have people coming in the front door you need to make sure the support is there to get people discharged back into the community and the community services are there You will always have a backlog in emergency departments if people arent able to be discharged at the other end Garrett Martin deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland said We very much welcome the ministers statement and see it as recognition that the minister is now listening However these staff cant just walk on to the departments and wards and function to the level that you require particularly in a specialist area like an emergency department It takes time to train and develop and orientate staff to an area where you need specialists Mr Poots also claimed there had been a dramatic reduction in the number of patients across Northern Ireland who had waited more than  hours for treatment Whilst clearly there remains much to be done we have seen improvement in the number of hour breaches he said  Regionally there has been a significant reduction in the number of patients who have waited longer than  hours  from September  to January   patients waited longer than  hours compared to  during the same period last year a reduction of     Mr Poots also told the assembly that a major summit on emergency medicine would be held in Northern Ireland on  April The College of Emergency Medicine conference will bring together policymakers key leaders in health and social care as well as staff who work on the front line and senior colleagues from across the UK to take a whole system look at our unscheduled care
