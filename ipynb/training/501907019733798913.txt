Mental health services for young people in England are stuck in the dark ages and not fit for purpose according to a government minister Norman Lamb told BBC News he was determined to modernise the provision of psychiatric help for children The care and support minister is launching a task force to look into how to improve services One task force member said that ultimately money will have to be spent The problems in childrens mental health services have been catalogued in a series of investigations by BBC News and the online journal Community Care Mr Lamb told BBC News I dont think that childrens mental health services the way theyre organised the way theyre commissioned are fit for purpose Im determined that we modernise services for children who have mental health problems  In many respects the way services are organised is stuck in the dark ages and it needs to be brought into the modern age The task force he has set up will look at how to improve the way childrens mental health services are organised and commissioned how to make better use of voluntary and charitable groups and how to make it easier for young people to access help online   Crucially I want young people to be involved Mr Lamb added The group will publish its findings next spring The minister was talking as he visited a purposebuilt childrens mental health unit in Colchester The St Aubyn Centre has  intensive care beds  general psychiatric beds and a suite to admit young people with mental health illnesses have been detained by police   The facility built two years ago at a cost of m is exactly the sort of facility the NHS should be providing according to Mr Lamb But even here staff talk of the pressures on the system   In childrens mental health we usually have to make not the best but the least worse decision said one official   Two of the patients in the centre have come from Cornwall It has also admitted patients from Newcastle and Somerset in recent weeks Touring the facility alongside the minister was Jonny Benjamin   The yearold came to prominence earlier this year when he launched the FindMike campaign an attempt to trace the man whod talked him out of a suicide attempt   Mr Benjamin will be a member of the task force and says he knows from firsthand experience the merits of good mental healthcare at a young age  If Id got the support I needed  years ago I dont think Id be in the position Im in today   I believe I would have been able to manage my mental health I would have been diagnosed with schizophrenia much earlier and that would have had a much more positive impact on my life The task force will be cochaired by officials from the Department of Health and NHS England   NHS England recommended that Clinical Commissioning Groups cut funding for mental health services this year by  more than for physical health    One in  children and young people aged five to  suffers from a mental health condition but just  of NHS funding is spent on services   Sarah Brennan chief executive of Young Minds who will also sit on the task force said We cant have discussions about provision of services without talking about resources  Ultimately theyre the NHS are going to have to spend some money
