                  In fact we talked to readers who knocked off   even  pounds with some surprisingly simple tweaks Borrow their tricks I used to eat out at restaurants up to nine times a week By cutting back to just once a week and ordering a grilled chicken salad instead of a large bowl of pasta Ive lost  pounds in one month  I reached my goal weight after I stopped routinely buying snacks at the grocery store If I wanted a bag of chips or a candy bar I had to walk to the store to get it That inconvenience usually made me ignore my cravings  I used to skip breakfast but now I never go without I always eat about  calories of a healthy mix of protein and whole grains My goto meal a sandwich with natural peanut butter and apple butter It   so I snack less throughout the day In a little over a year Ive shed  pounds  I try to fit in small bouts of exercise whenever possible like doing jumping jacks or crunches during television commercials or dancing while washing dishes This burns extra calories and keeps me from mindlessly munching in front of the TV Now my clothes fit way better and Im    I quit smoking and right away joined a gym and started working out with a personal trainer There was no way I could exercise and feel healthy if I kept lighting up Ive already dropped  pounds in three months  I totally cleaned out my pantry Once I replaced the foods I used to overindulge in like ice cream with lowercal snacks such as roasted sunflower seeds or Special K Chocolatey Delight cereal I began making better choices automatically Now Im slimmer than I was before I had my two kids  After work my colleagues and I always grabbed dinnerand it was usually deepfried Then we changed things up Instead of nights out we started walking and running around a local track A year later Im down  pounds  I loaded my iPod with jams that make me look forward to going to the gym They energize me allowing me to pick up speed on the ellipticaland because I want to hear my entire playlist my workouts are longer now Two months later Im down  pounds and have killer legs  By adding vegetables to the foods I lovelike eating pizza topped with arugula and green peppers instead of pepperoniI became so full so quickly that I no longer had room to eat things like chips or superrich desserts I said goodbye to four dress sizes
