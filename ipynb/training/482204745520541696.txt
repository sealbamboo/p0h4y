The idea took shape as Dr Shawn Barnes a psychiatry resident at the University of California San Diego watched some hospitalized older patients struggling with consent forms It wasnt because they didnt understand the forms or questioned the treatments they were about to undergo They had difficulty signing the forms because they had trouble seeing Dr Barnes said People had donated books for recuperating patients to read in the hospital but poor eyesight often put those offlimits too The geriatric psychiatry unit kept a few pairs of handmedown reading glasses in a drawer but not enough I looked into it and found out they were incredibly cheap Dr Barnes said You can buy them online for a buck a pair Hence his call in an article published in the American Journal of Alzheimers Disease and Other Dementias for facilities that treat older adults   the kind drugstores sell File under Simple Inexpensive Ideas That Could Pay Off As Dr Barnes and coauthor Daniel D Sewell point out presbyopia  the eyes inability to focus on nearby objects as the lens stiffens  becomes nearly universal at older ages But the lenses that correct it dont require exams and prescriptions you can pretty much predict what strength someone needs by age For older people several studies have shown visual impairment in a hospital or nursing home is linked to cognitive decline and delirium In a large study of elderly MexicanAmericans in five Southwestern states for example those with uncorrected presbyopia   Problems with distance vision didnt show the same correlation The unfamiliarity disrupted routines lack of sleep and new medications added during hospitalization are dangerous to frail elders Not being able to see adds to the general confusion Dr Barnes said Where am I What is this room Things can escalate from there to agitation or belligerence Dr Barnes added Sometimes older patients simply forget to take their reading glasses when an ambulance or a relative brings them to a hospital Those with dementia may have lost their glasses or never had any because they cant explain that they cant see Providing reading glasses wont solve all visionrelated problems in hospitals of course Many older patients need prescription lenses To help keep elders oriented and   family members should always bring their eyeglasses hearing aids dentures and walkers to the hospital along with family photos and other familiar objects But at  cents or so per pair  less than a plastic bedpan or a pair of nonskid socks  there should be a stock of these like other hospital supplies Dr Barnes said They could be borrowed and returned or just given away The San Diego Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance recently donated more than  pairs of reading glasses to the geropsychiatry unit at the University of California San Diego Medical Center he reported Bravo And perhaps while were waiting through the oftenpokey pace of change at hospitals other advocacy and charitable groups will step up And then theres Dr Barness next idea for augmenting supplies for the hospitalized elderly comfortable earplugs so patients can get a nights sleep even with the beeping and alarms going off and people coming in to talk to the person in the next bed They might cost even less than reading glasses
