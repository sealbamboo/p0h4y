Lopez pictured herself as a smaller person  someone who was able to go shopping and buy the cute clothes she saw on the thrift store hangers The mental image pushed her to do the beach stairs again despite the rising temperature  Lopez and her siblings lived primarily with their grandmother when they were young Once a month Grammita bought groceries with money from her pension and Social Security check The first of the month I would chow down Lopez remembers because by the end of the month we would be barely having anything Growing up poor living off rice and beans  if we were lucky  had a big impact on our eating habits says Lopezs younger sister Francine Hernandez No one ever told Regina and I to eat your vegetables   Lopez used to steal cookies out of her cousins cupboards when she went to visit them As the sisters got older they started playing outside less and drinking more They took money they earned working to splurge on the dollar menu at McDonalds  I developed an addiction to eating junk Lopez says simply  These bad habits carried into adulthood Lopez ordered fast food for lunch every day with her coworkers She never exercised and hated vegetables  Once in a while she attempted to lose weight sometimes dropping  or  pounds But something always made her sabotage her efforts She figured her obesity was hereditary  her aunts were all short chubby little ladies with big boobs And thats what I was  Creative by nature Lopez expressed her growing unhappiness in journals Shed draw photos of a fat woman crying with word bubbles that said things such as Im huge and I hate myself  What she hated most was shopping for clothes She longed to buy the cute outfits she saw at swap meets or in stores but could only fit into what she calls the Golden Girltype dresses sold in her size  At  feet  inches Lopez weighed  pounds   Lopez talked with her Art Supply Warehouse coworker Sarah Nelson often about losing weight In November  Nelsons mother underwent heart valve replacement surgery It was the wakeup call Nelson needed to change her eating and exercise habits  The friends decided to start an office weightloss competition Lopez was embarrassed stepping up to the scale for the first time in May   No one wants to show that they weigh  pounds in front of guys  but the number that flashed on the scale simply reinforced her commitment  She and Nelson began walking on their minute breaks and sharing healthy recipes they found online Lopez also used the Lose It app to track her calorie intake She exercised six days a week walking on the beach for four miles or running the stairs  It was hardest at social gatherings with her friends theyd be drinking beer and eating burgers while Lopez tried to stick with skinless chicken breasts and vegetables  My friends still love to have parties she says Im kind of like an old lady I come home work out eat dinner watch Golden Girls and go to sleep  By the end of the challenge Lopez had lost  pounds She had also lost the competition  the winner beat her by losing just  more of his body weight  I totally cried she remembers with a laugh I wasnt trying to be a sore loser but I think I worked my butt off  Before that fateful day Lopez swore to Nelson she would celebrate the end of the competition with a large cheesy pizza I never got that pizza When Lopez showed up at her familys annual Thanksgiving dinner in  she was wearing jeans for the first time in years She was also wearing a top that was way too big for her says Hernandez her sister  Lopez went shopping a few months later and called her sister to tell her the good news She now fit into a small shirt size I said Regina I told you You are tiny  Hernandez recalls It took me forever to get used to seeing Regina so small  Since May  Lopez has lost  pounds She currently weighs  pounds  just two pounds short of her goal weight She still walks or runs or climbs stairs six days a week And on Saturdays she treasure hunts at the swap meet browsing through the  clothing tables  I literally always dreamed about buying clothes and feeling good because they fit she says Now its my reality Its an amazing feeling Nelson who has also lost close to  pounds says Regina has always been beautiful inside and out But now her health is better than ever She looks wonderful
