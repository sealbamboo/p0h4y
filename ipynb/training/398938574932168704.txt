I threw out my back in September playing squash and went to the doctor She sent me down the hall for Xrays I may need more of them So Im curious how much does an Xray cost It sounds like a simple question In most places its impossible to find out but I live in Massachusetts where a   says insurers must be able to tell members in advance how much a test treatment or surgical procedure will cost So I call my insurer Blue Cross The recorded menu option doesnt mention health care prices so I press zero for all other inquiries Eventually I connect with a company rep named Jamie and I explain that Id like to compare the price of lower back Xrays at a few facilities She starts in with the questions Whats the doctors name Where do I want to have the Xray done I have the doctors name and a facility in mind but then Im stuck Blue Cross wants the procedure codes for each Xray I may need my doctors national ID number and the name address and ID number for my hospital or lab Why So the insurer can consolidate all the charges into one estimate Jamie directs me to a form online I call my doctor and get the info If I want to compare prices Ill have to fill out separate forms for each Xray lab Then Blue Cross has  hours to get me an estimate It takes me  minutes to fill out the form so I only fill out one This doesnt feel very much like shopping The point of this new requirement is to help patients make smarter choices right That way patients can start behaving more like savvy consumers Insurers arent thinking that way They all sound a little overwhelmed by trying to put a price tag on medical care The challenge is really about trying to make this information personalized and useful says Derek Abruzzese a vice president at   Unfortunately health care is very complex and so its difficult to make things simple straightforward and precise So many things can change when patients go in for treatment explains   director of member decision support at Blue Cross You know they needed an extra lab an extra MRI or some sort of diagnostic that neither we nor the member  nor the provider for that matter  could have foreseen at the time that estimate was requested he explains Insurers also worry about getting the price right because the new state law puts insurers on the hook if they are wrong If we show an estimate that is lower and someone goes and pays more then we are liable says Sue Amsel who is working on a shopping tool that insurer   is developing She shows me a demo that ends up revealing that the range of costs for a brain MRI is between  and  Amsel says that kind of range is not unusual which is one reason its important for people to know how much health costs We know that people are frustrated she says They go to the doctor not knowing They come back with a big bill that they didnt expect they werent able to plan for it and they werent able to prepare for it So I think this will help them quite a bit Harvard Pilgrim will spell out whats included and whats not in its estimate I went back and forth several times with my insurer Blue Cross and then it took two days to find out my Xray would cost  So we can find out in advance how much everything from a blood test to open heart surgery costs But in these early days at least it isnt quick or easy
