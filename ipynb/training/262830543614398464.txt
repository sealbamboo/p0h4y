Bill Sneddon had a feeling he was in trouble when his doctor called with his latest test results I just had a premonition that somethings not right said Sneddon  of Ocean Township NJ And sure enough Sneddons instincts were right He had prostate cancer Well its an eyeopener you know I didnt know if I had to buy a yard sale sign you know he said Its a shocking thing  It always happens to someone else After getting over the shock Sneddon a retired police chief quickly started investigating his options including surgery and radiation The next day a golfing buddy told him about a new kind of radiation treatment for prostate cancer He told me that I should look into proton therapy And Ive known him a long time so when he told me this is a treatment I should get I knew this is a treatment I better get Sneddon says So Sneddon was excited when he discovered that the   had recently opened in Somerset NJ about an hour and a half away from his house Its like coming to a health club or a fivestar hotel Sneddon said recently as he waited for the next round of his nine weeks of treatment Sneddon looked more like he was at his country club than in the waiting room of a cancer clinic The lobby has big windows high ceilings a rock wall surrounding a blazing fireplace Relaxing music was playing But beyond the comfortable atmosphere what really draws patients like Sneddon to proton therapy is how it works Its sort of like the difference between using a bullet which passes through a person and like a smart bomb that enters into a certain position deposits its energy and then releases its radiation to that location says   a radiation oncologist at ProCure whos treating Sneddon Because proton therapy can be targeted much more precisely it should minimize any damage to sensitive nerves and tissue around the prostate The hope is that it translates into far fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence But proton therapy has become the center of an intense debate Critics say its an example of a big problem with the US health system Doctors start using expensive new treatments before anyone knows whether they work whether theyre safe and whether theyre worth the extra money Theres a concerning trend of us building new and expensive new technology and using it for a common cancer like prostate without proving really that its equivalent to the existing technology said   of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill New treatments can  even though theyre promising  can potentially not be better and can even be worse Chen said I think we have to do careful studies before we adopt new treatments The ProCure clinic is the newest of  proton centers around the country and there are perhaps  more on the way That has many experts worried Theres no convincing evidence that its better The jury really is out on this new technology says   a radiation oncologist at Harvard Medical School It might be better I feel its probably the same It might even be worse And Zietman cant help but worry about how much it costs at least  for each patient which is about double the price tag for regular radiation Heres why Those huge proton machines are incredibly expensive They cost between  million and  million to build Theres almost no other medical device  that I can think of that comes close to a proton treatment facility Zietman said Doctors developed proton therapy for tumors in really sensitive places such as in the eye on the spine or in a childs brain But then Medicare started paying for it for prostate tumors  so more proton centers started promoting it for that Any institution that forks out that kind of money and makes that kind of investment is obviously going to want to recoup that investment fairly rapidly Zietman said And new proton centers started opening up All this means that the health care system is suddenly paying a lot more to treat prostate cancer with a therapy that so far doesnt look significantly more effective than other options  and may be worse In fact Chen   the results of a study over the summer that suggested proton therapy might cause more side effects such as bleeding from the bowel pain and severe diarrhea Unfortunately this is like driving a Ferrari to the grocery store and asking your nextdoor neighbor to pay for the Ferrari said   of the Prostate Cancer Treatment Center in Seattle Now proton therapy has lots of fans In fact doctors are presenting new studies at the  s annual meeting in Boston this week that they say show how well it works They say data from thousands of men provide powerful evidence that the therapy is effective and safe If cost were the same there would be no debate about providing less radiation to a patient which is always better said Leonard Arzt of the   While the debate continues men like Bill Sneddon are lining up to get it After changing into a hospital gown Sneddon walked into a sleek new treatment room Its very scifilooking No antiseptic smells Sneddon climbed onto a motorized platform and lay down in front of a big nozzle that was sticking out of the wall The nozzle is the business end of a gigantic machine down the hall a ton gizmo that was shipped over from Belgium That huge linear accelerator shoots out the proton beams Glowing red laser lights crisscrossed Sneddons body The technicians use the lasers Xrays and three little gold pellets that Tsai injected around Sneddons prostate gland to make sure hes positioned just right The key is to make sure the proton beam zaps his prostate gland and hopefully nothing else Theres absolutely no sound thats emitted from the proton machine Theres no sensation on the skin to indicate that the treatment is being received Sneddon said during the treatment In less than a minute he was done Ive had a couple days where I very easily could have fallen asleep through the whole procedure said Sneddon who so far said he feels great with no signs of any side effects Sneddon figures its the insurance companies who are behind all the questions about proton therapy Medicare and his private insurance are covering his bills  he doesnt even know how much it costs So hes even urging a friend who just found out he has prostate cancer to check out ProCure In the meantime a big carefully designed study is just getting going to try to settle the issue But the results wont be ready for years
