Rise and shine. Another busy day is on the way. As always, we are hustling to maintain order on the Pharmalot campus, where the mascots are busy fertilizing the grounds and the shortest of short people must be hustled off to summertime fun. As for us, well, you know, we have the usual line-up of things to do, starting with a cup or three of stimulation. Feel free to join us, but by all means, check with your doctor first if you have reservations. Meanwhile, here are the tidbits. Have a great day and keep in touch…. Meanwhile, one of Allergan’s top shareholders has sold nearly all of its shares, leaving the Botox maker without the support of a large and long-term investor as it tries to stave off a $53 billion hostile takeover; Doctors checking a soon-to-be-unveiled federal website that will publicly list drug company payments are encountering error messages if they have not accepted industry money, and officials in Delaware, the legal home of choice for most Fortune 500 companies, are concerned that corporate desertions could threaten the $1 billion in revenue the state draws each year from corporate franchise taxes and fees.
