It is probably not surprising the airplane bringing us into Conakry was nearly empty as are all the hotels here Not many people in the United States have ever visited Guinea or could even identify where it sits in West Africa It is already one of the worlds poorest countries and the panic around Ebola is only making that worse  Some of it is justified Thats because this time the outbreak is different In the past Ebola rarely made it out of the remote forested areas of Africa  Key to that is a grim version of good newsbad news because Ebola tends to incapacitate its victims and kill them quickly they rarely have a chance to travel and spread the disease beyond their small villages Now however Ebola is in Conakry the capital city with  million residents Equally concerning its just a short distance from where we touched down at an international airport  It has gone viral and now the hope is that it doesnt go global  When I asked doctors on the ground about that scenario they had split opinions Several told me the concern is real but unlikely Most patients with Ebola come from small villages in the forest and are unlikely to be flying on international trips they told me Furthermore they dont think Ebola would spread widely in a western country our medical expertise and our culture  not touching the dead  would prevent it  Others arent so sure  No one wants to test that theory  With Ebola there is an incubation period of two to  days Remember these numbers This is the range of time it takes to develop symptoms after someone has been exposed   With an international airport close by that means you could be on the other side of the world before you develop the headache fever fatigue and joint pain which make up the early symptoms of an Ebola infection The diarrhea rash and bleeding come later Hiccups is a particularly grave sign with Ebola It means your diaphragm which allows you to breathe is starting to get irritated There is a lot we know about Ebola and it scares us almost as much as what we dont know We do know Ebola a simple virus with a small genome is a swift effective and bloody killer The mortality rate is higher than  and in some outbreaks reaches   Ebola appears to kill in a clever way Early on it strategically disarms your immune system allowing the virus to replicate unchecked until it invades organs all over your body It convinces your blood to clot in overdrive but only inside your blood vessels While those blood vessels choke up the rest of your body starts to ooze because the clotting mechanisms are all busy  You start to hemorrhage on the outside of your body  Nose bleeds bruising even a simple needle stick will refuse to clot But it is the bleeding you dont see  the bleeding on the inside  that causes even more catastrophic problems  Many patients die of shock within an average of  days It sounds like the stuff of horror movies But despite the real danger Ebola is not at all easy to catch If it were my wife would have refused to let me come in the midst of an outbreak  To become infected you generally need to spend extended time with someone who is gravely ill and come into contact with his or her infected body fluids Thats why family members and health care workers are the most likely to get sick  Over the last three weeks at least  people have died including  health care workers With some infections you can shed and spread the virus long before you get ill Thats not the case with Ebola Its only after you are sick and feverish do you become contagious However it only takes a miniscule amount to infect and kill  A microscopic droplet of blood or saliva on your bare hand could enter through a break in your skin And whether you realize it or not we all have breaks in our skin  Since I was a kid I have been fascinated with outbreaks I learned in medical school that new pathogens generally make a jump from animals to humans a process called zoonosis  This is happening in areas where human and animals come into continuous contact David Quammen refers to it as Spillover in his book of the same name A stew of ducks geese chickens pigs and humans in southeast Asia led to the spillover of avian flu HN Contact between pigs and humans in Mexico led to swine flu HN pigs and fruit bats were the recipe for Nipah fever in Malaysia   The best guess is that fruit bats may be a natural reservoir for the Ebola virus too but this has not been confirmed Quammen makes the point Ebola didnt enter our world  we entered its world Pathogens can be predators like lions tigers and bears A virus may not plan the way a big cat does but in a sense it stalks its prey  waiting for the moment of opportunity then attacking with fury Because it can lie silent for years its also easy to see Ebola as a killing ghost like Jack the Ripper   Presumably outbreaks begin through some humananimal contact but since that contact is ongoing we dont know what it is that leads Ebola to rear its ugly head We dont know how to treat the illness or vaccinate against it We certainly dont know how to cure it  I thought about all of this as I left that woman in the airport and I have thought about her a great deal since then Her grief made an impression on all of us  It also made this mysterious exotic virus the world knows but doesnt fully understand so much more real and frightening For the next  days the outer range of the incubation period the woman we saw will be monitored for a fever or any early signs she may have contracted Ebola from her husband If she exhibits symptoms she will be isolated and treated with fluids oxygen and nutrition  That is all that can really be offered Again there is no cure for Ebola For her neighbors in Guinea and across its border another critical number is   as in  days or two incubation periods If the health care teams here dont see any new cases during that time then they officially say the outbreak is over We are not there yet not even close The clock is ticking
