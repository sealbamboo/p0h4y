In the three years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law it has survived more than  votes in Congress to defund or repeal it a Supreme Court challenge a presidential election and as of Tuesday morning a government shutdown Much of the spending for the law is mandatory and wont be cut off But now it must survive its own implementation Tuesday is the day that Obamacare goes operational Americans can begin signing up for health insurance on online marketplaces known as exchanges And that begins a new chapter in the nearly fiveyearold political battle over Obamacare says GOP pollster Bill McInturff What happens today is were going to move from this policy debate about Obamacare to a reality outcome debate What impact does it have on millions and millions of Americans and do they judge it to be good or bad McInturff says And I believe attitudes will shift based on that reality of the outcome of Obamacare The president is confident that attitudes will shift in his direction Like the   story    Obamacares chief antagonist in Congress  Obama is certain that when Americans try it they will like it Thats whats going to happen with the Affordable Care Act the president has said And once its working really well I guarantee you they will not call it Obamacare But Obamacare  as it will be called for the foreseeable future  has already exacted a stiff political price from the president Opposition to the health care overhaul fueled the rise of the Tea Party which led to the Democrats historic loss of their House majority in  But Republicans paid a political price too Their efforts to repeal the law in  failed and Democrats held on to the White House and the Senate Through it all public opinion has been consistent  consistently negative about the law even if voters dont want it defunded Health care historian Jonathan Oberlander says thats why hes not sure even a flawless rollout will change perceptions This is not a program like Medicare or Social Security it is a program that really is a series of policies and regulations and subsidies he says And that makes it difficult to explain to the uninsured what the benefits are and I dont think its going to be easy for Obamacare regardless of how well or not it does in the next year to overcome that chasm Both parties think the law helps them politically Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says Republicans have overreached by staking everything on stopping the law The Republicans have made the debate about Obamacare a debate about them and their tactics and their wanting to repeal it totally Garin says rather than a debate about Democrats or whether Obamacare is a good or a bad thing But Republican economist Douglas HoltzEakin says there are good reasons the GOP has planted its flag on Obamacare Ive had many people come up to me and say Why do Republicans do this And I say well the polling tells them to he says It continues to be the single thing that moves independents So you get the famous swing voters Nothing generates more political animation than Obamacare so if you look at intensity and turnout it still works Republicans see independent voters as the key to their two goals in  regaining control of the Senate and expanding their majority in the House And theres also another dynamic motivating Republicans Many feel this is their last chance to stop the law If we dont do it now in all likelihood Obamacare will never ever be repealed Cruz said recently on Fox News Why is that Their plan is to get the American people addicted to the sugar addicted to the subsidies Surrender is unthinkable for either side in this fight Thats because the health care debate reflects the deepest divide in American politics the core beliefs of the two parties about the role of government That debate is  for now  at a standoff We ask very simple questions says McInturff the GOP pollster  Do you think the government should do more or less And thats a  proposition right now in the country And its been that way for about a decade And guess what if youve got a country thats poised at  about whether government should do more or less and we have a health care issue that is absolutely wrapped around that question its not surprising that its led to this sort of paralysis that has made this a very contentious issue for cycle after cycle Obamacare is not only the law of the land Its also as of Tuesday a practical reality for millions of Americans But as a political issue its far from settled  and wont be anytime soon
