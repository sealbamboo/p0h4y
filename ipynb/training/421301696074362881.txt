Medical marijuana advocates briefed on Cuomos plan earlier this week said an executive action would allow certain hospitals to dispense the drug to certain patients The governors office did not return calls seeking comment  State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried a Democrat from Manhattan and a leading proponent of comprehensive legislation for medical marijuana said he learned about the executive action in a conversation Saturday with members of the governors staff He said the move paved the way for a limited and cumbersome program but called it a step forward Other New Yorkers welcomed the news Missy Miller of Long Island said she considered moving to California to gain access to a special strain of marijuana called charlottes web oil a derivative that may help cease her son Olivers seizures Oliver  had a stroke in utero that resulted in a brain stem injury  Among several other lifethreatening consequences are seizures sometimes more than a dozen a day Its scary every day she said Every seizure that he has I get anxious every seizure I worry is this going to be the seizure that doesnt stop  Miller has hoped for comprehensive legislation that would specify the sources and strains of the drug available Access is a huge question mark she said adding that while other states have legalized marijuana they do not have the strain that will help these children Miller said that while Cuomos announcement is a huge step and a step in the right direction and were applauding it it isnt enough It needs to include access and coverage to the people that need it all the people that need it An opponent of the governors action said it was driven by politics  I think serious questions can be raised about using a political vehicle to achieve the use of a prescribable medication in America said William Foster president of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Medical marijuana is not unprecedented in the United States Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form  among them Colorado where as of January  its legal to sell marijuana to those  or older  according to information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures In addition Maryland has a limited program for research The momentum has picked up recently with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade Among the states that allow medical marijuana are Connecticut Vermont and New Jersey each of which border New York And yet the Empire State has not joined them Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly only to stall in the Senate Cuomo is acting without the legislatures OK though what hes doing is legal according to Gottfried He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in  in setting the stage for a highly regulated system thats less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide Heres how it would work according to Gottfried Under Cuomos directive the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking the hospitals that would participate These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide on a personbyperson basis which patients qualify for medical marijuana It has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana  or the elements of it that might be dispensed  will come from including who might produce it Gottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete farreaching program Cuomo can take this step without the need for further legislation the Manhattan legislator said But to have a truly comprehensive and wellworking system will take legislation
