Last year the federal government made accessibility standards at playgrounds mandatory under the Americans with Disabilities Act so that children with disabilities can more easily play alongside typical kids But whether children with disabilities are able to enjoy their new civil rights to play may depend on where they live and the design decisions their cities and towns made when they built local playgrounds For yearold Emmanuel Soto who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair the local playgrounds design doesnt work On a recent afternoon his parents Teresa and Juan Soto walk with Emmanuel to a play area near their home in Richmond Calif As they arrive the boy is excited to get there But the wheelchair he uses gets stuck on the playgrounds floor The surface is made of a type of loose wood fill that is in compliance with the new laws Emmanuel however really cant move So his father lifts him out of his wheelchair and places him on a slide Its a scene the family has played out before Teresa Soto fights back tears remembering that when Emmanuel was  years old he quickly figured out that he couldnt play with the other children here He told me Mommy Im not able to play with the kids Lets go  she recalls I said Why You wanted to come here He said no lets go Mommy  In fact theres not much that Emmanuel can do by himself at this playground There are no ramps to take him onto the play structure just a transfer system which is made of a series of platforms and shallow steps A transfer system basically requires me if Im a child who uses a wheelchair to wheel up alongside of it drag myself out of the wheelchair and transfer onto a platform says accessibility consultant John McGovern and then ascend until I get to the fun part of the playground that I can use Its a pretty exhausting process McGovern says and not a lot of kids with physical disabilities can do it McGovern represented public parks and recreation departments on a federal regulatory negotiation committee The body helped draft accessible playground requirements that went into effect in March  He and others close to the process tell NPR that the committee made some compromises based on cost One of them was allowing those troublesome loose surfaces as an alternative to better but more expensive smooth surfaces Another one was not requiring ramps on smaller playgrounds Still McGovern says hes glad the regulations moved from voluntary guidelines to requirements under the nations civil rights laws To me this is no different than a public parks and recreation professional standing out in front of a recreation center and saying we dont allow women in here or we dont allow Hispanics in here Its exactly the same concept Richmond Parks and Landscaping Superintendent Chris Chamberlain says the city is technically in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act  at most of its playgrounds and overall Many city playgrounds like the one in the neighborhood where the Soto family lives have those loose wood fiber surfaces Chamberlain says The surfaces he says meet the ADA requirements for wheelchair access But he acknowledges a gap between the regulations and individual needs This particular surface may be too difficult for a child like Emmanuel to use To expect Emmanuel to be able to wheel into or even get pushed into and up to a transfer station and expect him to get up to and into the structure thats what Im talking about Thats the gap Chamberlain says Teresa Soto is disappointed in this park and the rest of her citys playgrounds When she can she drives Emmanuel to a park in another town  minutes away Thats not always possible though In the mornings she works cleaning houses Later in the day she cares for Emmanuels sister a teenager with Down syndrome Soto says she knows what shed like to see in her neighborhood I would like someone to tell me that in this place your son would be safe that he would be in a fun place with access for him she says Richmond recently won  million in grants for city park projects Chamberlain says the city is planning better play areas that will help children with more disabilities and more typical children play together
