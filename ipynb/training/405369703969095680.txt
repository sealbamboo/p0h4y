Look at this baby Lovely no Now think of this baby abstractly  as a sack of hundreds of millions of atoms Heres the atomic formula for a new human being arranged by elements   Notice that the two most plentiful atoms are H hydrogen and O oxygen which shouldnt be a big surprise since  Hs and an O make water and we humans are very moist especially when were born It turns out a brand new human baby is  percent water Were born as wet as a fresh potato Tomatoes are wetter  percent water Apples too but only slightly  percent Check out this fruit vs baby comparison OK we arent as wet as watermelons whod want to be but still we begin our lives as noisy dewdrops that will one day learn to crawl then walk As science writer Loren Eiseley   people are a way that water has of going about beyond the reach of rivers But then with every step we take we begin to dry The longer we live the drier we get One year after birth a human baby is only  percent water  a ten percent drop   Babies are wetter than children By the time were adults the USGS says adult men are about  percent water adult women  percent Elderly people are roughly half water There are variations of course The more buff you are muscle tissue stores more water the wetter you are Because women generally have more fat cells they tend to be a bit drier Fat cells arent as moist The water that lubricates your joints flushes your waste Im talking about pee assists seminal reproduction and absorbs shocks to your bones  as you age the moisturizer in you slowly dwindles And the odd thing is our wet parts arent where youd think I figured if some giant fist were to plunge out of the sky and squeeze a human like a sponge the wettest bit would be our blood Thats wrong Our brains lungs heart liver and kidney contain the wettest tissue  between  and  percent water Bones of course are dryish but still  percent water Theres also water between cells but only a small fraction of our H O is blood Most of the water inside us is stored not in our veins but in our  trillion teeny cells We are an assemblage of water packets slightly salty like the sea we came from As Loren Eiseley put it were a concentration of water that indescribable and liquid brew which is compounded in varying proportions of salt and sun and time and on the day were born were at high tide After that very quietly the sea within us ebbs and ebbs and as it goes  so do we The Universe Within the Deep History of the Human Body The Immense Journey
