The number of over-90s brought to A&E by ambulance in England has risen over the past five years, NHS data shows.. There were 300,039 trips in 2012-13 compared to 147,325 in 2007-08 - a rise of 104%, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.. It is unclear just how much of the rise is down to an increased number of people needing 999 help.. Some will be related to the ageing population and some because of better data collection.. The figures were revised after the Health and Social Care Information Centre admitted there had been a "labelling" error which meant the wrong statistics were used by the media, including the BBC News website.. The centre also admitted the increase seen could be partly down to changes in the way the data had been collected. . A spokeswoman said: "When looking at figures it should be noted that over time the completeness of the dataset has increased, meaning that changes over time may be partly attributable to improvements in data coverage."
