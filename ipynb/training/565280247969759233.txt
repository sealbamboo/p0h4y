Actress Jessalyn Gilsig barely has a moment of downtime Between being a single mom to her yearold daughter taping her role on the History Channels series Vikings and doing guest appearances on other programs the yearold has to fit in workouts whenever she can Determined to stay fit and active though she regularly makes time for exercise that keeps her focused energized and alert No two days are ever the same If Im filming or have meetings or that kind of thing I have to get up and face the day with that kind of face If its a day where I dont have work commitments I get up and the first thing I do is exercise I like to exercise in the morning  I like to get up and immediately get into my workout gear I like highintensity workouts  Spinning boxing cardio barre I also run and I have a Spin bike at my house I find these exercises more meditative too I think its important to get healthy but I like the highintensity workouts where you cant allow yourself to think about what needs to be done and conversations that you coulda shoulda woulda had I really try to find something thats like a little vacation from my brain And since no two days are the same and I feel like I dont have a particularly structured life its easy to feel like Im falling behind Exercise is the moment when you feel like you actually cant fall behind because you have to just be there I did a lot of team sports as a kid I was on the cross country team and I played hockey and so I think because of that I have a little bit of that need to be active Im happy to go out and play basketball a game of pickup soccer  Id almost rather play a team sport if I could find time for that In my line of work you have to maintain your energy so when youre called on to deliver you have the energy for it So I do think some kind of maintaining a baseline of health and energy is really important I basically dont buy prepared food My mother was a really good cook and somehow she drove it into my head that you never really know whats in the food youre eating unless you take it from its most original form and prepare it yourself I dont buy prepared food or processed food and we eat a lot of salads and beans I cook a protein once a week I grew up with very healthy parents my mother made everything from yogurt to bread  and I think it rubbed off on me as kind of the only way I know food
