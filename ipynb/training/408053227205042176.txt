Patients at the Royal Free Hospital in London are testing a device that provides relief from a common sideeffect of liver disease The pump siphons off excess fluid that can build up in the abdomen after liver failure and diverts it to the bladder so it can be urinated out  A liver transplant may be the only option for patients with cirrhosis  Doctors say the pump could buy time and may even allow the liver to recover avoiding the need for a transplant  So far eight patients at the Royal Free have had one fitted  The Alphapump sits beneath the skin of the abdomen and is connected to two small tubes that do the siphoning  When patients have cirrhosis the liver and kidneys stop working properly and fluid known as ascites can accumulate  Litres of fluid can gather inside the abdominal cavity making the patient appear pregnant as well as being painful  Patients may have to make weekly or monthly trips to hospital to have the fluid drained  Rajiv Jalan professor of hepatology at University College Londons institute for liver and digestive health at the Royal Free is the doctor running the trial  He said With cirrhosis patients can accumulate litres and litres of fluid They might need to come to hospital fortnightly to have up to  litres drained from their tummy  The pump can avoid this by draining about  millilitres every  minutes It means theyll pass a little bit more urine but they can turn the pump off at night It can improve quality of life for patients and keep them out of hospital for longer
