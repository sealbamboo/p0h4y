Children who consistently used their right hand to pick up toys as infants had more highly developed language skills at 2 years old compared with those whose hand preference became apparent as toddlers, a study in the current issue of Developmental Psychology found.. Hand use is thought to be variable until late childhood, but recent studies suggest a small number of children always use the same hand from a very young age, researchers said.
