It sounds impressive Major food companies have slashed  trillion calories from packaged foods they sold in  compared with  a study   Thursday But for each American that number translates to about  fewer calories purchased each day or the equivalent of cutting out one apple or   Hersheys Kisses The cut in calories is part of an effort by the nations giant food producers such as General Mills Hershey Co and Kraft Foods to curb childhood obesity by getting more healthful items on grocery shelves But could cutting out  calories each day really make a difference in your waistline or in the obesity problem in the US The range of calories that we need to stop obesity is about  to  approximately per person per day says   of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation a nonprofit that funded the study If these companies are helping to take out  calories per day thats an important contribution toward reaching the goal But the findings arent that clearcut The study looked only at   of packaged foods and beverages Its still unknown how this translates to calories   by Americans especially given that about   of all food in the US is wasted Also the study didnt consider food eaten in restaurants where Americans get about a   of their calories Back in   of the nations major food companies pledged to remove  trillion calories from their products in grocery stores by  and  trillion calories by  To reach that goal the corporations  which produce a third of all packaged foods sold in the US  started selling smaller portion sizes and introducing lowcalorie versions of their snacks and beverages For instance Nestle developed an ice cream with half the fat and onethird of the calories of the original     General Mills introduced a calorie Greek yogurt while Campbells launched a light line of caloriereduced soups Jimmy Dean put out a more healthful version of its sausages made with turkey So did any of these efforts change what Americans bought last year To figure that out researchers at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill tracked the items scanned through checkout lines around the country The teams full report isnt published yet But the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation   the overall numbers on its website Thursday In  the participating companies sold about  trillion calories compared with  trillion in  the study found So the companies crushed their goal  with a  percent drop in calories But some health researchers think the companies shouldnt get all the credit for the progress Its great to see companies selling fewer calories and reformulating their products to reduce fat and sugar but its hard to know how much is due to the proactive efforts of the industry rather than changes in Americans eating habits  Margo Wootan at the Center for Science in the Public Interest     Thomas at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation agrees that Americans preferences are helping to drive the lowcalorie food trend in grocery stores Theres a little bit of a virtuous cycle going on here she tells The Salt Demand for these healthier products is going up And the industry probably wouldnt have stepped forward to make this pledge if there wasnt a market demand for this change Companies that are doing more to make these products she adds are doing better financially
