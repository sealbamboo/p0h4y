High blood pressure is usually called the silent killer However a new study from the University of California now suggests that if youre over  hypertension can save the life of your brain cells  Hypertension may protect against dementia in people over age  the study authors say The researchers followed  participants who developed high blood pressure in their s for up to  years and found that their risk for dementia was  lower than people without a history of hypertension  Nevertheless the study doesnt promote hypertension in the elderly given that high blood pressure is related to other bad outcomes  I dont think it says if I find somebody whos doing well at age  whose blood pressure is  we should feed them salt to bump their blood pressure up says William Klunk vice chair of the Alzheimers Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council  The study simply shows that when it comes to normal levels of blood pressure it might not be a onesizefitsall with respect to age he says Seniors can lower their risk for latelife cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease with a number of lifestyle changes new research suggests A twoyear clinical trial from Karolinska Institutet and the Finnish Institute for Health included  participants aged  to  One part of the group received a lifestylepackage including nutritional guidance physical exercise management of heart health risk factors cognitive training and social activities The control group received standard health advice  After two years the lifestyleintervention group did much better in tests of memory and thinking  We know from past studies that implementing those lifestyle factors in midlife can hedge against Alzheimers disease later on says Ralph Nixon chairman of the Alzheimers Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council The good news from this particular study is that these kind of changes can be implemented in your s and s Middleaged people who were avid gameplayers think crosswords checkers cards tended to have bigger brains than people who did not play games according to a recent study that looked at brain scans Its like looking at someones muscle mass said Dr Laurel Coleman of the Maine Medical Center Geriatric Assessment Center Its bad when its smaller good when its bigger Researchers looked specifically at certain parts of participants brains The volume among gameplayers was greater in areas that tend to be damaged by Alzheimers disease suggesting the potential for delaying  maybe even avoiding  the disease People who kept their brains pumped scored higher on tests of their thinking ability Coleman suggests mixing it up Try potentially stimulating activities like learning a new language or switching from reading nonfiction to fiction  anything that poses a cognitive challenge Exercise seems to slow the descent toward dementia as well Two sets of data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging suggest that exercise may positively influence how mild cognitive impairment a precursor to dementia and dementia develop In one group of patients with mild cognitive impairment exercising seemed to protect against developing dementia Data on a different group of healthy patients who exercised  either lightly or vigorously  showed they were less likely to be diagnosed with cognitive impairment We would never say that these things totally prevent Alzheimers that they will cure you said Coleman a geriatrician  But theyre going to help your brain In the future a test of your sense of smell may help doctors predict your risk of developing Alzheimers disease In two separate studies scientists found that people who were unable to identify certain odors were more likely to experience cognitive impairment The researchers believe that brain cells crucial to a persons sense of smell are killed in the early stages of dementia    Researchers say this information could help doctors create a smell test to detect Alzheimers earlier Early detection means early intervention and treatment to slow the progression of the disease Doctors today can only diagnose Alzheimers disease once it has caused significant brain damage  In the face of the growing worldwide Alzheimers disease epidemic there is a pressing need for simple less invasive diagnostic tests that will identify the risk of Alzheimers much earlier in the disease process Heather Snyder director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimers Association said in a statement
