After decades of fighting to keep how much Medicare pays individual   a secret the federal government bowed to pressure from journalists and consumer groups and released the information in April The   let reporters  and anyone else  figure out who is getting paid by Medicare for what A few docs at the top of the Medicare pay pyramid made headlines Some pathology groups which analyze blood and tissue samples bill Medicare for all of their tests under one physicians name Other top billers were ophthalmologists who use expensive drugs in their offices that are reimbursed by Medicare as a practice expense As a teacher and a practicing physician I was curious to learn what I could about my own Medicare billing from the public data So I plugged my name into both   Medicare   and ProPublicas Medicare   to see where I stood What did I find In  Medicare reimbursed the university where I work  for my services Not much compared with the  million paid to a   who specializes in treating macular degeneration No doubt hes looked at a lot of eyeballs A   of eyeballs The most common charge I submitted was for whats called a level  office visit This happens when I know the patient the medical problems are relatively stable and the medical decisions are pretty straightforward This category also applies to many of the visits between residents and patients that I supervise My next two most common charges are interesting in that theyre evenly divided between office patients and patients in the hospital A split like that is becoming a rarity Most internists now choose to practice exclusively in hospitals or in offices or clinics Teaching hospitals and rural areas are the most common places where this still occurs I was reimbursed a little more than  for the care of complex patients in the hospital But I have to point out that the bills are different depending on whether theyre submitted on the day of   a   day or on the day of   Easy right Medicare also paid about  for me to see patients with more complex problems socalled level  in my office The charges roll on downhill from there in terms of hospital admissions discharges and less complicated office visits If you want to make sense of all these newly released Medicare charge data for your doctor it helps to know a little something about his or her practice In my case Im an academic doctor with a job divided roughly into thirds one part patient care one part teaching and the remainder devoted to administrative work So my Medicare charges are much lower than the average doctor who spends nearly all of the workweek engaged in patient care There were a couple of things that I learned from looking at my Medicare data I was able to bring in a small amount of money about  a pop by offering some patients an easier blood test in our nurseled anticoagulation clinic Patients who have to take blood thinners are monitored closely so they dont clot or bleed The test requires only a finger stick and gives nearinstant results compared with the old bloodtubefromtheelbowtype test It also keeps the Medicare dollars small though they are from the lab which is administered separately I also was reimbursed for reauthorizing plans of care at home You may have read that doctors   about too much paperwork nowadays Home health forms are but one example which involve overseeing and documenting a plan of care for an elderly or disabled patient at home I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this service actually brings in some money on average about  each time I do it Who says busywork doesnt pay Lastly I brought in more than  in Medicare fees just for ordering flu shots which of course are actually given to patients by our nurses Its well worth the  or so Medicare pays per shot to have them administer flu vaccine Theyre total pros
