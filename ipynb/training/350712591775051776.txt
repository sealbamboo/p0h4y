For  years Richard Lee Norris hid his gunshotshattered face from the public wearing a mask when he left the house and shopping late at night to avoid the curious stares of children and adults For all intents and purposes the once sociable Norris had become a recluse Then in  Norris received the face transplant that would forever change his life and break new ground for researchers hoping to heal soldiers disfigured by wounds from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars The landmark hoursurgery at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland included not just facial tissue from the hairline to the base of the neck but also the upper and lower jaws the teeth and also a portion of the tongue   Its the most comprehensive face transplant in medical history Dr Eduardo Rodriguez chief of plastic reconstructive and maxillofacial surgery at the center told NBCs Ann Curry  That surgery gave Norris a second chancem and over the past year hes been on a journey out of darkness and despair and into the light  A sensitive boy with a mischievous side Norris grew up in Fieldale a modest town in rural south Virginia He loved to hunt and fish with his dad and hoped friends said to one day become a policeman or fireman driven by a desire to help people  But in  Norris then  became the one who needed to be rescued by first responders  Hed been at home with his mom when she noticed one of the familys shotguns leaning precariously against the glass door of the gun cabinet When Norris stepped over to the cabinet to stand the gun back up the unthinkable happened The loaded shotgun went off blasting upward and through his jaw and nose He fell to the floor moaning Oh mom  Rushed to the hospital where surgeons worked frantically to save his life he was put in a medically induced coma for two weeks Though his life was saved Norris was left severely disfigured his jaws teeth lips tongue and nose were nearly erased and he was in constant pain  Even after his wounds healed Norris wouldnt venture out of the house without covering his face with a black surgical mask and then often only at night He began to avoid contact with everyone even his closest friends Depressed and disheartened sometimes Norris wondered if suicide was his only choice  Costly and painful followup surgeries to improve Norriss situation failed miserably I got fed up with these BandAid surgeries on him and giving him false hope Norriss mom Sandra told Curry Then in  eight years after the accident Norris and his family finally found the doctor who would change their lives Rodriguez a bold plastic surgeon who believed that Norris could be helped with new breakthrough medical techniques  Norriss mom Sandra remembered their first meeting He put his arm around me and said Mrs Norris were going to fix this and Im going to be with you all the way through it she told Curry The very first partial face transplant had been performed in France and Rodriguez was inspired to try his hand at this new kind of surgery Besides the Department of Defense was now offering funding for research into treatments to help severely injured soldiers returning from the wars The funding could help pay for experimental procedures like face transplants The possibilities werent lost on Norris  He began to talk about facial transplantation Rodriguez told Curry And I remember telling him Were not ready yet Its still too early in the game And I just dont know how we want to do this We need to figure out some things But he was always inquiring about it Rodriguez started to make a plan  and to hone his skills By  he was ready to contemplate a surgery in which he would transplant all the bone structure below Norriss eye sockets as well as the teeth tongue and an entire new face from the collarbone to above the hairline  The surgeon knew how risky the operation would be but he also knew how desperate Norris was and how futile the other options were  When youre missing the upper and lower lip its a very difficult area to recreate Rodriguez told Curry We can give you some sense of normalcy but it will never move normally It wont have normal sensation You cant drink and eat normally You drool We could have done surgery on him forever but he never would have looked normal functioned normally All that stood in the way of the face transplant was finding a donor who had the right blood type and immune system among other technical criteria  In  another familys tragedy offered Norris the chance to once again lead a normal life  Joshua Aversano a young man from White Hall Md who had joined the Marines and was soon to head off to boot camp had gone out on the town with a friend As Aversano walked across the street he was hit by a fastmoving van  The yearold Aversano was airlifted to Shock Trauma the very hospital where Norris was a patient When his parents Randy and Gwen Aversano arrived at the hospital they learned that even though there was barely a mark on their sons body his brain had been damaged too severely for him to survive Asked to donate their sons organs the Aversanos didnt hesitate  But then the doctors asked something the Aversanos couldnt have expected would they be willing to donate their sons face to a man who had also experienced a tragic accident Though it was an unimaginably difficult request the Aversanos were touched by Norriss case He was our sons age maybe a year older when he went through this devastating accident Gwen Aversano said And living as a recluse for all those years had to be horrible for him Norris was summoned back to Shock Trauma and asked if he was sure he wanted to take the risk of a surgery that might not only make things worse but could also kill him Norris was adamant that he wanted to go forward and told doctors If I do die I want to donate everything everything to help other people Although the surgery took longer than anticipated because of the heavily scarred tissue on Norriss face Rodriguez and his team of  eventually managed to transplant all the bones and tissue connecting up nerves and blood vessels  Ultimately the complex surgery may have come with an added bonus  a lower risk of rejection because the transplanted jawbone contained large amounts of marrow which produces immune cells called lymphocytes  The hope is that these cells will interact with the recipients immune system said Dr Rolf Barth a member of Norriss transplant team who has been managing his immune suppression Research has suggested that these cells might decrease the chances of rejection or even help develop a state of immune tolerance in which the body doesnt reject the graft at all  And so far it looks like thats whats happening in Norriss body In  percent of face transplants there has been a significant rejection episode said Barth an associate professor of surgery and director of liver transplantation at the University of Maryland Those are almost always reversible as long as they are treated Richard had a very mild episode of rejection that was easily reversed with an adjustment of his medication The experience doctors have gained through Norriss case may ultimately help service men and women coming back from the wars Rodriguez told Curry That was the same type of injury that our soldiers were experiencing in Iraq he explained They would see these injuries as a result of an IED blast coming from the ground up So if we could treat this problem in a civilian patient then it would be ideal to treat the military patients So that was our first goal What really mattered to Norris though was what he saw when Rodriguez handed him a mirror three days after the surgery  I saw a miracle that was performed Norris said a year later
