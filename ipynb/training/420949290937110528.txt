It didnt come as a complete surprise when a Pennsylvania hospice told Phyllis Fines family last year that she was no longer eligible to receive care   Mrs Fine  enrolled in hospice in June  After supposedly routine heart valve surgery she suffered a major stroke leaving her unable to walk speak much or feed herself   For months hospice staffers cared for her in her nursing home They were awesome people said her daughter Audrey Marsh They bathed and changed her and kept her company  They fed her The hospice had admitted Mrs Fine for  days then another   After that Medicare rules required recertification every  days meaning that a physician must attest she is likely to die within six months if her disease runs its normal course In May when Mrs Fine was no longer losing weight or showing other signs of decline the hospice apologetically said she no longer qualified   Ms Marsh understands the rationale Shes not getting any better but shes not wasting away  Carol Willette on the other hand is seething Her family had debated for months about calling hospice Her mother Earlene Willette  a nursing home resident in Mill Valley Calif had been ailing for several years  falling battling infections eventually losing mobility   Mom was trying to tell people she didnt want anyone prolonging her life Carol said I was talking about hospice but my siblings were in an uproar about it   It took a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS to make everyone understand that Earlene Willettes condition was terminal and meant increasing disability  In midNovember a local hospice enrolled her and the usual team  aides nurses a social worker a chaplain  began visiting  They all said they were there for her and for us Carol told me   Less than a month later the hospice discharged Mrs Willette saying she was not losing ground  I told them how cruel it was to do this Carol said   Mrs Willette can return to hospice care as her condition worsens so can Mrs Fine but Carol worries that her mother will feel on probation at risk of losing care she will come to depend on  Hospices have always had the ability  and under Medicare rules the obligation  to discharge some patients  The   relying on  and  data has reported that  percent of hospice patients are discharged alive each year the   says its surveys show that a third of discharges are initiated by patients themselves and twothirds by hospices   But discharges are climbing  Gilchrist Hospice the largest in Maryland now discharges of about  percent of patients and were on the low side said its clinical director Regina Bodnar Indeed a Washington Post investigation analyzing a million records of California hospice patients found that the proportion discharged alive     Whats happening here  Hospices have lamented for years that   to call enrolling at the eleventh hour when they could have benefited months earlier  Now were hearing more about patients doing as hospice believers including me have urged calling earlier in the course of a terminal disease  and then in a substantial minority of cases getting bounced Jon Keyserling senior vice president for policy at the national hospice organization points to several pressures  First the   are peering over every hospice administrators shoulder  CMS through its contractors is looking much more carefully at longerstay patients Mr Keyserling said  With hospices under increasing scrutiny they need to be even more careful about the patients they admit and the patients they keep The claims reviewers pay particular attention to whether a patients disease is progressing  They want to see evidence Does the patient need more oxygen Have her medications changed  Is he falling   In the past you never did weights on hospice patients Ms Bodnar said Now Gilchrist weighs patients if it cant it measures the circumferences of their arms  Were looking for objective data to justify recertifying patients she said  But hospice patients sometimes hit plateaus or temporarily improve in fact studies have shown that they live slightly longer than those with the same diseases but without the additional care  At that point to comply with Medicare rules you have to seriously consider whether theyre eligible to continue Ms Bodnar said  Patients can   but they dont usually win When auditors question hospice decisions causing a flurry of expensive and timeconsuming paperwork they can hold up Medicare reimbursement for months or years  if the hospices are eventually found to be entitled to payment And if theyre not Medicare audits forced the yearold nonprofit San Diego Hospice Californias largest to close earlier this year denied expected payments the hospice owed millions of dollars and declared bankruptcy  A sobering moment said Ms Bodnar  At the same time all hospices face shrinking budgets  The federal sequester reduced payments by  percent With other cuts some a vestige of the Bush administration and some mandated by the Affordable Care Act Medicare reimbursements to hospices will be about  percent lower this year Mr Keyserling said  One can sympathize with hospice organizations caught in this squeeze  Determining which patients will likely die within six months has always been difficult especially with conditions like heart disease or dementia whose trajectories can be unpredictable  To avoid being penalized if they guess wrong hospices are taking no chances  At least thats true of hospices operating according to the regulations and honoring the movements historic mission  The Post attributed much of the jump in discharges to the way forprofit hospices have come to dominate the field enrolling ineligible seniors for long stays to bolster corporate bottom lines then dumping them to evade Medicare sanctions  The Times has also   Whistleblowers and the Justice Department have sued several large national chains to stop these practices But I worry about families who have agonized about the decision and finally called for help then feel betrayed when hospice withdraws even though their relatives can regain hospice care when they decline further  They shouldnt get caught in this crossfire Was this really the intent of the  hospice Medicare benefit  to have dying older people moved off and on the rolls to have families receive crucial support and then lose it depending on whether someones weight has stabilized for a few weeks  I get the need to right the ship and make sure only eligible patients receive benefits Ms Bodnar said My fear is that were at risk of discharging patients who arent dying fast enough
