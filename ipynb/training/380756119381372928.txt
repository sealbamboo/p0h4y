Obesity Diabetes By now weve all heard of the health risks posed by drinking too much soda But over in Appalachia the region that stretches roughly from southern New York state to Alabama the fight against soda is targeting an altogether different concern rotted teeth Public health advocates say soft drinks are driving the regions alarmingly high incidence of eroded brown teeth  a phenomenon dubbed Mountain Dew mouth after the regions favorite drink They want to tackle the problem with policies including restricting soda purchases with food stamps now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and currently   in Congress We are using taxpayer dollars to buy soda for the SNAP program and we are using taxpayer dollars to rip teeth out of peoples heads who cant afford dental care and are on Medicaid says Dana Singer a research analyst at the MidOhio Valley Health Department in Parkersburg WVa who wants to see stricter regulations on sales of all sugary beverages in the region It makes no sense to be paying for these things twice The beverage industry has repeatedly   that its products are destroying teeth But dentists beg to differ I see erosion from the acids in the drinks and decay from the sugars says   spokesman for the Academy of General Dentistry and a practicing dentist in South Charleston WVa They go hand in hand many times and theyre equally bad I would definitely attribute these problems to drinks Both sodas and energy drinks he says are more damaging than food Dentists have also found that the effects of soda on teeth are strikingly similar to the effects of methamphetamine or crack on teeth as I   in May Drinking more than a soda a day raises the risk that   found in many soft and energy drinks will eat away at your tooth enamel and its pearly white color To get a sense of what that looks like check out   Back in  Priscilla Harris an associate professor at the Appalachian College of Law issued the first battle cry in the war against Mountain Dew mouth with a legal brief titled   which explores how the drink became ingrained in the regions culture Since then shes been leading the charge to come up with policies to tackle the problem Harris says that dental problems are especially bad because dental care is harder to get in Appalachia which includes many of the poorest and most remote communities in the country Many people dont trust the well water in their homes because of pollution concerns and probably drink more soda because of it she says Shes received a   from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to study the problem And theres another reason why soda mouth is so pervasive in Appalachia Harris says the regions distinct culture of sipping soda constantly throughout the day Singer adds Here in West Virginia you see people carrying around bottles of Mountain Dew all the time  even at a public health conference The drink is also native to the region Mountain Dew was   before PepsiCo bought the brand What Mountain Dew has going for it is that its high in caffeine and high in sugar Harris says adding Students tell us it tastes best and its a habit While Harris says that there arent a lot of comprehensive surveys of dental health in Appalachia signs of a rampant problem are unmistakable Some  percent of preschoolers in the region have tooth decay and  percent of  to yearolds have had a tooth extracted because of decay or erosion Thats according to calculations by Singer who is working with Harris The elderly are affected too Some  percent of West Virginians age  or older have lost six or more teeth owing to tooth decay or gum disease   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Singer says one of the best opportunities to curb the problem is targeting programs like SNAP which allows recipients to buy soda According to a   by Yales Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity the federal government is spending  billion to  billion on soda purchases through SNAP Under current guidelines any kind of soda of any size can be purchased with a SNAP card  even Mountain Dew which has  calories in a single ounce can Various states from Florida to Tennessee have proposed bills that would restrict the use of SNAP to buy soda sugary treats or other unhealthful foods Singer says she would like to see West Virginia and other states in Appalachia try this approach Basic education says Harris is also needed We also just need to let people know that you can drink these drinks safely but they can also do harm
