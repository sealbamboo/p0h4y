So far the human race has eliminated just one disease in history smallpox But its on the cusp of adding a second virus  polio  to that list One special man in Somalia was at the battlefront of both eradication efforts He   last week of a sudden illness at age  Ali Maow Maalin was the last member of the general public  worldwide  to catch smallpox And he spent the past decade working to end polio in Somalia World health leaders called Maalin an inspiration Even in the weeks before his death he was leading antipolio campaigns in some of the most unstable parts of Somalia Maalins fight against polio began in  Jimmy Carter had just been elected US president Apple Computer had just incorporated in California And the world was on the verge of wiping out smallpox Decades of vaccination efforts had pushed the virus into one last corner of the world Somalia Maalin then a hospital cook near Mogadishu caught smallpox while driving an infected family to a clinic He was careful not to spread the disease to anyone About three years later Somalia  and the world  were   free of smallpox In that respect Maalin is extremely important says   who directs health programs at The Carter Center He is an emblem of the global smallpox eradication campaign After recovering from smallpox Maalin decided to dedicate his life to eliminating another scourge He would always say Im the last smallpox case in the world I want to help ensure my country will not be last in stopping polio  Dr Debesay Mulugeta who   polio eradication efforts in Somalia tells Shots So in  Maalin officially became a polio vaccinator He organized volunteers went door to door immunizing children and helped to convince families the vaccine was safe At the time vaccinating kids in southern Somalia was a dangerous job Several militia groups were fighting each other and some vaccinators were even shot at Many militia leaders thought the vaccine wasnt safe so Maalin would share his own experience with smallpox and change their minds Maalin     in  that he had several opportunities to receive the smallpox vaccin but initially avoided it because he was afraid the shot would hurt Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine he told the   I tell them my story I tell them how important these polio vaccines are I tell them not to do something foolish like me Such tactics helped Maalin and other health workers stamp out Somalias polio outbreak in  The country was   poliofree in  Last year there were just  cases of polio worldwide Health leaders   to have that number down to zero by  But this spring polio began to make a   in Somalia A handful of children were paralyzed by the virus in May since then Somalia has recorded more than  cases So Maalin went back to work and started organizing immunization campaigns in one of the most turbulent regions of Somalia The area where he worked was not easy because militia controlled access to it Mulugeta says On the second day of the campaign Maalin got sick He had a fever Mulugeta says But he didnt give much attention to it A few days later Maalin was in the hospital and died July  The hospital said it was complicated malaria Mulugeta tells Shots Ali was such a great colleague I dont think he went for medical service early enough He was so busy in the field so focused on monitoring the campaign
