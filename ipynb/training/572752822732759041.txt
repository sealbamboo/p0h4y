A lethal mix of failings at almost every level led to the unnecessary deaths of one mother and  babies in the maternity unit of a Cumbrian hospital   The investigation into deaths at Furness general hospital in Barrow between  and  found maternity services were beset by a culture of denial collusion and incompetence Work inside the unit was found to be seriously dysfunctional with poor levels of clinical competence extremely poor working relationships and a determination among midwives to pursue normal childbirth at any cost The midwives at Furness general were so cavalier they became known as the musketeers The Morecambe Bay investigation was set up by the health secretary   in  to examine concerns over what appeared to be a spate of unnecessary deaths within what became the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS foundation trust UHMBT A panel of experts investigated events at Furness general from  January  to  June  The reports author Dr Blll Kirkup said on Tuesday Our findings are stark and catalogue a series of failures at almost every level  from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust The nature of these problems is serious and shocking Frontline staff were responsible for inappropriate and unsafe care and the response to potentially fatal incidents by the trust hierarchy was grossly deficient with repeated failure to investigate properly and learn lessons Kirkup said this lethal mix of factors had led to  instances of significant or major failures of care at Furness general hospital associated with three maternal deaths and the deaths of  babies at or shortly after birth Different clinical care in these cases would have been expected to prevent the outcome in one maternal death and the deaths of  babies This was almost four times the frequency of such failures of care at the Royal Lancaster infirmary he said referring to the other main maternity unit run by the UHMBT  The first warning signs should have been spotted in  the report said when a baby died from the effects of shortage of oxygen due to a mismanaged labour An investigation into the death was both rudimentary and overprotective of staff and failed to identify underlying problems Between  and  there was a series of further missed opportunities These included five serious incidents between  and  Each was investigated but so inadequately that the underlying problems went unnoticed In  there was a cluster of five serious incidents in the unit These included a baby who died due to the effects of a shortage of oxygen in labour a mother who died following untreated high blood pressure and a mother and baby who died from an amniotic fluid embolism A baby was damaged due to a shortage of oxygen during labour while another died from an unrecognised infection All showed evidence of the same problems of poor clinical competence insufficient recognition of risk inappropriate pursuit of normal childbirth and failures of teamworking Kirkup said Initial investigation was again deficient and failed to identify manifest problems The  cluster at least set off alarm bells within the trust A letter from a consultant obstetrician set out concerns raised by one of the incidents to the clinical director and medical director but failed to prompt any documented reaction Furthermore an external investigation was commissioned following a complaint about another incident that was felt likely to generate adverse publicity Kirkup said the reaction of staff in the maternity was shaped both by a denial that there was a problem and a strong group mentality amongst midwives characterised as the musketeers We found clear evidence of distortion of the truth in responses to investigation including particularly the supposed universal lack of knowledge of the significance of hypothermia in a newborn baby The disappearance of certain records was of concern to Kirkup and his panel of experts The investigators found evidence of inappropriate distortion in the preparation for an inquest with the circulation of what we could only describe as model answers The report makes no criticism of staff for individual errors but condemned incidents of collusion as both inexcusable and unprofessional It adds The failure to present a complete picture of how the maternity unit was operating was a missed opportunity that delayed both recognition and resolution of the problems and put further women and babies at risk The trusts managers allowed themselves to be distracted by their pursuit of foundation status Kirkup says  When the healthcare regulator Monitor suspended the trusts application for foundation status in  it looked to the Care Quality Commission CQC as the arbiter of clinical quality including patient safety and highlighted a series of failed communications between the CQC and the office of the   PHSO Crucially this was at a point in  when the PHSO was considering a complaint from James Titcombe the father of Joshua who died in  as a result of an infection missed for almost  hours Officials at both the PHSO and the CQC  which has    as well as from the local NHS were among more than  individuals interviewed by Kirkup Kirkup said Our conclusion is that these events represent a major failure at almost every level  There were repeated failures to be honest and open with patients relatives and others raising concerns The trust was not honest and open with external bodies or the public Kirkup said the events had been brought to light thanks to the efforts of some diligent and courageous families who persistently refused to accept what they were being told  He added Those families deserve great credit That it needed their efforts over such a prolonged period reflects little credit on any of the   organisations concerned Today the name of Morecambe Bay has been added to a roll of dishonoured NHS names that stretches from Ely hospital to Mid Staffordshire  This report sets out why that is and how it could have have avoided It is vital that the lessons now plain to see are learned and acted upon not least by other trusts which must not believe that it could not happen here  If those lessons are not acted upon we are destined sooner or later to add again to the roll of names James Titcombe said he was shocked that midwives at Furness general had been able to act like musketeers The lack of clinical governance the fact that these were people protecting themselves they lost track of mothers and babies and its tragic For me this report really lays out how preventable Joshuas death was I really recognise now that when we talk about missed opportunities were talking in my case about not having a sixyearold boy Other families must also have that sense that after all these things were going wrong nothing was done and other babies were allowed to die To err is human to cover up is unforgiveable In a statement UHMBT said it had apologised unreservedly to the families Pearse Butler the chair of the trusts board said This trust made some very serious mistakes in the way it cared for mothers and their babies More than that the same mistakes were repeated And after making those mistakes there was a lack of openness from the trust in acknowledging to families what had happened This report vindicates these families For these reasons on behalf of the trust I apologise unreservedly to the families concerned Im deeply sorry that so many people have suffered as a result of these mistakes As the chair of the trust board its my duty to ensure that lessons are learned and that we do everything we possibly can to make sure nothing like this happens again The trust added that the entire composition of its board had changed near the end of the period covered by the report and it recognised the need for improvement in its maternity and neonatal service It also said it now had  more midwives and doctors and had also improved its culture and teamworking
