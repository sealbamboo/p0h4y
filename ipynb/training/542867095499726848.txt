The governments backtowork schemes are ineffective and damaging for people with mental health problems according to campaigners   The charity Mind says unemployed people with mental health problems should be moved from mainstream programmes onto a specialist scheme  Mind surveyed  people supported by the governments Work Programme The government says it has helped thousands of people with mental illnesses into work The coalition government introduced the Work Programme  a key plank in its welfare reform agenda  in  Participants are given support but can face sanctions if they fail to comply with certain conditions According to Mind  of people they surveyed said using the programme and the governments job centre services had made their mental health worse  Three quarters of those polled said they felt less able to work as a result of being on these schemes the charity said At the same time the schemes were ineffective for people with mental health problems as only  of people had been helped into work campaigners claimed The charity is calling for the government to introduce a specialist scheme for people with mental health problems The Work Programme is a government welfaretowork programme introduced in Great Britain in June  Its perverse that programmes which are supposed to help those who are unwell and struggling to get into work are having the opposite effect damaging their health said Paul Farmer Minds chief executive  These schemes are not appropriate for people with mental health problems If someone is out of work because of depression and anxiety simply asking them to attend a CV writing course is a waste of time and money as it doesnt address the real problems they are facing  Forcing people to engage in these activities and cutting their benefits if they struggle to do so is inappropriate and counterproductive  This approach assumes people dont want to work and the only way to motivate them is to withdraw financial support which only causes greater anxiety and stress and makes returning to work less likely A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions defended the governments schemes  Mind are overlooking the fact that previous jobs schemes simply didnt do enough for people with mental health conditions he said  Everyone is different and so the Work Programme looks at an individuals barriers to work and tailors the support specific to their needs     It has already helped thousands of people with mental health conditions into work  instead of just writing people off on sickness benefits as often happened in the past
