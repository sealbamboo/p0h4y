Which diet is the best for you Whichever one you can stick with according to a new metaanalysis of  different trials involving nearly  overweight and obese adults The findings described in the Journal of the American Medical Assn or JAMA show that theres relatively little difference in the effectiveness of various lowfat or lowcarb diets including the branded ones from Atkins to Zone Our findings should be reassuring to clinicians and the public that there is no need for a onesizefitsall approach to dieting because many different diets appear to offer considerable weight loss benefits the study authors wrote Diet fads come and go each claiming to tap into some secret advantage that previous weightloss strategies did not But its difficult to tell which diets are actually most effective  and thats crucial information for overweight or obese individuals looking to successfully shed pounds by changing what they eat To provide some datadriven answers a team led by Bradley Johnston of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in Toronto examined  papers involving  randomized trials and sized up the examined diets average weight loss Lowcarbohydrate diets edged out the lowfat diets   Lowcarb diets were linked to  kilograms of lost weight  pounds at  months and  kg  pounds at  months The lowfat diets were close behind with  kg  pounds lost in the first halfyear and  kg  pounds at the oneyear mark Among individual brandname diets the weight loss differences were minimal the study authors wrote For example the Atkins diet nosed past the Zone diet at six months with just  kg  pounds more weight lost This supports the practice of recommending any diet that a patient will adhere to in order to lose weight the study authors wrote In other words Pick the one thats easiest to stick with over the long haul Linda Van Horn of Northwestern University in Chicago who was not involved in the paper praised the study in a commentary She noted that a healthful diet is ultimately about more than just macronutrients such as carbohydrates fats and proteins Choosing the right foods with the right micronutrients  such as calcium iron or folic acid  is key Choosing the best diet suited to an individuals food preferences may help foster adherence but beyond weight loss diet quality including micronutrient composition may further benefit longevity Van Horn wrote
