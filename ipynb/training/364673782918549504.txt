 If a retiree lives in the Snow Belt but spends winters in Florida or lives half the year with a son in Delaware and the other with a daughter in Maine does she need different advance directives or other legal documents for use in each state  No matter how many houses you have or visit theres one place thats your legal residence or domicile Its not a function of how much time you spend in each location Where do you register to vote Which state issued your drivers license What address do you list on your tax returns Thats your legal home Generally living in more than one state wont affect a will or living trust Those are tied to the state thats your legal residence you dont need more than one If you own real estate in another state however its a good idea to check with a local elder law or estate planning attorney to make sure you dont need additional documents to manage the property if you become incapacitated or to transfer it when you die Durable powers of attorney are another matter These authorize other people to make decisions for you if you lose the ability to make decisions or communicate them They cover two areas health care and legal and financial matters Most states call for separate documents for each type but in some states theyre combined into one State laws governing durable powers of attorney vary In Missouri for instance a DPOA isnt valid unless it includes the phrase in the event of later uncertainty as to whether I am dead or alive In Florida where some Missourians spend the winter no such phrase is required Some states say a DPOA must be notarized in order to be effective Others require witnesses some require all of the above Missouri Kansas and Texas require that the document be notarized for example but do not require witnesses Florida requires two witnesses and a notary Illinois only requires one witness If youre just traveling through a state have an accident and wind up in a hospital with an outofstate DPOA you should be fine But if youre spending a lot of time in another state its a good idea  not mandatory but advisable  to have a DPOA that complies with that states laws You dont want any difficulty in having it honored While you might eventually be able to straighten out any problems you dont want to take the time In a hospital you need decisions made immediately On the legalfinancial side if the person you designated as your agent officially called an attorneyinfact needs access to a bank account  to keep an insurance policy in force say  you dont want silly technical delays to slow that down Things go more smoothly if you can comply with state requirements I suggest you either have one set of documents incorporating both states laws or have two sets one for each state The latter is often the better way to go If you opt to have two sets of documents note that a DPOA generally includes a phrase like I hereby revoke any prior DPOA I might have executed In this case though you want the document to state that you have a second DPOA in another state We typically say I revoke all previous documents except the one signed on April   in my home state of Minnesota so its clear which document you want to keep in force You can designate different people to act for you in these documents You may want your banker son to be your first agent for your financial DPOA but your physician daughter to serve first as your health care decision maker For a legalfinancial DPOA we encourage people to name the same agents in the same order in each state On health documents however if most of your family is far away you might also want to designate someone local  a neighbor or nearby relative or friend who can get to a hospital quickly When you choose people to make health care decisions for you you list them in order of priority If you add local people they normally come at the end of the list Then if they are the first to get to the hospital they make decisions until the family members listed ahead of them arrive Once those family members show up they take over
