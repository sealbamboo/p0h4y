Pediatricians are regularly asked by patients and their parents about such bullying Both parents and pediatricians are often confused by the responses from the coaches athletic departments and school administrators when the behavior is brought to their attention   Ive written a perspective paper on this issue with Brett Enneking and Kristin Hendrix in the journal Pediatrics In one case we learned of a woman entered a gym when picking her daughter up early from basketball practice and saw the coach screaming at the team that they lacked intelligence and were lazy because they had not executed a play properly When she confronted the coach she was told that no one was allowed in the gym during practice for safety reasons  After asking around and finding that the coach had a history of intimidating players she approached the principal who told her he had spoken to the coach and the coach had apologized The coach he said was successful and won a state title the year before but sometimes got overexcited As we note in our perspective paper most research on bullying addresses peertopeer bullying but nothing in the definition of bullying requires a peertopeer relationship only one individual with perceived power over another Bullying can have dramatic and longlasting effects on victims studies have showed  We have observed four defensive techniques that bullying coaches have used to rationalize and minimize others negative perceptions of their behavior  When pediatricians can identify these defensive techniques they are better able to counsel parents and educate school officials about the use of these techniques in order to maintain focus on the behavior that needs to be addressed  The bully attempts to portray the behavior as socially acceptable They use normalization statements like all coaches lose it once in a while or this is how weve always done things and we win games   By arguing that the behavior is normal they attempt to show that common behavior is acceptable behavior  When a culture of bullying is accepted within a team or school it may actually seem normal and bullying of athletes tends to be rationalized and ignored   This sounds like I am really sorry I got a little carried away but we really need to work on fundamentals if we are going to win   There are two problems presented  First the coach is minimizing the harm by saying a little second he or she places the blame on the victims by implying that if the team had mastered fundamentals he or she would not have acted in such a manner  The apology becomes part of the bullying behavior cycle because it is a power play that belittles the victim  A coach might say I never push them around or lay a finger on them  Even if physical violence was not the concern the coach implies that there are far worse behaviors to downplay the severity of his actual misconduct  In escalation the stakes are raised until the person with the grievance gives up  Here the bully essentially bluffs the person making the complaint into backing down   With athletes the coach may make statements like If you dont like the way I do things you can quit the team  The bully is not necessarily escalating his bullying behavior but escalating the situation by presenting the secondary consequences a victim might face by fighting back  Bullying by coaches should be immediately reported to school officials and a report to child welfare officials may also be warranted  Such behavior is unacceptable and coaches should face consequences for not only physical but also verbal misconduct including demeaning namecalling and insulting young athletes
