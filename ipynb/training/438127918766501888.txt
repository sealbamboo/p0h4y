A key measure of hospital death rates should be ignored according to the expert leading the review into them  Academic Prof Nick Black has been asked by the NHS to see whether they are an accurate indicator of poor care His review is not due to be published until December but he told the BBC the most established method of measuring mortality appeared to have no value But Dr Foster  the research group which has pioneered their use  rejected the criticism Prof Blacks team are looking at two measures of mortality  the hospital standardised mortality ratio HSMR which compares the expected rate of death in a hospital with the actual rate of death and the summary hospitallevel mortality index SHMI which covers deaths after hospital treatment and up to  days after discharge Prof Black has already looked into HSMRs but is now doing this in more detail as well as looking at SHMIs He told BBC Radio s  that based on what he already knew HSMRs should be ignored He said they could not entirely take into account factors such as burden of illness and were skewed by other factors such as the availability of hospice care in the area  where there is less hospice care patients are more likely to be in hospital when they die I dont think theres any value in the publication of HSMR and Id go further I think its actually a distraction because it gives a misleading idea of the quality of care of a hospital When asked what the public should make of media coverage of death rates he added Personally I would suggest that the public ignore them  Prof Black was asked to look into mortality rates after a review by Prof Sir Bruce Keogh published in July found failings in care at the  hospitals with the highest death rates Despite the findings Sir Bruce said he was not sure how accurate an indicator death rates were This comes amid a growing desire to use them to identify hospitals at risk of providing poor care The Care Quality Commission is now using them alongside other factors to decide which hospitals to visit first under its new inspection regime Supporters of mortality data maintain they are not a confirmation of poor care but rather should be seen as a smoke alarm in that they highlight a problem that needs investigating Roger Taylor of Dr Foster said there were countless examples where death rates had identified problems including in the Stafford Hospital scandal What they do is they identify those areas where theres a greater risk of poor quality care he added
