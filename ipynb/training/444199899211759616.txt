If youre a student of fat  and who isnt these days  you know that the FTO gene is the gene thought to be most responsible for some peoples inherited propensity to become obese Well forget that A multinational group of geneticists has discovered that more likely the real obesity gene is named IRX and it is very far from the FTO gene  or would be if DNA were to be stretched out in linear fashion instead of coiled up like a skein of yarn In a letter posted Wednesday to the website of the journal Nature University of Chicago geneticists Scott Smemo and Marcelo A Nobrega along with a team of Canadian and Spanish researchers wrote that geneticists hunting for the obesity gene appear to have fallen into a trap They assumed that genetic variations they could see have only local effects and do not affect the workings of faraway genes Geneticists had designated the FTO gene the key obesity gene merely because it neighbored some oftseen obesityrelated genetic variations in the intron the  of DNA once thought to be junk because genes there dont code for protein production Instead Smemo and Nobregas team conducted a series of experiments that showed that the obesityrelated single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs seen in the intron may not even act on the FTO gene  or at least not only on the FTO gene The SNPs that most often make mice and humans alike gain too much weight act on the IRX gene When these genetic variations switch on the IRX gene mice become chubby have less brown fat which helps burn up white fat and have poorer metabolic function The group also discerned that IRX expressed itself in the brains hypothalamus a key node in the brains hungerandsatiety circuitry It was also found in organs and fat cells suggesting it may play a role in metabolism as well When the IRX gene was activated mice and people were likelier to be obese and to have diabetes When mice were bred without the IRX gene they were lean even when fed a high fat diet Nobrega said that scientists had begun to question whether FTO was the gene regulated by the SNPs they routinely found in the obese in part because people born with a genetic deletion of the FTO gene have lots of problems but obesity isnt one of them The discovery that genes in that thick forest of gene regulators known as the intron can act on genes very far away from them will make geneticists think twice before they make assumptions about the relationship of neighboring genes to one another As for what this finding means for the treatment of obesity Nobrega said that the study of such genetic interactions would help illuminate how diseases such as obesity and type  diabetes take root and progress Someday that may offer targets for the development of drugs or other therapies but this is way down the road he said
