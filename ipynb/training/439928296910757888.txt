Fifteenyearold Tadisa was never expected to live Her mother Grace was HIVpositive and passed the virus on to Tadisa at birth  In the s thousands of babies born with HIV in Zimbabwe died in infancy as todays cheap lifesaving drugs were not available in subSaharan Africa  But to the great surprise of doctors there are thousands of teenagers like Tadisa who have lived with HIV for more than a decade  When Dr Rashida Ferrand wanted to research these young survivors she was told none were still alive  Five years ago people would shake their heads in disbelief and say Well no nobody survives said the HIV expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Survival beyond five years is considered absolutely exceptional Noone knows exactly why people like Tadisa survived childhood with untreated HIV But while they have lived longer than expected their lives have not been straightforward Many suffer chronic health complications including disfigurement and as a result are socially ostracised Dr Ferrand now treats these teenagers in Zimbabwe and is a passionate advocate for them These children are more likely to be poor and to have lost their parents to Aids she said Theyve been shifted around amongst guardians and missed education so the odds are stacked against them SubSaharan Africa accounts for  of the worlds HIV cases Today nearly one in  adults live with the condition Lifesaving antiretroviral therapy ART has been available for free since  in the region and has transformed the outlook of those with the virus But children like Tadisa who survived unexpectedly have often gone untreated and the complications of untreated HIV  such as damage to the lungs and heart  are debilitating Theres also some brain damage leading to them not being able to perform in school said Dr Ferrand There are some obvious visible signs of longstanding untreated HIV infection such as stunting and skin disfigurement Part of the problem is a lack of awareness four out of five children with HIV do not know that they have the virus  Their medical problems are often put down to normal childhood illnesses and they do not get tested for HIV until they are in their teens Dr Ferrand described a culture of silence and said the most shocking aspect of her research was that nearly all the older children and adolescents who have tested positive could have been diagnosed earlier Twothirds had been to a primary health care clinic in the previous six months a quarter had been in hospital at some point in their lives and more than half had a parent or sibling with HIV Despite this noone had thought to test them for HIV  Once tested there was no standard way for young people to be told of their status according to research at Harares Parirenyatwa Ol Clinic  They asked  patients aged between  and  how they discovered they were HIVpositive Although the advice was for their parents or guardians to tell them the adolescents preferred to hear the news for themselves I wanted to be told at the clinic just so I know that its really true that Ive been tested and its true said one  yearold girl Some children had guessed such as one yearold boy who told the researchers My mother was lying to me saying I have a heart problem I have a hole in my heart So I decided to say Okay  But I knew I knew that when I was coming here I was HIVpositive And sometimes the news was given in an abrupt manner  My grandmother told me at home said one yearold boy I was watching TV My grandmother came up to me and said Hey A do you know that youre HIVpositive I said Okay She said it twice Youre HIVpositive I just said Okay The adolescents learn most about their condition from each other rather than their parents and guardians the researchers found Once diagnosed they can keep the virus at bay with the free ARTs  But one reason their guardians did not bring them for diagnosis and treatment was to protect them and their families They fear that if the child is disclosed to he will go about in the streets or at school telling others and other relatives that dont know that the parents are positive said a counsellor at Parirenyatwa Ol Clinic So they will be stigmatized or discriminated against as a family In  a UNICEF report stated that only about a third of children with HIV were receiving ARTs compared with around twothirds of adults  New WHO guidelines say testing should be offered to all adolescents living in areas of the world where HIV is common particularly subSaharan Africa Dr Ferrand believes it is an issue of child rights that the young people learn about their HIV status and receive treatment
