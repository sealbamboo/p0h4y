Epidemic obesity rates are the prime driver in a nationwide trend toward earlier and earlier breast development in young girls according to new research In a paper published Monday in the journal Pediatrics researchers found that the average age of thelarche or onset of breast development was earlier than previously recorded for white girls and that a high body mass index or BMI was a strong indicator of early puberty While the studys authors said it remained unclear whether early breast development led to early onset of menstruation they said the trend toward earlier sexual development raised numerous clinical issues Girls with earlier maturation are at risk for lower selfesteem and higher rates of depression wrote Dr Frank Biro a pediatrician at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital They are more likely to be influenced by older peers and more deviant peers and initiate intercourse substance abuse and other normbreaking behaviors at younger ages Biro and his colleagues wrote The authors noted also that early maturation was associated with increased risk of breast ovarian and endometrial cancer Researchers tracked the development of more than  girls in San Francisco New York and Cincinnatti The girls were enrolled in the study when they were between the ages of  and  and were examined periodically from  to  Among other findings the studys authors said that breast development in white nonHispanic girls began at a median age of  years earlier than previously reported Black girls were found to experience breast development earlier at a median age of  years and Hispanic and Asian girls were found to experience development at a median age of  and  years respectively The authors said that girls who were in the th percentile or higher for body fat content were progressively more likely to have reached early breast development than those below the th percentile The research has several possible limitations according to authors including the possibility that the study sample does not represent the nation as a whole The authors wrote also that while the study joins a number of others that have found a link between high rates of body fat and early puberty the data support but do not establish causality
