There are all kinds of theories why Ebola hasnt arrived in Ivory Coast despite the fact that it shares a long and very porous border with two Ebolaafflicted countries Liberia and Guinea Some Ivoirians credit a beefedup border patrol The citizens in this country thank God But Mumadou Traore who works as a field coordinator for   has a third theory He credits the legendarily infuriating Ivorian bureacracy French bureaucracy is a blessing for us he says because people here respect authority Not like in Liberia and Sierra Leone he says where people arent obeying their own health officials Cest mon opinion he says with a laugh Its my opinion Traores opinion doesnt quite hold water Guinea after all is a Francophone country And thats where the current outbreak began But in one way Traore is onto something Ebola spreads because of human behavior I met him in in the central town of Bouafle just near the countrys prime cocoagrowing region He was giving a training course for rural community leaders telling them not to shake hands not to kiss not to eat bush meat  a popular delicacy  since some animals can harbor the virus and pass it onto humans through their blood These are all government directives in place since March Government cant be everywhere in every village but Traore believes that the people of the Ivory Coast are following orders Adjoua Martine traveled  miles to attend this training Shes a farmer of cocoa and rubber trees who lives in a small forest hamlet called Brokoua Even in her tiny village in a country thats Ebolafree the pastors are preaching the governments prevention message She mimes how she crosses her arms if someone starts to greet her You cant stop every person from shaking your hand she says But if they try she tells them The rules say we mustnt now do this Dr Seydou Coulibaly is the regional health director of Tompki county which shares the longest border with Liberia and Guinea He says that in the first weeks of the outbreak before official prevention directives were issued from the capital he was telling clinics and hospitals to send him daily Ebola watch reports He gets a hundred a day Even before the borders were sealed he was sending health workers to take peoples temperature when they crossed Hes also arranged trainings for schoolteachers and soldiers All these efforts will help he says  maybe not to prevent the virus from coming to the country but at least the first eventual case will be wellmanaged Thats the main objective Coulibaly says his county is far from ready for an outbreak of the magnitude of neighboring countries Theres not enough protective gear for health workers and not enough ambulances to bring patients to isolation centers But they are watching for signs of Ebola with remarkable vigilance The government has set up a hotline number for anyone who suspects they or someone has Ebola Its a measure of the degree of commitment  or perhaps just fear  that every time Ive called Ive gotten a busy signal If Ivory Coast has turned itself into a nation of spies and informers Coulibaly says thats a good thing even if every Ebola alert so far has turned out to be just a rumor People will often call to say Well I havent seen him for a while so he must have been in Guinea And heck hes not feeling well so he certainly has Ebola To Coulibaly this means that the authorities will quickly be informed if and when there is a case Its not clear what happens to a Guinean who crosses the border illegally The local representative of the Guinean community told me that border crossers are immediately sent back In some cases Coulibaly says such individuals are quarantined until Ivory Coast authorities are sure theyre not the dreaded and expected first case
