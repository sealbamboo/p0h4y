Whooping cough   in California back in  There were more than    infections in the state a year high In recent years there has been a   across the country Why Some people arent getting immunized And its also probably the case that more sensitive tests and greater awareness of whooping cough are spurring doctors to do a better job of diagnosing it Another factor may be that the vaccines kids get to protect them against the respiratory illness appear to be losing their effectiveness faster than expected Results from a study that compared California kids who got whooping cough with some who didnt adds more weight to that hypothesis Kids are supposed to get three doses of the socalled   vaccine against diptheria tetanus and pertussis at two four and six months followed by booster shots at  months and  years The study of California kids found that those who had been fully vaccinated were less likely to catch whooping cough But the study also found that the more time had passed since children completed the fiveshot immunization regimen the more likely they were to get whooping cough Overall the effectiveness of the pertussis regimen fell from  percent within a year of finishing it to  percent five or more years later according to estimates by the researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health The   in the latest   the   The current vaccines introduced in the   have fewer side effects than the older versions But it appears they may not be as potent Now its true that this study which looked at sick kids and comparison children after the fact found associations and cant prove causation Still the researchers conclude that vaccines that provide longerlasting protection may be needed to better control whooping cough An   says that although the current vacccines may be suboptimal they are still quite effective Because infants are the most vulnerable to serious illness and death from whooping cough the editorial emphasizes immunization of pregnant women and people who will be in close contact with infants The latest results jibe with a Kaiser Permanente   in the   in September It found that whooping cough vaccines effectiveness faded too falling more as the years dragged on
