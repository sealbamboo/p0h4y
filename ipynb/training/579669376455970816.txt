The patient in front of me is five minutes late for her minute appointment As she sits down she tells me she is feeling suicidal as her father has just been diagnosed with cancer and she is about to be evicted from her flat for nonpayment of rent It is am on a Monday and the waiting room is already standing room only This is a slightly extreme scenario but it does happen Whenever general practice is discussed in news reports the main complaint seems to be that people cannot get appointments with their GP There are many reasons for this Chronic underfunding combined with everincreasing unfunded work being dumped on us are two major reasons why it is harder to see your family doctor Another important reason which the media seems to pay scant attention to is the misuse of the system by patients themselves The practice I work in has four doctors and more than  registered patients We have an average of about  appointments not attended every week DNAs Not cancelled appointments just appointments that patients failed to attend Thats  minutes of doctor time wasted every single week We are not unusual most practices will tell a similar story We advertise the fact of this wasted doctor time in the waiting room and text patients to remind them of appointments but it does not seem to make much difference In addition to this we have a dozen or so appointments cancelled at short notice This is when patients phone to cancel but leave it so late that an appointment cannot be reused Charging patients and fines for missed appointments have all been suggested as solutions to DNAs but it would lead to a whole new layer of administrative problems and would fundamentally undermine the principle that the   is free at point of use I dont have the answer to this problem but I do think the problem needs discussing more openly Another area that needs highlighting is what a GP appointment is and what can be realistically achieved within it When I started work as a GP  years ago many doctors were still operating on fiveminute appointment slots That gradually changed and now most surgeries will offer minute appointments as routine In those  minutes the patient has to walk to our room and explain their problems We have to examine them make a diagnosis and explain any necessary treatments or tests and then do the associated paperwork Finally we have to summarise all this to the patient then write our notes and do the required boxticking for the government so we can get paid This where I work is often complicated by the patient speaking little or no English or the consultation taking place through an interpreter Our GP training does teach us to work quickly and efficiently and we do mostly mange to cram all that into  minutes but it only needs one or two consultations to overrun to make us run late  The government want us to offer more appointments  but when On top of seeing patients we have to do paperwork home visits sign prescriptions and attend meetings there is no slack time in the day  We could take on more doctors if there was extra funding but there isnt any Not to mention that we dont have any spare consulting rooms  I am incredibly privileged to get paid well for a job I enjoy doing and am good at On my wishlist for  would be an open and honest debate not just about what the NHS should be doing for patients but what patients could do to make the NHS run better
