
 New research suggests that the biomechanical changes that occur during pregnancy can linger long afterward and significantly affect a womans running stride  Theres never been any doubt of course that pregnancy drastically changes a womans body She gains weight her center of gravity shifts and connective tissues become looser These changes are desirable and necessary for birth  But they also affect how a woman moves  A   in the journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth for instance documented how womens walking strides grew wider and shorter as their pregnancies progressed They began in essence to waddle  But there has been little science available about how pregnancy affects running form in part because relatively few women have run during and after their pregnancies That situation is changing though thanks in part to strong evidence that running throughout pregnancy does not harm a womans fetus together with wellpublicized success stories like those of the marathoners Kara Goucher and Paula Radcliffe who   soon after  But while more pregnant women and new mothers run today many also experience unaccustomed aches and pains and a niggling feeling that somehow their stride is different now  Such complaints drive many new mothers to the doctors office And they also sent some to the running clinic at the University of Wisconsin in Madison whose director Bryan Heiderscheit a professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation could find no studies examining running biomechanics in the pregnancy and postpartum periods  So he and his colleagues set out to conduct their own So far only a handful of women have been studied in depth but the early results presented at a  sports medicine scientific meeting and   are among the first to track biomechanical changes in a pregnant runners body and how those changes might effectively be managed  One of the cases involved a yearold runner who beginning in the sixth month of her pregnancy began visiting the universitys exercise lab every four weeks There she ran on a treadmill while the scientists used D motioncapture technology to study her form Her final visit while pregnant came two days before she went into labor Six months later she returned to the lab for a followup run By then she was running on her own about  miles a week  The scientists found that as her pregnancy progressed her pelvis began tilting forward more and more altering to some degree how she landed with each stride Six months postpartum much of that forward tilt remained She also displayed more sidetoside pelvic motion while running than she had when she began the study six months into her pregnancy  She didnt report any appreciable pain while running But that wasnt the case for another postpartum runner studied by Dr Heiderscheits group  a yearold mother of two who visited the running clinic  months after her second child was born because of considerable hip and low back pain while running  After she ran on the lab treadmill the researchers determined that her pelvis tilted abnormally far forward during running and moved too much from side to side In effect her pelvis remained unstable a year after her last pregnancy Partly in consequence her right leg struck the ground harder than the left absorbing about  percent more force with each stride None of this was surprising Dr Heiderscheit says Pregnancy and labor stretch the muscles and connective tissues in the abdomen which allows the slightly unmoored pelvis to tilt and sway Unless a woman strengthens the affected muscles after pregnancy the tissues remain stretched  Relying on that gym standby crunches wont do the trick though Dr Heiderscheit says They dont activate the small muscles deep within the abdomen Instead he suggests pulling the belly up and in multiple times and also imagining that youre trying to cut off the flow of urine  Using those techniques together with traditional abdominal exercises like squats planks and bridges instructions for these can be   can help stabilize the pelvic area They also suggested that the woman shorten her stride by about  percent to reduce the pounding that she experienced as she ran After seven weeks the woman reported that her feelings of pain while running had dropped from a constant  on a scale of  to  to an occasional  She returned to running about  miles a week I think its time we acknowledge that having a baby is going to change how you run Dr Heiderscheit says  The changes are not necessarily deleterious he adds There is no evidence that a majority of mothers are slower runners or more injuryprone after giving birth But things are likely to feel different he says and probably for a long time Ongoing studies at his clinic are looking into whether some of the alterations in running form are in fact permanent  For now he says his advice to pregnant or postpartum runners is to pay attention to signals from your body If you feel pain while running especially in the back or hips slow down and consult a sports medicine specialist After medical clearance consider starting an exercise program designed to strengthen the abdominal muscles  And if you need inspiration the mother with the sore back and hips Dr Heiderscheit says recently completed her first halfmarathon
