Doctors who specialize in treating infertility are making a big change in their position on a controversial practice The   ASRM has concluded that freezing womens eggs to treat infertility should no longer be considered experimental The group plans to officially announce the change on Monday More and more women are using frozen eggs to try to have babies Some older women use frozen eggs donated by younger women Some younger women freeze their own eggs while they finish school focus on their jobs or keep looking for the right guy Thats why Jennifer Anderson did it last year I really wanted to have the traditional experience of falling in love and getting married and then having children But I know every persons life path is different and it hadnt worked out for me yet to fall in love and get married says Anderson  a consultant who lives in Arlington Va So Anderson went to the   clinic in Rockville Md to freeze some of her eggs I guess I feel like Ive stopped the biological clock to some degree That this gives me a few more years to find what it is that Im really looking for she says The practice of freezing eggs has long been controversial Many experts argue theres too little data on how well it works or how safe it is So theyve mostly recommended it only for women whose fertility is at risk because they are undergoing chemotherapy or have some other medical problem But Eric Widra an infertility doctor at Shady Grove says thats changed He chaired the   Practice Committee which prepared the report It was the first time the group had reviewed eggfreezing since  We no longer think that it should be covered under the experimental label Sufficient studies have been done to warrant considering this a clinically available technique Widra says The report reviewed nearly  published studies Egg freezing and thawing techniques have gotten a lot better he says The available data for egg freezing indicate that it is safe and effective and has a good probability of success he says So far babies born from frozen eggs seem to be healthy And a woman in her s or s seems to have about the   as a woman in her s or s if she uses frozen eggs from a donor that young We think that is a reasonable expectation going forward he says But the new policy which is being published in the societys journal   warns clinics against creating false hope by aggressively marketing egg freezing to women as a guaranteed way of stopping their biological clocks There still havent been enough studies to know for sure how well longterm egg freezing works according to the assessment Women who are considering doing this for elective reasons should understand that they are really at the leading edge of using this technology Widra says and were not yet certain that it will provide the promise that we hope it does That said Widra says he thinks its probably going to work for women seeking to postpone childbearing How good an assumption that is time will tell But at this point we think the available data are strong enough to say its reasonable to do he says But the fertility societys shift is raising a lot of concerns Some womens health advocates say theres still not enough data to really know how often frozen eggs actually produce healthy babies The societys assessment was based on pregnancies not healthy births noted Amy Allina of the   In addition the hormone injections needed to get eggs to freeze can in rare cases cause potentially lifethreatening complications in women Were talking about a procedure that has some known risks and unknown benefits Allina says Theres also the worry that the policy shift will fuel the creation of frozen egg banks   of the   says that could lead to the exploitation of poor younger women Its pretty evident that theres usually a difference in socioeconomic status between the women who are being asked to sell their eggs or rent their wombs and the women who are using it she says Some argue that society should make it easier for women to have kids when they are younger so they dont have to resort to technological fixes Its an example of using technology to solve social problems says   a bioethicist at Yeshiva University As for Anderson shes just glad she had the option To be honest it just it really took a lot of the anxiety away from my personal life I guess and my efforts to date and to find the right person she says The fertility society plans to continue to collect data about the safety and effectiveness of egg freezing In the meantime Widra says the association hopes the new policy will encourage more insurance policies to pay for egg freezing
