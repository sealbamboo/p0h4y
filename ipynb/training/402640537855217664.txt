The launch of new treatment guidelines isnt a good time for confusion and controversy But thats precisely   to a set of sweeping new guidelines aimed at slashing the US rate of heart attacks and strokes  the first reboot of such advice in seven years If such guidelines are going to work Dr   points out they have to convince We need the publics support here the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist says Doctors can write prescriptions for drugs but patients have to want to take them And what I fear is at risk here is confusion that prevents people who would benefit from getting the drugs and may lead to the wrong people getting these drugs The guidelines   by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology at the behest of the National Institutes of Health are aimed at preventing a first heart attack or stroke in millions of Americans Because this affects so many people we have to get it right Nissen says But when   saw the cholesterol guidelines last Tuesday evening he was troubled Ridker who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston had caught an advance peek at the document many months earlier Back then he advised the team writing the guidelines that their proposed   to predict peoples risk of heart attack and stroke might overestimate that risk because it relied on old data His caution apparently fell on deaf ears though because when it came out the formula hadnt changed So Ridker and Harvard colleague   tested the new risk calculator using more current data from three big studies We found that it overestimated risk by a substantial amount Ridker tells Shots On average it was between  and  percent  so a rough doubling And thats a substantial overestimation He thinks the reason is that the cardiovascular risk of US adults has changed quite a lot over the past two decades and more Not only are rates of smoking lower but people tend to exercise more and theyre on better diets Ridker says If you use a prediction model that uses older data that might or might not tell you whats relevant now Ridker says its not such a big deal if a formula overestimates the risk of somebody whose chances of a heart attack and stroke are high  he will probably get cholesterollowering drugs in any case But its a different story if somebodys real risk is low and the calculator overestimates that risk If a persons true risk is  or  percent and you wouldnt treat but the risk calculator increases it to  or  percent and you would it raises the possibility that we might not be getting the right drugs to the right patient at the right time Ridker says On Monday the guideline writers stoutly defended their work at a press conference in Dallas where the Heart Association is holding its big annual scientific sessions The truth is the risk equations work exactly as we asked them to do says   of Northwestern University who led a panel that developed the new risk calculator The question is Are they the right populations We selected populations that were representative of the US in the mids He points out that estimating peoples risk of heart attack or stroke  years into the future requires following them to see what happens to them and theyve got to be followed for at least  years Id love to snap my fingers take a population existing today and know what their outcomes are going to be in  years LloydJones says But you just cant do that He argues that Ridker and Cooks analysis  s risk because it used research subjects who were much healthier than the average American The analysis mined data from the   the   and the   For his part Ridker stresses that he supports  percent of the new guidelines But hed like to see their implementation delayed until scientists can figure out how to deal with the problem of risk projection I think when you see a signal like that  when the data dont quite make sense  the most responsible thing to do is stop and sit tight Ridker says as you continue to try to identify other factors you may not have taken into account At the moment that doesnt appear likely American Heart Association President   said at Mondays media briefing that the organization will go ahead with the risk calculator and guidelines as is We are implementing this approach to the prevention of cardiovascular disease Jessup says We think weve done our due diligence We have faith and trust in these investigators And ultimately as with all guidelines the implementation is at the level of the patient and the practitioner
