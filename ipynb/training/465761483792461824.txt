Everything about the US pharmaceutical company Pfizers attempts to buy its AngloSwedish rival AstraZeneca is big Let me try to explain why writes Anthony Reuben The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry   that it costs on average bn to bring a new drug to market  and takes  years And if that seems like a lot   reckons the biggest companies pay way more than that  Its reporter Matthew Herper took the slightly crude but basically valid step of taking the amount spent on research and development by pharmaceutical companies over  years and dividing it by the number of drugs each company brought to market over that time On that measure he found that AstraZeneca was spending the third most at bn bn per drug while Pfizer came in at number five spending bn bn per drug Looked at in that context you can see why the bn that Pfizer is offering for AstraZeneca and which AstraZenecas board has turned down would not have to give Pfizer access to very many new drugs to be worthwhile Thats even clearer when you look at the rewards available for a blockbuster drug The worlds bestselling drug last year according to   was Humira a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis among other things which had global sales of bn bn That one drug alone would almost have been enough to put a pharmaceutical company in the global top  firms So thats why there are such a lot of big numbers circulating linked to this potential takeover and why companies keep merging so they can shoulder the costs of research Some scientists reckon that the costs linked to bringing out new drugs are just too high making them unaffordable for patients and that a new approach is needed if the new drugs the world needs are to be discovered But until there is a new approach expect to see more such megamergers proposed in the future
