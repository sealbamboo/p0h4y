A minute video shown on an iPod at the department of motor vehicles may help increase the number of organ donors researchers found Participants who viewed the video which addresses some common concerns about organ donation were more likely to agree to be a donor than those who did not see the video according to J Daryl Thornton MD MPH of MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland and colleagues The intervention also had positive effects on perceptions of organ donation the researchers reported in the April  issue of   Because tens of millions of Americans obtain drivers licenses annually this approach has the potential to substantially increase the number of potential organ donors they wrote noting that the gap between the supply and demand for organs is widening particularly among ethnic minority groups The researchers designed a minute video that addressed the following common concerns about organ donation At  branches of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles BMV located within  miles of downtown Cleveland the researchers conducted a study that included  Englishspeaking individuals ages  to  who were applying for a new license permit or identification card and who had not previously consented to being an organ donor The research staff approached individuals outside of each branch  were shown the video on an iPod and  were not All participants were asked to show whether they had elected to be an organ donor when they left the branch The average age of the participants was  in the video group and  in the control group Overall  percent reported that BMV staff asked them about organ donation Watching the video was associated with an increase in the proportion of individuals who elected to become an organ donor among both whites  percent versus  percent and blacks  percent versus  percent There were few Hispanic participants but the effect trended in the same direction in that subgroup Participants in the video group also were less likely to report having insufficient information about organ donation  percent versus  percent wanting to be buried with all of their organs  percent versus  percent and having conflicts with organ donation  percent versus  percent There were however no differences between the groups in the percentage of individuals who trusted that their organs would be allocated fairly or who had concerns that carrying a donor card would lead to inadequate medical care The researchers noted that the major limitation with the study is that it remains unknown whether the increased consent to become a donor would have any effect on the organ supply in the region
