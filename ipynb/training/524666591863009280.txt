Ebola has killed more than  people in Liberias capital of Monrovia But for the millionplus residents who arent sick life goes on even as their city is reshaped by death On market day the downtown is teeming with shoppers and merchants and people just hanging out It almost looks like commerce as usual until you notice all the Ebola buckets elevated plastic containers with spigots that deliver a chlorine solution for handwashing One of those buckets is next to the hair salon where Angie Gardea does braiding and weaving Her afternoon is going very slowly Business is not too fine since the Ebola she says The customers are afraid of us Thats true of many businesses And in a city where todays earnings are tomorrows groceries it means people like Gardea sometimes go hungry A block from the hair salon is a street where you can buy just about anything  from cassava to clothing to outdated cassette tapes A man in a faded Monty Python Tshirt is pushing a wheelbarrow full of plastic toys and slippers Since the outbreak he says hes been living on a dollar a day Things arent much better along the winding alley on Mamba Point where local artists sell carved wooden crocodiles and paintings of tropical scenes Foreign missionaries used to visit the wooden stalls and buy art says Suah Kollie who runs SK African Arts Shop Now they are afraid to come near him he says Even the loan shark business is hurting these days Late on a Saturday afternoon Diggs Monger who calls himself a money changer sits beneath a brightly covered umbrella outside the Monrovia Sports Bar He has no customers I got to get my food money before I go home Monger says Inside the sports bar is Antonio Francis Tuan a man who doesnt need a loan Hes a lawyer whos come to watch his favorite English football club Arsenal When Ebola first appeared Tuan and his friends stayed at home Now theyre back at the sports bar though Tuan positions himself near the open door and keeps a distance from other patrons We come here and relax a little bit have fun and go back home he says It relieve the stress from your mind
