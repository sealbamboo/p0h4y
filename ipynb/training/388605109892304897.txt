Scientists have discovered the first new form of botulinum toxin in over  years but theyre taking the unusual step of keeping key details about it secret Thats because   is one of the most poisonous substances known It   and the newly identified form of it cant be neutralized by any available treatment The researchers published two   describing their work online in   Jo  The information in those   is deliberately incomplete to prevent anyone from using it as the recipe for a potent new bioweapon This is not the usual process for publishing manuscripts We thought in this case an exception was appropriate says   an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who serves as one of the editors of the journal Normally the journal would require that the scientists disclose the genetic sequences needed to make the toxin In this case however the researchers didnt want to do that because of the security risk The journals editors ultimately agreed that they could go ahead and publish but withhold the information until new treatments were developed There was enough scientific importance that we did not want to delay the publication says Hooper Their decision comes as biologists have been grappling with how to handle potentially dangerous information Last year for example scientists and security experts had a huge argument over whether to publish the details of mutant forms of bird flu that could potentially cause a pandemic in humans Biology has long had a tradition of openness to allow people to confirm research findings and build upon others discoveries But some worry that new technologies have made it easier for basic science to be exploited by people with evil intentions And any expert in botulinum toxin knows that its history as a possible bioweapon goes back decades The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo   in downtown Tokyo in the s but these attacks failed One scholarly article on the toxin noted that a single gram could potentially kill more than a million people if it was evenly dispersed through the air and inhaled  although that would be difficult to do Botulinum toxin is normally made by bacteria and it can cause a serious and lifethreatening paralytic illness In the US botulism most commonly occurs in young infants whose stilldeveloping guts dont have the normal microbes that can inhibit the growth of the bacteria The new form of the toxin was discovered by Jason Barash and Stephen Arnon at the California Department of Public Health They use fecal samples from babies to diagnose botulism and characterize the type of toxin thats producing the disease But in the newly reported case they found a completely unexpected toxinone that cannot be neutralized by any of the currently available antibotulinum antiserums Barash and Arnon couldnt immediately be reached for comment This toxin has unusual risks and consequences for human health says   a microbiologist at Stanford University who was asked by the journal editors to   to publish the incomplete manuscript He says if this new type were deliberately misused we would have no defense Relman agreed with the decision to withhold information I want to applaud the authors for acting in a way that I think was responsible and prudent he tells Shots An editorial accompanying the report notes that the scientists consulted with numerous officials from government agencies such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention It would seem that this process or this consultation was entirely an internal withinthegovernment kind of consultation says Relman He serves on a government advisory board called the   which is supposed to provide guidance on how to handle biological information that could be misused But that committee which played an important role in the recent debate whether to publish controversial research on bird flu apparently wasnt consulted this time around None of us had heard of this work until I was sent it says Relman Asked if people who needed to know the information to develop countermeasures were going to be able to access it Mass Generals Hooper says That was our understanding yes But some say that not sharing scientific work in the usual way because of fears it could fall into the wrong hands carries its own risks Ronald Atlas a biologist and bioweapons expert at the University of Louisville in Kentucky says he agrees with the decision in this case But I have real concerns about how often we would do this and what it does to the overall implication of advancement in the life sciences he tells NPR He says that advancement depends on biologists being able to replicate each others work and use that research to take the next step forward  something thats not possible if scientists and journals withhold critical details He notes that if this sets a precedent and biologists start withholding information that they deem too risky that could slow down the communitys ability to do things like search for new treatments Thats the last thing you want when youre facing a public health threat he notes
