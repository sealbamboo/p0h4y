The ebola virus that has killed almost  people in West Africa this year is fatal for up to  of those infected according to the World Health Organization WHO But note the words up to What is the normal fatality rate asks James Fletcher  The WHO describes ebola as one of the worlds most virulent diseases It is according to the organisations website a severe often fatal illness with a case fatality rate   A case fatality rate  or CFR  is a relatively simple measurement Its the number of people who die from an illness divided by the number of people diagnosed with it But in the current outbreak the proportion of infected people dying is far lower than  That  figure actually comes from one outbreak of ebola which took place in the Congo between  and  Its the highest rate we have ever seen says Maimuna Majumder a biostatistician and epidemiologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The cumulative average considering   is actually closer to to and the current outbreak has a CFR of about   though its subject to change as the outbreak goes on This figure of  however is an average taken from several countries The fatality rate    in Guinea its about  whereas in Liberia its  and in Sierra Leone its  Why the variation  The main factors according to Majumder are the level of preparedness and the availability and quality of medical care Another factor  when it comes to the varying CFR from one outbreak to the next  may be the different strains of the disease Of the five known ebola strains the Zaire and Sudan strains have been responsible for most deaths The Zaire strains average fatality rate is  and the Sudan strains is   research on the current outbreak in Guinea suggests that it is   The CFR doesnt tell you how contagious a disease is Ebola transmitted through contact with bodily fluids is much less contagious than airborne diseases such as influenza or measles What it can do is indicate how serious the disease is for those patients infected with it But as weve seen this varies When you have large ranges of CFR like you do with ebola it isnt really appropriate to give one extreme or the other Majumder says I think if we were to use a CFR for ebola we really ought to give the case average since initial emergence of the disease in   and that is significantly less than the  estimate that we hear a lot of in the media And which we also hear about on the WHO website
