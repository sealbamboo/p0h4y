A new report out Monday threatens to reignite the fierce debate over when women should get mammograms It shows that many women diagnosed with breast cancer before age  who died had not ever been screened  and the authors suggest that guidelines should be changed to encourage earlier regular mammograms for all women But other experts called the study flawed and said it would confuse women more than they already are Mammogram screening has been a sticky subject for years and there was an uproar when the US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF   that most women should not start getting regular mammograms until they are   Screening women earlier the group said doesnt save enough lives to justify the expense worry and needless procedures that women go through when they get a falsepositive result a suspiciouslooking mammogram that turns out not to be a tumor And many experts say that the types of tumors that kill younger women are fastgrowing and are not usually caught by mammograms For the latest report a research team at Harvard Medical School looked at the cases of  women diagnosed with breast cancer between  and  checking their medical records until  Of those  died of breast cancer Among those who died  percent had never had a mammogram They concluded that this shows that earlier screening could have saved lives Most deaths from breast cancer occur in unscreened women To maximize mortality reduction and lifeyears gained initiation of regular screening before age  years should be encouraged Dr Daniel Kopans of Massachusetts General Hospital and colleagues wrote in their paper published in the journal Cancer But other experts questioned the analysis Just because someone got cancer and hadnt been screened doesnt necessarily mean that a mammogram would have caught the tumor in time to save the patients life according to the National Cancer Institute  Finding cancer early does not always reduce a womans chance of dying from breast cancer the NCI  Even though mammograms can detect malignant tumors that cannot be felt treating a small tumor does not always mean that the woman will not die from the cancer A fastgrowing or aggressive cancer may have already spread to other parts of the body before it is detected It is one of the reasons that actress Angelina Jolie when she found out she had genetic mutations that gave her an  percent chance of developing breast cancer Many women with his genetic risks of breast cancer worry that a mammogram  My worry here is that people will assume from the article that if you find a cancer through screening youre going to save that persons life said Dr Laura Esserman head of the breast cancer center at the University of California San Francisco  In fact what they show is exactly the problem that we face We know that younger women are more likely to develop the killer cancers Esserman added Screening works best for more slowgrowing cancers Doctors worry about sending mixed messages to women Screening the right women can save lives and there are fears that women may just give up and skip screening altogether if they fear it wont do them any good And women with a high risk of breast cancer  for example those with a family history of the disease  do need to start screening early All of us in the field are trying to figure out better treatments better screening and better prevention Esserman said Studies have found that women  when they get a questionable finding on a mammogram and need to have followup And   found that women were in fact being diagnosed with breast cancers that never would have killed them Researchers found that as many as a third of cancers detected through routine mammograms may not be lifethreatening They said  million women may have been overdiagnosed which means they were needlessly treated not to mention emotionally distressed A study earlier this year showed that women over    every other year is fine Thats what the USPSTF recommends But other groups  and the US government itself  have rebelled against this Our policies remain unchanged Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in  Indeed I would be very surprised if any private insurance company changed its mammographycoverage decisions as a result of this action  The American Cancer Society which publishes Cancer recommends that women get a mammogram every year starting at age  So does the NCI The  health care law requires insurers to pay for mammograms without charging patients any fees such as a copay Medicare will pay for its patients to have a mammogram every year Most recommendations say women should talk with their doctors about screening  when they want to start and how often they would like to have the scans
