Summar Ruelle was in the best shape of her life when she got devastating news The yearold mother of two had just lost  pounds of stubborn baby weight via diet and rigorous exercise like kickboxing and running  Then in late August of last year the Beaverton Ore mom discovered a mass in her left breast A mammogram showed nothing but an ultrasound and subsequent tests told a different story Summar had Stage IV breast cancer which had spread to her lymph nodes spine ribs hips and collar bone Careening from appointment to appointment Summar suddenly found herself debating mastectomy chemo and the removal of her ovaries with a clutch of strangers in white coats  But a week later all that seemed insignificant to her   The Ruelles yeardaughter Sapphire whod been suffering from unexplained bruises and idiopathic fevers had been to the doctor for some tests as well and the results were unthinkable Sapphire had leukemia I was absolutely devastated says Summar now  It was like my diagnosis became nonexistent at that moment I wanted to cancel everything  my surgery my treatments I wanted to forget all of that I felt I needed to be there for her While the American Cancer Society has no statistics on simultaneous parentchild cancer diagnoses Summars oncologist Dr Alison Conlin says their situation is quite unusual For a daughter and mom to simultaneously be going through this and for a mom to be that young and have advanced disease from the getgo thats very rare she says It all adds up to make it fairly unique although Im sure its not one of a kind sadly Stress fear financial hardship dueling surgeries and treatments such is life for families whove been slapped with a heartbreaking double diagnosis of cancer People ask How do you do it But we dont have a choice says Summar Its heartbreaking but thats how things played out For Summer and her husband Pascal going forward is the only option Shortly after both mom and daughter were diagnosed we were literally in surgery at the same time at two different hospitals says Summar But it was necessary We didnt have the luxury of time I couldnt waste any more time and she couldnt have any delays We had to both go forward Mom and daughter stayed in touch via FaceTime while friends and family shuttled back and forth between the hospitals and home making sure everybody  including the Ruelles old son Jayden  was being cared for Summar had surgery to remove her ovaries one breast and  lymph nodes her condition also forced her to leave a plum job as a business analyst with Columbia Sportswear While her doctors decided against chemotherapy she did go through five weeks of daily radiation treatment and is currently undergoing other treatments Side effects and complications  infections debilitating leg pain and the pocket of fluid buildup or seroma  that shes had since breast surgery have become a way of life  Sapphires treatment plate is just as full Although shes past the first wave of heavyduty chemotherapy the kind that takes your hair Sapphire still has a year and a half of maintenance chemo ahead of her much of which will be administered by her parents  Summar says shes found support through social media sites like Twitter as well as a hospital group for women with metastatic cancer She has yet to connect with another parent dealing with a similar set of circumstances though Our scenario is so unique she says I havent found any moms in my position There was another mother with a sick child but then the child passed away Its really tough Not surprisingly their yearold who has been on steroids since her diagnosis has had her own problems grappling with the pain the anger and the profound changes to her life According to her mom Sapphire was aggressive at first taking her anger out on her parents We would call it roid rage says Summar It was very traumatizing The beginning was a real struggle Misunderstandings about the treatment and its side effects didnt help   At one point she didnt think her hair was going to grow back until she was an adult says Summar She started crying and my mom explained that when she stopped her medicine it would grow back But that was tough for her she asked about the hair a lot Being away from her school friends has been hard on the little girl as well She isnt allowed to be around school children because of the possibility of illness and infection says Summar Thats been tough on her and its hard for her friends to understand too With both parents out of work the Ruelles rely on Summars disability as well as donations from friends family and strangers to get by Summars best friend has helped organize online fundraisers as well as a meal train for the family  Summar and Sapphire draw strength from each other Even though shes  she gets this thing to a degree that she can comfort me and I can comfort her says Summar She can totally go and see me get my blood drawn and my seroma drained and be supportive She told me Mom you go to all of my appointments why cant I go to yours Sue Harden a Los Angelesbased psychologist who specializes in chronic illness says this kind of togethertime is therapeutic Being able to see what happens to her mom when she goes to those appointments is going to help reduce stress for her says Harden whos worked with families where both parents have had cancer but never helped navigate a simultaneous parentchild diagnosis While the situation is obviously very stressful for all involved she says there are strategies that can make a difference such as reaching out for help and establishing new patterns and routines  You set it up so its not so traumatic for the child she says Every time you go the hospital you might visit the fish It just becomes a routine For kids  theyre incredibly resilient  it becomes the new normal of their life Summar acknowledges that if theres been any kind of positive its that their cancer fiasco has tightened the bond between mother and daughter  We have different cancers but were going through the same thing she said We take some of the same medicines We take each others BandAids off We talk about how we feel and about what we want to do when we feel better Yet there are key differences between mom and daughters diagnoses Its kind of strange these two situations being run sidebyside says Pascal Sapphire has a  to  percent success rate with a road map for what theyre going to do But with Summars situation its living scan to scan I wish there was a road map and a finish to it But we just have to deal with it day by day Undaunted Summar says her big focus is raising awareness about stage IV breast cancer toward that end the   People have an idea in their mind about what breast cancer is she says You get a mastectomy and then new boobs and then youre fine But thats not it At first a lot of people didnt understand what mets metastasized breast cancer was They were like Youre going to beat this Summar and I had to educate them Im Stage IV cancer Im going to be in treatment the rest of my life  Despite the unknowns the ubiquitous doctors appointments and the stress of dealing with cancer every day the Ruelles are quick to point out their blessings Friends in the community support them with meals and fundraisers and Sapphires hair is finally growing back much to her delight Last month the family went to Florida to visit Walt Disney World through the Make a Wish program Come September Sapphire will be back in school allowing Summar to take on a new volunteer position coordinating fundraising and awareness events for the research and   Im excited about that she says I have something to focus on as I look toward the future To give me more hope Ive always been a working woman and wasnt really ready to stop working This gives me an opportunity to feel like Im making an important difference
