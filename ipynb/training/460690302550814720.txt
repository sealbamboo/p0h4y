A leading abortion provider says more needs to be understood about why some women have repeat terminations Marie Stopes UK which carried out  abortions last year  many of them for the NHS   It commissioned phone interviews with over  young women who have had more than one abortion  It says  of women were using contraception when they became pregnant and the women who had had at least one previous abortion were just as likely as women having their first abortion to be in a stable relationship Marie Stopes UK says too many women are being let down by a lack of ongoing support in choosing and using the most effective method of contraception  But antiabortion campaigners say more contraception is not the answer A yearold woman whom we have given the false name Lisa who has had four abortions has said she wants others to learn from her careless actions She said she does not think terminations are right  but she did not wish to have three or four children with different fathers She said With the first one you dont know whats going to happen Youre scared and anxious  But once you see all the other women there it doesnt make you feel that bad  And it does get easier with the more you have I know that sounds really bad but that is just how it is Lisa had her first abortion at the age of  She went ahead with her second pregnancy  and her daughter was born when she had just turned   She then had another abortion when she was  and her third and fourth last year  at the age of   Two of the terminations resulted from brief relationships  the other two while she was seeing a man who was drinking and jobless  Lisa said I was really careless I cant blame anyone else  I should have been more responsible because Ive killed a life now And it wasnt that babys fault  I thought that if I could tell my story maybe young women would think twice about having sex without contraception or sleeping with guys they dont really know  I want to tell other women that abortions arent just something you should do It could change your life  She added Ive tried the pill the patch the injection the coil and the implant And they didnt work  I bled continuously while I was on them And the coil gave me pains so I had to take that out after a month  No one wants to keep on having terminations  so I have tried different methods of contraception but they dont seem to work for me All of Lisas abortions took place in the first two months of pregnancy  She works in the public sector in London and hopes to buy a house one day Lisa said When I was in school there was no kind of sex education talk My mum and family just brushed it under the carpet  The only person that did really help me was the nurse at the clinic at my doctors surgery  They had a clinic every Tuesday for  to  year olds  When you have an abortion they talk to you about what steps you can take afterwards  They give you a lot of help  but at the time you just want to get out of there Youre not really listening Lisa said she did not have any regrets She added I dont think abortion is all right at all But I did what was best for me and my daughter at the time  I dont want to have three or four kids by three or four different dads Marie Stopes UKs director of policy Genevieve Edwards told me shed like to see the abortion rate coming down faster She said Our research shows all sorts of women of all ages can experience repeat unwanted pregnancy  In the past weve failed to tackle this because we didnt want to stigmatise women The general secretary of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children SPUC Paul Tully said Increasing the provision of contraception isnt going to reduce the abortion rate Contraception doesnt address the social financial and relationship reasons which are usually the drivers for women to seek abortions  We need to answer those problems and then well see the abortion rate coming down
