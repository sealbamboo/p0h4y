The news for   just keeps getting worse Now doctors are reporting two new spinal conditions among patients successfully treated for meningitis a brain infection One involves   pusfilled sacs of fluid around the spine A more serious condition is    inflammation of tissue around the nerve roots coming out of the spine The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesnt yet have a good handle on the number of these new complications but there appear to be dozens so far Most have been in Michigan and Tennessee which together make up nearly half the   in  states Twentynine people have died But cases of spinal infections have recently been seen in Virginia and Indiana too What were hearing is that patients have been treated for meningitis and improved Then they returned with these complications   of CDC told Shots We dont have a good understanding of why certain people are developing these conditions He says patients with these complications dont seem to be older or more immunocompromised so were not able to predict whos going to develop this    that about a third of  meningitis patients treated at   in Ann Arbor Mich have developed epidural abscesses Another  have had abscesses without prior meningitis Chiller says the situation is an unprecedented event so doctors and public health experts are learning how to cope with it as they go along The new problem affects different layers of tissue that encase the spine The dura mater is the outermost layer Next is the arachnoid a delicate cobwebby membrane that carries much of the spinal cords blood supply Of the two complications epidural meaning on or around the dura abscesses are less dangerous and more amenable to treatment If antifungal medication doesnt do the job neurosurgeons can often debride or remove the infected tissue and drain the infection Arachnoiditis is much more difficult to treat Delicate nerve roots are caught in a thick fibrous material that compresses them causing intense pain numbness paralysis pinsandneedles sensations sometimes loss of bladder control and other neurologic symptoms Surgery is not usually an option if ever and the success of drug therapy is uncertain Chiller says experts dont think its a good idea to infuse antifungal drugs directly into the spine because they can increase inflammation and make matters worse Patients who develop these spinal complications may need to be on antifungal medication often intravenously for six months to a year Chiller says The trickiest problem for doctors is diagnosing epidural abscesses or arachnoiditis because many of the patients exposed to the moldcontaminated steroids already have chronic back pain Thats why they were getting injections right Chiller says So the real challenge is identifying whether the pain over the site of injection or where they have chronic pain is worse  or is different Theres no telling how many patients will develop the spinal complications One indication is that so far most of the known victims previously had meningitis That appears to limit the risk largely to the  or so reported meningitis cases  and the others expected to be discovered in the coming weeks We think the last of these products were given around Oct  so were already a month out from that Chiller says Weve passed the peak of the mean incubation period  the period between injection and onset of symptoms  which is around  days Other meningitis cases will be reported he says but they should begin to taper off quickly this month An estimated  Americans received injections of the moldcontaminated steroid made by New England Compounding Center a Massachusetts company that has been shut down Federal inspectors   fungal and bacteria contamination in many samples of drugs made by the Massachusetts company A   is under way and a number of civil suits have already been filed
