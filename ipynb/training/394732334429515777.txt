Its really only a sliver of time when humans build the bulk of their skeleton At age  the bones start a big growth spurt And by the time puberty ends around  or  years old the adultsized skeleton is all but done about  percent complete But doctors say a lot of children arent getting what they need to do that Calcium and vitamin D are essential sure but so is lots of time jumping and running Its the magic window of time when bone is built says   an orthopedic surgeon who directs the pediatric bone health program at Childrens National Health system in Washington DC And when it comes to bones bigger is definitely better she says The wider and thicker the bone the harder it is to break or tear Just about everybody knows that calcium and vitamin D are essential to build strong bones But children and teenagers are all too often shunning the foods that would help them get enough calcium and vitamin D to build those bones Federal health officials recommend that children between the ages of  and  get  milligrams of calcium every day That translates into four to five glasses of milk or the equivalent According to   an adolescent medicine specialist at the Stanford University School of Medicine most teens are not drinking anywhere near that amount Only about  percent of high school students are drinking milk according to a  federal   And only about  percent of girls do In part thats because milk drinking is viewed as uncool says Golden and teens particularly girls often think of milk as fattening But thats not true he says One glass of skim milk contains no fat and approximately  calories about the same caloric content as an apple Now of course there are other sources of calcium  yogurt and cheese for example But lots of kids think those are fattening too Golden says And while vegetables can be a source of calcium youd have to eat an awful lot of them to reach the recommended levels  one cup of broccoli has just  mg of calcium Fortunately there are other food sources including fortified orange juice breakfast cereals and tofu Calcium supplements are often recommended for adults to meet their recommended daily requirement But for kids Golden says its far better to eat calciumrich foods Thats because the body absorbs calcium better from food than it does from supplements Even if boys and girls get the recommended amount of calcium if theyre not also getting vitamin D it wont make a difference You can drink as much calcium as you like but if you dont have enough vitamin D youre not going to absorb it Golden says The vitamin which is actually a hormone interacts with the lining of the stomach and intestines to help calcium get absorbed In  the Institute of Medicine   that children and most adults need  international units of vitamin D a day They found no evidence of widespread vitamin D deficiency though people these days spend much less time out in the sun which stimulates the bodys production of vitamin D Vitamin D is found in foods like fatty fish such as salmon and sardines but teenage girls were least likely of all age groups to get enough vitamin D in food according to a    One interesting point says Golden Farmed salmon is not as vitamin D rich as wildcaught salmon And like calcium vitamin D is added to foods like milk and orange juice If a teenager still isnt getting enough vitamin D from fish milk and other healthy foods Golden says a reasonable workaround is taking supplements of about  international units per day Perhaps the secret ingredient to building strong bones for a lifetime is exercise says orthopedic surgeon Tosi One   found that when children jumped up and down between classes totaling about  minutes a day they added mass to their leg bones The bounce is whats important Tosi says We think the bounce probably sends an electrical or other signal right up the skeleton saying OK time to give more time to build more bone  So jumping jogging tennis and basketball are all good options Federal health officials suggest kids get at least one hour of exercise every day
