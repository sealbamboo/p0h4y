The world of health care like any is full of haves and havenots     Its not hard to the haves at SherwinWilliams corporate headquarters in downtown Cleveland where some  employees have access to an inhouse health and wellness center     The huge paint company offers comprehensive health coverage to its employees and encourages them to take a break from work for an exercise class a workout on the elliptical trainer or a run on the treadmill Like many other large employers SherwinWilliams serves as its own health insurer Because the company pays for employees health claims it has a strong incentive to keep workers healthy SherwinWilliams is betting it will be better off bearing those costs directly rather than paying premiums to an insurance company The key is to have healthy engaged productive present employees says Martha Lanning the companys director of health and wellness plans SherwinWilliams and its employees arent likely to use the individual Obamacare marketplaces but they will help bear part of the cost Lanning says it takes time and money for companies like SherwinWilliams to sorting through the legal and administrative issues surrounding the Affordable Care Act There are direct costs too We also have to pay that transitional reinsurance fee that totals for us with some other aspects of the Affordable Care Act about  million in  she says The government collects  from large selfinsured employers and insurance companies for every person covered by a plan  both employees and their dependents All told these fees are expected to amount to   The money goes into a fund to reimburse health insurance companies for some extra costs involved in providing coverage to highrisk people on the Obamacare exchanges You might think of it as a subsidy from big business for making insurance coverage available to everyone without regard to preexisting conditions The fee will be reduced next year and is set to disappear completely by  Mark Hall a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University says its a sensible solution to a temporary problem The great feature of the Affordable Care Act is it now makes everyone qualify for coverage but that means the first people to sign up or to show up are going to be the folks who need it the most Hall says So we expect particularly at the outset that there is going to be a heavy load on the insurance pool of highcost people But Helen Darling who heads the Washington DCbased   fears the fee wont go away as planned Once something is in law and somebodys got an idea about a new tax youre always nervous that thats going to become a way to finance something else and something that is supposed to go away and be sunsetted wouldnt be because they needed the money Darling says For SherwinWilliams with   the added cost appears modest at most In fact human resource executives at companies nationwide said as much in  the consulting company The survey concluded found  percent of executives felt the Affordable Care Act was having no effect on business operations and performance apart from benefits And to the extent there is a financial burden employers are shifting some of it to employees Mercer also found that most large employers are requiring workers to pay part of the ACA fees SherwinWilliams for its part is committed to providing insurance to its employees says Lanning Its going to be the differentiating factor for businesses moving forward she says After all she adds the key to an engaged and productive workforce is its health
