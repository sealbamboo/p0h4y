Sunworshipers out working on their tans might not just be after a bronzed look They may be addicts A new study shows that ultraviolet radiation can not only trigger skin browning but also spark the release of feelgood chemicals known as endorphins Scientists have suspected for some time that exposure to UV radiation has the potential to become addictive The New Jersey woman known as   brought attention to the problem popularly known as tanorexia Though the new findings are in mice the researchers believe they may explain why some people cant seem to kick the   despite all the public service announcements about cancer risks and   Since endorphins work their magic through the same pathway as   sunbathers and tanning salon fans may actually become addicted to UV The researchers are particularly concerned about the endorphin effect in   Tanning salons are for the most part regulated at the cosmetics level in many states said study coauthor Dr David Fisher chairman of the dermatology department at the Mass General Hospital and Harvard Medical School Teenagers can walk in and easily have tanning bed exposure Many package deals are inexpensive in the beginning Companies seem to have learned from experience that tanning has a propensity to be addictive So its the perfect business model For the new study Fisher and his colleagues ran several experiments in mice In the first rodents with shaved backs were exposed to UV at a dose that is roughly equivalent to  to  minutes of midday sun exposure in Florida during the summer for a fairskinned person of average tanning Fisher says adding that the exposure wasnt enough to sunburn the mice After a week of mouse UV exposure the researchers tested levels of betaendorphin in the rodents blood Sure enough endorphin levels had risen sharply so much so they were enough to blunt the rodents sensation of pain Though the researchers cant say anything about how the endorphins make mice feel they suspect the brain chemicals create a pleasant experience that both mice and humans will want to revisit There are lots of data for opiate drugs that clearly show euphoria wellbeing etc but I believe it is currently unknown whether betaendorphin the bodys natural opioid does the same things Fisher says It is a plausible speculation that it could since it acts on the same molecular circuitry in our bodies and brains Of course the other side of addiction is withdrawal In a later experiment the researchers injected rodents that had been regularly exposed to UV with a drug that blocks opioidsthe same drug that is given to people when they overdose on heroin Sure enough the mice started showing signs of withdrawal including shaking shivering and teeth chattering Although the new study is in rodents Dr Charles Bradberry suspects its findings would be applicable to humans This is a very basic and fundamental neurochemical pathway says Bradberry a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh The thing that is very impressive is it does suggest that if people stop being exposed to UV light they may experience discomfort and will learn that by reexposing themselves they will relieve the discomfort It fits very nicely with certain conceptualizations of addiction And Bradberry says it may go a long way to explaining why people continue to spend time in tanning salons despite all the dire warnings of consequences The immediate gratification has a way of obscuring distant dangers he says
