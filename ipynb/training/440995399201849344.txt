Cancer patients who get chemotherapy in the last months of their lives are more likely to die in the intensive care unit rather than where they wish a study finds And with more than half of all people with incurable cancer getting   in the months before they die many people could be suffering more than needed Palliative chemotherapy is used to control symptoms and perhaps buy a patient a bit more time once its clear the person will likely die from the cancer But this study which involved  patients at eight academic medical centers found that chemotherapy may be interfering with other important aspects of care in those final weeks People getting palliative chemo were more likely to be given CPR or be put on a ventilator in the last week of life And  percent died in an ICU compared to  percent of patients who didnt get the chemo Chemo patients were less likely to die at home with only  percent dying in their preferred place compared to  percent of other patients I didnt expect to see such a powerful association says   the lead author of the study because we give chemotherapy so frequently I honestly as an oncologist was somewhat skeptical But the studys percentages came out the same even when Wright and her colleagues accounted for things like how active the patients were and whether theyd discussed their endoflife wishes with their doctors The findings I took from this are not that its wrong to give palliative chemotherapy says Wright an oncologist at DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston Its not It does help patients Instead she says the findings should send a message to doctors that they need to   about what they want the end of life to be like Earlier studies have found that  percent of patients get chemotherapy in their last two weeks of life  when its almost certainly doing them no good In  the American Society for Clinical Oncology listed chemotherapy at lifes end as one of the top five   But oncologists have been reluctant to make that shift Wright tells Shots A decade ago oncologists argued vehemently that you can do people harm by telling them that they are dying Wright says I dont think thats where we are now But realizing that and making that happen are two different things And patients may be reluctant too In this study patients said they would continue chemo if it enabled them to live just one more week Still patients are usually relieved when doctors bring up endoflife choices Wright says The takehome message is not that palliative chemotherapy is futile but that it has the potential to be ineffective and potentially harmful especially if we dont understand what patients want
