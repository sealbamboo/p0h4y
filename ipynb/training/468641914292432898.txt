Politics is one of the most complex areas of human thought So when I heard the claim that scanning peoples brains could predict political choices I was naturally sceptical  Brain science is achieving extraordinary insights but mapping what you can measure in a brain scanner on to human social interactions is a huge leap like trying to find exact correlations between two bowls of soup  only one soup is made from vegetables macaroni and stock and the other soup is made up of abstract ideas like economics equality and history But in the US and in Britain psychologists and neuroscientists are doing serious research into linking political attitudes to what goes on inside our skulls   By looking at how the brain is processing political phenomena we can understand a little better why were doing what were doing says Darren Schreiber of Exeter University  He started using fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging while in America to look at patterns of activity in the brain when people made decisions especially those involving risk  While their decisions werent all that different Dr Schreiber saw variation in the parts of the brain that were most active in selfdescribed conservatives and those who called themselves liberal  He wont generalise about exactly how conservatives and liberals think but he does think his work suggests that differing political outlooks reflect deepseated divergence in how we understand the world Neuroscientist Read Montague of University College London and Virginia Tech was sceptical when approached to help political scientists with their research  I laughed them out of the room he says But when John Hibbing and his team at the University of Nebraska showed him their data he changed his tune  Their studies of twins suggested that political allegiance was partly genetic  Not as strongly as height for example but enough to suggest that some people really could be dyedinthewool conservatives  or dyedintheDNA at least But how exactly could genetic differences be expressed as political differences in the real world  Dr Hibbing and Dr Montague wanted to know if these innate predispositions could be observed at work in the brain  So they tested instinctive responses to images designed to provoke disgust and fear and found a link between the strength of response to the pictures and how socially conservative a persons views were likely to be  We need to make clear the distinction between economic conservatism and social conservatism says Dr Hibbing  People who have more protective attitudes about things like immigration who are more eager to punish criminals people who oppose abortion these are individuals who seem to have a much stronger reaction to disgusting images  These reactions are measured biologically so the studies are linking explicit conscious opinions with subconscious responses In the research done so far its attitudes to risk disgust and fear that show the strongest links to overt political views  The difficulty comes when trying to apply these insights to a specific situation  American social conservatives might also be strongly in favour of a smaller state and a freer market In former Eastern bloc countries social conservatism might make you more likely to hanker after the old days of Communism  Behavioural economist Liam Delaney is studying the psychology of the Scottish independence referendum campaigns but he warns against thinking that our subconscious instincts can be a complete guide to the debate  Biological determinism is a little tricky with these situations because theres just too much variation across different political systems   So I think youd risk simplifying things by saying that there is a hardwire thats determining the outcome Darren Schreiber agrees Human politics is extraordinarily complex Its not just reduced to brain and I want to be very clear that Im not a biological determinist Were hardwired not to be hardwired  If people were simplistic we wouldnt need these very big complex brains None of the scientists doing this research claims that our political views are completely innate  Human brains change throughout our lives so neuroscientists are careful to say that our experiences as well as our genes have shaped the brain theyre putting in the scanner But John Hibbing believes our subconscious drives which evolved long ago in response to urgent physical dangers direct our political minds more than we like to think  People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational that theyre a sensible response to the world around them so when we come along and say Maybe there are these predispositions influential but perhaps not fully in your conscious awareness thats not the way we like to view our own political beliefs He compares our innate ideological tendencies to which hand we prefer to use We used to think of this as a habit that could be changed yet now know it to be deeply embedded in biology That would have profound implications for political life If being leftwing is as innate as being lefthanded why bother with politics at all  Could we just put everybody in a brain scanner and infer what they think and will always think and were born to think and stop trying to change anybodys mind I was relieved to find that even John Hibbing doesnt draw that conclusion Its not so much that I think people should just shut up and accept that some people are different But I do think they should accept that some people are either not going to change or theyre going to be extremely difficult to change and that simply by continuing to shout at them were not contributing to anything So we wont be swapping the ballot box for the brain scanner any time soon  Which is good because I still think politics should be about taking our ideas out into the world beyond our skulls the real world of challenging beliefs and clashing opinions Perhaps Im just hardwired to think that way
