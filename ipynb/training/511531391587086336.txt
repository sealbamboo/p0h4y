Its easy to be motivated with a legion of orcs on your tail But on the streets of Los Angeles on regular old Earth Astin must find the drive to run from within On March  Astin ran the LA Marathon for the third time  but as he explained in a recent interview he doesnt always find it easy to push himself to lace up those shoes I was about  and my friends stepdad asked me to do a K with him because his son  who was more into basketball  didnt want to It was amazing and I still remember the time I got  Later I ran crosscountry for Crossroads School in Santa Monica I really wanted a varsity letterman jacket but you had to be in the top seven to race I was ninth But one guy got sick and another was hit by a car he wasnt badly hurt and I snuck my way in After high school it became a lot more sporadic I would run around UCLA sometimes and occasionally see a sign for a K race and register for that but I wasnt that dedicated From  to now I have every single run recorded on my Nike Plus system Ive noticed a definite pattern to my running where Ill go for two months without a single run and then Ill run  miles in a month and then  miles the next month then  the months after that then work my way back down to nothing again Im not sure why Im doing it If you look at photos of me during the months off Im  pounds fatter and at the peak Im skinny Its an unhealthy pattern and Ive tried to figure it out My diet is always terrible unfortunately I dont know moderation I kind of peak at how far I can push my body and then I run out of determination for the habit and start easing off Its really just a lack of focus and discipline There are always a couple of months in the year when Im really slothlike but when Im on the upswing you pass a certain threshold  where the addiction comes back Then its off to the races Im much more prone to feeling down a lot I just feel sluggish and unmotivated You feel like youll never get back to it and thats just awful It takes time to evolve out of it There is a bottom where my mind will start gearing itself up again My mind knows that once it starts its going to go hard The amazing thing is youre one short run away from feeling like youre moving in the right direction Something about the blood moving makes you feel better I think I am getting better at minimizing periods of inactivity At  now it takes almost no time to get out of shape and fat And it takes longer to get back into shape So a selfpreservation instinct kicks in where you just dont want to do that hard work again You just want to do the hard work of maintaining it instead This was my third and they were all LA Marathons My first was  with a time of  I did  but on a torn calf muscle and my time was  It was a miracle I was able to run it For  my time was  and I feel its not representative of what Im capable of I came out of the box too fast and never once was I comfortable during the race I am determined to get a subfourhour marathon I want to do this by next year I saw a lot of people running barefoot in the LA Marathon and it looks to me like it would be really hard I wouldnt be a big proponent of it I just dont think it would be a good thing for me to do
