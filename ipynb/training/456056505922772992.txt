A year after she lost most of her right leg in the Boston Marathon bombings Roseann Sdoia refuses to sugarcoat the recovery Its been hard difficult on a daily basis tougher than most people imagine it might be said the yearold Boston woman who was waiting for two friends who were running the race when the backpack carrying the second explosive detonated at her feet I think people do need to know its a process she said of healing from the attacks that killed three people and injured  Are we good For the most part yes But there are still a lot of underlying situations that are there Before it happened to her Sdoia said she couldnt have imagined that it would take several prosthetists and four prosthetics companies before she found an artificial limb with the right fit and function She couldnt have understood the effort it takes to put on her new leg and wear it all day I put it on first thing in the morning and I dont take it off until  pm at night Even if its rubbing in the wrong places I just suck it up Its exhausting to use By the end of the day Im beat Im tired Sdoia said she has been overwhelmed with support from so many people  family friends complete strangers  who have donated time and money and energy to help her recover I appreciate what youre doing for me she said But for a woman who was always independent and who has always enjoyed a full life of work friends and fun it has been a huge change to take a leave of absence from her real estate development and investment firm and be forced to focus on recovery Its overwhelming that you are in a position of such need Sdoia said And for someone who ran three to five miles a few times a week partly because it felt so good and partly so she could have a snack and a cocktail and not worry about gaining weight Sdoia acknowledged that the physical and emotional toll of her injuries add up You feel ugly you feel unnatural she said You feel like the freak in the room There have been some positive changes too Shes dating Mike Materia the firefighter who held her hand in the ambulance on the way to the hospital Shes been using her new running prosthetic leg and getting stronger Shes looking forward to the future But Sdoia still wants people to know theres a long way to go Even though our hair isnt singed anymore and our burns have healed theres still a lot internally and physically that we need to get through she said
