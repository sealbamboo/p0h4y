 Your birth plan may have lasting repercussions for your newborns digestive health according to new research published in the   Whether a woman has a vaginal or Cesareansection birth as well as her choice to breastfeed or go with formula could have an impact on the formation of her babys gut bacteria which in turn plays a role in many longterm health issues Gut bacteria not only helps process food and regulate the digestive system it also helps build overall immunity and safeguards the body against infection Potential diseases that can arise from impairment of gut bacteria include allergies asthma cancer and irritable bowel syndrome to name a few The potential longterm consequences of decisions regarding mode of delivery and infant diet are not to be underestimated wrote the study authors in the journal Infants born by Cesarean delivery are at increased risk of asthma obesity and   whereas breastfeeding is variably protective against these and other disorders Previous research attempted to understand the often questionable role of gut bacteria in infants yet scientists were limited to only testing lab cultures that couldnt t account for  percent of intestinal microbes Now researchers have used new DNA sequencing technology to analyze gut microbes from  healthy infants   percent born via Csection and  percent breastfed  from the   which gathers data on the influence of environmental factors before birth on child health They found that certain good bacteria groups were absent in babies delivered by Csection as opposed to vaginally even if the babies were breastfed Similarly formulafed newborns when compared to breastfed infants also showed a substantial deficiency in gut microbes Our findings are particularly timely given the recent affirmation of the gut microbiota as a super organ with diverse roles in health and disease and the increasing concern over rising Cesarean delivery and insufficient exclusive breastfeeding in Canada wrote study coauthor Anita Kozyrskyj PhD of the University of Alberta in the report We want parents and physicians to realize that their decisions regarding Csection and   can impact their infants gut microbiome and this can have potentially lifelong effects on the childs health study coauthor Meghan Azad PhD a postdoctoral student at the university said in a press release Uncovering this link between diet delivery mode and gut bacteria helps to advance the understanding of crucial digestive microbes in the development of healthy infants
