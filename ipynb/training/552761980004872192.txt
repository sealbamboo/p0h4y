Do you have trouble understanding your doctors English No Well apparently some people do  GPs who dont speak very good English are something that people out there are talking about The Ukip leader told Sky News that nonEnglishspeaking health workers shouldnt be employed and said its scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country We factchecked this Heres what we learned To put it bluntly no says Dr Chandra Kanneganti chair of the   BIDA All doctors who qualified outside Europe and apply for registration to work here   This means passing the academic version of the globally recognised International English Language Testing System   test in speaking listening reading and writing Accents can sometimes be hard to understand says the deputy chair of the British Medical Association   but he argues thats a problem within the UK too Sometimes you cant understand what a Scottish person is saying sometimes you have problems understanding a heavy Liverpudlian accent Language is a nonissue Farage doesnt have a leg to stand on Europeantrained doctors dont have to take the IELTS test but last summer the law was changed to give the GMC the power to check their language skills if a serious concern is raised about their ability to communicate effectively with patients and colleagues The GMC also increased the overall score needed in the IELTS test from  to  points out of  Its not a simple exam says Kanneganti You have to have a good command of English Elements include a vocab test and listening to a conversation in English then answering questions about it The most important thing people need to realise is that doctors trained in the Indian subcontinent follow the British system of education in medical school he says And more importantly the medium of education is English  particularly British English  Among the foreign doctors  had qualified in European countries The top five overseas suppliers of doctors to the UK are India  doctors Pakistan  South Africa  Nigeria  and Ireland  Around  foreign doctors a year pass the IELTS exam and the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board or PLAB which is required for them to practise in the UK Debatable Last year experts from University College London and Cambridge highlighted what they called a performance gap between overseastrained doctors and those who had attended British medical schools and suggested that the pass mark for the PLAB exam should be raised from  to  The researchers found that those whod trained overseas did much less well in entrance exams for professional bodies like the royal colleges of physicians and GPs and that their subsequent career progression was not as good The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin   said it was disturbed by the   and said fair comparisons could only be made using a common test In September   with a broader assessment of ethical values and a cap on how often candidates are permitted to retake it In  GMC figures showed that over the past five years  of the  doctors who were struck off or suspended had been trained overseas despite making up a much smaller percentage of the total number of doctors Absolutely not according to Chand because the checks are in place to ensure doctors have good English The study he says doesnt take into account factors like the stress of immigration and interruption to doctors careers Its a very complex issue he says Its not to do with English Its to do with so many other things attitudes culture immigrants coming to another country their mental health By and large their clinical competence is of a very high quality Kanneganti says of the GMC figures People complain about overseas doctors not because they make more mistakes than others but because there are inherent doubts in the minds of the general public about their competencies and a tendency to assume that their training may be inferior to that of Britishtrained doctors Its not racism at play he thinks but subconscious bias It is also a fact that a greater proportion of overseas doctors work in more emergency acute services where there are higher chances of things to go wrong he adds Actually this is by no means a new phenomenon   and with the birth of the NHS in  they were needed in even greater numbers explains Stephanie Snow a senior research associate in NHS history at the University of Manchester Attracting foreigntrained staff was the only way of keeping up with the increased provision and advances in medical technology between  and  alone the medical workforce in England increased by  and by  in Scotland By  between  and  of all NHS junior doctors were from India Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and the following year Lord Cohen of Birkenhead told the House of Lords that without them the health service would have collapsed Today the evergrowing elderly population combined with even more rapidly expanding technologies continues to create additional need Given that it takes five years to train a doctor in the UK cutting overseas doctors from the equation is simply not an option The history of foreigntrained doctors and UK health services suggests that it would be most effective for policy to focus on providing better support for these doctors in terms of acculturation and mentoring given that the UK has been dependent on their skills for decades says Snow To Farages mind its a scandal to others the contribution of those whove come from overseas and prop up our system  often working in less popular specialisms such as general practice psychiatry and geriatrics  deserves a little more respect In StokeonTrent where Im from  of GPs qualified outside the EU says Kanneganti They are popular with patients too in  a study found that British patients favourite doctors were young female and Asian It costs  to  to train a GP in Britain and even then theres no guarantee they wont   Kanneganti points out Overseas doctors arrive readytrained and keen to stay Farage should stop talking politics and realise the immense contribution of immigrant doctors he says  This article was amended on  January  An earlier version referred to IELTS tests as spelling rather than speaking listening reading and writing
