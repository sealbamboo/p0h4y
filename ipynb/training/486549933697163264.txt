Goats and Soda Stories of Life in a Changing World Thats the name of NPRs new blog covering health and all sorts of development around the world You may be thinking Goats Soda This blog is going to look at communicable diseases education struggles sanitation concerns  and its called Goats and Soda We considered many names A few seemed promising but fell short Unarrested Development Globelandia Up the Road They were too long too hard to say on the radio or too vague Then   a radio reporter on our team whos been based in South Africa for the past four years proposed Goats and Soda Traveling about in Africa he saw a lot of goats And a lot of soda In rural southern Malawi I came across a roadside snack shop in the middle of nowhere The woman running the shop somehow had a refrigerator full of cold sodas It struck me that a rather amazing sequence of events had led to that cold Coke in my hand We liked the name Its lively Its down to earth And its definitely original A google search for Goats and Soda yielded zero results Then we had to ask ourselves Does this name really make sense as a title for our blog And will it cause any concerns Goats and soda as it turns out are complicated icons In many parts of the world goats are a force for positive change Dozens of charities give goats to poor families to provide nutrition andor income But   director for international cooperation at the World Resources Institute points out that such donations can make it seem as if good things only happen to people as a result of beneficent actions by bighearted foreigners The name is creative and unique and not rude says   who posts his   about life in India on YouTube But I think you should be aware that many Indians are vegetarians and do not eat meat An alternative could be Rice and Soda  As for soda we all know it has been linked to obesity an emerging health issue in many middleincome countries such as   and China Yet global health workers are envious of the fact that Big Soda knows how to get its product to the remotest spots and keep it cold Thats what global health workers would like to do with vaccines The English nonprofit group   explores the use of sodalike strategies to keep medicines on ice So thats a little bit about whats in our name We know that it will have detractors  and we hope it will have fans as well I love the name Goats and Soda  says   professor of public policy and global health at Duke University It grabs the reader creates a curiosity in what it means and how goats and soda can be related and makes the person want to read more And we hope thats what you do
