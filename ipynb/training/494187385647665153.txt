A few weeks ago we took a look at nonverbal greetings around the world In Japan they bow Ethiopian men touch shoulders And some in the Democratic Republic of the Congo do a type of   But the American   stood apart from the rest Knocking knuckles was the only greeting we could find that signaled both victory and equality neither bumper has the upper hand so to speak But many of our readers pointed out that bumping fists may have another superior quality Its cleaner than a traditional handshake Now scientists in Wales have confirmed what these astute readers already knew Youre much less likely to pass along bacteria when you bump fists than shake hands or highfive biologists   Monday in the   The study was small Only five pairs of people bumped shook and slapped palms But the findings were clearcut A moderately strong handshake transferred more than five times as much   bacteria onto a recipients hand than a fist bump biologist   and his colleague at Aberystwyth University found And that strong sturdy handshake your grandpa taught you was even dirtier It transferred nearly  times more bacteria than a fist bump The highfive fell between the two other greetings Slapping palms on average passed along twice as much bacteria as the fist bump To quantify the cleanliness of each greeting Whitworth and his colleague had volunteers put on a sterile glove and then dip their hands into a solution packed with bacteria After the glove dried each volunteer shook bumped or highfived another person wearing a clean glove The scientists then measured the amount of  on the recipients hand In general more microbes moved to the recipient when the greetings were longer stronger and involved more skintoskin contact The bacteria used in the study were harmless But Whitworth thinks the findings would also apply to pathogenic bacteria and viruses Many nasty microbes such as   and influenza spread in clinics and hospitals through the hands of health care workers And several infectious disease doctors have recently   for a ban on handshakes in hospitals But completely forbidding this classic greeting altogether at clinics may go too far says   of the Thomas Jefferson University School of Nursing in Philadelphia We always have to take our cues from a patient says Manning who is the presidentelect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology If a patient extends his hand I dont think I would refuse it I would just wash my hands before and after And Manning definitely wont switch to bumping Fist bumping just seems more of an informal kind of greeting  a way to greet friends not patients she says I havent been a fist bumper and I dont intend to become one But she is a big fan of Whitworths study I think its fabulous she says Its getting us all talking about the role of germ transmission from hands I think awareness can potentially lead to behavior change and disease prevention
