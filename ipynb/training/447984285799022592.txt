The more active a mother is the more physically active her child will be suggests a UK study of  mums and fouryearolds But many mothers exercise levels fell way below recommended levels it said Researchers from Cambridge and Southampton universities used heartrate monitors to measure activity levels over seven days The study published in   said policies to improve childrens health should be aimed at mothers   Children are not just naturally active it concluded and parents have an important role to play in developing healthy exercise habits early on in life As part of the study  fouryearolds and their mothers from Southampton wore a lightweight combined heartrate monitor and accelerometer on their chests for up to seven days Participants wore it continuously including while sleeping and doing waterbased activities Kathryn Hesketh now a research associate at the Institute of Child Health at University College London coled the study and said the data from mothers and children showed a direct positive association between physical activity in children and their mothers The more activity a mother did the more active her child Although it is not possible to tell from this study whether active children were making their mothers run around after them it is likely that activity in one of the pair influences activity in the other She said that for every minute of moderatetovigorous activity a mother engaged in her child was more likely to engage in  more of the same level of activity For every minute the mother was sedentary children were  minutes more sedentary so one hour of sedentary time in mums would result in  minutes in children These small differences may seem trivial but over the course of a month or a year they could be significant she added Factors which influenced a mothers activity levels included whether she worked or not and whether the child had brothers or sisters  Costudy author Dr Esther van Sluijs from the   said the link between a mother and childs activity levels was stronger for mothers who left school at  compared to those who left at  The study recognised that once women become mothers their activity levels fell and often failed to return to previous levels This lack of activity could then influence their young children it said Miss Hesketh said There are many competing priorities for new parents and making time to be active may not always be top of the list However small increases in maternal activity levels may lead to benefits for mothers and children Simply walking and moving more each day can be all it takes to create these benefits Dr Ann Hoskins director of children young people and families at Public Health England said it was committed to increasing physical activity in families and children to improve overall health Active play is an important way to develop coordination and motor function skills in the preschool early years and there are lots of activities like parent and toddler swims buggy fit and baby gym which provide opportunities for mums to socialise be active and support their childs development  Their   encourages families to eat well move more and live longer For children that means being active for an hour a day and two and a half hours a week for adults
