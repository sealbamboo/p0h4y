Fifteen years ago an unwelcome viral visitor entered the US and weve been paying for it ever since The US recorded its first case of West Nile virus back in  Since then the disease has spread across the lower  states and cost the country around  million scientists   this week in the   The hefty bill works out to about  million a year And the tab doesnt include money spent to control mosquitoes that spread the virus The high price tag comes mostly from the treatment of people who develop serious neurological problems when the virus infects the nerves In these cases West Nile can cause seizures coma paralysis of limbs something called   swelling in the brain or spinal cord encephalitis and meningitis and even death These illnesses from West Nile virus are rare occurring in less than  percent of infections But when they happen they can be nasty  and expensive Treatment may involve multiple trips to the hospital and longterm physical therapy Symptoms can linger for months even years To figure out how much it costs to treat these severe forms of West Nile virus epidemiologist   and her team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked the initial medical cost of  Coloradans hospitalized for the illness back in  Five years later they followed up with about half of those patients to estimate longterm medical expenses incurred from doctors visits physical therapy sessions and hospital stays They also asked the people about how much work they missed from being sick The team then used an algorithm to extrapolate from those  cases to the  recorded across the country since  The result Treating West Nile virus over the past  years has cost the US somewhere between  million to  billion But Staples and her team didnt stop there They also figured out which types of neurological problems  such as meningitis or acute paralysis  were most expensive People with meningitis had shorter hospital stays than those with paralysis or encephalitis the team found But younger people tended to get meningitis So they missed more work and the meningitis cases were associated with a higher economic cost in lost productivity On the other hand people with encephalitis tended to be older and retired So lost productivity was lower for these cases But the biggest economic cost of treating West Nile virus by far was decades of work lost when people died of the disease Since  West Nile virus has caused the deaths of at least   in the US Altogether Staples and her team estimate that these premature deaths cost the US about  million since   or nearly half of West Niles total tab So how does the virus price tag stack up against other diseases Its hard to compare Staples tells Shots The economic impact on a population really depends on the number of cases that youre seeing Take for instance Texas in  she says The state   a whopping  cases that year So Id wouldnt be surprised if West Nile virus wasnt one of the more costly diseases for Texas that year
