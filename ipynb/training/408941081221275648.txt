Though at first muted in his approach to the issues surrounding HIVAids Nelson Mandela eventually became a dedicated and extremely effective advocate for a more vigorous approach to the disease When Mr Mandela was released from prison in February  HIVAids had yet to make its full impact on South Africa Following his election as president four years later Mr Mandela faced huge challenges and  like so many other world leaders at the time  failed to fully understand the depth of the problem and did little to help those with Aids At the time the African National Congress ANC was gripped by an ongoing debate about both the causes of and treatment for Aids Some figures like Thabo Mbeki Mr Mandelas successor as president openly questioned whether Aids was caused by HIV  After Mr Mandela left office in  he campaigned for more research into HIVAids for education about safe sex and for better treatment for those affected However most South Africans still did not mention the disease in public According to UN figures the rate of HIV infection among adult South Africans rose from less than  in  to about  by  South Africa is currently home to more people with the virus than any other country   million of its citizens were infected with HIV in  including  children aged  out of a population of just over  million The causes of an epidemic on this scale have been many  primarily poverty but also economic migration the poor status of women and unsafe sexual practices have all contributed to the rapid spread of the disease Apart from the human misery caused by Aids its economic impact has been huge with South African economic growth rates badly affected Having put the issue of Aids on the back burner when in office Mr Mandela began to make strong pronouncements on the subject after he stepped down in  On World Aids Day in  he sent out a hardhitting message saying Our country is facing a disaster of immeasurable proportions from HIVAids We are facing a silent and invisible enemy that is threatening the very fabric of our society Be faithful to one partner and use a condom Give a child love laughter and peace not Aids Mr Mandela said his country should promote abstinence the use of condoms early treatment counselling and drugs to reduce mothertochild transmission At the time there was a marked reluctance on the part of the South African government to fund antiretroviral drugs for those with HIV  The then President Mbeki outraged many people when he told a US journalist that personally I dont know anybody who has died of Aids and that he did not know if he had ever met anyone infected with HIV One of his ministers suggested that people with HIV eat garlic and beetroot to combat the infection In November  Mr Mandela  and his Nelson Mandela Foundation  stepped up the campaign launching an HIVAids fundraising campaign called  after his prison number on Robben Island He compared the urgency and drama of his countrys struggle against HIVAids to the fight against apartheid Pop stars like Beyonce Youssou NDour and Dave Stewart supported the campaign and a starstudded concert held in Cape Town in  was seen by a worldwide television audience of two billion The money raised by Mr Mandelas initiatives has been used to fund research projects and provide practical support for South Africans with HIVAids The campaign received a further boost in  when Mr Mandela shocked the nation by announcing that his son Makgatho   He urged people to talk about HIVAids to make it appear like a normal illness It was a significant move which had a huge impact said Michel Sidibe head of the UNs Aids agency Unaids The country has become a leader in the Aids response because of Mr Mandela and is moving towards an Aidsfree generation thanks to his campaigning he said Mr Mandela also became a central figure in the African and global Aids movement Mr Sidibe said  He was instrumental in laying the foundations of the modern Aids response and his influence helped save millions of lives and transformed health in Africa he said He was a statesman who had Aids at the top of his agenda and he used his stature and presence on the global stage to persuade world leaders to act decisively on Aids His legacy will be felt by generations
