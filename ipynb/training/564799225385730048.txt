For couples looking to conceive a baby one key roadblock could be hiding in plain sight high lipids circulating in the bloodstream of either partner High cholesterol readings according to a study published Tuesday are implicated in delayed conception among couples And though either partners high circulating lipids were problematic the effect was more powerful when the womans free cholesterol levels were found to be in worrisome territory The effect appears to be independent of body mass a wellestablished obstacle for couples looking to conceive High body mass index  BMI a rough measure of overall fatness  often goes hand in hand with high levels of lowdensity lipoproteins LDL the bad cholesterol and it largely did in this study as well But the authors of the current study found that even among couples who were not overweight or obese high free cholesterol was associated with a longer path to pregnancy The study appears in the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism The study enrolled  couples in Michigan and Texas who sought to become pregnant and followed each for a year Most were collegeeducated nonLatino white couples Though  couples withdrew from the study largely because their pregnancy intentions changed  of the couples became pregnant within the year and the remainder did not The average age of the women was  and they were trained to measure their periods of peak fertility Free cholesterol levels  a rough index of good cholesterol highdensity lipoproteins and bad cholesterol  were highest in those couples who did not become pregnant within the year and lowest in couples who became pregnant relatively quickly Long before older age sets in cholesterol readings associated with higher rates of atherosclerosis can disturb basic functions the authors said High cholesterol in women has been associated with poor egg quality and with poor sperm quality in men so either partners unchecked cholesterol could drive down the prospects of a successful pregnancy In addition to raising the risk of cardiovascular disease our findings suggest cholesterol may contribute to infertility said one of the studys authors Enrique F Schisterman of the National Institutes of Healths Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD in Bethesda Md Our results suggest prospective parents may want to have their cholesterol checked to ensure their levels are in an acceptable range
