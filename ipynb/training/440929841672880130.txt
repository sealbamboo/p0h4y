Many women who are unable to breastfeed feel guilty about it and worry they may be depriving their children of a range of benefits Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend six months of exclusive breastfeeding for all infants citing studies that show breast milk is easily digestible and has nutrients that are superior to or absent from infant formulas including immunological substances that reduce rates of infection and fatty acids important in brain development  But now a new study suggests that many of the longterm benefits attributed to breastfeeding may be an effect not of breastfeeding or breast milk itself but of the general good health and prosperity of women who choose to breastfeed Researchers at Ohio State University compared  sibling pairs one of whom had been breastfed and one bottlefed on  measures of health and intellectual competency The children ranged in age from  to  years  The researchers recorded various health and behavioral outcomes in the sibling pairs including body mass index obesity asthma hyperactivity reading comprehension math ability and memorybased intelligence The study   found no statistically significant differences between the breastfed and bottlefed siblings on any of these measures By studying discordant siblings  one of whom had been breastfed and the other not  the authors sought to minimize the possibility that racial socioeconomic educational or other differences between families could affect the results Many earlier studies on breastfeeding failed to control for such factors they say Campaigns to increase the rate of breastfeeding have been highly successful in recent years According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about threequarters of American mothers now breastfeed compared with less than twothirds in  and about  percent are still breastfeeding at six months compared with  percent in  Yet despite this increase researchers have consistently found large socioeconomic and racial disparities in breastfeeding rates A CDC survey in  found that  percent of white infants and  percent of black infants were ever breastfed and in  the agency reported that  percent of white babies but only  percent of black babies were still being breastfed at  months Compared with bottlefed infants breastfed babies are more likely to be born into families with higher incomes have parents with higher educational attainments and live in safer neighborhoods with easier access to health care services Still sibling studies such as this latest one do not solve all the problems of bias We were not able to control for everything that could affect what would make a mom breastfeed one child and not the other said the lead author Cynthia G Colen an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio State But we did control for premature birth birth order the age of the mother and whether she was working when she had one infant and not when she had the other  Geoff Der a statistician at the University of Glasgow who has worked with the same data in previous studies said that the findings in the present study were robust and the authors method for eliminating selection bias was powerful He had reassuring words for women who do not or cannot breastfeed In a society with a clean water supply and modern formulas he said a woman who isnt able to breastfeed shouldnt be feeling guilty and the likelihood that theres any harm to the baby is pretty slim
