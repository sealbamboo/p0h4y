In  the American Foundation of Urological Disorders identified distinct diagnostic categories for the most common womens sexual function complaints hypoactive sexual desire disorder sexual arousal disorder orgasm disorder and pain disorders such as dyspareunia and vaginismus  Heres what you should know about each Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is defined as the absence of sexual thoughts or feelings This is one of the most prevalent issues seen in female patients For women it can be stressful and negatively impact their relationships   Causes include sexual trauma history the quality of a womans current relationship Im just not that into you   hormonal imbalance and depression or anxiety   When patients come to see me for this issue I usually ask whether they fantasize about actors models or even the pool boy If they answer yes then more than likely it is a relationship issue not a psychological andor biological issue  For women it is hard to turn off the fight you had with your spouse earlier in the day or the fact that he constantly irritates you with something you dont like  Most times the fix is communication and spending quality time together  A sex date is usually my prescription Try it you might like it Sexual arousal disorder is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain adequate lubrication after sufficient stimulation  It oftentimes overlaps with sexual desire disorder It can also be dependent on the stage of life a woman is in  Menopause for example which is categorized by a significant loss of estrogen can have a huge impact on a womens sexual activity  The loss of estrogen can lead to the loss of vaginal lubrication and cause vaginal atrophy which can be painful  For women who are not in menopause sexual arousal can also be caused by a lack of blood flow to the labia poor partner ability hormones and other factors Viagra has been prescribed for women to help increase arousal to the vulva but it is not FDAapproved for use in women Arousal and desire at times go handinhand Men tend to forget that women need longer foreplay it takes about  minutes or more to become fully aroused  Foreplay for women is not only physical but also mental  it starts way before you get to the bedroom So start the foreplay before you hit the bed Emails text messages and even taking out the garbage go a long way Orgasm disorder is defined as the inability to achieve orgasm Being able to be aroused either physically andor mentally is necessary in order to achieve orgasm   For many women orgasms are elusive because they are unable to stay in the moment They are thinking about a host of other things which distract them from feeling and being present   In addition a lot of women do not know their bodies andor have difficulty talking about what makes them feel good How can you advocate for improvement if you dont understand what you are trying to improve   Sometimes improving orgasm can be as easy as changing your sexual position Switching a woman from the missionary position to being on top can help give her increased clitoral stimulation as well as control of the depth of penetration and rate of thrusting Pain disorders in women are common place  At some point in a womans life many will experience painful sex  Dyspereunia is defined as persistent or recurrent genital pain that occurs before during or after intercourse Vaginismus is the involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal walls There is a range of causes for these pain disorders that include insufficient lubrication trauma surgeries irritation and emotional factors Earlier this year Osphena was brought to market and has changed the lives of some women with pain disorders caused by menopausal symptoms Vaginismus on the other hand is treated by using varying and increasing sizes of vaginal dilators usually in conjunction with therapy    When a patient comes about this issue I always want to know whether they use latex as there may be an allergy or if waterbased lubricant is being used  Waterbased lubricants tend to dry faster needing repeated application The drying out can lead to small vaginal tears due to friction Siliconebased lubricants tend to be more slippery and need less reapplication which often means less tearing Biologically women and men are quite different in their hormonal makeup yet we share some of the same hormones in differing amounts  Testosterone and estrogen are our main hormones and have been found to play a significant role in our sexual response   Testosterone when it is at a low level in men can lead to decreased desire and erections that are less firm  Women also need testosterone for desire Research has shown that birth control pills tend to bind to the free testosterone in womens blood leaving little to fuel desire   There has been much conversation about testosterone being prescribed to women in order to improve sexual functioning Despite the controversy by  over  million testosterone prescriptions were written for women Women clearly are ready to change the status quo and reclaim their right to good sex  Just start by asking Wheres my orgasm
