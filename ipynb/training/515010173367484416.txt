For the initial diagnosis of kidney stones ultrasounds may be a better choice than CT scans a new study has found Both techniques may be effective but CT scans are more expensive and deliver a large dose of radiation For the study   researchers randomly assigned  people presenting with symptoms of kidney stones in the emergency room to one of three groups ultrasonography by the ER doctor ultrasonography by a radiologist or a CT scan There were no significant differences among the groups in serious adverse events average pain score after seven days return visits to the ER hospitalizations or diagnostic accuracy Some patients in the ultrasound group went on to have CT scans as well but even among the majority who did not there was no difference in outcomes The lead author Dr Rebecca SmithBindman a professor of radiology and epidemiology at the University of California San Francisco said that there were some findings on ultrasound that might need a CT scan as a followup But for the initial diagnosis this is a clinical area where we now do CT scans and can safely replace them with ultrasound If patients know that it is a good option they can ask for it This is a good place for patients to become their own advocates
