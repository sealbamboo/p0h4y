Human rights activists are suing the United Nations on behalf of five Haitian families afflicted by cholera  a disease many believe UN peacekeeping troops brought to Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating  earthquake there The   filed Wednesday in a New York federal court challenges the UNs claim that its immune from lawsuits arising out of damage done in the course of its activities The activists say they have no choice but to sue because the UN has failed to activate a process that is supposed to deal with such claims The suit doesnt specify the amount of compensation the plaintiffs seek Most legal observers are pretty confident that the UNs absolute immunity is endangered   one of the plaintiffs attorneys said in an interview with Shots earlier this year It certainly has not happened yet but many people say if theres a case that would do it its this one because the liability is so clear and the harm is so great Theres no disputing the harm that cholera has brought to Haiti The epidemic there has become the worlds largest and fastestspreading one involving cholera The Bostonbased   which Concannon directs says more than  Haitians have been sickened by cholera since October  Thats almost  percent of the population About  Haitians have died of cholera a disease unknown in Haiti for at least a century before  About  more die of cholera every year with no end in sight The biggest national cholera outbreak in modern times is still not under control and its happening right on Americas doorstep says Dr Edward Ryan of Massachusetts General Hospital a past president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene The society   a special issue of its journal Wednesday on the Haitian cholera epidemic As to the UNs responsibility a series of studies point toward choleras introduction by infected UN peacekeeping forces who arrived in Haiti just before the outbreak The epidemic emanated from a UN camp with documented sanitation deficiencies in Haitis central highlands And the cholera bacteria spread down the Artibonite River system into which the camps sewage was discharged Scientists have shown that the cholera strain which has now spread throughout Haiti comes from a single source And the strain is almost identical to the bug that was circulating in Nepal in the summer of  as an expert panel commissioned by the UN   in  The Haitian and Nepalese cholera strains differ in only  out of  million genetic elements Tufts University environmental engineer Daniele Lantagne   Shots earlier this year Lantagne served on the independent panel investigating the outbreak for the UN Part of the reason we think the outbreak grew so quickly was the Haitian population had no immunity to cholera Lantagne says Something like when the Europeans brought smallpox to the Americas Former President Bill Clinton during a visit to Haiti in the spring of    that the UN troops were the proximate cause of the cholera but he said Haitis poor sanitation and health infrastructure amplified the disaster The UN has rebuffed   by Haitian advocates to get the agency to compensate cholera victims In February of this year UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon ruled that such claims are not receivable under the privileges and immunities provisions in the UNs charter In a   at that time Ban expressed his profound sympathy for the terrible suffering caused by the cholera epidemic He also called on partners in Haiti and the international community to work together to ensure better health and a better future for the people of Haiti In an address to the UN General Assembly last week Haitis Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe   the organization bears a moral responsibility for the cholera outbreak He complained that efforts to stem the epidemic have been far from adequate The UN has a  billion plan to improve Haitis sanitation systems and provide clean water  the only way to stem the ongoing cholera epidemic But only a   of the money has been raised so far A report last summer from the Yale Law School   that the UN has a mechanism to deal with complaints of injury caused by UN operations under the socalled Status of Forces Agreements that govern peacekeeping operations But the UN has refused to activate that process the report said Ira Kurzban one of the attorneys representing the Haitian plaintiffs said in a press statement that his clients expect the UN to argue that US federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear the case We are prepared for that challenge Kurzban said
