No one likes being in the hospital on Christmas but truth be told theres no other holiday that Id rather work Thanksgiving is known for patients coming in with skyrocketing blood pressures from having consumed too much salt  or too many salty arguments with family members On New Years the emergency room is buzzing like a frat house Christmas is widely thought to be the most peaceful holiday of them all Theres also never a time that I find patients to be more grateful Theres the endless supply of sweets which is evident at the nurses station and especially at the bedside Just a few hours into my Christmas shift on the bone marrow transplant unit my teeth already hurt from all the candy and chocolate Ive partaken of With nursing staff and residents adorning Santa hats reindeer noses tacky sweaters and elf ears the hospital resembles a less creative version of Halloween The worst complaint I hear is from a nurse who is grumbling about the slow Internet connection as she is trying to Skype with her children as they open their presents In the evening my wife surprises me with a warm homemade dinner Not everything is fun and games though A woman barely  who had never seen the inside of a medical ward was transferred to our hospital from the suburbs Shed had a headache the past few weeks that didnt go away and an MRI revealed that it was cancer that had spread to her brain The emergency room transferred her on Christmas Eve to the cancer ward just before the stroke of midnight and all she wanted to know was not how bad the cancer was how long she had to live or what treatment options she had but whether she would be able to go home to have Christmas dinner with her children On no other day would such a thought cross anyones mind Oddly in the United States more people die in a hospital on Christmas the day after or New Years Day than on any other day of the year This was shown in a   that examined all  million official death certificates produced in the United States between  and  Not only do people have more     and   but fatality rates from a wide variety of causes spike on these days except for suicides which   sharply after the holidays In Mexico deaths peak on Christmas and All Saints Day In one   researchers interviewed people living in Yautepec Mexico whose relatives had died around holidays To them a final passage that occurred on a special day represented a beautiful death and was something to be cherished In Pakistan where I grew up dying on a significant day is always preferable When Pakistans most celebrated singer Noor Jehan died in  the silver lining was that she passed on one of the holiest nights of the Muslim calendar Yet in the United States it seems that most families and patients prefer to postpone a death so that it doesnt coincide with a holiday That way the holiday or special occasion can be celebrated in the future without evoking memories of loss While hospital deaths rise on Christmas the number of patients getting admitted to hospitals   significantly This is probably because people have a higher threshold for going to the hospital over a holiday than on a regular day Less sick patients it seems tend to stay away from the hospital on these days For a patient and the family of course no day in the hospital is an average day Inside the hospital things continue to function efficiently as they should At the same time empathy from hospital staff seems to overflow How can we make the medical experience as rich with joy every day as it is on this special day Perhaps if we switched our white coats for Santa hats every day could look like Christmas in the hospital
