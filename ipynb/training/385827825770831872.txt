Earlier this week I found myself surrounded by journalism royalty Many of the mosttalented and mostcourageous broadcast journalists editors producers and videographers had gathered at New Yorks Lincoln Center for the News and Documentary Emmy Awards But to my amazement I was not just a guest or casual observer at the Emmys  I was a nominee   had been honored by the National Academy of Television Arts  Sciences with a nomination for its most prestigious award The series was one among  nominations that evening vying for just  golden Emmy statues that beckoned on the stage They always say at award shows that its an honor just to be nominated In my case that sentiment is particularly meaningful Just a few years ago at the age of  I learned I had an aggressive form of leukemia I needed intensive chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant to save my life Back then my doctors told me that I had a  percent chance of surviving my transplant I found myself fighting for a future I had yet to define The notion of professional achievement let alone an accolade like an Emmy nomination was simply not in my realm of possibilities Being in your twenties and trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do in life  with or without cancer  is a scary endeavor on its own But learning that I was facing a lifethreatening illness made me feel like someone had just hit the pause button on my life before it had really begun As an undergraduate I had traveled across North Africa and the Middle East to study womens rights through narrative storytelling and oral history I ended up writing my senior thesis about the subject One of the chapters was titled Voices of the Voiceless and it detailed the underreported stories of women in Tunisia I was inspired by the journalist Amy Goodman who has said The responsibility of a journalist is to travel where the silence is  That was exactly what I hoped to do with my life But just months after walking across the stage at my college graduation cancer interrupted my plans It was hard to imagine any kind of future let alone my plans to become a journalist and champion the cause of women around the world Isolated in the oncology ward I began to think about my dream to become a writer What could I possibly write about now Where could I travel if I was stuck to an IV pole Maybe the story wasnt in a faraway land but right in front of me I hadnt chosen this story   it had chosen me But I decided to accept the challenge Slowly I began to report from the frontlines of my hospital bed first in journals and then in a hastily put together blog Cancer isnt something that makes you want to share its something that makes you want to hide The shift from telling other peoples stories to writing in the first person about something so personal was difficult After all cancer isnt exactly something you update on your LinkedIn profile But I knew this much writing about what was happening to me felt good even when my body didnt Ive never felt as lost as I did in that first year after I found out I had cancer But without realizing it I had also found my voice Although Id never been published before I emailed my journalism professor Marty Gottlieb and asked him what he thought about pitching my story to The Times Well section where I had been reading dispatches from another cancer patient   who was chronicling his life after treatment for prostate cancer  He helped me reach out to the editors at The Times and in the spring of  my   appeared just as I was undergoing a bone marrow transplant followed soon thereafter by the   I never could have imagined that  months later I would be sitting in the audience at the Emmys waiting for my category to be announced And then something incredible happened we won Standing on the stage holding that golden and surprisingly heavy Emmy statue has to be one of the most surreal amazing moments of my life Shayla Harris the series producer and the woman who spent countless hours with me filming my story gave a beautiful acceptance speech as my editor Tara ParkerPope celebrated the moment with me Days later I still cant believe we won an Emmy Living with cancer has been terrifying but in some ways its also made me feel fearless and like anything is possible Its taught me that time is precious and that I need to go for the things I want  not tomorrow but today After all what do I have to lose I still dont know what the future holds but I do know that Im doing well and continue to be cancerfree The stories and words of encouragement Ive received from readers and viewers of Life Interrupted have been my lifeline to an incredible and supportive community None of this would have been possible without you In my small way I hope I have traveled to where the silence is and given voice to a community thats too often voiceless young adults with cancer Heres to making the most of a life interrupted View all of the videos in the
