Up to  doctors have been hired from overseas by the   in the past year as the service battles to tackle staff shortages that medical professionals say are serious and growing They came from at least  countries including India Poland Australia and Greece  but also even Iraq Syria and Sudan  according to  of the  hospital trusts in England who responded to requests from the Guardian for details of their recruitment Dr David Rosser medical director of University hospitals Birmingham one of Englands biggest trusts said The NHS doesnt have the number of doctors it needs The shortage is real We arent training enough doctors in this country and so we are dependent on foreigntrained doctors   in more and more branches of medicine report shortages especially in specialities such as AE where its tough work Painting a picture of how wide the NHS is having to cast its net for doctors and other clinical staff the research shows that  University hospitals NHS foundation trust in Southampton recruited the highest number of foreign doctors   in the last year  The service is struggling to find enough doctors to work in particular medical specialities including AE radiology ophthalmology and general medicine   The  foreign medics hired by the University hospitals Bristol trust included six Greeks three Pakistanis two Hungarians two Romanians two Sri Lankans and one born in Sudan with British nationality  Five of Englands  regional NHS ambulance services are also pursuing new recruits abroad More than  of the  paramedics the London Ambulance Service is hiring before the end of March will be from Australia and New Zealand   NHS trusts in England said they had hired just over  nurses from overseas with experts warning that hospitals were competing with each other for overseas talent Overall figures from the General Medical Council show that the number of foreigntrained doctors on its register rose by  between  December  and  January  They made up twofifths    of the  yearonyear increase in the overall number of doctors which rose to  Of the  doctors of all types registered with the GMC on  January   were foreigntrained including   specialists  The GMC said that some of the foreigntrained doctors on the register may not be actively working in the NHS while others could be working in private hospitals and some may be British nationals who gained their qualifications abroad Rosser blamed the shortages of doctors on two things NHS central workforce planning which is supposed to ensure the service has enough staff to meet future medical need has never worked and has been a shambles forever he said And the tightening of visa rules under the coalition which has made it harder for junior doctors from the Indian subcontinent to stay in Britain long enough to complete their training has prompted some of the doctors who have traditionally made up a key part of the NHS workforce to go instead to places like Canada where they are allowed to stay until they become senior doctors  The NHS is the loser because of that because we get the offer of highclass trainees subsidised by their countries governments and so come at a much lower cost than employing our own trainees but the number who come over is getting smaller because they want to come here for five six or seven years but the visa rules can mean they only get two years which is too short for them added Rosser  A UKwide lack of radiologists who interpret scans and xrays could harm patients who have a CT or MRI scan or xray warned Dr Giles Maskell president of the Royal College of Radiologists RCR We are very short of radiologists The main implications for patient safety are delays in scan interpretation and the risks of people getting the wrong treatment or no treatment due to not getting the right tests or expert interpretation he said The RCR is holding its first job fair at the European congress of radiology in Vienna in March at which it will help medical directors of hospital trusts find radiologists to come and work for them Growing numbers have been coming to work in the NHS from Hungary Latvia Greece and the Balkans in recent years said Maskell  Northern Lincolnshire and Goole hospital trust said it is seeking as many as  extra doctors We have doctor vacancies in a number of specialities including general surgery urology trauma and orthopaedics emergency medicine gastroenterology respiratory medicine rheumatology haematologyoncology and radiology said a trust spokeswoman The trust plans to head to Poland Hungary and India to recruit doctors The growing global recruitment also saw Poole hospital trust take on  doctors from Pakistan Bulgaria Sudan Greece Spain Italy and Ireland Similarly the  at Milton Keynes hospital included an Iraqi Chinese Pole Romanian Nigerian and two Indian medics  The  trusts that responded to a Guardian request for information between them have hired  doctors and  nurses from abroad since the start of last year But as they represent only a fifth of the  acute trusts the overall figures will be much higher   and ambulance services are also having to use employment agencies abroad and send staff to recruitment fairs in Europe and the far east in an effort to find thousands of nurses and paramedics Of the five ambulance trusts hiring from abroad the SouthEast Coast Ambulance Service said it had recently brought staff from Poland and Australia and is seeking  international graduates during   South Central Ambulance Service which covers Berkshire Buckinghamshire Hampshire and Oxfordshire has  vacancies   of its workforce It is actively recruiting in Poland for qualified paramedics where their qualifications skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff said a spokesman  The NHS is also increasingly short of nurses prompting concern from medical leaders Here we are wholly reliant on our overseas staff About a third of our nurses are from overseas This situation isnt ideal said Keith McNeil chief executive of Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge  Theres a fairly major shortage of homegrown nurses Every week we are right down to the wire in terms of finding nurses to fill the rotas effectively It really is a challenge  Overseas staff cost the NHS more than UKtrained personnel because they take longer to familiarise themselves with the service and receive clearance to work he added  Addenbrookes has hired more nurses since the start of  than any of the other  trusts who supplied information   Of  joining the hospital this month  are from the Philippines  from EU countries and one each from Canada and Australia  Shortages are so severe that hospitals are competing with each other for staff notably nurses  There are fewer nurses entering the profession as a result of reduced training places within universities which came into effect a few years ago Given that all NHS trusts are facing similar issues we are finding that the labour market is very competitive hence the need to also look overseas said Angela Wilkinson director of human resources at the Mid Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust The trust has hired  nurses from Spain and is seeking  more in India next month The lack of staff is so acute that NHS trusts in England are spending bn a year on agency and temporary staff official figures show Monitor which regulates foundation trusts has warned that trusts are having difficulty recruiting and retaining permanent staff and that this was contributing to unprecedented financial pressure on them Richard Murray director of policy at the Kings Fund said GP practices and NHS community services trusts which deliver care outside hospitals were also reporting difficulty in finding staff as a key concern  He added Trusts clearly do want more permanent staff both to ensure quality of care for patients but also for good financial reasons The problem is finding permanent staff to recruit Some hospital finance directors are asking are there any people to recruit The proportion of British staff working in the NHS has risen slightly from  to  over the last five years as  more doctors and  extra nurses have joined the NHS the Department of   said Foreign health workers make a valuable contribution to the NHS but we have introduced language checks to ensure they can properly communicate with their patients a spokeswoman said  NHS England said that NHS trusts are individually responsible for recruiting and planning their own workforce But is it of course vital that we are able to attract the right of numbers of staff to the healthcare system said a spokesman  The organisation is working with Health Education England HEE on robust training and recruitment plans that will lead to more permanent doctors nursing and paramedics in the NHS he added  HEE said its responsibility is to ensure the NHS has a big enough workforce in the future and also to help employers relieve current shortages It is boosting the number of trainee nurses and with the College of Emergency Medicine has organised the arrival of the  foreign AE doctors  But Rosser warned that the NHSs lack of doctors is here to stay A solution involving providing more Britishtrained doctors in significant numbers is a decade away at least because thats how long it takes to train a doctor In the mediumterm the solution is to get more doctors in from other countries The NHSs increasing reliance on foreign doctors will continue for a decade at least  Qatar being so dry and hot we see a lot of heatrelated illnesses in Durham we see coldrelated illnesses such as hypothermia says Dr Rensy Mathew who was thrust into work at University hospital of North Durhams AE unit a week after entering the country Speaking excellent English the primary language during his school education in Kerala and his means of interaction with expats in Qatar Mathew says that he answered the call from the NHS because it offered speciality training limited in the Gulf state The biggest difference from Qatar I would say I noticed is things are more streamlined he says Everyone follows a system everything goes in a flowchart way  He has also seen first hand the particular pressures facing the NHS In Durham if  people were to come in on a day I would say around  would be from the geriatric population The older age group is quite high here and most come in with multiple chronic illnesses The fourhour limit for being treated admitted or discharged is good but people who come in in an emergency it requires a lot of care and commitment for staff When you have a large number of people there is definitely going to be longer waiting times Having worked for nine years in emergency medicine in Qatar where sale of alcohol is restricted another difference has become apparent to Mathew In Qatar we do have people with alcoholrelated causes but I would say the number of cases definitely is more in Durham especially on weekends  Mathew attended a recruitment round in India  a second one was held in UAE  which involved four days of interviews and role play He says he has been welcomed by patients in Durham with open arms People are very eager to know where I have come from and whats my background they are very courteous very welcoming and quite keen to know what I have to say and what advice I have to give he says  The weather was more of a challenge When I came in definitely your body needs a week or two to get used to the cold weather he says I must have got used to it as Im wearing less clothes  Mathew who has visited the capital is also already showing a keen appreciation of the northsouth divide I like Durham more than London its more relaxed he says People look like theyre happy smiling enjoying themselves it gives you a boost as well  Like the other doctors mainly from India and UAE Mathew will remain here for four years during which Health Education England which carried out the recruitment and the College of Emergency Medicine will help them work to achieve membership or fellowship of the college  The idea is for them to return to their home countries with enhanced skills and qualifications and despite his favourable initial impressions Mathew has no desire to stay At this age I dont think I can move on to a new life in a new country he says I miss home
