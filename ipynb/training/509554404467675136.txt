People who consume the sweetener fructose   which is most people nowadays  risk developing a variety of health problems But the risk drops substantially if those people get up  and move around even if they dont formally exercise two new studies found  Most of us have heard that ingesting fructose usually in the form of highfructose corn syrup is unhealthy which few experts would dispute Highfructose corn syrup is used to sweeten many processed foods and nearly all soft drinks The problem with the sweetener is that unlike glucose the other component of common table sugar fructose is metabolized primarily in the liver There much of the fructose is transformed into fatty acids some of which remain in the liver marbling that organ and contributing to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  The rest of the fatty acids migrate into the bloodstream causing metabolic havoc Past animal and human studies have linked the intake of even moderate amounts of fructose with dangerous gyrations in blood sugar levels escalating insulin resistance Type  diabetes added fat around the middle obesity poor cholesterol profiles and other metabolic disruptions But Amy Bidwell then a researcher at Syracuse University noticed that few of these studies had examined interactions between physical activity and fructose That was a critical omission she thought because movement and exercise change how the body utilizes fuels including fructose  Dr Bidwell sought out healthy collegeaged men and women who would agree to drink soda in the pursuit of science They were easy to find She gathered  The volunteers showed up at the universitys physiology lab for a series of baseline tests The researchers assessed how their bodies responded to a fructoserich meal recording their blood sugar and insulin levels and other measures of general and metabolic health including cholesterol profiles and blood markers of bodily  inflammation The students also completed questionnaires about their normal diets and activity levels and subsequently wore an activity monitor for a week to gauge how much they generally moved  Then half of the volunteers spent two weeks moving about half as much as they had before The other  volunteers began moving around about twice as much as before for a daily total of at least  steps a day or about six miles  After a rest period of a week the groups switched so that every volunteer had moved a lot and a little  Throughout they also consumed two fructoserich servings of a lemonlime soda designed to provide  grams of fructose a day which is about what an average American typically consumes The sodas contained about  calories each and the volunteers were asked to reduce their nonfructose calories by the same amount to avoid weight gain  After each twoweek session the volunteers returned to the lab for a repeat of the metabolic and health tests  Their results diverged widely depending on how much theyd moved As one of two new studies based on the research   reports after two weeks of fructose loading and relative inactivity these young healthy volunteers displayed a notable shift in their cholesterol and health profiles There was a significant increase in their blood concentrations of dangerous verylowdensity lipoproteins and a soaring percent increase in markers of bodily inflammation  The second study   focused on bloodsugar responses to fructose and activity and found equally striking changes among the young people when they didnt move much Two weeks of extra fructose left them with clear signs of incipient insulin resistance which is typically the first step toward Type  diabetes  But in both studies walking at least  steps a day effectively wiped out all of the disagreeable changes wrought by the extra fructose When the young people moved more their cholesterol and blood sugar levels remained normal even though they were consuming plenty of fructose every day The lesson from these studies is not that we should blithely down huge amounts of fructose and assume that a long walk will undo all harmful effects said Dr Bidwell who is now an assistant professor of exercise science at the State University of New York  in Oswego I dont want people to consider these results as a license to eat badly she added 
 But the data suggests that if you are going to regularly consume fructose she said be sure to get up and move around  The study did not examine how activity ameliorates some of the worst impacts of fructose but its likely Dr Bidwell said that the additional muscular contractions involved in standing and taking  steps a day produce a cascade of physiological effects that alter how the body uses fructose  Interestingly the young people in the study did not increase the lengths of their normal workouts to achieve the requisite step totals and most did not formally exercise at all Dr Bidwell said They parked their cars further away from stores took stairs instead of elevators strolled the campus and generally sat less moved more she said Thats a formula for good health in any case she added but it appears to be key if youre determined to have that soda
