When confronted with the reality that your favorite blueberry scone the one you buy for breakfast every day comes packed with plus calories do you still go for the pastry Yes you probably will  No matter how much calorie information is on the menu list people still choose the food they like not whats supposed to be healthier researchers from Carnegie Mellon reported Thursday  Despite the good intentions of regulations requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts of each menu item studies have shown such mandates do little to actually change peoples behavior But the Carnegie Mellon researchers wondered if people were given a little more information to help put those calorie counts in context would they choose a lowercalorie item They found even including calorie information for each food item   the recommendations on how many calories are appropriate to consume during one meal or over the course of a day doesnt turn people off a Big Mac plus calories Putting calorie labels on menus really has little or no effect on peoples ordering behaviors at all says Julie Downs lead author of the new study published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health  Its an important issue as several states and municipalities across the country  New York City Philadelphia California Oregon and King County in Washington state  have already introduced mandatory menu labeling Soon nationwide regulations will go into effect thanks to the new health care law  and as part of that new health care reform legislation restaurants will be required to post daily calorie recommendations directly onto menus Its a wellintentioned but unrealistic policy Downs says The new data show that providing that broader context doesnt help people make healthier choices either  The people who set these policies arent very representative of the people theyre setting them for Downs says They think about what they eat They think Im not going to eat a giant hamburger fries and a milkshake for lunch  To see how real people responded to menu labels researchers staked out two New York City McDonalds restaurants at lunchtime  one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn  and found  adults ages  to  to participate At both restaurants calorie counts were prominently displayed as is mandated in New York City Prior to ordering one group received a sheet of paper with the recommended calories for a single meal  calories for women  calories for men a second group received information about recommended calories for a day  calories for women  for men and a third group received no instructions similar to most of the earlier studies What they found About onethird of the study participants ate more than  calories in the meal The presence of additional information about recommendations for meal or daily eating had no impact on food choice A majority of men and women ate more than the recommended intake for a meal  and neither type of information had an impact on the number of calories consumed compared to the group with no information Importantly says NBC News diet and health editor Madelyn Fernstrom the study found no difference between overweight and healthyweight participants in their food choice behaviors the obese group did not choose higher calories than the healthy weight group And both groups underestimated the calories consumed in a meal a finding supporting earlier research These data do support the idea that many consumers choose taste value and convenience over nutrient density and controlled calories Fernstrom says And since the study was done at a fastfood restaurant the results might not apply to other types of restaurants The takeaway message of this new research is not that restaurants should do away with displaying calorie counts and calorie recommendations Actually one of the studys limitations is that the research failed to examine those who used the calorie counts and   eat less Fernstrom says Because for some people its a helpful tool When it comes to human food choice no one would expect that this strategy would work for everyone Fernstrom says But It certainly cant hurt For those people who dont care it doesnt make any different for those who seek that information its a plus And there is also likely a subgroup of people who might glean some bit of information from the calorie counts and impact choice in a small way on choice As Downs puts it I think a lot of that comes down to who is using the information Its probably people who are already ordering pretty well pretty healthfully While more information and transparency about the food we consume in restaurants is a positive trend Downs adds thats not going to help curb the obesity epidemic Because Fernstrom says its really hard to count calories  it takes a lot of focus and mental energy when done regularly Downs believes a better option to help nudge people toward making healthier food choices might be introducing some monetary incentives  and not just negative motivators like soda or sugar bans or taxes Lets not just tax the sugary stuff because thats just going to piss people off  but lets also maybe subsidize the healthier stuff Downs says  One example she suggests Offering a small discount for people who order water or a diet soda with their combo meal rather than a regular soft drink But for now Fernstrom says try downsizing your combo meal to a kids meal with a lowcalorie beverage
