In the current Ebola crisis much of the focus has been on Liberia and Sierra Leone But the virus also continues to spread in Guinea where the first case in the current outbreak was identified in March According to the latest   from the World Health Organization Guinea has had fewer cases than either Sierra Leone  or Liberia  WHO has recorded  Ebola cases and  deaths in Guinea This however is just a few dozen fatalities fewer than in Sierra Leone And despite the lower numbers in Guinea some data suggest the outbreak is spreading faster there than in the neighboring countries Goats and Soda spoke with Marc Poncin response coordinator for   in the Guinean capital of Conakry to get a better picture of the outbreak Theres clearly been a new phase starting in midAugust From midAugust until now weve seen a much higher number of cases compared to the first and second peaks of the epidemic So we are clearly in a serious situation Very clearly at the end of May we were almost over with the epidemic Again at the end of July things were looking much better compared to the month before I think that its mainly the importation of cases from Sierra Leone and Liberia that creates a very difficult situation in Guinea As of June when the epidemic began to hit the fan thereve been a lot of people leaving those countries Liberia and Sierra Leone to come back to their family in Guinea Some of those people were sick without knowing it When they were back they started to show symptoms and contaminate their own family and the people around them Weve seen that many many times This explains why the epidemic relaunched and why it was very difficult to control it again The epidemic is now covering  districts out of  in the country Some of those districts are highly affected Since midAugust weve seen a regular increase of cases each week We dont know if weve reached the peak The complexity is to have those four principles functioning at the same time If you have just treatment it is not enough If you dont have good surveillance if you dont have good contact tracing then you cannot stop the transmission chain You will always run after the epidemic like weve seen in Liberia The situation in Guinea is very different than the situation in the two other countries In Guinea the situation is very bad but its clear that the authorities never gave up on the epidemic Theyve been always trying to do something  maybe not enough but theyve been always present and trying to coordinate the response If you come to Guinea youll be very surprised You arrive in a country thats functioning normally Generally speaking you can have a normal life The markets are functioning The schools did not restart because they are trying to find a way to make sure they protect children but they have a strong willingness to restart the schools This is a big difference with other countries From the beginning of the crisis until now MSF Doctors Without Borders is running all the beds for Ebola in Guinea and this is not a good thing Just as the US has pledged to help Liberia and the UK is sending troops to Sierra Leone France has vowed to help Guinea its former colony battle this outbreak I think its unrealistic that we can control it by January of  but there is a strong will to increase the response and to have a quick impact on the epidemic
