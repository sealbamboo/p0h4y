The quest for a treatment that can combat Alzheimer’s remains frustrating and expensive, but Andrew Lo believes he may have a path forward. A finance professor who directs the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at the MIT Sloan School of Management, Lo thinks that a public-private partnership could solve some of the funding issues that have plagued drug discovery and development. The hope is to create what the pharmaceutical world likes to call ‘lots of shots on goals.’ We spoke with Lo about his idea…. “We need a change in our approach,” he says. “Right now, the risk of failure [in developing an Alzheimer’s treatment] is far too high for any single pharmaceutical company to take on. And if we don’t do anything about it, it’s going to be a very long time before we develop an effective therapy.”
