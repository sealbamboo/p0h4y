                  If you can also skip conventional peaches apples blueberries and cherries which are typically treated with multiple pesticides and usually eaten skinson Your pots and pans are just as crucial to upgrade as the food you cook in them Most nonstick cookware contains a fluorochemical called PTFE that breaks down to form toxic fumes when overheated says Olga Naidenko PhD a senior scientist at the EWG Those fumes can coat the inside of the lungs and cause allergylike symptoms 
                   
                  Tests commissioned by the EWG showed that in just two to five minutes on a conventional stove top cookware coated with nonstick surfaces could exceed temperatures at which the coating emits toxic gases Switch to stainless steel ceramic or cast iron cookware The linings of microwavepopcorn bags may contain a toxic chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA which is used to prevent the food from sticking to the paper According to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA PFOA is a likely carcinogen We dont know all of the hazardous effects of PFOA yet but we have some evidence of a link to cancer as well as to effects on the immune nervous and endocrine systems says David Carpenter MD director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany 
                   
                  Pick up an airpopper or make your popcorn in a pan on the stove top Some lawn and garden pesticides contain suspected carcinogens according to EPA data Longterm pesticide exposure may be related to changes in the brain and nervous system the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center reports Not only are you breathing the chemicals in but you bring them indoors and onto carpets via your shoes says McKay Jenkins PhD a journalism professor at the University of Delaware and author of

                  For adults the biggest concern with BPA is that it may increase the risk of breast cancer in women and reduce sperm counts in men says Dr Carpenter who explains that BPA can leach out into the water in the bottle To be safe sip from an unlined stainless steel or BPAfree plastic bottle BPA strikes again Many foodstorage containers are made of the hard clear polycarbonate plastic that may contain BPA As is the case with water bottles the BPA can leach out of the plastic in these containers and seep into your leftovers 
                   
                  The leaching is increased during heating but it also leaches to a smaller degree even when cold foods are stored Dr Carpenter explains Glass containers are your safestnot to mention planetfriendlybet Both Rubbermaid at left and Pyrex make glass ones with BPAfree plastic lids The milk youre drinking may not be doing your body good Dairy products account for a reported  to  percent of the estrogens we consume through our food If that seems like a shockingly large number its mainly because milk naturally contains hormones passed along from cows What worries some experts is that about  of dairy cows are treated with the hormone rBST or rBGH which stimulates milk production by increasing circulating levels of another hormone called insulinlike growth factor IGF Elevated levels of IGF in people are associated with an increased risk of cancer including breast cancer Dr Schettler explains In fact the use of rBGH is banned in Europe and Canada Although research has yet to definitively conclude whether drinking rBGHtreated milk increases your IGF levels high enough to cause concern Dr Schettler says its advisable to buy milk that hasnt been treated with it So pick up milk thats labeled rBGHfree rBSTfree or is produced without artificial hormones When researchers at the EWG analyzed  producepesticide tests to determine the most contaminated fruits and vegetables celery topped the chart In terms of the sheer number of chemicals it was the worst says Sonya Lunder senior analyst at the EWG Celery stalks are very porous so they retain the pesticides theyre sprayed withup to  of them according to the EWG analysis Lunder also advises buying organic bell peppers spinach and potatoes because they scored high for pesticides as well When picking up tomato sauce or paste choose the glass jar or box over the can The lining on the inside of food cans thats used to protect against corrosion and bacteria may contain BPA explains Cheryl Lyn Walker PhD a professor of carcinogenesis at MD Anderson Cancer Center and past president of the Society of Toxicology 
                   
                  In  Consumer Reports tested BPA levels in a variety of canned foods and found it in nearly all of the brands tested suggesting that the chemical leaked in What can happen is that BPA in the lining can leach into the food Walker explains Some regular mattresses may have been treated with potentially toxic flame retardants called polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs which have been linked to learning memory and behavioral impairments according to Lunder 
                   
                  Though PBDEs were phased out of mattresses in  they can still be found in other household items including carpet padding and some electronics The EWG advises opting for products that havent been treated with brominated fire retardants and choosing lessflammable materials such as wool
