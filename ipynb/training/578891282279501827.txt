The decision to remove wisdom teeth often seems like a routine part of young adulthood But more people are starting to ask whether its always necessary Those who oppose automatically taking out those four teeth say watchful waiting is a better path because the teeth and surrounding gum tissue might remain normal making costly surgery unnecessary The four teeth at the very back of the jaw also called the third molars generally start to shift at  to  years of age according to the American Assn of Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons When wisdom teeth break through the gum only partly often because theres not enough room in the jaw they are considered impacted That can lead to decay plaque and other problems and thats why many dentists suggest removing them despite no apparent diseases in the teeth Plus discomfort from the removal generally increases with age But theres disagreement about whether wisdom teeth need to come out to ease crowding  not so long ago a common reason for extraction A  Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials related to wisdom teeth looked at evidence on both sides of the debate In its conclusion the research team found no sufficient data to suggest that taking out wisdom teeth reduced crowding of the remaining teeth over five years Americans spend an estimated  billion a year removing wisdom teeth according to the American Public Health Assn And the single biggest predictor of having the surgery is availability of insurance according to respondents in an APHA survey published in April When dentists recommended removal  of participants adhered to this recommendation during followup and the main reason was availability of insurance  according to the survey To extract a single wisdom tooth depending on procedure complexity tooth position and where you live in the country insured people might pay from  to  on average per tooth says Jay Friedman a general dentist and consultant in Los Angeles who analyzed a survey of fees in  from the American Dental Assn A person with good dental insurance might have to pay  of the fee outofpocket as much as  to  for four wisdom tooth extractions Friedman added Just how many healthy wisdom teeth are routinely removed remains unclear Dental procedures are not held to the same international tracking standards that yield statistical data on other medical professions says Dr John Yamamoto of Delta Dental of California the largest dental benefits carrier in the state But he says that based on Delta Dental claims data from the first quarter of  nearly  of the extractions performed by oral surgeons were of wisdom teeth Other procedures performed by oral surgeons include dental implants corrective jaw surgery and facial surgery for cleft lip and palate Risk is part of any surgery even the most routine When weighing the risks of wisdom tooth extraction ask yourself Whats the relative benefit says Richard Niederman chairman of the department of epidemiology and health promotion and director of the Center for EvidenceBased Dentistry at New York University If the tooth is not diseased leave it in If it is diseased then consider taking it out says Niederman He urges patients and dentists to focus on the current state of health and avoid predictions that may or may not prove true Most wisdom teeth extractions could be done with a local anesthetic in which the patient is awake and able to communicate with their dentist says Friedman a vocal critic of routine wisdom teeth removal and of routinely turning that job over to oral surgeons who can administer general anesthetics A general anesthetic which makes the patient unconscious he says is used too often and costs more They oral surgeons like to give general anesthetic Its a big money maker Youre making a lot of money giving general anesthesia or IV sedation even though you dont need it says Friedman adding that he has often removed wisdom teeth with a local anesthetic such as Novocain Friedman also said surgeons prefer general anesthetic because its easier for them to work in the mouth One risk he says is that the jaw can be opened too wide causing injury And in rare cases nerve injury leaves people with permanent lip tongue and cheek numbness after removing wisdom teeth according to the American Public Health Assn But there also are risks to keeping wisdom teeth including gum infections or the potential for emergency surgery says Dr Thomas Dodson a professor in oral and maxillofacial surgery at the University of Washington Recent studies have shown that third molars can be unpredictable he says About  of his patients choose to have their wisdom teeth removed he says For those who keep their teeth close monitoring by dentists and careful care by their owners are required Scott Tomar a professor of community dentistry and behavioral science at the University of Florida considers removing healthy wisdom teeth no different than removing a healthy appendix just in case it might burst I dont know of any other surgical treatment still done in the United States where we prophylactically do an invasive surgical procedure unless theres pretty strong evidence supporting it Weve abandoned that idea long ago  Why did humans develop wisdom teeth  apparently called that because they emerge after weve accumulated a bit of wisdom Scientists theorize that early humans once put their wisdom teeth to good use Thats because the human diet was largely roots tough meats and raw food Think jerky  morning noon and night With these hardtoeat foods it meant the human jaw worked much harder to grind up a meal before swallowing The extra teeth helped get the job done According to scientists at one time the jaw was larger something that gave ample room for these oftenmisunderstood molars to thrive
