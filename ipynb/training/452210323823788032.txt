Twentyfive years ago when the twin daughters of a childhood friend were  and I was  I told them that someday when they were grown Id babysit for their children  When Im old enough to have a baby youll be old as a bone one of the girls said  Ouch  Now theyre  and Im  Neither woman has children so Im not babysitting sad to say Still it never occurred to me then or now that  could be old as a bone I dont feel that way or look that way New Old Age commenters who may have seen my photo and disagree Im ready for you Was it a mistake not to fix my face while there was still time Bring it on  So how to explain the deference of total strangers lately to what they apparently perceive to be my doddering old age  In the space of a day three people offered me their seats on buses I remember doing that when I last lived here in New York three decades ago But when I gave my seat away back then it was to old ladies and the rare man who looked too frail to stand up holding onto a pole for  minutes These days Im just fine without a seat on the bus I thanked those who offered me theirs and stood   The next day three residents of my building raced past me to hold open the heavy front doors What is their problem I thought I mean I go in and out without assistance many times a day   with a gigantic dog a bag of garbage or a shopping cart Sometimes with all three  Then not two hours later I went shopping at the grocery store seven blocks from home As I was leaving with three bags of groceries the something at the checkout counter asked if I wanted a cab I huffed out and carried my bags home My shoulders are just fine  Its one thing to admire grace in others as age changes who they are Its another thing to accept that you are that someone The other day postponing jury duty by phone which I assumed would require a long ordeal on hold I was instead immediately connected to a person who was clearly not in a call center in Mumbai He couldnt have been nicer Things seemed settled when he jolted me back to reality with a kind question I should have asked before we went through all this he said But you dont have to serve at all if youre  years or older  I want to serve I told him trying to sound selfrighteous not indignant It would be my civic honor  What I wanted to say is not printable in a family blog
