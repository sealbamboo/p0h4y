A British couple are to become parents of two sets of twin babies carried by two Indian surrogate women they have never met Experts say twiblings  or children born to separate surrogates but created from the same batch of embryos  are not uncommon in India The four babies all due in March  are the result of a commercial surrogacy agreement with a clinic in the Indian city of Mumbai   The husband aged  and wife aged  who do not want to be identified travelled to India in May following two miscarriages and several failed attempts at fertility treatment in the UK  I thought to myself why wait and why waste any time and go through ups and downs and attempts again Weve had a long tenyear journey with this he says There are no official figures but Natalie Gamble a lawyer who specialises in international surrogacy cases estimates hundreds of British couples travel to India for surrogacy each year At the Corion clinic in Mumbai the couples eggs and sperm were fertilised to create embryos which were then implanted in two different surrogates to increase the chances of a pregnancy We had six embryos in the fridge and typically you would use one surrogate but I thought get me two surrogates and implant three in each says the husband A month later the clinic called with the news that one of the surrogates was pregnant with twins They were both overjoyed Days later there was another call from the clinic They found two heartbeats in the second surrogate says the wife The clinic was panicking because its never happened before she says They asked us  is this what you want Otherwise tell us now and well do the necessary However the couple say there was never any question of terminating any of the pregnancies Absolutely not if there were three in each we would have had them In a few months time they hope to return to India to pick up their four babies They will not disclose how much they have paid the clinic however a surrogacy package in India on average costs from   to   They are grateful to the two women carrying their babies but insist they have no intention of meeting either surrogate Shes doing a job for us how often do you communicate with your builder or your gardener Shell get paidwe dont need to see her As long as shes healthy and delivers my babies healthily shes done a job for us says the wife Neither is daunted by the challenge of having four babies and both are confident they will be able to financially provide for them For the professional couple from Bedfordshire it is nothing short of an amazing miracle For me to have four children its going to be the same challenge as the next person having one child I dont know any different Im over the moon I cant wait says the woman However the case has raised concerns among health professionals in Britain It is troubling says Dr Rima Rajkhowa a consultant gynaecologist at Birmingham Womens Hospital I think patients who dont work in the medical field are not aware of all the risks that are involved with multiple pregnancies All they can think of and are focused on is having a child and they want to make sure every step is taken to get to that goal I dont think any clinic in the UK will consider treating a commissioning couple with two surrogates simultaneously  It is a view shared by lawyer Natalie Gamble  It wouldnt be allowed here Under the regulation of licensed fertility clinics there are quite strict rules about how many embryos can be transferred and certainly you couldnt transfer embryos to two surrogates in the same cycle she says  The UKs regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority HFEA says that multiple pregnancy can increase the risk of stillbirth neonatal death and disability for the child and complications for the mother including late miscarriage high blood pressure and preeclampsia They recommend single embryo transfer always be performed unless there is a medical reason to transfer more than one embryo  But how common is it for fertility clinics in India  a country where there are no laws governing surrogacy  to offer patients two or more surrogates at a time Dr Kaushal Kadam medical director of the Corion clinic which treated the British couple now expecting four babies insists it is not common practice Its usually a single surrogate but there are times when the couple want more she says But is it really that unusual Several couples who have had babies as a result of surrogacy in India have said clinics offered them the opportunity of using more than one surrogate per cycle Lawyer Natalie Gamble confirms there are similar cases but she believes it is a trend which is largely unique to the subcontinent Weve seen it a few times I wouldnt say its routine but its not massively uncommon in India she says In fact there is even a new term coined for these babies  twiblings Theyre not quite twins and not quite siblings either she says Medical experts believe twiblings represent a fertility phenomenon which has emerged as a direct result of Indias estimated billion dollar surrogacy industry an industry which critics say is driven by profit Surrogacy in the UK is a legal and ethical minefield There are strict laws governing it and commercial surrogacy is banned Meanwhile the Indian government is under increasing pressure to introduce laws to regulate the surrogacy industry Listen to the full
