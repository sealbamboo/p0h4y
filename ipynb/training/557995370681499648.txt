The late  is back for an encore this time as a formerly pimplecausing bacterium that apparently has moved from human skin to the bark of grape vines Italian researchers named the new type of   after the genre bending and iconoclastic Zappa whose surname in Italy also means hoe a nod to the agrarian roots of the winerelated institute where the discovery was made This is the first time its been found that a microorganism can switch from a human to a plant said microbiologist and ardent Zappa fan Andrea Campisano of the Edmund Mach Foundation lead author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution Campisano said he played Zappas music regularly and kept a quote from the genrebending rock musician displayed on his computer screen in the laboratory If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom your dad your teacher your priest or some guy on television  then you deserve it So when the researchers detected the DNA of a bacterium in grape vine cells that looked suspiciously like that of a common human acne bug they didnt toss it out as a contaminated sample according to coauthor Omar RotaStabelli an evolutionary microbiologist at the foundation They followed their muse who once said he made a living by drawing dots on paper and connecting them RotaStabelli used a molecular clock analysis based on rates of DNA mutation to estimate when  might have made its leap from finger to vine It turns out that the most probable date is about  years ago which is when we estimate that we started cultivating grape vines said Campisano Probably as soon as humans started to touch this plant this bug that used to live on human skin found a very hospitable environment inside the cells of the grape vine Comfortably ensconced in bark tissue and pith the bacterium does not appear to harm the grape vines Researchers believe it simply changed its appetite from human fatty acids to those of plant cells In fact it has adapted so well it cannot grow on human skin according to the study It has extensively restructured its genome and DNA and its now unable to go back to its earlier humanassociated form said Campisano And thats a state of being that Frank Zappa probably would appreciate
