Burpees are one of the hardest exercises going And theyre probably not top of the list for expectant moms or for women trying to get in shape for pregnancy But Sara Haley a pre and postnatal exercise specialist based in Santa Monica and creator of the Expecting More workout series for pregnant women says she has a gentler version of burpees She calls them baby burpees but you dont need to be pregnant to enjoy the benefits of this exercise Haley was five months pregnant at the time of this photo shoot She has since given birth to a boy A fullbody exercise that raises the heart rate and builds a foundation and confidence for doing traditional burpees This is a great way to work up to one Haley said Stand  or  feet away from the side of a sturdy chair placed on a mat or carpet  someplace where the chair wont slide away from you Beginners should approach the chair squat down using the seat of the chair for balance and then return to the starting position Repeat breathing fully throughout the exercise but taking care to never push yourself so hard that youre out of breath This movement mimics the first step in doing a fullfledged burpee After a few repetitions of those work on the second half of the traditional burpee movement Use the seat of the chair for balance as you step your feet behind you creating a plank position The wider apart your feet the easier it will be Then walk your feet back in and return to standing Take turns leading with your right foot and then with your left foot so you strengthen both sides Advanced exercisers can begin to put the two movements together for a burpee that uses the chair You can pick up the intensity by using the chair for support and jumping your feet back Another option to advance the movement is taking the burpee to the floor but slowing down the sequence and walking instead of jumping through the lowerbody movements Baby burpees are done by time instead of repetition Haley suggests  seconds of movement followed by  seconds of rest with the goal being two rounds total Do this two or three times a week Haley stresses that there is no need to race the clock or push yourself past your comfort zone while performing this workout Slowly but surely youll find yourself improving
