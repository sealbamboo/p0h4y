The number of older heart failure patients who qualify to enter a cardiac rehabilitation program paid for by Medicare has just been vastly expanded  About two million people are newly eligible Medicare officials estimate   But will they take advantage of it Medical and advocacy groups have been pushing for this change for years  Cardiac rehab supervised by a physician involves a monitored exercise program usually done on a circuit of machines three times a week in addition to instruction and counseling that help patients stop smoking eat healthily and manage stress   Originally Medicare paid for  rehab sessions for people whod had a heart attack bypass surgery or stable angina  episodes of chest discomfort that develop with exertion  More recently Medicare extended cardiac rehab coverage to those who have undergone procedures like heart valve replacement stenting or transplants  But that still left a whole lot of people who didnt fit those criteria Some  percent of Medicare beneficiaries over age  had chronic heart failure in  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports Until now they would have had to pay for cardiac rehab out of pocket To professionals in the field the benefits of cardiac rehab in improving stamina treating depression and lowering the risk of future cardiovascular problems were clear People with heart failure often struggle to climb a flight of stairs or walk half a block  The heart failure patient has typically slowed down is fatigued has poor endurance said David Prince director of cardiac rehabilitation at Montefiore Medical Center in New York This is someone who has learned to live with a lot of limitations  A few decades ago doctors advised such patients to rest  Now of course exercise has become the nearly universal prescription for everything including heart failure  When you deliver appropriate exercise you correct some of the muscular weakness and chemical imbalance Dr Prince said  People feel better  They sleep better They show significant improvement in quality of life In  the last time Medicare officials considered cardiac rehab for additional heart failure patients  those who hadnt had an event or one of those procedures  they decided against broadening coverage At that time the evidence wasnt as strong said Dr Joseph Chin a medical officer in the agencys coverage and analysis group   But the largest randomized controlled trial of cardiac rehab nicknamed HFAction was already underway in  centers in the United States Canada and France  When the researchers reported their results that provided sufficient evidence to look at this again Dr Chin said  The trial assigned  heart failure patients to cardiac rehab three times weekly for  weeks or to usual care  a selfmanagement booklet whose recommendations included exercise  The rehab group started with  to minute exercise sessions then increased to  to  minutes at higher intensity  As they transitioned to exercise at home they were provided with cycles or treadmills and heart rate monitors After an average month followup the rehab group had what the investigators called modest significant reductions  about  percent     That was enough to prompt Medicare to expand coverage  A separate study of the same population   too To qualify for cardiac rehab through Medicare patients still have to meet certain criteria including left ventricular ejection fraction a measure of cardiac output of  percent or less and Class II to IV symptoms on the widely used New York Heart Association classification system Patients also have to be on drug therapy as most already are   Still its a fairly big expansion Dr Chin said  Of the four million Medicare beneficiaries over age  estimated to have heart failure about half will now qualify for rehab Historically though only a minority of those eligible for cardiac rehab   studies have shown though those numbers have improved  Were getting there said Dr Marjorie King a cardiologist at Helen Hayes Hospital in Rockland County NY of efforts to increase awareness and enrollment  Its inching up Dr King past president of the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation ticked off a number of barriers  Rehab programs that dont have flexible hours or arent accessible to rural or inner city patients  Medicare copays among those who lack supplementary insurance  Fears that rehab means spandex and jogging No   Probably at the top of the list physicians who neglect to make referrals  Its not that they dont agree that it works Dr King said  They just plain forget Prescribing drugs seems faster and easier and procedures pay more cardiac rehab generally isnt a profit center  So there may be a role here for family caregivers of heart failure patients If nobody mentions cardiac rehab at your older relatives medical appointment ask about it  The strength of physicians recommendations has been shown to increase rehab enrollment Dr King pointed out  They have to look the patient in the eye and say This will help you feel better and live longer  Heres the prescription  Go
