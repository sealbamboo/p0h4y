It was well past midnight and most of the patients had settled in The hospital ward was quiet except for the howler The howler was a patient in his s who earned his nickname for his nightly bouts of yelling This was in the early s during the peak of the AIDS epidemic I was a secondyear medical resident at Bellevue Hospital in charge of the sprawling AIDS ward that night Admissions were rolling in one after another each more feverish and emaciated than the previous This patient was already receiving hefty doses of pain medication yet he kept screaming to the nurses about his pain This went on night after night despite extensive medical evaluations to see if there were any missed explanations for his pain Nothing seemed to help and the nightly yowling was agitating the other patients and driving the nursing staff to distraction The head nurse paged me at  am You have to   she said I went to the patients room It was my fourth visit of the night and the patient and I were both pretty exasperated with each other He was sullen and cranky I was exhausted and at my wits end I pulled out a syringe and carefully drew up one cc of plain saline You know about Tylenol I said showing him the liquidfilled syringe Youve heard of Tylenol  Theres even a Tylenol  This  and here I paused for dramatic effect this is Tylenol  The patient stopped howling and gave me an interested look Then he lowered his pajamas and allowed me to inject his gluteus maximus Afterward I pulled up a chair to his bedside and we waited together allowing the minutes to tick unhurriedly by After what seemed like a mutually agreeable time I stood up and bid him goodnight The patient put his head to the pillow and promptly fell asleep The ward was silent for the rest of the night I felt terribly guilty that I had committed an outright deception with this patient  something that is a true nono But on the other hand it was the first night he got a full night of sleep to say nothing of all the other patients on the ward and the rest of the staff When I related this story to Dr Ted J Kaptchuk director of the program in placebo studies at Harvard he gave a sigh of recognition We all have our moments of desperation he said Usually around midnight Dr Kaptchuk does not condone deception but his research bears out that how caregivers present and administer treatments has a powerful effect on clinical outcomes Patients for example who received pain medicine directly from a doctor achieved better pain relief than patients who unknowingly received the same medicine even at higher doses automatically in their IVs The rituals the doctor performs  drawing up the medication visibly injecting it into the IV discussing expected benefits  not to mention the attention and caring that comes with the presence of an actual human being    as doubling the dose of the medicine Placebos used to be thought of as psychological mumbojumbo more akin to hypnotism than real medicine The biological breakthrough came in  when   that not only was the placebo effect real but that it could be reversed by administering naloxone  the chemical that blocks our endorphins our natural painkillers Suddenly there was a plausible pharmacological mechanism for how placebos work and research in the field flowered In June Harvard Medical School and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation held an   devoted entirely to placebo science Dr Kaptchuk describes placebos as not just the traditional sugar pill but also everything that surrounds a medical treatment how caregivers describe the medication how they administer it the expectations they have for the medicine their tone of voice their strength of eye contact In short everything that doctors and nurses do in an interaction with a patient This is not especially surprising Healers and shamans have known intuitively about the importance of this interaction since the dawn of time Before we had developed treatments that could significantly impact the pathology of disease  antibiotics chemotherapy stents organ transplants transfusions  the everything else was the mainstay of medical care Doctors and nurses always feel a bit uneasy when it comes to placebos Somehow it seems wrong unethical deceptive But patients it turns out seem to be more flexible in their thinking   symptom relief even when patients are told they are getting a placebo many patients are   If it gets rid of the pain a patient once told me I dont care if its a dill pickle The ethics are evolving but the general consensus is that transparency is the bottom line What I did as a young  and desperate  resident wouldnt pass muster because I deceived my patient about the medication But if Id told him that it was inert saline and if he was amenable to trying it it could have been a reasonable treatment option And it still might have helped him especially if we had been able to have a detailed and compassionate conversation about his pain Dr Kaptchuk thinks of placebo effects as just one of the many things in the toolkit of medicine It would never be a substitute for appropriate medical care but it is something that can enhance medical care greatly Wise doctors and nurses already do this Theyve found usually just by personal experience that their everything else  respect attention comfort empathy touch  often does the lions share of medical care no deception
