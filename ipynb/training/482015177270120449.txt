A new study adds to the evidence that lowdose aspirin known to reduce the risk for heart disease may also reduce the risk for pancreatic cancer Pancreatic cancer has a  percent fatality rate and   there will be about  new cases and  deaths from the disease this year In a fiveyear study   researchers compared aspirin use in  pancreatic cancer patients with  randomly chosen controls Participants were asked about past and present regular use of aspirin defined as at least once a week for three months After controlling for age sex race smoking diabetes and other variables the researchers found that regular aspirin use lowered the risk for pancreatic cancer by  percent Patients who had been taking aspirin regularly for one to three years reduced their risk by  percent those who had been taking it for seven to  years reduced risk by  percent Why aspirin would do this is unclear Pancreatic cancer takes  to  years to develop said the senior author Dr Harvey A Risch of the Yale School of Public Health We dont know if the aspirin is preventing the formation of new tumors or helping the immune system to control them later on Empirically it seems to do something and at this point thats all we can say Â
