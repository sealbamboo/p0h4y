Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and harder to break They are used in products such as detergents beauty products and childrens toys People are also exposed to phthalates by eating and drinking from containers containing them according to the    Previous studies  primarily in rodents  have linked BPA exposure to   including reproductive disorders but at this point the   that it has carefully assessed these studies and finds no convincing evidence to support that belief Phthalates   to health issues such as male sexual development and attentiondeficit disorder in children Its not clear what effect if any phthalates have on health   noting that there is insufficient evidence of harmful effects to take regulatory action  More evidence may be on the way  One study presented at the conference looked at  couples who were trying to become pregnant The couples in the study were interviewed and examined and provided urine samples to measure their BPA and phthalate levels They also kept journals about intercourse menstrual cycles and pregnancy tests  Researchers found that the men  but not women  with high phthalate concentrations experienced a  decline in fertility and took longer to get their partners pregnant than men with lower concentrations   Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors meaning they interfere with our hormone systems said American Society of Reproductive Medicine President Linda Giudice who was not involved in the research If a couple is having trouble getting pregnant they should try to minimize the males exposure to phthalates Giudice says  Phthalates are antiandrogens and other studies have shown that environmental levels of phthalates in infertile men correlate with increased rates of sperm DNA damage low sperm counts and abnormal sperm she said  In another smaller study presented at the conference  women were asked to give blood samples four or five weeks into their pregnancies The samples werent tested for BPA until after the women gave birth to live babies or after they had a miscarriage if it occurred in the first trimester Sixtyeight of the pregnancies ended in miscarriages  Researchers concluded that women who had high levels of BPA in their blood were at significantly increased risk of miscarriage compared to women with the lowest levels They believe that more research on how this chemical affects pregnancy is urgently needed We expected BPA exposure to be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy genetic defects in miscarriages because of animal studies linking BPA exposure with chromosome abnormalities in eggs study author Dr Ruth Bunker Lathi said But we found BPA was higher in both chromosomally normal and abnormal miscarriages  Lathi suggests that the BPA may be acting in other ways to cause miscarriages We just dont know the mechanism at this time Researchers say they dont know why certain women in the study had higher BPA levels they did not ask whether the women were doing specific things like leaving their plastic water bottles outside in the heat something thought to increase BPA levels in the water dramatically Its not routine to do BPA testing in patients who are struggling to carry a child to term said Dr Dorothy MitchellLeef a fertility expert at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta who was not involved in the research But she says studies like this further highlight the impact the environment can have on fertility and miscarriage It gives you one more thing to ask the patients about when you see unexplained miscarriages in patients Neither study showed an actual cause and effect But Giudice says there are ways to   to BPA if parents are worried  She advises against leaving plastic water bottles in the car microwaving plastic containers eating canned foods and touching paper receipts that contain BPA The FDA also warns against putting very hot or boiling liquid in plastic containers made with BPA if you plan to consume the water Thats because BPA levels rise in food when containers or products made with the chemical are heated and come in contact with the food according to the agency For that reason the FDA also   used to make baby bottles and toddler cups
