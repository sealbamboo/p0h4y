How sick and disabled how far into advanced dementia how close to death do elderly nursing home patients have to be before their physicians stop prescribing drugs that can cause uncomfortable side effects but show scant evidence of helping them Let me quickly acknowledge that this was my own reaction to a study published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine part of its weekly   series Researchers use far more measured terms sometimes the things they report make you wonder how they manage that Consider this nationwide sample of  people with a diagnosis of advanced dementia who spent at least  days in a nursing home between  and  Most were over age  and had other diseases as well The great majority almost  percent had a donotresuscitate order Its always a heartbreaking situation Dementia is a terminal disease although family members dont always recognize that and health care professionals dont always explain it By definition these patients can no longer recognize family members most are bedridden with a vocabulary that has shrunk to five words or fewer They cant walk or feed themselves or communicate meaningfully said Dr Jennifer Tjia a geriatrician and palliative care specialist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the studys lead author A lot also have severe swallowing difficulties Moreover Dr Tjia added These folks have a very high mortality rate Many die within six months A number of previous studies have shown that health care proxies who make medical decisions for such patients overwhelmingly   Yet pharmacy records revealed that most of these patients almost  percent   More than a third were given a cholinesterase inhibitor Aricept is the best known and a quarter received memantine Namenda both commonly prescribed for dementia More than  percent were on statins to lower cholesterol and  percent were on blood thinners All these drugs were deemed never appropriate for palliative care patients with advanced dementia in a   and published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society And the United States Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that in some patients with mild to moderate not advanced dementia drug therapies   but the clinical significance of these improvements is uncertain Then why I asked Dr Tjia describe them as of questionable benefit Why not call them medications of zero benefit She said that the drugs had their proponents and that discontinuing them remained controversial in some quarters despite little evidence of effectiveness If the only problem with such medications was uselessness and cost which averaged  per quarter perhaps we would shrug But as with any medical treatment they can also do harm I was a nursing home doc for years Dr Tjia told me Theres an unappreciated personal cost to these patients in continuing these medications Aricept and Namenda for instance can induce nausea and fainting and uncomfortable urinary retention They can also cause heart arrhythmia which in turn can lead to implanting a pacemaker A classic prescribing cascade Dr Tjia said Were treating the side effect of a drug with more drugs or in this case devices  People with severe dementia one recent study found are   Statins have a documented risk of muscle pain along with elevated blood glucose People who have lost the ability to speak cant tell their doctors that they ache or constantly feel like vomiting But the agitation or lashing out sometimes seen in patients with dementia  possibly triggering another round of drugs  sometimes reflects their physical discomfort Discontinuing drugs sometimes helps them to remain alert and relaxed although again theres no strong published evidence either way Why are so many people in this unhappy situation being given questionable drugs when even swallowing pills can be difficult As with many treatments geography is destiny In the Census Bureaus Middle Atlantic Region  New York New Jersey Pennsylvania  about  percent of patients got at least one of these drugs In the West South Central Region Texas Arkansas Oklahoma Louisiana  percent did Moreover they were more frequently prescribed in nursing homes with higher use of feeding tubes That indicates that theres a level of discretion in whats happening Dr Tjia said Its not just clinical need driving this Nursing homes hospitals even cities and regions have their own cultures and practice patterns and professionals often tend to follow their peers But emotions play a part as well Dr Tjia said And who could disagree The idea that a family is doing everything for a failing loved one or a doctor for his or her patient remains potent despite many warnings that not every drug or procedure is benign despite fullfledged   The idea that there could be benefits to stopping medication is still a pretty radical issue for most people Dr Tjia said  and she meant both professionals and families For some folks its a marker that the end is near and thats hard In an   Dr Greg A Sachs an Indiana University geriatrician said the findings should cause all clinicians to reconsider their prescribing practices and other decisionmaking for a broad population of patients late in life That would be nice But meanwhile family members can question the purpose and value of drugs their loved ones continue to receive as they decline Especially when theyve lost the ability to speak for themselves
