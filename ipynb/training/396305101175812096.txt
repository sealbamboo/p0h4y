
 To those of us in training the hospital was cursed At least when it came to a certain operation  We dreaded being asked to scrub in at these operations because we knew we would be forced to hold patient parts until our fingers went numb and arms quivered The surgeons hunted stabbed and slashed their way through the procedure and whenever their knife would go a little too far or their knot would slip or their stitch pull we braced ourselves for their furyand for the inevitable extra time it would take for them to correct their errors  The patients many of whom had come in to the hospital walking and talking ended up lingering for weeks afterward with infections open wounds and other complications But everything changed when a new surgeon came on board Built like a rugby player he shocked us first with his speed and then his results The once unbearable daylong slog became a mornings work and instead of spending weeks in the hospital his patients went home after eight days  In the operating room his bear paw hands turned delicate teasing out tissues caressing vessels and nimbly knotting thread as fine as human hair There was not a single wasted movement and each step blended seamlessly with the next giving those of us who had the fortune to observe the sense that we were watching not surgery but a wellchoreographed ballet  Its like youre just standing there holding the needle or knife said one friend who was lucky enough to assist the new surgeon and hes moving the body underneath you  I remembered this surgeon  and the dramatic differences between his colleagues and him  when I read a   on the relationship between a surgeons operative technique and patient outcomes It has been   that not all surgeons produce the same results The reasons however have remained elusive Most studies on surgical quality have focused on what surgeons do before and after surgery practices that are easy to measure and analyze like   and administering blood thinners to    But even with the most compulsive adherence to these pre and postoperative protocols and much to the chagrin of many a wellintentioned health care expert payer and policy maker    The reason observers have postulated may be the one obvious thing that most of these initiatives have scrupulously avoided what goes on in the operating room  Now an innovative collaboration between researchers payers and weightloss surgeons the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative has addressed thatwhichcouldnotbenamed And their findings have confirmed what patients have long suspected and trainees have long known  the dexterity of a surgeons hands can account for much of the differences in how well patients do Researchers from the group asked a panel of surgeonexperts to review videotapes of operations performed by  unnamed surgeons who were part of the collaborative They then asked the surgeonexperts to come up with a ranking based on the deftness with which operating instruments were used the gentleness with which tissues were handled the degree to which the surgeons were able to expose key areas the time and amount of movement required to perform each step and the general flow of the operation The researchers then confirmed that the rankings remained consistent by asking a different group of surgeonexperts to evaluate the videotapes  To the researchers surprise there were huge variations in operative skill between the practicing surgeons with the lowest ranked surgeons working at what the reviewers considered a level only slightly better than a trainee at the end of residency and the highestranking surgeons working like masters in their field  You didnt have to be an expert to see the difference said Dr John D Birkmeyer a surgeon who is lead author of the study and director of the Center for Health Care Outcomes and Policy at the University of Michigan Dr Birkmeyer and his coauthors then reviewed the records of the  surgeons postoperative complications and compared them with their rankings Not surprisingly surgeons in the bottom quartile took  percent more time to complete the same operation and had higher mortality rates than topranked surgeons But their patients also ran a significantly higher chance of developing a whole host of complications including wound infections pneumonia bleeding and thrombophlebitis and required reoperation and readmission to the hospital after discharge more often than patients of surgeons whose rankings were in the top quartile  The study is the first to reliably measure operative skills in practicing surgeons and correlate those measurements with patient outcomes We now have a scientific way to evaluate a practicing surgeons skill that is as reliable as about anything we measure in health care in terms of quality Dr Birkmeyer observed  Being able to measure operative skill could change how patients and doctors approach surgery Currently patients have few direct ways to evaluate a potential surgeon and end up trying to divine the quality of operative technique by researching where the surgeon trained  or relying on wordofmouth Regulatory organizations too must   like a surgeons training and performance on multiple choice tests and oral exams These methods of appraisal even with the best available approximations of operating room scenarios can only offer indications of how a surgeon might actually perform in the operating room  Even practicing surgeons who have few opportunities after residency training to strengthen their operative techniques may benefit from the research Dr Birkmeyer and his colleagues are currently studying how coaching from master surgeons might help other surgeons improve their rankings There may be some strategies for not just measuring a problem but ultimately fixing it  But its those practicing surgeons who may also be most resistant to such evaluations For surgeons performance in the operating room is hugely personal Dr Birkmeyer noted Having it evaluated can be seen as highly threatening  Still organizations like The Leapfrog Group whose members include large employers trying to improve health care are considering using similar methods to help patients identify safer hospitals for surgery And Dr Birkmeyer and his colleagues are extending their efforts to include studies looking at how operative technique might correlate with patient outcomes in prostate colon and spine surgery  It makes sense that some individuals might be naturally more talented at surgery like some people are better at music or athletics Dr Birkmeyer said  But this isnt just about who is the better tennis player he added  Peoples lives are at stake And here is   of a lessskilled surgeon Credit Dr Jonathan F Finks clinical assistant professor of surgery
