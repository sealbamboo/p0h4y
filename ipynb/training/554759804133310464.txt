But look at her now  CNN medical producer John Bonifield and I had the pure joy of seeing this wonderful young lady again last week Her name is Jenny and shes  years old and a prekindergartner in Miami She can write her name and loves to color and dress up as a princess and is adorable and spunky and smart and funny  Here are all the miracles that it took to save her life   That someone happened to find Jenny in the rubble four days after the quake   That at a time when vehicles were in short supply Jennys rescuers flagged down a car to rush her to the hospital   That the Medishare team of doctors and nurses led by Dr Karen Schneider an emergency medicine physician at Johns Hopkins managed to get fluids into her Jenny was so dehydrated her veins had collapsed and Schneider had to put a needle through her shinbone and directly into her bone marrow to deliver fluids They didnt have to sedate her  Jenny was so unconscious she didnt even cry Heres Schneider reunited with Jenny a year after her rescue  That Project Medishare found a flight headed immediately to Miami because she needed surgery the tent hospital couldnt provide Hospital workers flagged down a UN truck and promised the driver theyd name the baby after her if she got the airport on time   That the baby then named Patricia after the truck driver survived the flight to Miami and the emergency surgery  When the baby arrived in Miami it was presumed her parents were dead Shed been found in the rubble next to the body of a woman thought to be her mother  But that woman turned out to be her baby sitter Shortly after the baby arrived in Miami a couple came forward saying they were her parents Many people doubted them thinking they just wanted to get to Miami but DNA testing showed they were telling the truth and the babys name was actually Jenny  Now Jenny and her parents Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis and her monthold little sister Naima live in an apartment in North Miami Her parents have explained to Jenny that the bumpy scars on her left arm are from when she was crushed in the rubble of the Haiti earthquake Theyve told her shes a miracle that Jesus saved her  Jenny nods her head and says she understands But really shes a little embarrassed by all the attention and just wants to go put on her Cinderella dress and go outside and ride her bike and then draw pictures of big red flowers under a sun and sign her name  Jenny Alexis
