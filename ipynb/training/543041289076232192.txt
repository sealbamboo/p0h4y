Doctors diagnosed Castanada with StevensJohnson Syndrome a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications   When she took the medication she started having a hard time breathing and she told her mom that her lips were burning her throat her eyes they got so red that she couldnt talk So she rushed her to the ER and thats when they diagnosed her with the disease And from there it has just spiraled to a nightmare Hughes said Now Castanada the mother of a monthold is in critical condition at the University of California Irvine burn center Her prognosis is good even though the disease has a high mortality rate according to Dr Victor Joe the centers director But the situation Castanadas family says has been devastating Just unreal just watching your daughter burn in front of you literally burn in front of you her mother Laura Corona told KABC Every day a new blister a new burn a new scar And shes just Mommy I want to go home And I cant take her home I cant put water on her lips  On a website created to raise funds for Castanadas care her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine A  friend offered her an antibiotic pill that she had from a previous illness Corona wrote She was thinking that it would help her This would be the biggest mistake of her life Now Corona says shes hoping to spread the word so others dont make the same mistake Dont share medication Dont give someone else your medication Dont offer medication she said She also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to  before its too late At first doctors diagnosed Castanada with StevensJohnson Syndrome which refers to a condition where between  and  of the skin on the body is affected Joe said Now shes experiencing Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis the diagnosis when more than  of the body is affected Joe estimates that  of Castanedas skin and mucus membranes have been affected The allergic reaction is causing layers of Castanedas skin to separate Joe said creating lesions that grow into large open wounds Patients can experience problems with taste swallowing eyesight and sexual functions can be affected In Yaasmeens case we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected This can cause scarring of the corneas which could lead to permanent blindness he said We are trying to prevent that from happening Photos on the fundraising website show Castanada lying in a hospital bed with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her As part of her treatment for the disease doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing Joe said We have chosen to place a dressing that adheres to the open wound which allows her skin to heal without having to remove the bandages to wash the wounds he said Mortality for those suffering from StevensJohnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis can be as high as  in adults but tends to be lower with early treatment   Though its uncommon Joe said his hospital has treated around six cases in the past year because the burn center has experience treating open wounds This is very sobering The fact that you can get a lifethreatening situation from taking a medication  It can happen and most people dont think twice about taking pills for things Joe said In fact most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication just not this severe After recovering from StevensJohnson Syndrome patients usually only have minor issues with their skin such as dryness Joe said Hopefully new skin will come in Corona told KABC Im just there watching All I can tell her is Hang on hang on Its almost over
