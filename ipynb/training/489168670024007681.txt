What we really want if were honest is a pill or a shot that would allow us to stop worrying about ever sinking into dementia Instead what were hearing about preventing dementia is in many ways the same stuff we hear about preventing other kinds of illnesses Healthy lifestyles Behavioral modification Stress reduction At the   this week researchers from Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine were among the scientists presenting findings that had little to do with amyloid in the brain and a lot to do with how people feel and act and cope with life A number of people have been interested in modifiable lifestyle factors for years said Richard Lipton a neurologist at the college and director of the   which has tracked cognition in elderly Bronx residents since the s But interest has increased lately he said Its at least in part a reflection of disappointing drug trials Medications have failed over and over to prevent or cure or substantially slow the ravages of dementing diseases What else might help Dr Lipton and his colleagues who  monitor about  people aged  to  have been exploring the impact of stress More specifically they have been measuring perceived stress a metric not so much about unpleasant things happening as how people respond to them They use a scale based on the answers to  questions like In the past month how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems and  In the past month how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high you could not overcome them In one smaller study presented in Copenhagen a team followed  people average age at the start  who had amnestic mild cognitive impairment a combination of memory loss and other cognitive deficits that typically progresses Over an average of two and a half years about a quarter of these people developed dementia Those with the highest perceived stress on the scale the researchers found had two and a half times the risk of dementia compared with those who were less stressed In a larger study of  participants who were cognitively normal average age just over  about  percent developed amnestic mild cognitive impairment over an average followup of almost four years again high stress scores showed significant association with cognitive loss And neuroticism  mostly high anxiety  intensified that effect A huge number of behavioral approaches to reducing stress have been shown to be effective in reducing various illnesses Dr Lipton said citing biofeedback techniques to help control migraines as an example Cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness programs relaxation strategies yoga  could any of these help reduce stress and keep cognitively normal people from sliding into cognitive impairment or slow those with impairment from progressing to dementia You want to intervene before people get the functional impairments Dr Lipton said like forgetting to turn off the stove getting lost in familiar neighborhoods and then the full spectrum forgetting everything Such experiments are already underway at Albert Einstein and elsewhere but these are very very early days with only smallscale pilot studies he cautioned Well probably hear more about lifestyle changes and some very dread diseases For instance Judith Graham reported here last year on   As with these stress findings its not yet clear whether depressed people are more likely to become demented or whether the depression is a symptom of cognitive decline already at work This week an article in JAMA Neurology looked into whether eating foods high in certain polyunsaturated fatty acids could   Conclusion Yes it might And in Copenhagen   in which  older adults at risk for cognitive impairment were randomly divided into two groups Those who participated in a program including exercise social activities nutritional counseling and cognitive training plus management of cardiovascular health did significantly better on several kinds of cognitive tests two years later than a control group  The quest to defeat dementia has brought heartache and failure many times But we need to be doing most of these things anyway  eating intelligently exercising treating depression reducing stress  if only to have enjoyable healthy active lives It would be awfully nice to think they were helping our brains resist damage too Its been a great  or  years for cardiovascular risk reduction for heart attack and stroke Dr Lipton told me rattling off what cardiologists have learned and public health advocates have emphasized about controlling blood pressure and cholesterol and diabetes My hope is that with regard to dementia and Alzheimers we are where the cardiologists were  years ago and we can move quickly to reduce the burden of these godawful diseases
