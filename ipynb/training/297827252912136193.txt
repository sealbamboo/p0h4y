Americans seeking stem cell replacement therapy hope the process can heal them of myriad diseases and   estimated the industry could bring in  billion in revenue by  But the Food and Drug Administration has expressed concerns The agency   at a Regenerative Sciences clinic in Colorado and   of another company Celltex Therapeutics in Texas While patients in dire situations are willing to try the therapy and pay the hefty costs theres concern the research doesnt support broad practice just yet SammyJo Wilkinson remembers the day  years ago when she suddenly couldnt stand She was a young ambitious computer programmer launching an Internet startup Her doctor told her it was secondary progressive multiple sclerosis Now at  Wilkinson is in a wheelchair Shes tried every available FDAapproved drug and two experimental therapies including a twoyear course of chemotherapy Nothing worked Over time she started researching adult stem cell replacement but it was available only abroad The US opened its doors to the treatment two years ago Wilkinson had to see a doctor first but then she paid Celltex  for stem cell replacement In a nutshell the company promises to remove good healthy stem cells store them make more and put them back into her body where they can help her heal Wilkinson tells NPRs Laura Sullivan she got better immediately   of her  MSrelated symptoms have either improved or completely disappeared Last October she was scheduled to have her second round of treatment but then the FDA shut down the Celltex lab Journalist Susan Berfield investigated the FDAs case against Celltex   What the FDA said is what Celltex does to the stem cells is more than minimally manipulated which means that when they put the stem cells in that medium theyre doing something to it and that process needs to be regulated she tells Sullivan She says that what Celltex argues is that what it offers should be considered a medical procedure rather than a product or drug which would have to be approved and regulated by the FDA But the FDA wasnt satisfied that what Celltex was promising the patients is what the patients were getting Berfield says Andrea Ferrenz executive vice president and legal counsel for Celltex says the company is not selling a cure to sick people She says the company provides treatment only when doctors request the companys services for their patients One of the doctors who refers patients is Celltex cofounder Stanley Jones Ferrenz says this is not a conflict and that Jones is one of many doctors who want their patients to undergo adult stem cell replacement He is also a patient himself for his arthritis The company is keeping a research arm open in the United States but the profitmaking part of the company is headed to Mexico Ferrenz says where its opening a new clinic to expand the growing business COFEPRIS Mexicos equivalent of the FDA is as concerned with safety for the people in its country as the US FDA she says Ferrenz cites studies the company has done and some independent research that suggests the treatments are effective But many scientists disagree Among the skeptics is Dr George Daley who works at Boston Childrens Hospital and is a founder of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Theres a lot of promise but we are still in the earliest experimental stages The data even in animals has been highly variable he says Certainly we dont have convincing compelling evidence that these cells work in humans certainly not for the vast array of diseases that seem to be being treated at this time Daley says the therapy does have a lot of promise though Its even used at Childrens Hospital but only with certain cancers and diseases doctors are sure it treats Daley says stem cell therapy could become an everyday practice in a few decades We need decades to learn how to harness the healing power of stem cells he says For MS patients like Wilkinson the future may be too far away I dont have time she says Im completely out of time Wilkinson recognizes that the FDA has to do its job and that Celltex has to protect itself as well But she says in the end there will only be one loser in this fight over stem cells My husband and I have decided  through endless hours of discussion that this is the best investment we can make to improve both our lives she says Were always just waiting in hope Thats exactly what critics of these companies are worried about
