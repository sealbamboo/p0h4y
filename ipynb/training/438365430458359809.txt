This week I answer readers questions about what doctors can ask for in advance and the nuances of switching insurance plans both on and off the health exchanges A Probably not The contracts that physicians sign with insurers in order to be included in a plans provider network include hold harmless provisions that prohibit doctors from charging members more than a copayment or other specified costsharing amount for services that are covered In addition many states have laws prohibiting providers from   health plan members for amounts over what the insurer paid on a claim It doesnt matter where you buy your coverage the same rules apply To the extent that there are state restrictions or contracts theyre the same in qualified health plans on the marketplaces and other plans says   project director at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms But given the sometimes chaotic enrollment process for the exchanges it may be hard for   which patients are in network and when their insurance becomes effective This could lead to confusion over   Some physicians operate boutique practices that promise extra services or more personal attention for an additional fee But it doesnt sound as if the  charge was related to any particular service or type of care that you received and even if it were you should have been told about it in advance Providers frequently ask to keep credit card information on file in case there are additional uncovered charges or you owe more than anticipated because you havent met your deductible for example But patients have to sign an authorization agreeing to that in advance says Reid Blackwelder president of the American Academy of Family Physicians or they can opt not to do so A In general people can buy a marketplace plan only during the   which will continue until March  for  coverage and begin again in the fall for coverage that starts in  If people have significant changes in life circumstances however they may qualify for a   that allows them to buy a new plan outside of the regular open enrollment period These life changes include getting married losing a job or having a child While the birth of a child creates a day window to change plans neither the pregnancy nor the birth itself would be covered under that new plan says   senior counsel at the National Womens Law Center However if you get pregnant it does change your eligibility for   says Palanker Medicaid covers prenatal care labor and delivery and  days of postpartum care In most states the income eligibility threshold for women who are pregnant is at least  percent of the federal poverty level  for a twoperson household in  Medicaid pays for  percent of the births in the United States A You may be Under the health law most health plans that offer   have to extend that coverage up to age  even if the child is financially independent or married Until  plans that had grandfathered status under the law could sidestep the requirement if the adult child had health coverage available through an employer But when these plans renew their coverage this year that exception no longer applies says Sandy Ageloff a health and group benefits leader at Towers Watson a human resources consulting firm If your health plan is grandfathered and if the new plan year doesnt start until later this year and if your son has an offer of health insurance at his parttime job its possible that your employer can justify not offering him coverage until the new plan year begins But thats a lot of ifs
