 Rory Staunton started flying planes when he was still in single digits Hed sit for hours in front of a flight simulator on his computer learning the routes from New York to London or London to Tokyo or Tokyo to San Francisco He knew every country in the world by their airports and he planned to visit all of them When his parents told him he had to be at least  to take flying lessons yearold Rory got on the computer and did a little research while his parents were out to dinner Ive got it he said when they returned home I found a school in Long Island where you can get flying lessons when youre  Rory tended not to give up On May    his th birthday  he hopped into a twoseater next to his instructor and took off into the sky above Long Island as his parents Ciaran and Orlaith and his little sister Kathleen watched from the ground their hearts in their throats and their hands clasped tightly together Less than a year later Rory was gone killed by whats believed to be complications from a common strep infection Now his family is living its worst nightmare and wondering what could have been done to save their son When Rory fell and cut his elbow on Tuesday March  while playing basketball at the Garden School in Queens NY it wasnt particularly gruesome So scant was the blood he got a bandage and went on his way his father says The next day Wednesday the cut reopened This time Rory was given two bandages He seemed fine otherwise so no further treatment was administered his parents say It was just a simple scrape But later that night around  am Rory woke up complaining of a strong pain in his leg He said he needed to vomit Orlaith massaged the area until her son fell back to sleep but Rory woke up before morning achy and feverish On Thursday his leg pain was worse And his temperature was  His parents say they called his pediatrician and left a message Hours passed and Rorys fever continued to rise They called twice more An appointment was scheduled for that evening By the  pm appointment Rory was almost too weak to walk He had chills and blue marks were strewn across his body He threw up as soon as he arrived at the pediatricians office and again while she was examining him Ciaran Staunton described Rorys leg pain and mentioned the cut on his elbow She noticed his throat was red so she took a swab to test for strep throat The results came back negative It was probably a stomach bug his father says she told him It was going around To be safe she recommended he go to the emergency room where they could put him on IV fluids and give him something to prevent the vomiting The Stauntons drove Rory to New York University Medical Center in lower Manhattan They were extremely worried Ciaran Staunton is a hearty man with a lilting Irish brogue and an easy warmth He came to the United States from County Mayo more than  years ago and has lived the past decade in New York City where he is a prominent local businessman the president of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and above all else a husband and father When Rory was  days old Staunton says I brought him here This is where we sat In this corner Staunton nods to a booth in the upstairs restaurant of his bar ONeills an Irish pub tucked away between drab gray office buildings in the heart of midtown Manhattan The place is empty save for a few bartenders and busboys and for a moment he is alone with his son in the memory of that May morning just over a decade ago He shows how he cradled the baby against his chest rocking his arms side to side and his face softens to a warm smile Rory wanted to be a pilot but he also wanted to make change in the world Staunton says When he was born his uncle Niall ODowd heralded his arrival in the ethnic newspaper the with the headline Rory Staunton Will Announce in  for President Rory was a natural leader with a strong social conscience and a passion for politics that no doubt came from his father He and his dad were best friends and Rory often stayed up late during election season to watch the primaries with his dad Recently he had helped start a debate team at school Thanks to his father Rory had met President Bill Clinton and his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hed shaken hands with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama He counted Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King among his heroes Before he was old enough to vote he knew more about the world and the people who ran it than many adults know But in other ways he was very much a typical yearold Rory was always hanging out here Staunton says referring to ONeills He used to swim around the corner at the YMCA and afterward hed come in with his cousin and his sister and theyd have their fries and their scrambled eggs and then run around downstairs He pulls his sons school picture from his wallet one of many photographs he keeps on him and in the bars office in the basement Its a recent shot and a nice one Rory smiling his shaggy red hair combed neatly out of his eyes his broad shoulders turned squarely at the camera Hes a goodlooking kid right Fivenine  pounds A young strapping guy Just months after the school photo Rory was nearly unrecognizable when he arrived at the emergency room of New York University Medical Center He grimaced in pain and his tall sturdy frame suddenly seemed smaller and more childlike His father says that a nurse took him to an observation area where he was hooked up to IV fluids and examined by two doctors Both echoed what his pediatrician had said Staunton recalls It was probably a stomach bug There was one going around Staunton says he wasnt convinced but he filled the prescription for   a stomach medication and took Rory home The next day Friday Rorys condition worsened He could tolerate only halfspoonfuls of fluid at a time and he needed help sitting up in bed He had diarrhea a fever and more mysterious blue marks By  that night the bruiselike blue marks strafed his body and Rorys skin had turned a sickly yellow color Now the blue marks were accompanied by several bright red spots on his skin He was desperately weak Staunton called the pediatrician  his sixth call in two days he says This time she told him to take Rory immediately back to the emergency room There doctors swiftly ushered Rory to a bed and an oxygen mask Rory what day is it one of them asked I dont know but I know its March Staunton has memorized this conversation and every other conversation from those few days after Rory got sick He recounts them all almost mechanically the details pouring forth in one long uninterrupted stream his voice quiet but steady his eyes cloudy but unblinking Ask him who the president is Orlaith said Rory whos the president Barack Obama Who will be the president for the next four years Here Staunton pauses choking up and unable to continue talking about one of his final conversations with his son He takes a deep shaky breath and then in a choked whisper finishes his thought He begins to weep Rory was gravely ill the ER doctors told Ciaran and Orlaith Critical they said The cut on his elbow had been infected with strep  the same strep for which his pediatrician had swabbed his throat  and it was now attacking his system His kidneys were failing He needed oxygen His arm had turned black as the tissue died from necrosis They had resuscitated him twice They were fighting it  Rory was fighting it  but he was sick and he wasnt going to get better Griefstricken the Stauntons sat with their son all weekend telling him stories they hoped he would hear and know how much he was loved When he died Sunday April  four days after falling ill they got into bed with him and held him the trickle of sweat down the back of his neck still warm The cause of death the family got from the hospitalan official autopsy report from the medical examiner is not yet availablewas streptococcal toxic shock caused by   or group A strep infection Group A streptococci are the bacteria most commonly responsible for   which affects an estimated  million people in the United States every year  including the Stauntons say several students at Rorys school in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization For most of these millions the symptoms of strep are relatively mild sore throat fever swollen tonsils In some cases patients experience   or sinus problems but even then a quick round of antibiotics is usually enough to kill the infection Fortunately strep continues to be susceptible to antibiotics including good old penicillin It remains very very treatable under most circumstances says Camille Sabella MD a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic A lot of times when people dont get well from strep its not because we dont have the drugs to treat it its because the effects of the bacteria are so aggressive With these infections the bacteria typically invade the body in other ways opening the door for serious complications such as necrotizing fasciitis flesheating disease bacteremia blood poisoning or as in Rorys case toxic shock There are some strains of group A strep that can be very aggressive and produce toxins that break down the skin and the soft tissues Dr Sabella explains When that happens the bacteria can break though the very superficial parts of the skin and really get into the deeper layers and ultimately the bloodstream where they can cause a lot of damage These cases known as invasive strep infections affect between  and  Americans a year according to figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Active Bacterial Core surveillance Those most at risk Dr Sabella says are the very young the elderly and patients who have immunocompromised states and skin conditions such as eczema and chicken pox although invasive strep can also follow seemingly mild lacerations  like the simple scrape Rory got at school The bacteria for strep are widespread so its difficult to determine where or with whom the deadly infection originated Staunton says he believes strep was going around his sons school The school could not be reached for comment Group A strep is one of these bacteria that are so common in the environment that its hard to really pinpoint where youre getting it from says Richard Malley MD an infectious disease specialist at Childrens Hospital Boston Just being around somebody who has streptococcus in their throat exposes you to getting it as well There are even examples in the military of streptococci being able to survive on inanimate objects like blankets That type of transmission however is exceedingly rare Dr Sabella notes Group A strep is generally spread from person to person he explains Picking it up from objects or pets or carpets is not usually possible The main modes of transmission are through droplet spread contact with respiratory secretion or direct contact with infected skin Strep that gets into the skin is generally riskier  in part because it can more easily spread to other parts of the body such as the bones the joints or the blood  but not all skin cases are severe and not all throat cases are benign Are there specific factors that make one group A strep more virulent than another We dont know exactly Dr Malley explains If you look at all of the group A strep even though those bacteria have the same name on a genetic level theyre very very different Its a bit like the human race Were all people but we have enormous differences in our DNA and those differences result in differences in our height our skin color our eye color etc Among the various strains of group A strep he continues certain bacteria may produce more of a specific type of toxin or poison which might translate into more or less virulence or a more or less aggressive nature The other side of the coin he says is the host You might be very resistant to group A strep for example but I might fall apart And the difference might just be your genes compared to mine or your past exposure compared to mine  Its very hard to say that one person is protected and another person is not Its a complicated issue Strep deaths are uncommon Millions of people are infected every year but only a small percentage of those cases are invasive and only a small percentage of those cases   percent to  percent or approximately  to  of the CDCs estimated   result in death Streptococcal toxic shock which is what is believed to have killed Rory is even more unusual especially among children There are less than  cases a year in the country Those numbers of course mean nothing to Staunton But these do Strep has cost me  percent of my family he says Fifty percent of my children Thats the reality  living with It is a horrible form of torture that has been inflicted on us on Rory he adds One Tuesday Im picking out what kind of toppings he wants on his pizza and the next Tuesday Im speaking at his funeral Someone needs to send a message Theres a killer on the loose The Stauntons are not alone Less than  miles from their Queens home a Rockville Centre Long Island family is coping with the same reality Sean Sweetman  died in February under circumstances remarkably parallel to Rorys He too was reportedly diagnosed with a stomach virus that turned out to be invasive group A strep He too was taken from his family just days after getting sick Similar stories from around the country  an yearold girl in Ohio a preschooler in Virginia a toddler in Oregon  are part of the reason why Staunton is speaking out Theres nothing out there for me Rory isnt coming back he says But if our story helps save someone elses son maybe some good can come of this Maybe well be the last people to be tortured by the loss of a child to strep Awareness will help but experts say some deaths cant be prevented in part because theres often no cardinal sign that indicates strep over another infection Unfortunately bacteria when they hurt the host tend to hurt the host in much the same way as other bacteria with fever and pain Childrens Hospitals Dr Malley says The more distinct red flags occur later when the illness has already progressed With streptococcal toxic shock for example the first symptoms may be fever chills muscle aches nausea and vomiting all of which could be indicative of other conditions such as the flu As the bacteria spread throughout the body however  usually within  to  hours of exposure  patients may experience rapid deterioration presenting as low blood pressure accelerated heart rate bright red skin excessive bruising yellowed eyes tissue necrosis and pain or swelling at the site of infection Its very acute meaning the person is well one day and sick the next Dr Malley explains Because of this invasive strep cases can be difficult  but not impossible  to treat Toxic shock especially with strep can be very very aggressive Dr Sabella warns Fortunately we do have antibiotics that are active against the strep itself But a lot of times its the toxins   the strep that cause the damage We usually have to do significant debridement or drainage of the soft tissue thats surgical treatment to clean out the tissues and to allow the antibiotics to get where they need to go to treat the bacteria In Rorys case surgery wasnt an option It was gone too far Staunton recalls No matter what they were throwing at it it killed everything He wipes away a tear that is immediately replaced by another one He was my best friend He used to steal my clothes you know Staunton says Only the good ones I got this beautiful shirt from my wife for Christmas and he came down one morning dressed for a debate and there it was I said Thats my shirt He said Not anymore Rory was buried in that shirt The last thing I had to do was get his shoes cleaned get my shirt cleaned and iron his pants to bring to the funeral his father saysweeping again I must have ironed his pants  times that morning The funeral attended by more than  people in New York was also streamed live to friends and family around the world Shortly after Rory boarded his final flight a oneway trip to Ireland where officials stamped his passport for the last time There in the shadow of St Peters Church in Drogheda  miles from Dublin loved ones lowered him into the ground next to his grandmother who died when Rory was  Spiritually emotionally we couldnt bear the thought of him lying alone in a graveyard without anyone around him and where no one knew him Staunton says So we buried him where we know friends and family visit all the time Staunton is quiet for a moment thinking Does that make sense he asks Nothing seems to anymore You see your childs name on a headstone he begins His voice already barely above a whisper breaks trails off Its unnatural
