Julies hands descend  one landing lightly on Ians chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs She is using touch and light pressure to simulate for her premature son her own womb A few moments later Ian stops crying   When he was born he was so tiny said Chung It was like Oh wow can a baby even survive outside the womb this early  Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies Experts say fewer than  are born in the micro preemie category at the hospital where Ian is being treated Childrens Hospital of Orange County in California that means born before  weeks or born weighing less than  pounds  Survival rates among micro preemies have been improving said Mindy Morris a neonatal nurse practitioner at Childrens Hospital  So they may survive to discharge But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications  Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Childrens Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population    Aptly named the Small Baby Unit the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital Here stimulation is kept to a minimum speaking is only done in hushed voices The overall effect is one of relative calm an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero We try to keep it low sound low lights so that it is as close to the womb as we can get said Morris coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital We try to minimize the intrusion to them  In  before the Small Baby Unit was up and running  of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease In  after the unit had been operating for three years the rate was down to   Infection rates from  to  dipped from  to  and feeding weight and head circumference have also improved  Dr Kristi Watterberg chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on the fetus and newborn said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is  broadly speaking  a good thing But since Childrens Hospitals data are selfreflexive she questions what exactly is contributing to the units success  When someone starts focusing on something it tends to trend better said Watterberg  What made it happen We dont know  Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Childrens Hospital including various forms of touch therapy can be beneficial to premature infants   A   published in  found  to  greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy  they also were discharged sooner from the hospital Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development At the Small Baby Unit parents act as therapists and partners with the staff so they are engaged fully with their childs progress  Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety  Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son  For preemies it can hurt to be touched because their skin isnt ready for it explained Karin Mitchell a developmental therapist working with Chung  Mitchell grabs Chungs hand Let me show you on your hand she said pressing on Chungs palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian  Its not heavy but its also not superlight Remember when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body Mitchell said Thats what helps babies know Where do I start and where do I stop  When babies are born early like Ian they dont have that option so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air  Its a lot different   Soon Ian will lie  tubes and all  skintoskin on his mothers chest for an hour or more something referred to as kangaroo care Painful medical interventions like intubation extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skintoskin with a parent whenever possible In those situations touch is thought to mitigate pain   Kangarooing as mothers here refer to it also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies For mothers it may stimulate breast milk production  It calms me when hes kangarooing with me and I notice hes more calm said Chung She pauses as tears roll down her face Its nice to know that those things help him  You cling to those little things that can ease things for him  Ians care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life in a traditional NICU at another local hospital There according to his parents the lights and noise were blaring  This unit is a laser focus on this very specific patient population  I think that is what makes this so unique said Dr Kushal Bhakta medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Childrens Hospital Other places Ive worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition next to another child who may be crying he continued So theres  a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and its not done purposely Its just the layout of whatever unit theyre in Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving  We used to think it should be quiet so when these babies came into the world too soon wed turn off the lights and make it quiet said Watterberg a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine  Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero and that maybe if its too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need  She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a babys acquisition of speech and language and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies  Similarly she said too much darkness could be counterproductive to a babys development since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms  We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term said Watterberg So Im pleased that this group is working on it but the information we have is always in process  In the Small Baby Unit numbers mean a lot  When Ian was born they went something like this  chance hed survive and if he did survive only a  chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems    Chung and her husband Ryan Chung temper the harsh reality of those statistics by focusing on other numbers  milestones Ian is reaching from day to day week to week Ian has already defied the steep odds that he would not survive Today he is  weeks old  We celebrated  grams last night said Julie of Ians weight gain since he was admitted to the Small Baby Unit  Its like He is  pounds Wow  The Chungs believe that Ians future prospects are improving because of his treatment  in particular the emphasis on touch  in the Small Baby Unit   Three weeks and  ounces later he is less reliant on supplemental oxygen and is less averse to touch  Julie you want to massage him asks Mitchell Yes says Chung who glances up at the numbers changing favorably on a monitor above her He likes it Weeks earlier the monitor beeped incessantly  Today Ian seems relatively calm  more OK with his surroundings  Although some of the science behind what happens in the Small Baby Unit eludes her Chung knows that one alternative  little or no contact between her and Ian  would leave her empty emotionally She recalls an article she read recently describing how most NICUs operated years ago  Moms wouldnt touch their kids said Chung They would look at them through the glass wall My heart broke for them  Not to be able to hold them or touch them or do any of that stuff she added All of that fulfills what I long for It gives me something even though its little
