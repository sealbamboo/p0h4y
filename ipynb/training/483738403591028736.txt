When the Supreme Court ruled Monday that closely held corporations   you may have assumed the decision applied only to familyowned businesses Wrong An estimated   businesses are closely held However some benefits experts question just how many of those companies would want to assert religious views The   a closely held corporation as having more than half the value of its stock owned by five or fewer individuals Thats    not just family members Closely held companies tend to be small  many are far too tiny to offer any type of insurance But some are huge and include some of the bestknown names in American business such as Mars Inc with more than  workers and Cargill Inc with more than  It appears that under   such huge enterprises may be able to refuse to offer contraception coverage if they assert a religious view The majority of the justices said Protecting the freeexercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented noting that  closely held is not synonymous with small  In her written opinion she suggests there may be many future legal battles involving these large complex enterprises because the Supreme Courts majority fails to offer any instruction on how to resolve the disputes that may crop up among corporate owners over religious values and accommodations In other words even if the number of owners is small they could have big disagreements about religious issues How is the arbiter of a religionbased intracorporate controversy to resolve the disagreement Ginsburg asked in her dissent The  majority opinion said that protecting the freeexercise rights of owners of corporations such as Hobby Lobby Stores Conestoga Wood Specialties and Mardel protects religious liberty Such owners dont forfeit their religious rights just because they choose to organize their business as corporation not a sole proprietorship or partnership  from New York University done in  showed that slightly more than half of private sector employees work for closely held companies rather than companies that publicly trade stock on open exchanges Still even though most companies are closely held the number of companies refusing to offer contraception coverage may turn out to be quite small according to Tim Goodman an employee benefits expert and partner at the law firm Dorsey  Whitney There may be lots of these types of corporations but not many that would assert this religious view Goodman said It takes effort and energy to bring these assertions so it takes someone with very strong religious beliefs to make the case he said Goodman said that to follow in the path of Hobby Lobby a company would have to expend a lot of time working with its insurer to shape a special policy And then an employee could bring a court challenge questioning the employers religious sincerity And there could be bad publicity both with customers and potential employees he said For most company owners you are a lot more interested in making your business work than taking this on he said So most likely changes to insurance coverage will be confined to smaller familyowned businesses with very deeply held religious views he said
