As many as  nurses in Northern California are preparing for a twoday strike that will start Tuesday Nurses plan to leave their posts at  am and picket outside  Kaiser Permanente medical centers and clinics The placards nurses carry and the chants they repeat will say little about salaries or pensions No economic proposals have even been put on the bargaining table yet This seems awfully quick to go to a strike says   an economics professor at the University of California San Francisco School of Nursing I cant recall a situation where a strike has come up where there has not been some kind of disagreement about wages and benefits as part of the package Instead nurses are focusing on more than  operational proposals that remain unresolved after   These demands include a call to fill more than  nursing positions that have been vacated in the last three years better protections for use of sick leave or more flexibility over breaks and more training and education Both sides have leaned on the recent Ebola scare to try to win PR points with the public Nurses have   and more training for caring with potential Ebola patients  calls that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention heeded by updating its federal guidelines last month Kaiser nurses say they still want more and have timed the second day of their strike to coincide with nurse demonstrations across the country in a National Day of Action over Ebola preparedness The hospital system has tried to turn that argument around in light of the work stoppage We are baffled by the unions tactics at this critical time read an ad that Kaiser ran in Northern California newspapers Monday Calling a strike now just as we are entering flu season and when the nation and our members are concerned about the risk of Ebola seems particularly irresponsible The hospital system has hired and trained more than  temporary nurses to staff its medical centers while its regular nurses are on strike a stopgap that costs as much as  million per day Kaiser says Some elective surgeries and nonurgent appointments will be rescheduled to ease pressure on the system Our main concern is patient care issues and safe staffing says Zenei Cortez copresident of the California Nurses Association and chair of the bargaining team for the Kaiser nurses She says Kaiser will only agree to changes that are cost neutral which is one reason the proposals are stuck in limbo The main tension in the negotiations is over whats not being said Nurses say they are eager to incorporate the subject of wages and benefits into the negotiation While they have made no formal economic proposals they have stated that they are seeking the status quo no cuts Kaiser is quiet on this It has not put forward any of its own proposals yet The hospital system said in a statement that it prefers to resolve a majority of the other issues the union has already put on the table and then add our wage and benefit proposals to the mix Experts say this is all unusual But the move to isolate patient care demands from economics could be a strategy on either side says Spetz Because the nurses patientcare proposals would both cost money and create a benefit to nurses in their working conditions  by reducing workload for example  it makes sense that they would want to balance these requests against any proposed changes to salary and benefits Usually these all get negotiated as a group says Spetz Kaiser may prefer to separate the issues as a way to strengthen its position when negotiating over wages and pensions Nurses in California are among the few private professions to still have pensions But nurses may benefit from the separation too now that theyve called a strike To the extent the union can clearly state what exactly their concerns are and argue that Kaiser is not listening that can bring a lot of public sympathy Spetz says It does not benefit Kaiser to be perceived as being against patient safety
