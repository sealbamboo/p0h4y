In summer we have access to abundant fresh produce but what about winter When your favorite fruits are out of season dried fruit can serve as a healthy alternative to your typical snack But with dried fruits you must pay attention to serving size They have about the same amount of   as fresh fruit but because dried fruits are concentrated theyre more caloriedense so its easy to eat too much Also some manufacturers add sugar so look for no   added on the package In addition to being available in every season dried fruits have another big advantage over fresh They dont require refrigeration So as long as youre careful with portion size theres no reason not to enjoy dried fruit year round
