 Children born after in vitro fertilization IVF or other fertility treatments appear to be at modestly elevated risk of cancer although causality still isnt clear a metaanalysis showed The risk of any childhood cancer was  percent higher after medicallyassisted reproduction compared with spontaneously conceived controls Susanne Krger Kjaer MD DMSc of the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen and colleagues found The association also was significant for leukemias neuroblastomas and retinoblastomas specifically the group reported online in   But the absolute risk was low they noted For Denmark where  percent of all babies are born with the assistance of fertility treatments one excess childhood cancer would be expected for every  women treated assuming the link is causal However our results do not rule out that factors related to underlying subfertility rather than the procedure itself are the most important predisposing factors for childhood cancer they cautioned Only two of the studies that went into the metaanalysis were designed to adequately control for underlying fertility problems A causal link is plausible though Kjaer and colleagues noted Potential mechanisms whereby fertility treatment might cause childhood cancers include epigenetic changes induced by repeated hormone exposure semen preparation freezing of embryos and gametes use of culture media growth conditions for embryos and delayed insemination they explained And unintended consequences arent unheard of in obstetrics Of possible note is the fact that diethylstilbestrol which was prescribed to pregnant women between  and  to prevent complications of pregnancy and was associated with the subsequent development of cancer in children is structurally similar to the antiestrogens used for ovulation stimulation the group pointed out On the other hand though infertile couples may already have an increased number of epigenetic defects in their gametes which come to light through the treatment process they acknowledged The groups metaanalysis included  casecontrol and cohort studies from  countries The pooled cancer risk appeared roughly similar whether looking just at assisted reproductive technology or if hormone treatments were included as well The results for both neuroblastomas and retinoblastomas should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies Kjaers group noted The risk estimates for CNS and neural cancers as well as other solid cancer appeared higher with assisted reproductive technology than with all the techniques combined but these results were also based on small numbers and had a large degree of heterogeneity The metaanalysis didnt turn up evidence for publication bias but recall bias from the casecontrol studies couldnt be excluded Consequently future large cohort studies with sufficient followup time and an adequate control population ie children of couples with fertility problems conceived without fertility treatment are needed they concluded Source
