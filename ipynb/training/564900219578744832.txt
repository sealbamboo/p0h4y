Wolverines are some of the nastiest creatures on the planet making honey badgers look like golden retriever puppies Actor Hugh Jackman is the opposite of a wolverine in terms of temperament but when it comes to his workout regimen to prepare for his recurring role as   Wolverine for the justreleased XMen Days of Future Past Jackman needs to unleash the beast and let the testosterone flow freely How does one become qualified to carry blades of adamantium Answer Lift heavy stuff Its too hard to get in shape from scratch and its easier to stay in shape than to get in shape  For Wolverine I really up the training Right now I do about an hour of training a day and ride my bike everywhere But I do about   hours of training a day when getting ready for the role and foodwise I eat more but I eat a lot stricter Seventy percent of your physique is your diet and diet is the biggest change that happens I do heavy weights in the morning for about an hour and then I do  minutes of highervolume lifting in the afternoon My least favorite is the legs  I do quite a few chinups and rows I do mostly oldschool lifting with a lot of squats I actually do more front squats than I do back squats and I do a lot of deadlifting If I could only do one exercise it would be deadlifting For cardio I dance I ride my bike I run and I have kids There is a  lot of cardio just from being a parent When lifting Im always with a trainer because the thing that makes a difference is that last  in your training and he very scientifically looks after my food as well because when Im going for a shirt off shot everything changes the month before and Im timed down to the day There is water dehydration for  hours before Its quite a scientific process to looking your best Its absolutely physically demanding to play the role of Wolverine Theres a lot of action and I try to do as much of it as I can because its better for the audience You dont just have to look physically in shape you really have to be mobile and be able to fight and jump and do wire work and stuff like that The training has to be functional Of course you want to look a certain way but to me the look is more about him being animalistic than just looking buff Yes it does and when I dance I drop muscle very quickly The body is very smart and efficient and a traditional dancers body is not going to be bulked up on top because theyre muscles that you dont really need And your body is constantly going for the most efficient way to do something A sprinters body is very different from a longdistance runners body Of course but my wife is not so much like that She says Will you stop all this body obsession Im the one who is supposed to be looking good She also says The best thing about being married to an actor is that I get to have an affair every few months Its a different kind of look all the time But Ive got to be honest mate being in a D film on a foot screen is pretty good motivation for being in shape
