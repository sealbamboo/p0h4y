When Jim Black leads people on a robust walk three times a week on the grounds of the acre Saddleback Church in Lake Forest hes got powerful company God The several dozen people who join him have shown up with the same hopes that anyone brings to an exercise plan They mean to lose weight ditch inhalers get stronger But at Saddleback theres a lot more going on Pastor Rick Warren is using the power of his church one of the biggest in the country to impress upon his followers that their bodies need the same care as their spirits After two months on The Daniel Plan Black gave up his diabetes medication He has given up wheat dairy and sugar He recently bought a bicycle In a year he lost  pounds his wife lost  Its that one scripture My body is not my own my body is on loan and someday Ill have to account for it said Black  I wanted to serve God at a higher level And I wanted to be able to fit in the seat of a roller coaster and buy one seat on the airplane instead of two Despite a multibilliondollar industry of programs and books and diet meals and meetings the secular world has done a fairly lousy job at getting people to lose weight and get fit So why not turn to a higher power One Sunday afternoon  people came to a rally at Saddleback to hear about the Daniel Plan from Warren and others including two of its creators Daniel Amen a psychiatrist who belongs to Saddleback and Dr Mark Hyman who has taken care of Bill and Hillary Clinton If Jesus came to dinner what would you feed him Hyman asked the crowd Would you give him a Big Mac fries and a Coke Would you feed him all the junk that we feed ourselves and our guests when they come to dinner Or would you eat real food Places of worship may call to mind ice cream socials or groaning tables of fried chicken and potato salad more than they do workouts but Warren is the latest in a long line of people of faith connecting mind body and spirit After all gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins They include the th century health reformer Sylvester Graham and later the Seventhday Adventist Dr John Harvey Kellogg More recently fundamentalist CS Lovetts Help Lord  the Devil Wants Me Fat sold close to  copies in two years after its release in  Other books have included More of Jesus Less of Me and Slim for Him And Warren is not alone in using as inspiration the story of the prophet Daniel who rejected the rich food and wine of King Nebuchadnezzar Millions of American Christians have made a religious duty out of diet R Marie Griffith writes in her  book Born Again Bodies Fit bodies ostensibly signify fitter souls she said by phone But they also can be used to support a maledominated hierarchy the market is lucrative and its important to look at the underlying messages Warren has an opportunity to change lives Griffith said Because of his name and his fame and how beloved and admired he is his could really have a bigger impact Dee Eastman director of the Daniel Plan said she doesnt look at it as a diet plan Ultimately we try to look toward getting balance in health overall And we think food plays a huge role in that she said This is going to sound extreme but if you can cut out the white menaces  white flour and white sugar  your palate changes and your cravings stop You can actually start loving foods that love you back Warren traces his inspiration for the plan to the day in  that he baptized  adults and calculated that hed lifted more than  pounds Not only were most of those believers overweight Warren thought But Im fat too Im as out of shape as everyone else is In a pilot rollout of the Daniel Plan more than  people lost a collective quartermillion pounds in a year the church said Plans are underway for a longterm tracking program for the plan Eastman said Warren said he had  pounds to lose and though hes still working on that goal hes gone from Hawaiian shirts to slight more bellyhugging black Tshirts Is this something new No Warren said For  years the church has been caring for the sick A few years back Michael Minor banned fried chicken from his small Baptist congregation in the heart of what public health authorities call the stroke belt in Hernando Miss Its all about the idea of wholeness a harmony of mind body and spirit Minor said If any one of those three is off youre not healthy In the years since a widespread focus of faith communities on food seems to be taking root Theres a garden across the street from the Obama Chicago home for example that grows food to feed the hungry Its not just another diet craze  its tapping into something deeper this deeper hunger we have to reconnect with our food with our community with our land We are eating in a food system that has disconnected us on every level We are eating alone  were eating on the go says Fred Bahnson who directs the FoodFaith Initiative at Wake Forest Divinity School in North Carolina The fact that Saddleback which is conventional  not some fringe group of hippies out in the woods  its not just a fringe thing anymore Bahnson said Warrens plan has five components food fitness focus faith and friends Theres a book journal apps and a cookbook as well as meetings and programs at the church and online Its not just what we eat its what eats us Theres an emotional and spiritual issue we ignore Warren said by telephone The secret sauce is faith friends and focus Much of the advice is straightforward Simple real fresh delicious nutrientpacked foods plenty of exercise getting help from friends All of it built on a foundation of faith The Daniel Plan even quotes James Beard as it advises followers to eat unprocessed food to learn to cook and to explore new foods like goji berries enoki mushrooms and seaweed There are starter detox plans of  or  days that cut out processed food alcohol dairy sugar and gluten The friends aspect is supported with small group gatherings to study the Daniel Plan to talk about Warrens teachings and members progress Walk  Worship is just one of many active ministries at Saddleback to help members get exercise and find the friends component of the program Zumba is the most popular with as many as  people showing up Theres also soccer hiking and triathlon training  all with this view of the body God created it Jesus died for it The Holy Spirit lives in it Shouldnt you take care of it Brian Olsen and David Jacques met one glorious Saturday morning at the beach in Dana Point ready to share their faith and their surfing skills as they do each week Norma Ramirez who came out to surf latched onto the Daniel Plan about a year ago She wasnt fat but she worried she was eating too much sugar I had been praying for help and when the Daniel Plan came out I said Norma here you go Before people and surfboards hit the water theres a prayer  and the hope that someone who isnt a believer yet will be transformed said Jacques who has been surfing much of his life On the water waiting for a wave theres the chance for more conversation Many of the new surfers this day dont get to their feet on the boards a couple of them do But thats not the point really Jacques said We reach out to the community and put out some love
