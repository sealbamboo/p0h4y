On Sunday we   you about bartenders who are up in arms about a new California law that makes it illegal for culinary workers to touch uncooked food with their bare hands Turns out sushi chefs are ticked off too For sushi chefs crafting sashimi or a great roll is a lot like creating art It requires skill and feel Bare hands are essential The new law is not sitting well with chefs like Toshi Sugiura Hes the owner of sushi   in Los Angeles where diners devour everything from yellow fin to   a kind of Japanese tapas Sugiura was making spicy tuna rolls with gloves on when we caught up with him recently He has made thousands of these rolls before molding each grain of rice with great attention and precision Looks OK to me he says eyeing one in his hands But still it really feels  something different Ive been doing  years making sushi and its never been using gloves Sugiura says that his sense of touch is lost in loose fitting disposable gloves The roll hes just made probably wont fall apart but it wont live up to the sushi traditions exacting standards either But Sugiura says hell reluctantly wear the gloves because he wants to follow the law For all the attention the law is getting California is not breaking new ground   a spokesperson for the California Restaurant Association says many other states already ban barehand contact with food to improve food safety and hygiene In fact the change in California wasnt a surprise to big chain restaurants They were wellprepared for this Pappas said I think it was very much expected It seems like it was more the Californiabased companies and independents that werent expecting this necessarily Still gloves arent a substitute for handwashing   director of the Center for Consumer Research at the University of California Davis says that cooks who wear gloves forget to wash their hands more often than cooks who dont wear them So if you put gloves on dirty hands youre handling food with dirty hands Bruhn says Gloves are not the barrier you would think they are Restaurants can apply for an exemption to the rule Its something fine dining establishments might do but chain restaurants might not Its not yet clear which ones will qualify or how violations will be prosecuted California health officials have agreed to a soft rollout of the law for the next six months Restaurants not complying with the rule will receive only warnings until July On our recent visit to Bar Hayama Sugiuras spicy tuna rolls looked perfect and the tuna was exactly as rich and savory as it should be But the rice fell apart a little too quickly in our mouth It was a tiny flaw in a great dish but for Suguira and other sushi chefs in California thats still a big deal
