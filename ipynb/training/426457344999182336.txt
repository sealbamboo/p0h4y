Our fourlegged friends suffer from many of the same cancers that we do But one type of dog tumor acts like no other Its contagious The tumor spreads from one pooch to another when the dogs have sex or even just touch or lick each other Its a common disease in street dogs all around the world says geneticist   at the University of Cambridge People in the US and UK havent heard of it because its found mostly in freeroaming dogs in developing countries Now this strange disease just got even stranger Murchison and her colleagues found that the infectious cancer is a living fossil The modern tumors contain the DNA of an ancient pooch that hung out with prehistoric people thousands of years ago The   first arose about  years ago in a wolfdog hybrid thats most closely related to an Alaskan malamute Murchison and her team   Thursday in the journal   About  years ago the tumor jumped from continent to continent via the worlds pooches And the cells have been living and hiding out in dogs ever since When I look down the microscope and see these cells that came from a dog  years ago it boggles my mind Murchison tells Shots Its really incredible So how did she figure all that out To start off she and her team sequenced the DNA of tumors from two dogs a cocker spaniel from Brazil and an aboriginal camp dog in Australia They then compared the genetic patterns of the tumors with more than  modern dog breeds Their conclusion The contagious cancer first appeared in a dog that looked something like an Alaskan malamute graybrown or black coat short straight fur pointy ears and a mediumsize snout But this pooch probably wasnt as cuddly as a malamute The ancient doggie also contained a fair number of wolf genes Murichson found The dog was around during the early days of domestication she says But it seemed to be relatively inbred and had some signs of domestication For instance the dog probably could digest carbohydrates she says which is a trait found in Fido but not his wolf cousins Veterinarians have known about the contagious dog cancer since the late s Murichson says The disease even offered scientists one of the first tools for studying live cancers When Russian scientists figured out the tumors were transmissible in the s it was a hugely important insight Murichson says At the time there wasnt a model for studying cancer Scientists could only study it in people who had already died After the discovery she says many labs started trying to figure out how cancer arises and spreads in the body Now Murchison hopes the genome of the dog tumor will help solve one of the major outstanding questions about human cancers how they evade the immune system We found mutations that confer that ability in the dog tumor she says They could potentially offer clues for human cancers as well
