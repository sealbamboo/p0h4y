Postwar Liberia had struggled back onto its feet in the past decade after the civil war and was just catching its collective breath when Ebola landed One of the lasting effects of Ebola on the country is likely to be its impact on the economy In Liberia Ebola was first detected in March in   in the north Although the epidemic has brought some temporary jobs to the area the virus is costing Liberias economy dear Local businesses and farmers say theyre hurting Dozens of Liberians hover outside the Doctors Without Borders   clinic in Foya a town in Lofa Theyre all looking for temporary work Young unemployed men and women are waiting and hoping their names will be called to join the frontline workers in the battle against the virus Hygienists carpenters and others work at the relief agencys expanded Case Management Center for Ebola patients and suspected cases Alfred Pongay a yearold student has been coming to the clinic for the past two weeks looking for work I come in the morning  oclock he says adding that hes ready to do whatever work is offered  dig holes crush rocks erect additional tents or carry plants Another student yearold Mary Nyumah has arrived for her first day of training in the zone where relief workers dress in protective clothing She peels an orange and waits patiently Aspiring national Senate candidate   is also a businessman in Voinjama the capital of Lofa County He runs a security company and a gas station franchise and owns a hotel Ebola has affected business immensely because a lot of our customers that used to support our business that come to our guest house are no more around he says Theyve all left  Theyre not coming again Zargo says agriculture and farming were once the backbone of Lofas economy They have been hard hit twice over  first by the civil war and now by Ebola Before the war this part of Liberia was considered the breadbasket he says Most of the food you see in Liberias capital of Monrovia is from Lofa But now its the other way around Take for example recently the   sent Lofa some  bags of rice for distribution Normally people in Lofa dont live on handouts But its donations of rice Liberias staple food that many people are desperately hoping for In the tiny village of Nyewolihun  an hourandahalf drive from Voinjama and a bumpy uphill motorbiketaxi ride from the nearest town  school principal and farmer Matthew Ndorleh says theyre hurting A lot of us are starving he tells me Starving or hungry I ask Hungry he says We have to go out and look for food The old rice are all gone  Theres only the bush yam the wild fruit we eat He says theyre fast running out of current supplies of rice and havent yet harvested the new crop Many farmers Ndorleh says are too frightened to tend their farms during this lean season between harvests Most of the people are afraid to go in the bushes thinking that if he or she goes they might encounter Ebola because they say the wild animals got it  and weve got a lot of monkeys with us here The health authorities have warned people not to eat bushmeat because some animals such as bats are carriers of the Ebola virus But beef  or cow meat as its called in Liberia  is still safe to eat Thats one of the dishes yearold Mohammed Bah serves at the Quick Service Center which doubles up as a restaurant and momandpop shop in Voinjama close to the border with Guinea Voinjama was depending on Guinea before more than even Monrovia because even the cow meat  we got from Guinea Bah says But right now the border is closed so we have serious problems  If the border is continued to close sorry  were not going to get fresh meat here now Bah gets the occasional customer coming to watch soccer and perhaps eat a meal But times are tough since Ebola hit The business is going down too much Nothing good is going on now he says I used to receive more guests from everywhere International white people from America  everybody used to come and eat here But right now as you can see  take a look  nobody is around Except us
