The drug was developed by the biotech firm   which is based in San Diego The company was founded in  to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense    Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction to develop an Ebola treatment for several years Yes In March the NIH   to establish a collaboration between researchers from  institutions who were working to fight Ebola  A whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why a news release about the grant said  Tekmira a Vancouverbased company that has a   with the US Department of Defense to develop an Ebola drug began Phase  trials with its drug in January But the FDA recently halted the trial asking for more information  At least one potential Ebola vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers according to Thomas Geisbert a leading researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch And last week the   of another Ebola vaccine will start as early as September Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign or harmful cells A monoclonal antibody is similar except its engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell   mimicking your immune systems natural response Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions Sources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a threemouse monoclonal antibody meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mices blood were harvested to create the medicine  However the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro has been working with Samaritans Purse and Emory University Hospital to provide limited quantities of the drug to Emory according to company spokesman David Howard  Many have asked why these two workers received the experimental drug when so many     others in West Africa also have the virus The World Health Organization says it was not involved in the decision to treat Brantly and Writebol Both patients had to give consent to receive the drug knowing it had never been tested in humans before  The process by which the medication was made available to the American patients may have fallen under the US Food and Drug Administrations compassionate use regulation which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials  No The drug had shown promise in primates but even in those experiments just eight monkeys received the treatment In any case the human immune system can react differently than primates which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use  The two Americans cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems  Its unclear Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult Doctors Without Borders said in a statement Experimental drugs typically not massproduced and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says scientists have to be careful about assuming this drug will work in other patients as it appears to have worked in Brantly  Having worked with administering antibodies for people for a really long time that would be distinctly unusual he told CNN As we all know in medicine  you have to withhold judgment The company has very few doses ready for patient use Fauci told CNN   Kentucky BioProcessing is working closely with Mapp various government agencies and other parties to increase production of ZMapp but this process will take several months Howard said We dont know Samaritans Purse covered the cost of Brantly and Writebols evacuations but did not pay for the drug according to a spokesman  When a patient gets an experimental drug the drug company can donate the product under compassionate use Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc might have done that in this case Health insurance companies typically do not pick up the tab for treatments that have not been approved by the FDA But they usually would cover the cost of any doctor fees associated with giving the drug and any costs associated with monitoring how the drug is working   If it were widely available it certainly couldnt hurt An effective Ebola drug could help doctors treat the deadly virus which is killing about  of the people infected in West Africa But a vaccine would be a much more effective tool in stopping this and future epidemics  Vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent them from ever becoming infected One challenge with Ebola experts say is that companies dont believe they   from developing a vaccine so few companies show interest
