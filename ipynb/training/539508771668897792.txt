Alaijah Borden was  years old and significantly overweight when Dr Sundari Periasamy a pediatrician at Harlem Hospital Center in New York enrolled the middleschooler in an innovative program to increase her consumption of fruits and vegetables  and hopefully to reduce her weight After two years in the program Alaijah is an unqualified success story She lost five pounds the first year by snacking on fruits and vegetables then eight pounds more the second year when she cut down on greasy foods Her mother Sheryl Brown  said Alaijah used to sabotage homecooked family dinners by buying junk food  cookies cakes and other snacks  on her way to and from school Now Alaijah carries fruit or cutup vegetables to school She likes raw carrots celery and broccoli Its really an awesome program thats made it more affordable for me to get fruits and vegetables Ms Brown said I told my daughter its better to be told youre overweight and heres the solution than to just be told youre overweight and sent home Mom too has benefited Though not overweight Ms Brown loves to snack and had developed   She brought it under control without medication when like her daughter she switched her snacks to fruits and vegetables The Browns are among  lowincome families with overweight or obese children enrolled in the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program or FVRx at Harlem Hospital Center Three other hospitals in New York also have been testing the program The program was created by   a nonprofit organization that advocates for access to better food in lowincome neighborhoods in partnership with the    and the citys Health and Hospital Corporation It is a startlingly simple idea to deal with a complex problem Instead of drugs or admonishments to lose weight which typically fall on deaf ears doctors provide families in the FVRx program with a prescription to eat fruits and vegetables The families also are given nutritional education recipes and most important of all socalled Health Bucks that are redeemable for produce at a local farmers market  at twice the amount that the families could purchase with food stamps alone Ms Brown receives  in food stamps each month to feed her family of five There is no single solution to the nations epidemic of   and the costly diseases that result from it But this and similar programs at community health centers in  states strongly suggest that providing access to fresh fruits and vegetables with the means to purchase them and the motivation to do so can make a meaningful dent in the problem New Yorks FVRx program operates in poor areas known as food deserts where eating at places like McDonalds is both cheaper and easier than purchasing fresh foods and preparing them at home For people today with income shortages getting good food like highquality fruits and vegetables is a big problem said Michel Nischan founder of Wholesome Wave which supports the programs at community health centers A movement to restrict food stamps to healthy foods is wellmeaning but it wouldnt work in many areas where Elevens are the main source of peoples food said Mr Nischan a former chef who began focusing on nutrition when his son developed  Type  diabetes The goal is to level the playing field between artificially cheap unhealthy stuff and the healthy foods that wealthier people enjoy It is a winwin endeavor Participants who qualify get tokens  or in New York and Boston Health Bucks  to spend on fruits and vegetables at local farmers markets The farmers are reimbursed for the full value of their goods with dollars from communitybased nonprofits and grants Participating farmers also benefit They sell more produce increasing their income on average nearly  percent And they are able to hire more people put more land in production diversify crop plantings and invest more in farm operations Mr Nischan said Last year two New York public hospitals  Harlem in Manhattan and Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx  tested this approach with  children and their families through a twoyear  grant from the Tisch fund This year Elmhurst Hospital in Queens and Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan offered the program to an additional  children and family members Each month the young patients meet with their doctor or nutritionist to renew their FVRx have their weight and body mass index evaluated and get additional advice on how to achieve a healthy diet An analysis of last years results found that  percent of the children and  percent of their families ate more fruits and vegetables after joining the program More than  percent of families shopped at farmers markets weekly or more than two or three times a month and  percent understood more about the health value of fruits and vegetables Most astonishing perhaps after just four months in the program  percent of participating children lowered their BMI Dr Periasamy said there is so much enthusiasm for the program among both the children and their families all of whom benefit from the nutrition education and fresh produce One child told her I tried a cucumber today and its good actually A grandmother who had been eating canned foods all these years said she is now happy to be eating fresh fruits and vegetables The hospitalbased programs and accompanying farmers markets in New York ended last month But competition and consumer enthusiasm have prompted nearby markets and bodegas to carry more and better produce and to price it more affordably so that families with limited incomes can have yearround access according to the program directors Ms Brown froze some summer produce to use in cooking after the markets shut down for the season And her daughter has developed a new enthusiasm Alaijah had conversations with the farmers at the market and learned a lot about how things are grown and whats in season Ms Brown said Last summer she participated in a new community garden She was excited by what was grown because she knew what they were after going to the farmers market The goal now Laurie Tisch said in an interview is to let other cities know that this approach works and is worth replicating on a larger scale
