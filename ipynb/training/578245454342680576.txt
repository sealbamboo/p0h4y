A new global fund is being launched to help developing countries fend off challenges to tobacco control measures by cigarette makers  The m m fund is a joint effort by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation They say tobacco control gains are being put at risk by the industrys use of trade agreements and litigation But tobacco companies argue they are protecting investments including intellectual property rights The fund has been launched in Abu Dhabi at an international conference on tobacco control  The former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said The significant gains we have seen in efforts to reduce tobacco use are at risk of being undermined by the tobacco industrys use of trade agreements and litigation  Both philanthropists say the purpose of the targeted fund is to help countries such as Uruguay which has spent the past five years fighting a challenge by a cigarette company against the use of graphic health warnings on packets  Australia is also facing a case by the World Trade Organisation and the tobacco company Philip Morris International against its recent law allowing cigarettes only to be sold in standardised packaging  Similar laws have now been passed in Ireland  and in the UK earlier this week Mr Gates added Country leaders who are trying to protect their citizens from the harms of tobacco should not be deterred by threats of costly legal challenges from huge tobacco companies Australia won its first case which sends a strong message But smaller developing countries dont have the same resources One of the purposes of the AntiTobacco Trade Litigation Fund will be to create a network of senior lawyers  some working pro bono  who are experienced in trade litigation The criteria for poorer countries to receive help include the size of the population that will benefit from tobacco control law and the importance of the outcome to other countries considering similar laws Both philanthropic organisations hope the initial investment will grow with other donors joining the effort  Mr Bloomberg said The bottom line is people are stopping smoking And so we think this is a good battle  It is certainly a cause worth fighting for A billion peoples lives are at stake As mayor of New York City he banned smoking in public places in  Since leaving office Mr Bloomberg has funded and campaigned for countries to adopt tobacco control policies He added No one is a stronger supporter of capitalism and trade than I am This is about sovereignty and whether a country has the right to set its own public health policies The fact that there is a fund dedicated to taking on the tobacco companies in court sends a message that theyre not going to get a free ride A spokesman for Philip Morris International said We respect a governments authority to regulate in the public interest and we believe that sound tobacco control policy and compliance with international law can easily coexist as many countries around the world have demonstrated for years  Governments can and should honour their international obligations when enacting tobacco control measures and this fund can provide them with resources to do so
