A review of all Welsh hospitals to address public anxiety about standards of NHS care has been urged by the Royal College of Surgeons RCS The respected professional body said it was worried about poor performance and called for urgent assurance on safety It said the hospital inspection system should be beefed up with more input from professional medical bodies But the Welsh government said a review was not needed The RCS  which represents surgeons across the UK and promotes surgical standards  stopped short of calling for a wholescale review of the Welsh NHS But in a briefing prepared for assembly members the college argued more should be done by politicians NHS managers and clinicians to improve public confidence  It is worried about the high number of patients who die waiting for heart operations in south Wales and about the big rise in general in people waiting too long for hospital treatment  Conservative Shadow Minister for Health Darren Millar welcomed the RCS call The Conservatives have previously demanded an inquiry into Welsh NHS care standards similar to an investigation by Sir Bruce Keogh into health trusts with the highest death rates in England The Welsh government has ruled that out Mr Millar said Its not right that the people of Wales have hospitals with higher death rates than elsewhere in the UK We need to understand the reasons for that and I am pleased the RCS has made this call The RCS wants the current inspection regime led by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales HIW to be beefed up and suggested setting up a dedicated hospital inspectorate within the watchdog It said in its briefing to AMs We understand HIW will soon be consulting on its future inspection model and the Welsh government have already indicated that they will review all audit inspection and review bodies in Wales  While HIW already carries out some proactive reviews we believe more regular reviews need to occur Routine inspection is mostly related to specific areas of concern and issues such as cleanliness Changes to HIW need to happen quickly as the public need urgent assurance about the standards of care at Welsh hospitals Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd who recently led a review of NHS complaints in England said the RCS report must be recognised I think it will shine a light on what are very serious concerns  long waiting lists long waits for diagnosis in the first place compared to England and a number of patients  particularly in cardiac surgery  dying on waiting lists she said So dont listen to politicians listen to these professionals who are saying theres great cause for concern she said Ms Clwyd has previously called for a wideranging inquiry into standards of care across Wales The Welsh government said systems were in place to intervene when things went wrong but insisted the vast majority of patients were satisfied with the care they received These issues were debated fully in the assembly on  November when calls for an inquiry into Welsh hospitals were defeated it said in a statement As we stated then a review of all hospitals in Wales is in our view not necessary  Let us not forget that patients in Wales come into contact with the NHS some  million times a year and  say they are satisfied with the care they receive in hospital The Welsh government said HIW was an important part of the systems in place which start with the responsibility of health boards to deliver safe compassionate care and includes community health councils the public services ombudsman and others  In July BBC Wales revealed that during an RCS visit to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff surgeons had branded some services there dangerous  They were particularly worried about the number of patients dying while on waiting lists for heart surgery at the hospital Cardiff and the Vale Health Board suggested that  people had died while on cardiac waiting lists in  months Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board later confirmed that  people had died during a fiveyear period while waiting for heart surgery at Swanseas Morriston hospital Both the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru stressed the need for the necessary procedures to be in place to ensure a safe NHS
