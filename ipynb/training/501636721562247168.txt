Pittsburghs dominant health insurance company and its largest healthcare provider are essentially getting a divorce For decades   and   worked together But as the line between insurance companies and health care providers across the country blurs these longtime allies are venturing into each others business and becoming competitors In the process patients can get caught in the middle Daycare worker Gail Jameson has Highmark insurance and shes been going to the same UPMC medical office for more than  years I could go in and just stop in if I needed to because its close to my work Jameson says I go past it every day Shes about five years from retirement and was disappointed to learn her Highmark policy will no longer include UPMC providers She has to find all new doctors through another health system that is unfamiliar to her The road to divorce began when insurer Highmark got into the hospital business It bought the struggling West Penn Allegheny Health System which was UPMCs main competitor Highmark stepped in in order to ensure that there was competition in the marketplace and there would continue to be consumer choice says Highmark President and CEO David Holmberg In a town where UPMC controls more than  percent of the market Holmberg says there needs to be healthier competition among providers Theres another reason an insurance company would decide to become a healthcare provider the Affordable Care Act It tells insurance companies what basic services to offer who they must insure and even what percent of premiums can go to administrative expenses and profits That takes away a lot of what insurance companies used to do so theyre looking for new reasons to exist Insurers are trying to demonstrate that they bring value to the table and are doing more than just brokering a benefit  and doing more than paying bills says Gail Wilensky senior fellow at   Wilensky says some insurance companies are responding by building more efficient networks of highquality providers Highmark went a step beyond that and became a provider of health care itself UPMC responded by expanding its existing insurance business and refusing to sign a new longterm contract with Highmark saying it could not both compete and work with Highmark We couldnt have a contract with them says UPMC President and CEO Jeffrey Romoff Because they Highmark have the burden of keeping their provider side alive So for every one of their insurance subscribers they will want to steer them to go to their own providers The divorce of Highmark from UPMC is all but final now An agreement between the two companies will expire on January   The state of Pennsylvania negotiated a   It does things like ensure Highmark subscribers already in certain kinds of treatment at UPMC can continue receiving care Now the Pittsburgh health care landscape looks very different It went from one of the least competitive environments that you can imagine  a dominant insurer and a dominant health system joined at the hips with a long term contract says Romoff To one without a longterm contract with now five choices In addition to the two new competitors UPMC invited three large insurance companies into the Pittsburgh market Cigna Aetna and United Healthcare Competition is good says Romoff It keeps us all on top of our game It gives us incentive to not be fat and sloppy With competition come the marketing campaigns UPMC is banking on its good reputation Highmark will appeal to those concerned about price For some people their monthly premium and the cost of their health care may be more important than having access to everything Holmberg says In Pittsburgh now people have a lot more choices  and decisions  to make when it comes to their health care Thats supposed to be a good thing But for Jameson who was satisfied with her HighmarkUPMC combination the extra work is a pain I just dont like change I shouldnt have to change says Jameson Its not just patients dealing with change Employers who buy insurance for their workers face difficult decisions too With two insuranceprovider networks that dont allow access to each other Pittsburgh employers can be put in the position of effectively choosing which doctors treat their workers Employers want to provide benefits that allow them to be competitive and attract and retain a productive work force says Jessica Brooks executive director of the   They dont want to be in the business of making personal life decisions around who their employees can see and who they cant see she says The Affordable Care Act aims to increase the quality and affordability of health care Creating competitive marketplaces is part of the plan It will be a few years before people in Pittsburgh and around the country know whether the changes happening now make those goals reality
