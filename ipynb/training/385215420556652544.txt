The price of cocaine heroin and marijuana have fallen over the last two decades while the purity and potency of these illegal drugs have risen according to new research In a   published online recently in the journal BMJ Open researchers say a review of drug surveillance databases suggests that global efforts to combat illegal drugs have failed to curb supply After reviewing online drug surveillance databases for governments across the globe researchers said they documented a clear drop in the price of illegal drugs in major drug consuming nations as well as a trend toward larger drug seizures by authorities These trends combined with increased drug potency suggested that the global supply of illicit drugs has likely not been reduced in the previous two decades wrote lead author Dan Werb an epidemiologist at Canadas British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIVAIDS It is hoped that this study highlights the need to reexamine the effectiveness of national and international drug strategies that place a disproportionate emphasis on supply reduction at the expense of evidencebased prevention and treatment of problematic illegal drug use Werb and his colleagues wrote The United Nations has estimated that the global illicit drug trade is worth at least  billion a year In addition to the harm associated with drug use narcotics are also a key factor in the transmission of bloodborne diseases like HIV the authors wrote According to study authors the average inflationadjusted prices of heroin cocaine and cannabis in the United States decreased by   and  respectively between  and  At the same time their average purity increased by   and  respectively authors wrote Meanwhile US seizures of cocaine fell by roughly half between  and  while those of marijuana and heroin rose  and  respectively Study authors said they observed similar trends in Europe where the price of opiates and cocaine decreased by  and  respectively Seizures for cocaine and cannabis fluctuated but heroin seizures rose  by  Researchers acknowledged that their study had limitations It did not include amphetaminetype stimulants and other new synthetic drugs and was limited to certain regions Also researchers said that price and purity of illegal drugs were not the only indicators of drug availability and that future studies should include other measures such as streetlevel questionnaires given to drug users To listen to a BMJ Open podcast on this study click
