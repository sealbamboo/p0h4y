Were living longer And cardiovascular disease and infectious diseases arent taking quite as much of a toll as they did a couple of decades ago But that doesnt mean were immortal Road accidents suicide chronic kidney disease alcoholrelated diseases  these are a few of the topics to discuss after looking at a new   of causes of death by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington There are  countries included We spoke to IHMEs director Dr Christopher Murray about some of the more unusual findings In Central America you start to see really interesting things Violence is the No  cause of premature death in El Salvador Colombia and Venezuela Chronic kidney disease is No  in Mexico And you wouldnt even find a national policy on chronic kidney disease Its a big issue in not just Mexico but other countries in Central America and its starting to be a big issue in East Asia The Central American issue is very controversial Partly its diabetes and obesity But its believed to be pesticiderelated by one group Another group believes it might be an unrecognized viral illness thats the cause Theres active research on what might account for this but very little recognition by governments of how huge it is Road traffic injuries is the No  cause of premature death in four countries in the Middle East the No  cause of premature death in China Probably both Probably poorly enforced traffic regulations drunk driving lots of vehicles without safety restraints like air bags and seat belts And the mixing of pedestrians and cars There are ways you can intervene that would not be that expensive Railings at danger points for example so people cant walk across the street at random One thats very strange is that there are a very large number of deaths in Bolivia recorded as foreign body aspiration where kids in particular get a foreign body stuck in their airway and die I dont know When we were inquiring about this in Bolivia they gave us local names for things  I dont know what they were Because the population in the world is much older many more people die from Alzheimers But its not yet a big issue in subSaharan Africa There are very few people living into their s and s I dont know why in Korea but if youre the government of South Korea and you look at these numbers you have to try to understand the trend We know more about suicide in China Theres a huge variation across provinces almost as much as fivefold variations in suicide There are theories that say once you have high suicide rates its kind of selfperpetuating People know people whove committed suicide they also know about the means of suicide Theres this notion that its almost a contagion But these are theories The good news in China is that suicide rates are down a lot in the last  years We attribute a lot of that to economic progress and to more emancipation of younger people from their families One of the big drivers is men in the countries of the former Soviet Union Theres a big increase in the death rate in that bracket in Eastern Europe and alcohol is likely a part of it
