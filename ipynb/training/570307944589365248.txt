Some people think all we do in   payroll is press a button and cash appears in peoples bank accounts on payday We now use a frequentlycrashing human resources HR database with addons to enable payroll function run by a company that also provides payroll services No conflict of interest there then This has changed my role significantly I am personally responsible for the distribution of millions of pounds of public money more than  salaries per month paying domestic portering maintenance clerical nursing and medical staff senior managers chief executives and apprentices I need a working knowledge of each set of conditions pension regulations and pay scales HR and departmental managers make many changes in the database but it is our responsibility to ensure they are applied correctly working through huge reports to identify what has been changed when and by whom Managers failing to inform HR of starters leavers and changes HR failing to act on them or timesheets not sent to payroll cause stress and distress to staff Payroll deal with the fallout we get the upset or angry phone call chase whoever is responsible do the calculations write to staff to explain Were not allowed to say who is at fault so they assume we are Im currently setting up  new starters closing down  leavers checking  changes and have three queries on overpayments all caused by inefficient managers but I cant persuade HR or managers to provide the accurate information I need to resolve them so Im under pressure from the payees A colleague wants me to check and sign off his entire months work thus making me responsible for it Im chasing HR to make changes and send paperwork My email inbox is buzzing with new instructions and queries my paper intray is overflowing despite being emptied an hour ago and my phone is ringing constantly as Im covering for three parttime workers who dont do Fridays My senior managers chat about their holiday plans the middle managers argue about football and the first line managers carry their workload Their frustration cant go up the line due to the culture of fear and blame so comes down instead to the clerks  who then take it home with them and impose it on their partners Finally its time to go home  but we cant leave as the hospital site is gridlocked It will be an hour before we can go Wed carry on working but noone will authorise an extension to core time so we wont be paid A lady just called sobbing She has her maternity pay forecast but thought shed be paid full salary for the duration of her yearlong leave A leaver shouts at me because hes sure he worked a particular month  in   and wants his money I have twice had callers threaten to end it all if I cant arrange instant payment Frequently I deal with distress or aggression and the fault almost always lies elsewhere Our service level agreement however prevents me from saying that their manager HR or they themselves created the problem Im just the person who is going to sort it out Theres no support I was fourth in line in a managers bullying campaign The solution I was sent to a psychologist the manager was not dealt with I was threatened with disciplinary action for raising concerns over a bullied colleague who has since resigned with no job to go to and hasnt been replaced due to funding cuts I now have a share of his workload too During recent industrial action our trust warned of the potential dangers to patient care and the service generally not just if we took strike action but if we took our proper breaks and didnt work for free Theres no letup We dont have quiet days we cant wind down for weekends or for Christmas We have to answer every phone call so when a am caller rings back at am because his problem is not yet solved hes cross about it What am I supposed to do If I have to answer more than  calls in a day theres no time to deal with any of them I start each day with antidepressants and hypertension medication and end it wishing my working life had taken a different course I have tried but when you work in payroll its hard to persuade potential employers that youre capable of anything more than pressing that magic button
