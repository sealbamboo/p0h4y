It’s National Better Sleep Month. How well did you sleep last night? Eight-in-ten Americans say they would feel better and be more prepared for the day if they had an extra hour of sleep, according to a recent survey by the Better Sleep Council.. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults should sleep seven to eight hours each day and school-aged children should get at least 10 hours. However, only 48 percent of Americans sleep at least seven hours a day during the week. On the weekends, that number grows to 65 percent. Seems like most of us need to catch up on a little shut-eye this month.
