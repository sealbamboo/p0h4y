Morbidly obese people in England should be given a free flu jab on the NHS each year say government advisers  Public Health England and the governments vaccine advisory committee are in agreement that obesity poses enough of a health threat to consider including it as one of the at risk groups routinely offered the vaccine It would put obesity in the same league as asthma diabetes and heart disease  The government is yet to announce whether it will act on the advice  A spokeswoman from the Department of Health said this coming years flu plan was still being developed Nearly a million people in the UK are morbidly obese  Morbid obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index a measure of weight in relation to height of  or more  In the UK about three women in every  and one man in every  fit in this category  And experts say lessons from the  outbreak of pandemic swine flu which spread from country to country and   suggest that people who are morbidly obese are particularly vulnerable to severe flu The seasonal flu vaccine is currently available for free on the NHS for at risk groups which include  have suggested that many of the patients around the globe who died or ended up in hospital with HN swine flu were morbidly obese  While some very obese people might already be eligible for the flu jab because of coexisting health problems the majority will not be experts estimate   about  extra people in the UK could then qualify for the vaccine if morbid obesity is added to the at risk list The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said based on the evidence available to them it was clear that morbid obesity should be considered a risk factor for having the seasonal flu jab A spokesman said JCVI considered a summary of evidence provided by Public Health England which indicated that morbidly obese people are at an increased risk of complications and mortality from influenza relative to healthy individuals and additional evidence suggesting that such individuals respond well to vaccine  The committee confirmed its advice that morbid obesity should be considered a risk factor for seasonal influenza vaccination Jonathan Ball professor of virology at the University of Nottingham agreed that morbidly obese people should be given a free flu jab because they were an at risk group People who were obese were turning up to hospital with serious complications of influenza infection and therefore it makes perfect sense to give them the vaccine because there is no reason why they wouldnt respond well to it he told the BBC Mr Ball said there would be both a health benefit and cost benefit for the NHS in the long run if the group were given the vaccine
