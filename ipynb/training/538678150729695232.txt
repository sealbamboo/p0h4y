About a year ago at a MiamiDade County school board meeting superintendent Alberto Carvalho was happy to announce the district and the teachers union had just ratified a new contract I believe that this contract honors and dignifies what you do every single day he told the school board members It included bonuses for most teachers and it settled how to handle health care expenses after yet another year of rising costs We know exactly what the district pays out in terms of claims because we are the insurance company Theres no profit to be made he said Like most large employers the MiamiDade school district is   It bears the financial risk of covering its own employees The school boards reaction to the health care costs in the new contract was incredulous They are an elected board and didnt look forward to telling the teachers their prices were still going to go up One board member after another questioned the rise in prices Do we sit with our employees knowing what their salaries are and help them carve out the best options insurancewise one asked Twentyseven hundred more for his familys health  can you comment on that asked another Yet another lamented Our employees are tired of hearing about rising health care costs This was not the conversation the superintendent expected I thought we were coming here today to first and foremost celebrate something pretty remarkable he said Now a year later with another new contract the school board is still grappling with health care costs Teacher contributions to insurance will mostly stay the same but it means the district will absorb another  percent increase in costs Fedrick Ingram is head of the MiamiDade County teachers union which represents nearly  members Our salaries have not gone up in the same way that health care costs have gone up he explains So hes been urging the school district to figure out where the money is going We have to know whos driving up costs he says Whats going to affect the bottom line for our premium costs and what is actually contributing to that Turns out that is incredibly   But its a conversation more businesses should be having says Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University Businesses and employees need to stop taking for granted that rising health care costs are inevitable because they make tradeoffs Reinhardt says Employees actually pay for what they think is companyprovided insurance by lower wages he says But its so hard to get costs under control because the actual prices are secret Selfinsured organizations like MiamiDade County schools have to hire an insurance company to manage the claims process and negotiate rates with hospitals and doctors But insurers and providers keep the rates secret even from those employers hiring them Carvalhos right The district knows exactly what it pays overall for health care claims What it doesnt know is how much its paying to any one hospital or provider for a given service That means it doesnt know whos the most expensive provider or who is the cheapest That may drive prices higher for employees Reinhardt says Its almost like blindfolding people shoving them into Macys and saying Buy efficiently for a shirt  Reinhardt says Well you come out with a pair of shorts The school district is subject to the states open records laws but Cigna the insurance carrier they use for employees refused to share accounts of what was actually paid out citing trade secrets Even though the county school district which is taxpayerfunded takes on that risk its not allowed to see the contracted prices The district is seeking ways to get around the legal obstacles Its planning to shop for a service that can work with its limited   and at least figure out average costs Ideally district officials say theyd like to know enough about costs to offer incentives for employees who choose less expensive options Until theres more transparency MiamiDade teachers union member Cheryl Collier thinks the situation would offend even her secondgraders They would be angry that they are being forced pay for something not really fully understanding the value of what theyre paying for she says Its a lesson the school district and other employers are starting to learn
