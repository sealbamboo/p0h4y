 Tracking weight loss on a computer helps patients shed more pounds than other handsoff advice but wont top inperson interventions a new review found Over  months computerbased interventions led to greater weight loss than minimal interventions such as a brochure on how to lose weight Louise Falzon MD of Columbia University Medical Center and colleagues wrote in a  But patients in these programs had less weight loss than those who had inperson treatment they reported Computerbased interventions have a positive effect on shortterm weight loss and shortterm weight loss maintenance they wrote but they result in smaller losses and lower levels of weight maintenance than inperson counseling Research has started to show that treatment programs in which patients interact with the computer may help them make changes in lifestyle and diet in order to lose weight These programs include online goal setting and online logging of caloric intake and exercise So to assess how these programs compare with more traditional inperson interventions they reviewed randomized controlled studies involving computerbased weight loss or weight maintenance programs through May  A total of  studies on weight loss involved  patients and four studies with  patients focused on weight maintenance Although the computerbased interventions led to greater weight loss than minimal interventions such as pamphlets they couldnt top the weight loss seen with inperson treatments the researchers reported While interactive computerbased interventions appear to be more effective than a minimal or notreatment control they do not appear to be more effective than inperson treatments even in cases where the inperson contacts are infrequent they wrote Fewer trials in the review looked at computer interventions for maintenance of weight loss but these still consistently led to lower levels of weight regain when compared to a minimal or no treatment condition the researchers reported Again these were not superior to infrequent inperson therapy Few interventions led to changes in caloric intake physical activity or waist circumference the researchers cautioned but the outcomes werent reported in all studies Also no studies reported information on healthrelated quality of life morbidity complications or adverse events One study reported the costeffectiveness of weekly inperson weight loss sessions to a computerbased intervention at  per lifeyear gained though its unclear if that number can be extrapolated to other studies the researchers said They added that greater adherence to computer interventions was associated with greater amounts of weight loss though it was not clear what intervention elements would best encourage greater use or whether encouraging greater use would lead to larger effects The study was limited because it didnt assess the longerterm impacts of computer interventions but Falzon and colleagues concluded that even though inperson programs may offer better weight loss providers have few options to offer their patients so programs of less impact are still potentially important to consider as treatment options Source
