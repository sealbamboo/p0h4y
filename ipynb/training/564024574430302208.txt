Despite ongoing media and political attack Barack Obamas health reforms are succeeding Given the poor record of most major health legislation what can we learn from this Some  years ago Lyndon Baines Johnson changed the foundations of healthcare in the US Although overshadowed by the Vietnam war Medicare and Medicaid offered the old and vulnerable in America vital medical protection Since Theodore Roosevelt first proposed national health insurance more than  years ago the US has struggled to put in place anything close to a national health system Johnson aside major health reform has eluded all the modern presidents Until now Although it may be unfashionable to say so Obamas healthcare reforms are working Part of the reason this is not well understood is that the voices of opposition have been fierce and constant Congress has made more than  attacks on the Affordable Care Act ACA It will reinvigorate these efforts as the th congress gets into gear The media has played a big role too Prof Robert Blendon of Harvard University explained that just m m has been spent on positive advertising for the ACA whereas m has been burned trying to kill it Numerous legal battles have cast a shadow over the reforms But the data show something different The best estimates suggest that more than  million fewer people are uninsured as a result of the health legislation Thats like creating a new health service for the population of Scotland and Wales from scratch It is predicted that coverage will reach  million by  It may also be starting to curb costs Were it a national economy the US healthcare system would be the fifth largest in the world with an annual spend of tr It spends nearly double what any other country does on health slowing down health spending is a major policy priority In the four years since Obamas health reforms were introduced the rise in healthcare costs have been historically low  less than  per year Despite the near constant barrage of negative voices public opposition may also be starting to thaw Although there has been no increase in public support since  the desire for the act to be repealed has reduced from more than  of the population to around one in three The battle is not yet won however if Obamacare is to stand alongside the health reforms of the s Obama has first to weather the next wave of congressional and legal attacks Although outright repeal is not likely  Obama will be able to veto this  some important elements of the reforms may be eroded If the reforms survive these storms then comes the  election While commentators are divided on how Hillary Clinton will handle health in this campaign the Republican contenders will need a plan of their own There are also vested business interests in making the ACA work While overall costs may be rising slower than normal successful hospitals and insurers are making money from expanded coverage While  of the attention has been on increasing insurance access the other  largely overlooked  objective of Obamas health reforms was to reshape the delivery system The US is currently in the process of a bewildering array of experiments to test out new models of care of which Accountable Care Organisations ACOs are perhaps the best known If just some of these can bend the cost curve and improve quality then Obamacare will have achieved its full mission What can British policymakers learn from the US experience of reshaping healthcare given our own lamentable experience at major reform Three lessons strike me First Obamacare had a clear overarching goal reduce the number of uninsured Who can stand up and make such a clear case for the   Second stay out of the weeds   argues that Obama was successful by steering clear of the technocratic details This was something Carter and Clinton failed to do As did Andrew Lansley in the UK you might say Third be prepared to use personal political capital The Obama team made a close study of previous attempts to reform healthcare  in particular Johnsons and Clintons efforts While not always taking the public podium Obama was pivotal in managing Congress at key moments Johnson said that health was a staple like coffee and flour For years American cupboards have been bare Obama may finally be filling them
