
 During her pregnancy Emily Oster didnt appreciate her doctors habit of issuing blanket rules Dont gain more than  pounds No need to discuss amniocentesis  youre not  No eating in the delivery room An edict to limit coffee to two cups a day particularly irked Dr Oster a health economist at the University of Chicago whose workday was powered by a pretty steady caffeine drip Her obgyn issued decrees without explanation much as a parent says no and expects compliance But Dr Oster a PhD trained in statistics who is not a medical doctor could not imagine making an informed decision without some data Her new book is the result of weekends sifting through   and other scientific databases reading a textbook Steven Gabbes Obstetrics and chewing over issues with friends in the field to figure out which pregnancy rules were supported by convincing evidence   will be a revelation for curious motherstobe whose doctors fail to lay out the pros and cons of that morning latte let alone discuss real science And it makes for valuable homework before those harried obgyn appointments even for lucky patients whose doctors are able to talk about the rationale behind their advice But her confrontational approach may well alienate some readers not to mention doctors and some experts are questioning the accuracy of her advice on alcohol Some of myths she attempts to explode were already on the ropes Its widely known that bed rest  recommended to supposedly prevent preterm labor  is   and   And Dr Oster  notes that fertility declines with age but not as fast as you might expect But as luck would have it she got scooped by an   that argued  with statistics  that a decline in fertility in a womans s has been oversold Shes on fresher terrain dissecting two tests performed late in pregnancy The   done to assess fetal distress depends on measurements of the heart rate and the fetus movements Simply   and get her moving Good to know And if an ultrasound finds that amniotic fluid is too low Dr Oster writes there are two possible solutions Make sure the socalled   alternately drinking two liters of water before the test can raise amniotic fluid levels Thats useful advice especially since a low reading can lead to induced labor Yet some of her conclusions are less well supported by medical research After reviewing small studies showing that exercise has little impact on rates of Csections fetal growth or labor length she concludes that exercise is fine for pregnant women but so is abstaining for nine months The latter approach overlooks the broad health benefits of exercise pregnant or not Dr Osters thoughts on drinking alcohol while expecting have already generated controversy In her view there is no good scientific evidence that light drinking negatively impacts the fetus Pregnant women can be comfortable with  to  drinks a week in the first trimester and one drink daily afterward she writes Similar assertions have long been made but her explanation may be unique a woman who drinks slowly lowers the amount of alcohol and acetaldehyde its toxic byproduct reaching her fetus Most government agencies and the   say that no amount of alcohol has been proved safe for the developing fetus a position Dr Oster calls draconian Bill Dunty a program director of the division of metabolism and health effects at the   called her explanation oversimplified and said it could potentially mislead women to think they are not exposing their fetus to alcohol Women vary in their ability to absorb and metabolize alcohol according to Dr Dunty It is unrealistic to believe that an individual can inherently control the amount of alcohol or its metabolites that reach her fetus by taking longer time to drink an alcoholic beverage he said Dr Oster contends that acetaldehyde is processed by the babys liver and doesnt get into the brain However the fetal liver is not formed until at least week  and it doesnt become fully functional until just before birth says Jacquelyn Bertrand a senior scientist at the   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Whats more ethanol crosses the placenta and becomes part of the amniotic fluid said Dr Bertrand who has a PhD in psychology and has studied the neurodevelopment of children with prenatal alcohol exposure Even with very slow drinking ethanol builds up in the amniotic fluid which bathes fetal tissue for a considerable time she said adding that all fetal organs especially the brain are very vulnerable because sometimes they are in direct contact with amniotic fluid Throughout Expecting Better Dr Oster paints a fairly antagonistic picture of the doctorpatient relationship castigating what she views as the restriction of womens freedom Dr Jeffrey L Ecker the chairman of the committee on obstetrics practice for ACOG acknowledged that doctors used to take a directive approach of Do this dont do that end of story But now he said relationships with expectant patients have evolved into more of a shared decisionmaking model I wouldnt equate offering a recommendation even a recommendation that doesnt have the strongest possible evidence with restricting someones freedom Dr Ecker said
