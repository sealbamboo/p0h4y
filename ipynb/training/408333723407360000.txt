Hands on the steering wheel one foot toggling between brake and pedal head twisting to check mirrors Consider the many bones and joints you must engage before you even turn on a cars ignition among them the fingers wrist forearm elbow shoulder neck heel ankle and leg If youve recently had an injury to any of them when is it safe to resume driving It turns out there are no widely accepted returntodriving timelines for patients who must wear casts slings neck collars or controlled anklemotion boots Whether someone is recovering from a sprain fracture bunion surgery knee or hip replacement or neck fusion the ability to steer glance at mirrors and brake safely can be seriously if temporarily impaired Several recent articles have attempted to summarize the disparate findings of a relative handful of postoperative driving studies Among their conclusions most studies say that braking function returns to normal four weeks after right knee arthroscopy nine weeks after surgery for an ankle fracture and six weeks after the patient can walk unencumbered after a fracture of a major lowerbody bone After a total right hip or knee replacement the recommended time before driving is generally four to six weeks One absolute patients should not drive with a cast or brace on the right leg or if a cast or sling immobilizes the wrist or elbow The goal of such studies which typically measure how long it takes a recovering patient to make an emergency stop was to encourage surgeons to have conversations with their patients about factors to weigh before getting behind the wheel  something many surgeons are loath to do because of a misperception that they could be sued if the patient got into an auto accident or if driving somehow aggravated the injury And even when surgeons do have that conversation some of the research showed many patients dismiss the advice As surgeons we cant clear someone for driving but we can educate them said   a coauthor of one review recently    I tell patients No immobilization full range of motion without pain and then well talk about it But thats common sense and not science added Dr Marecek an assistant professor of clinical orthopedic surgery at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine Still there is great variation among studies in terms of timelines and precautions with   who were pain free could drive as soon as one week after a simple right knee arthroscopy  Experts therefore urge surgeons to tailor their advice to the individual patient and procedure weighing such factors as the patients pain tolerance medications postoperative mobility and mental acuity  One reason formal guidelines have not been endorsed by associations of orthopedic surgeons is that goldstandard data is scarce Typically the few studies used computerized driving simulators or obstacle courses and healthy volunteers police recruits in one whom they fettered with mobilityrestricting casts splints and slings  These are not representative recreations of the typical patient after surgery but they do show that even painfree unmedicated highly competent drivers experience lag time in braking when wearing such postsurgical supports Another limitation of the studies is that the vast majority were done on automatic transmission vehicles and looked at impairments to right arms for steering and right legs and feet for braking and accelerating Almost none looked at stickshift drivers who typically use both feet   vice chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center who has conducted drivingimpairment studies but was not involved in the recent review articles noted that even on automatic transmissions some people drive or steer with their left arm or use their left foot because of an amputation or other medical challenges Some drive cars with adapted hand controls Its all about what youre used to he said The message should be if there is any impairment to your normal mode of operating a vehicle you shouldnt do it   He said that normal braking function usually follows the patients return to walking though other factors may play a role If for example a patient is sleeping poorly because of pain alertness may be a compromising factor Dr David Goodwin a resident physician in the department of orthopedic surgery at Georgetown University Hospital and a   PDF typically instructs patients Its best that you practice in a parking lot or another large open space But he added Legally I would never put down in writing that youre cleared to drive Many doctors remain skittish about even broaching the subject with one study showing that  percent of surgeons never discussed safe postoperative driving with their patients   But the doctors fear of litigation may be overblown Dr Marecek noted that many insurance companies and lawenforcement officials place the responsibility for the decision to drive squarely on the patient  According to   a partner at the law firm Husch Blackwell and a member of the American Bar Associations health law section I know of nothing definitive in the law that establishes a standard for physicians in clearing patents for driving after orthopedic surgery Given that reality he said it is wise for physicians and patients to have a conversation about when it would be safe for the patient to drive
