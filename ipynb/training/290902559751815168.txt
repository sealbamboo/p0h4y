One week after the brilliant young quarterback Robert Griffin III blew out his right knee in an NFL playoff game fans questions have morphed from How could this have happened to When do we get him back But figuring out when an athlete with damaged knee ligaments can get back in action is an inexact art at best because medicine has yet to come up with a solid way to fix a knee Even when doctors make the repairs the fix often isnt good enough to let an athlete whether hes a high school soccer forward or a multimilliondollar quarterback return in gamewinning form It takes  months on average for an NFL player to return to play after anterior cruciate ligament surgery according to one   In that case RGIII would likely miss the  NFL season  a heartbreaking prospect for Redskins fans Another review of the skimpy literature on return to play for athletes found that just onethird are able to ever get back in the game It is sobering says   an orthopedic surgeon and researcher at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago who conducted that review Hes wrapping up a study on NFL NBA and pro soccer players looking at how long it takes the athletes to get back in the game So far it looks like soccer player struggle the most with ACL injuries No ACL no sports The ligament that runs up the middle of the knee is the stabilizing anchor that makes it possible to flex turn and pivot Too much torque on the joint can fray a knee ligament or sever it About  people suffer   with half of them having surgery according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons ACL damage is common in athletes of all ages even afflicting gradeschoolers as youth sports become intensive yearround events To make the fix surgeons prefer to use a healthy tendon from elsewhere in someones body usually from the kneecap or tendon That can be a problem for someone like RGIII who tore the same ACL in  while playing for   Unfortunately that hurts one part of the knee in order to help another says   an orthopedic surgeon at the Stone Clinic in San Francisco There are shortterm weakness and longterm pain and arthritis consequences Indeed a  study in the   found that   when it came to dealing with ACL injuries Other studies report failure rates of  to  percent One theory is that the synovial joint fluid that surrounds the ACL hampers healing there while the lateral collateral ligament on the outside of the knee which Griffin also injured heals more easily Long recovery time is another problem and not just for pro quarterbacks but for high school athletes who are gunning for college scholarship or just yearn to play When surgeons harvest the replacement ligament they leave chunks of bone at each end Those are fastened to the tibia and femur with screws It takes two to three months for the bone to attach firmly according to   an orthopedic surgeon in Memphis who is team physician for the NBA Grizzlies Cadaver tissue which is used when a person has no more ligaments to spare attaches more slowly which is one reason that orthopedists are experimenting with using pig ligaments instead Growing new nerves and blood vessels around the new ligament can take several months more Biologys got to happen youve got to take time for biology to happen Azar says You balance biology versus the patient being ready to move on to the next step Physical therapy to regain strength stability and balance can take another four to six months according to the orthopedists academy But very few studies have been done on how long it takes to recover and return to play especially at the pro level Thats not unlike recovery from another ligament repair common for top draft picks   The Washington Nationals phenom Stephen Strasburg missed a good chunk of the  season including the playoffs so as not to overtax an elbow operated on in  Will Washingtons beloved RGIII suffer the same fate Cole and other researchers are now working on standards to measure things like movement and landing skills The goal is to know more objectively when a knee is ready to return to play rather than depending on a players passion for the game or a coachs eagerness to put his star back on the field
