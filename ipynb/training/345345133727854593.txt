Just two years ago Barbara Whitmarsh was a woman who seemed to have it all She was a highly regarded scientist at the National Institutes of Health Married for  years shed raised six children with her beloved husband John But then John Whitmarsh started to notice some disturbing changes in his wife now  It was as if the woman hed married and lived with all that time was slowly and inexorably fading away  Her ability to feel empathy her personality it just disappeared over a period of time John said I would ask her Is there anything wrong and she would say No I love you and everythings fine but she wasnt there And she said it in that flat way A scientist himself Whitmarsh knew there was indeed something wrong And he was worried He asked his wife to see a psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with frontotemporal dementia or FTD Its a dementia that generally strikes at an earlier age than Alzheimers disease And its symptoms are different  at least in the beginning  from Alzheimers because it originates in a different part of the brain  Its also a disease that until very recently doctors thought was rare  but that view is changing  Weve begun to realize that frontotemporal dementia is actually more common than Alzheimers disease in people with degenerative disorders under the age of  said Dr Bruce Miller director of the Memory and Aging Center at the University of California San Francisco The Alzheimers Association estimates that in people younger than age  FTD may account for up to  percent to  percent of dementia cases  While Alzheimers can eventually lead to behavior problems it starts with a deterioration of memory as neurons in the hippocampus are destroyed FTD starts with behavior problems caused by the death of nerve cells in the frontal lobes then spreads to other areas of the brain leading to fading memory As the diseases progress they become more and more difficult to tell apart A key symptom of FTD is a loss of inhibition since the frontal lobes are responsible for judgment decision making and selfcontrol Before her illness Whitmarsh watched her weight closely In just a year she has gained  pounds Because those early symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric illnesses people with FTD are often misdiagnosed Miller said For that to change there will need to be a paradigm shift in our society he added  I think traditionally people have thought about behavioral symptoms such as loss of empathy for other people addiction later in life disinhibition as not having a neurological origin I think that when people begin to realize that when someone in their s or s suddenly loses empathy for others becomes disinhibited becomes profoundly apathetic begins to overeat frontotemporal dementia needs to be suspected Its a tragic problem because often the first manifestations of the disease are bad judgments and disruption of the family infrastructure happens Miller said For Barbara Whitmarsh the brain damage due to FTD has meant living in a locked nursing home where she moves compulsively and constantly  As the disease has progressed it also has robbed her of her memory She seldom recognizes her husband or their children and she rarely speaks As with Alzheimers disease and other dementias there is currently no treatment for FTD For more information on FTD please visit The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration   RELATED
