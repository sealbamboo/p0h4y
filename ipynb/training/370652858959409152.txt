One day about eight years ago chef   of the famed   restaurant at   in the Hudson River Valley got a FedEx package from someone he didnt know Inside were two ears of corn And a letter The handwritten note explained that the corn was an heirloom variety called New England Eight Row Flint or   by its Italian name and that it was a taste that was nearly lost to history Native Americans cultivated this variety hundreds of years ago The corn caught on with settlers in New England because it was hearty and nutritious Then in the th century the grain was exported to Italy where it was prized as a stunningly flavorful polenta corn Barber was curious So he got in touch with the man who had sent the FedEx package a grain enthusiast named   He had tracked down Eight Row Flint corn seed from a   and grown some It was phenomenally flavored Roberts told me The flavors were bounding out of the polenta He was eager to revive the corn here in the US If you listen to my story youll hear how chef Barber made an arrangement to start growing the New England heirloom corn at the farm next to his restaurant And for the past eight years farmer   has overseen its cultivation During my visit Algiere showed me one of the goldenhued cobs still growing on the stalk It will turn a golden orange when its dry Algiere said The vibrancy of this yellowishorange pigment is indicative of high concentrations of beneficial   called carotenoids which make this corn appealing for its nutritional value And its also fairly high in protein So why did farmers stop growing this corn For everything that New England Eight Row Flint corn has going for it in terms of flavor its big downside is that it doesnt produce many cobs Its a lowyield corn Thats why farmers moved to higheryield varieties explains Algiere They can get more corn per acre at lower quality Farmers produce for bulk because theyre paid by the bushel not by the color or the flavor So varieties such as New England Eight Row Flint corn may produce great taste but theyre not really commercially viable unless you convince more people to pay for taste over volume Thats what chef Barber is doing at Blue Hill He serves a polenta made from the Eight Row Flint corn grown at Stone Barns And when I tasted it I was surprised The polenta tasted as if he had added butter It was creamy and flavorful Diners who have been turned onto it say the flavor is stunningly complex Its kinda crazy he says The taste is coming directly from the corn Barber says this corn is just one example of what can happen when crops are bred to be flavorful and colorful not just big The chef says he hopes this story becomes more than just a foodie fascination with heirlooms because he thinks theres more at stake here about the way our food is grown What Ive come to learn from this experience is that if you are pursuing great flavor he says you are pursuing great nutrition Its one and the same And what hed like to see is for farmers and plant breeders to work together to combine the best of the old with modern breeding techniques that may help pack more nutrition into the foods we all eat So where can you get your hands on some of these heirloom varieties of dried corn Well in Italy a few   grind   corn And theres a smattering of farms and seed suppliers in the US selling other varieties of Flint corn such as   and    in Exeter RI grows a variety called Longfellow One highprotein variety according to Slow Food USA is called   flint And theres also enthusiasm for a very colorful variety known as
