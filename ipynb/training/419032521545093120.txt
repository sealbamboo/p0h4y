Wiping out malaria is a top goal for many leaders in global health Fewer people are dying now from the mosquitoborne disease than at any other time in history And theres a very very strong belief now that malaria can be eliminated says   who chairs the African Leaders Malaria Alliance But when you look at the overall numbers on malaria eradication almost seems like a pipe dream In  malaria was ranked as the seventh biggest killer in the developing world More than   people got malaria in  and more than  of those infected died By comparison the world recorded just a few hundred cases of polio last year and less than a hundred cases of    two other diseases at the top of the eradication list So why are global health leaders so optimistic about someday ending malaria Perhaps because there has been a precedent And it happened right here in the US The federal government   malaria from the American South in the early part of the th century And the lessons learned from that successful campaign could help control the disease in developing countries says   a political scientist at the University of Texas Arlington Its almost impossible for us to imagine Sledge says But in the rural South as late as the s the extent of malaria was in many ways comparable to what it is today in subSaharan Africa Sledge and his colleague recently analyzed archived public records to try to determine what factors helped to eliminate malaria in Alabama The findings were surprising It wasnt getting people to sleep under insecticidetreated bed nets or getting better medications to people who do get infected  two major tactics used to control malaria today in subSaharan Africa and Southeast Asia Instead the parasite left the US in large part because the government destroyed mosquito breeding grounds The primary factor leading to the demise of malaria was largescale drainage projects which were backed up by the creation of local public health infrastructure he says Sledge and his colleague   their findings this September in the   There had been some speculation that malaria went into decline when tenant farmers started to move out of the hardest hit areas to seek jobs in factories up north Sledge says But that wasnt the case We found that the population actually increased in highly endemic areas over the course of the s he says To wipe out mosquito breeding grounds the US government had to dig more than  miles of drainage ditches and canals the Pan American Health Organization   in  So this strategy comes with its own set of problems including damage to the environment Largescale drainage projects arent central to most malaria control programs in Africa and Asia today But Sledge thinks the American experience with the parasite could be instructive for efforts to wipe out the disease globally
