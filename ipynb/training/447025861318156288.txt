In honor of St Patricks Day I spent the week working on wholegrain soda breads and scones Not all Irish soda bread is made with wholegrain flour but the ones I like the best are They are one of the reasons I love going to Ireland I especially love the moist brown panbaked loaves served with smoked salmon butter and cheese  It took me years to achieve the kind of moist crumb I was looking for in this kind of loaf but I finally got what I was going for this week The trick I realized was a very wet dough baked at a moderate temperature in a loaf pan rather than at the higher temperatures Ive always used for the hardercrusted freeform loaves I put a little bit of white flour in my loaves but you could use all wholewheat flour if you prefer With whole wheat your bread will have more fiber zinc B vitamins and iron and its glycemic index will be considerably lower than that of bread made with white flour Irishstyle wholemeal flour available from King Arthur Flour and from importers has a coarse crumb that is typical of Irish soda bread I achieved the same crumb using my Community Grains wholewheat flour and adding oatmeal to the mix I used buttermilk as the liquid but you can also use yogurt or a mix of yogurt and milk You do need the acid from the fermented milk to react with the baking soda Any bread or pastry that you can mix together in less than a minute is going to become a keeper in my kitchen The soda breads fit this requirement beautifully as did the scones I made which were also Irishinspired My son Liam who is halfIrish is in Ireland  right now enjoying Irish food and the company of his family I cant be there to enjoy it with him so Ill settle for these homemade breads at home  These are diminutive light scones like the ones that originated in Britain and Ireland  This soda bread is baked at a lower temperature so that it doesnt develop a hard crust  A mix of raisins sweetens this brown soda bread  A regional version of soda bread that is darkbrown grainy and moist  A wholegrain scone that pairs well with cheese
