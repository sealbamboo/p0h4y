Theres no doubt Pharrells Happy is the biggest hit of the year so far It spent  weeks at the top of the    and inspired hundreds of fan videos on YouTube Just a few weeks ago six Iranian teenagers   for posting a video of themselves dancing to the catchy song So what is it about   that triggers a nearly uncontrollable need to tap your foot bob your head or move to the rhythm in some way It may be more about whats missing from the song than whats there Last month neuroscientists at Aarhus University in Denmark   a study showing that danceable grooves have just the right amount of gaps or breaks in the beats Your brain wants to fill in those gaps with body movement says the studys lead author   Gaps in the rhythmic structure gaps in the sort of underlying beat of the music  that sort of provides us with an opportunity to physically inhabit those gaps and fill in those gaps with our own bodies she says A few years ago Witek set out to figure out which songs got people onto the dance floor She created an online survey and gave people drum patterns to listen to Some had really simple rhythms with regular beats Others had extremely complex rhythms with lots of gaps where youd expect beats to be Finally there were drumming patterns that fell in the middle of those two extremes They have a regular predictable beat but also some pauses or gaps Witek says that people all over the world agreed on which drum patterns made them most want to dance Not the ones that have very little complexity and not the ones that had very very high complexity she says but the patterns that had a sort of a balance between predictability and complexity These rhythms offer enough regularity so that we can perceive the underlying beat Witek and her team reported in the journal   But they also need enough gaps or breaks to invite participants to synchronize to the music So which popular songs on the radio today have this optimal amount of complexity I think the recent single by Pharrell Happy is a very good example Witek says The song is layered with predictable beats and complex syncopated ones The drums the piano the clapping and even Pharrells voice create inviting gaps she says But Pharrell isnt the only one who knows about this trick Classic dance tunes in disco funk hiphop and rhythm and blues also hit this sweet spot of   Witek says Michael Jackson Stevie Wonder  those guys have a lot of tracks which seem to have this balance between predictability and complexity when it comes to the rhythmic structure she says And dont forget about Ray Charles His s hit   made everybody want to hit the dance floor But its not just a songs syncopation that gets you to go from tapping your foot in your chair to standing up and fullout dancing Its also the songs layers of rhythm says neuroscientist   at McGill University In Ive Got a Woman the drums are keeping a very steady rhythm The piano is syncopated and the vocals are exquisitely nuanced in time Levitin says Its very difficult to sing along with him Ray Charles exactly the way he does it So we dont sing with Charles Instead we want to move with him The more rhythmically complex the music is  the easier it is to engage different body parts Levitin says because they can be synchronizing with different aspects of the music So youre swinging your shoulders with the snare drums Youre bobbing your head with the piano And you might be wiggling your hips in halftime or something like that he says Before you know it youre up out of your chair and doing the twist
