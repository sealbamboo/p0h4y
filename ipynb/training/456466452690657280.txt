In August  federal agents swept across the Detroit area arresting doctors pharmacists and other health professionals accused of running a massive scheme to defraud Medicare The following month several of those arrested including psychiatrist Mark Greenbain and podiatrist Anmy Tran   program for the poor But the indictment and Medicaid suspensions didnt deter Medicare from continuing to allow the doctors to treat elderly and disabled patients  and didnt stop the physicians from billing taxpayers for their services In  Medicare paid Greenbain more than  according to newly released data on Medicare payments to physicians Tran received  Greenbain and Tran were among dozens of doctors identified by the nonprofit newsroom   who kept getting Medicare payments after they were suspended or terminated from state Medicaid programs indicted or charged with fraud or had settled civil allegations of submitting false claims to Medicare Outlays to these doctors amounted to more than  million in  ProPublicas analysis shows Thats only a small fraction of the  billion Medicare has publicly reported paying that year for doctors visits and outpatient services in its Part B program But it signifies a hole in regulators ability to protect the program  and patients against fraud and abuse say current and former government officials and fraud experts The total dollars paid to sanctioned doctors is likely much higher Only a handful of states post online the names of doctors terminated from Medicaid programs in a way that can be accurately matched to Medicare Part B payments If youve been suspended or terminated in one of the federal programs  I would think that youd be suspended in the other programs just as a basis of good practice said Louis Saccoccio chief executive of the National Health Care AntiFraud Association Part B payments to doctors were released last week for the first time A court injunction that had kept the information secret for  years was lifted last year as a result of a lawsuit by Dow Jones    parent company of  Aaron Albright a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said he could not discuss the status of individual doctors such as Greenbain and Tran both of whom were finally barred from billing Medicare this month By that time Greenbain had pleaded guilty and been   in prison Tran had been found guilty at trial and was   She is appealing her conviction Albright said the Medicare payment data may not reflect money already recovered by his agency or held back from providers suspended from billing the program Preventing improper payments is a top priority for CMS Albright said The agency has employed new enrollment screening techniques to prevent highrisk providers from getting into the system he said and is using advanced data analytics to spot fraudulent billing before payments are made Last year ProPublica reported that doctors who had been booted from Medicaid  or who had been disciplined by state medical boards  were able to continue prescribing medications to beneficiaries in Medicares drug program The finding prompted Sen Charles Grassley RIowa to push for better coordination Among the physicians ProPublica found who continued to collect Medicare Part B payments after being flagged by law enforcement or other oversight agencies Even a guilty plea sometimes wasnt enough for Medicare to cut off payments Dr Anthony Jase of New Orleans   in October  He still collected  for Medicare billings in  Last fall   and ordered to pay  in restitution It certainly looks like there is a need for more attention said Mark McClellan former administrator at CMS who is now at the Brookings Institution
