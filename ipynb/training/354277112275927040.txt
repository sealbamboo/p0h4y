John Tatum is  years old He is a swimmer And a gold medalist Tatum is one of thousands of the top athletes in the US who run vault and swim for the gold in the National Senior Games All of these seniors are over age  and some are over  And they show no signs of slowing down I see no end for me Tatum says I would like to just compete year after year after year You know Im  probably could be  I dont know But as long as I am healthy I can do it Theyre the focus of a documentary called   Host Michel Martin speaks to Tatum and producer Keith Ochwat about the Senior Games Bradford was the better swimmer You know sickness overtook him That declined his skills a little He was in a lot of swimming teams when I wasnt We switched back and forth on the win on certain contests Sometimes I clipped him a lot of times In  or  they had a public pool for blacks in the District of Columbia  I was interested but I had other things to do Brad really got into it He was on the swimming team the very first one they had I went to high school and theyd never had a team there And in college they didnt have a swimming team I just picked up again after I retired because we heard about Howard University having this meet every year for seniors And you know at that time I was  maybe  or  And I went on and I saw a couple of guys that I knew from high school who were in their s and they were still swimming Its really hard for us to have prepared ourselves for the story that John and Brad told us We knew from the beginning of their contact with us that they had faced segregation and they had overcome quite a bit to follow their love of swimming But once we had the opportunity to meet John and Brad and their families and see their role in the community it really became our mission in telling their stories in the  that these arent just swimmers these arent just seniors they are not just athletes These men are examples These men are living examples They are living examples and role models for people who are older younger our age It was wonderful to get to know them You never know what comes up in your life physically but I see no end for me I would like to just compete year after year after year You know Im  probably could be  I dont know But as long as I am healthy I can do it And thats what I tell other people you know the guys around me I dont have any friends from my boyhood anymore My sons friends are my friends now I try to keep them up with it Get out and do something Youre physically fit Go out and try yourself you know And those things help you live
