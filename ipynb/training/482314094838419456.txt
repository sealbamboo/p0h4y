Being in the middle of a group of laughing friends is usually a happy experience but for those with an unusual phobia it is anything but They are people with gelotophobia  a fear of laughter Drummond all names have been changed  from the US told researchers I hear people laughing and I assume they are laughing at me I tense up and get ready for a fight I can feel the adrenaline  I hardly ever talk or do anything that could cause me to be laughed at I remain stonefaced most of the day  I see other people having fun Sometimes I want to change and be like them  But I dont want to get there and be made fun of because I am different  His description of his condition was recorded by Dr Tracey Platt at the University of Zurich in Switzerland  She is part of a body of scientists across the world including Africa Canada India and Russia trying to understand what causes the condition Gelotophobes either do not understand what laughter is or they think it is directed at them in a negative malicious way and feel scared when they hear it  They often find being around people difficult and may suffer stress headaches dizziness and bouts of trembling in social situations  Chukar  is from Israel He says he feels ashamed and embarrassed when he hears people laugh  When I hear laughter I feel above average to extreme anger which starts as a visceral reaction that would last for hours and sometimes days I also get extreme body tension and headaches  Chukar says he sidesteps social situations in favour of reading and playing solitary sports  He says When others sought to bait me and use me as the butt of their jokes to impress their friends then I would fight I have got into few fights in my life but when I did my target usually got badly hurt and the rest of the group avoided me like the plague Working in a busy office can seem an insurmountable challenge if every time someone laughs it feels like a personal attack People with the condition can be limited in the sorts of jobs they can get    Long term the phobia can lead to anxiety and low selfesteem It is also associated with depression  Gelotophobes can struggle to make friends find love or form lasting relationships  I am alone and cope alone says Chukar   started in  so it is still largely a mystery exactly what lies behind it meaning treatment is relatively limited  Dr Platt says the causes are likely to be a childs environment how their personality develops their school life social life and their own humour  She says many gelotophobes report being bullied at school  The question is what came first Does someone have a disposition that makes them sensitive and there is a mismatch which means they feel they are being bullied in the first place  Or it could be a straightforward response to bullying she says  Dr Platt believes the phobia would not suddenly develop at the age of  and also that there is a link to   Dr Platt works to understand what facial expressions are linked with feeling afraid of laughter   After filling out online questionnaires her volunteers come into the lab in Zurich  She uses avatars to show them a range of facial expressions to see exactly when a smile becomes upsetting  It may be that gelotophobes can be reprogrammed she said  But they are not at the point where they can test treatment as the field is so new she adds Dr Platt says she wants the condition to be easily identified by therapists who can then help to shape a patients treatment in future   Britain has the highest prevalence of people with the phobia says Dr Platt likely due to its culture of humour with  of the population gelotophobic to some extent  It leads the world for extreme gelotophobia with  of the UK population categorised as having a pathological fear of laughter which impacts greatly on their daily life  There are also higher numbers in some parts of Asian culture she says where shame could be used as a form of control  But Denmark has the lowest gelotophobia in society as laughing at somebody else  you just dont do it  It is seen as very wrong to laugh at anothers misfortune she added   Just under  of Denmarks population have the condition Prof Sophie Scott at University College London is researching the neuroscience of voices speech and laughter She said I do not think you can play down the importance of laughter It is absolutely endemic Prof Scott said laughter had a key role in helping people to deal with negative emotions and to feel calm and cheerful that would not be available to gelotophobes  She added You can imagine it would be highly unpleasant if you could not join in with laughter or react in a nice way Prof Scott said being gelotophobic could be an index of peoples social problems or personality traits rather than laughter  Work is ongoing to focus on what was happening in the brains of children with disorders which can result in gelotophobia to understand its neurological basis she said
