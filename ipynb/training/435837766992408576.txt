On the surface the yearold construction worker looks like any other patient with back pain He came to the Washington DC emergency room where I work in severe discomfort after moving heavy cinder blocks a few days before The pain gets worse with twisting and bending but he has no numbness or weakness in his legs Theres no tenderness along his spine no difficulty urinating no fever so theres nothing to suggest a fracture infection spinal cord mass or anything other than a muscle strain The resident Im supervising orders a Percocet pill a sensible option we choose almost every day But the patient refuses when the nurse offers it to him Thats strange On an average eighthour shift in the ER I see dozens of patients in pain Sometimes the pain is caused by a chronic condition like arthritis Other times its an acute episode of muscle strain or a broken tooth Every patient in pain wants relief from it Often people ask for narcotics by name Percocet Vicodin oxycodone and Dilaudid I was curious why this man was the exception That stuff messed me up bad he tells me In his early twenties hed had a similar episode of back pain after heavy lifting Doctors prescribed opioid painkillers He soon found himself addicted to them He went from doctor to doctor to get prescriptions then turned to buying drugs on the street It took him  years to get clean His first exposure to narcotics had been in the ER I can imagine myself as the wellintentioned doctor who aimed to take away his pain not knowing the consequences that would follow I began to wonder how many other patients Ive prescribed narcotics to end up following the same path as this patient At first I dismissed this possibility as preposterous Physicians routinely order narcotic medications for patients in pain Its not an unreasonable thing to do After all the pain is so bad the people come to us seeking emergency care We doctors want to relieve their suffering In the ER we meet patients for single encounters and dont have time to track down whether theyve received prescriptions from other hospitals Besides when patients demand pills we dont usually give them more than a few days worth Philip Seymour Hoffmans death raised renewed questions about drug addiction I was horrified to learn that nearly   who used drugs for the first time began by using a prescription drug Prescription painkillers are just as deadly as street drugs according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In fact they kill   than heroin does In the meantime narcotic prescriptions are multiplying In    prescriptions for opioid painkillers  one for every adult American and a  percent increase from  While the US makes up less than  percent of the worlds population Americans consume  percent of its   Why are so many people receiving medications that have such high potential for abuse and overdose While some patients are addicts shopping for doctors who will prescribe narcotics most are seeking relief from pain unaware of the risks of opioids And while there may be some doctors who knowingly prescribe too many painkillers most are like me and struggle with how to responsibly help patients in pain without driving them to addiction There are some policies that attempt to reign in chronic abusers New York City has   to giving no more than a threeday supply of opioid pain medications Many states have   that track narcotic prescriptions obtained from different providers Fewer resources exist to assist the majority of people who have discrete episodes of pain Patients need to know that requesting narcotics as a quick fix to pain helps fuel the epidemic of prescription drug abuse Many symptoms get better with time and there are nearly always alternatives including physical therapy and overthecounter pain relievers Doctors also need resources to enable us to address patient expectations while upholding our oath to first do no harm Hospital policies can help with limits on the amount of narcotics prescribed and prompt followup with pain specialists Some patients will still end up with narcotic prescriptions but others like the construction worker with an aching back will decide to tough it out I know what that stuff can do to you he says Id rather deal with the pain
