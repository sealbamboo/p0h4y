A hightech screening tool for cervical cancer is facing pushback from more than a dozen patient groups who warn that the genetic test could displace a simpler cheaper and more established mainstay of womens health the Pap smear The new test from Roche uses DNA to detect the human papillomavirus or HPV which causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer While such technology has been available for years   as a firstchoice option for cervical cancer screening bypassing the decadesold Pap test But a number of womens groups  including the American Medical Womens Association and Our Bodies Ourselves  warn that moving to a DNAbased testing model would be a radical shift in medical practice that could lead to confusion higher costs and overtreatment It replaces a safe and effective wellestablished screening tool and regimen that has prevented cervical cancer successfully in the US with a new tool and regimen not proven to work in a large US population state the groups in a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg The letter dated Monday is signed by  patient advocacy groups including Consumers Union the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund and the National Alliance for Hispanic Health Chief among the advocates concerns is that HPVonly testing could lead to overtreatment of younger women who carry the virus but have little risk of developing actual cancer Most sexually active young people will contract HPV though their bodies usually eliminate the virus within a few months Only yearslong infections develop into cancer Unfortunately the HPV test by itself isnt very useful because so many young women have HPV that will disappear without any treatment said Diana Zuckerman of the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund Having an HPV test without also getting a Pap smear to check for problems is going to scare a lot of women who are not developing cervical cancer An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on the letter since it deals with a product under review
