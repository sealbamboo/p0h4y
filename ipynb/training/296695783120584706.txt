 Binge drinking isnt just for college students anymore Once this juvenile habit is all grown up it has   possibly including type  diabetes researchers from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine report in the journal   The reason for the link between binge drinking and diabetes Overconsumption of alcohol might disrupt the brains regulation of glucose or sugar which over time can lead to type  diabetes When rats in the study were given large daily doses of ethanol to simulate binge drinking they eventually became insulin resistant  an important marker for type  diabetes because insulin resistance prevents the hormone from properly regulating blood glucose levels In addition to diabetes elevated blood sugar levels can cause all sorts of   including heart disease dementia blindness and stroke largely due to neurological damage The authors of the study discovered that binge drinking causes insulin resistance by disrupting insulin receptor signaling in the brain This suggests that alcohol might impair metabolism through neurotoxic effects on the brain rather than by damaging the liver researchers say Binge drinking is defined as five drinks for males or four for females within a twohour time span About  percent of the alcohol consumed by underage people in the United States is in the form of binge drinking Yet  percent of    involve adults older than  researchers write in the paper Frequent binge drinking has previously been linked to an increased risk for alcohol addiction risky sexual behavior and chronic conditions such as heart disease and hypertension While binge drinking used to be more common for males than for females more girls and women report binge drinking at least three times a month than ever before a recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed One in five female high school students and one in eight young women commonly binge drink the CDC found  with men and boys drinking at about equal rates A separate CDC report found that while drinkers under  drink the most    nearly six times a month on average While men and women are drinking at nearly equally rates men still face more severe consequences after bingedrinking episodes Men have higher rates of alcoholrelated deaths and hospitalizations than women and men are also twice as likely to be involved in fatal drunkdriving accidents In the wake of the most recent study researchers call for further research into the mechanisms by which alcohol triggers diabetes risk
