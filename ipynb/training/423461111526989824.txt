 Chelsea Therapeutics International Ltd.'s lead product candidate Northera received strong support from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel, raising prospects the blood-pressure drug will receive approval from regulators. . The FDA had rejected Northera in March 2012 and asked Chelsea for more efficacy data on the medication. It accepted the resubmitted application in September, after more than a year of delays in the company's effort to bring its first treatment to market.
