Unmet needs a term gerontologists use refers to care or help you require but dont get If when youre elderly or disabled you arent able to shop or cook you lack the strength to go outside you cant keep track of your bank account or your medications  and no one assists you with those functions  you have unmet needs Older people who move into assisted living and other forms of supportive housing are primarily seeking ways to reduce unmet needs Occasionally someone moves because he feels lonely or she is trying not to burden her children But usually people stay in their homes as long as they can until unmet needs pile up What I have frequently wondered  and Im sure lots of you have too  is how often those supposed solutions actually provide enough services to merit their very high price tags When someone is spending  a month for assisted living  the national median according to Genworths annual survey  are there fewer activities the resident cant manage Does he or she have fewer unmet needs  A   sheds some light on this so lets take a look  The study uses data from the  National Health and Aging Trends Study and pays particular attention to more than  Medicare beneficiaries over  who reported having difficulty with daily activities or received help with them but did not live in nursing homes    The great majority  percent still occupied traditional community housing their own apartments homes or condos in line with national statistics Almost  percent lived in retirement communities or senior housing complexes that didnt offer much in the way of services Another  percent were in independent living facilities and  percent in assisted living  In interviews they were asked about things they had to go without in the past month because they didnt have the help they needed or it was too difficult to do those things on their own said the coauthor Vicki Freedman research professor at the University of Michigans Institute for Social Research  She and her coauthor Brenda Spillman of the Urban Institute measured what resulted having to stay in bed not being able to leave their homes or buildings going without eating not being able to get cleaned up a variety of consequences Dr Freedman said Both authors have investigated aging issues for years yet what surprised us was the sheer amount of unmet needs Dr Freedman told me The numbers are unsettling Of those who had difficulty or received help about  percent of those in traditional housing reported having unmet needs in the past month But so did  percent of those in retirement or senior housing who were significantly more likely than community residents to have gone without hot meals to have been unable to do laundry or go shopping to bathe or to go outdoors In assisted living where meals and laundry are typically among the services provided the rates increased still further  percent reported a consequence in the past month The biggest problem  Residents were significantly more likely than community dwellers to be unable to get to a bathroom promptly One in five assisted living residents reported being unable to use a toilet before soiling or wetting themselves The data showed no significant difference in unmet needs between community dwellers and those in independent living So on the face of it this looks as though moving out of your house and into a retirement community or assisted living facility doesnt do much for you Unmet needs are actually more prevalent there  But that ignores the fact that the people living in these various places are different The study collected information on age health and physical and cognitive function and confirms what we might expect Assisted living facilities serve a clientele thats older more frail more likely to have dementia Dr Freedman said When the researchers controlled for those variables the differences in unmet needs pretty much evaporated That is people in senior housing and in assisted living didnt report significantly more unmet needs or negative consequences over all than those living in their own homes  In fact after those adjustments people in assisted living were less likely than community dwellers to have negative consequences like not going outdoors not moving around indoors not getting dressed or managing medications  Theyre less likely to have unmet needs Dr Freedman said Someone is helping them  Which looks like a classic good newsbad news finding On the one hand seniors and families are getting something for that  a month and more frequently way more in assisted living Even though they are older and more physically and cognitively impaired they dont have more unmet needs than younger healthier seniors in their own homes   The bad news though is that unmet needs remain too high in all these settings In their own homes in senior housing and retirement communities in assisted living lots of people arent getting the help they manifestly need
