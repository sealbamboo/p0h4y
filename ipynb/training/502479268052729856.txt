Their recoveries seem to offer hope for those fighting the largest Ebola outbreak in known history More than  people have been infected by the virus according to the World Health Organization and its killed more than half  But ZMapp is not an approved treatment for Ebola in fact no approved proven treatment exists So governments aid organizations and scientists around the globe   to find a way to stop the virus Here are answers to questions about Ebola patients and treatments for the disease  Mostly For Ebola patients to leave isolation two blood tests had to come back negative for the Ebola virus So their bodily fluids like blood sweat and feces are no longer infectious Nancy is free of the virus but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition Writebols husband David Writebol said in a statement  Some doctors believe the virus can remain in vaginal fluid and semen for up to several months according to WHO Dr Bruce Ribner an infectious disease specialist at Emory said there is no evidence Ebola has ever been transmitted this way but the risk was discussed with both patients Doctors believe surviving Ebola leaves you immune to future infection Scientists have found that people who survive Ebola have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future and possibly against other strains as well  But as you can imagine they havent tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again  There are four Ebola strains known to infect humans the Zaire ebolavirus causing the current outbreak is the most common  The Ebola drug was flown to Spain to give to a priest named Miguel Pajares who had contracted the virus in Liberia Pajares died on August  Its unclear if he was given the drug before he died ZMapp appears to be helping three Liberian health care workers who were given the experimental drug They have shown very positive signs of recovery the Liberian Ministry of Health   Medical professionals treating the workers have called their progress remarkable The drug was developed by the biotech firm   which is based in San Diego The company was founded in  to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense    Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction to develop an Ebola treatment for several years Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign or harmful cells A monoclonal antibody is similar except its engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell   mimicking your immune systems natural response Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions Sources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a threemouse monoclonal antibody meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mices blood were harvested to create the medicine  However the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro provided limited quantities of this kind of the drug to Emory according to company spokesman David Howard  No The drug had shown promise in primates but even in those experiments just eight monkeys received the treatment In any case the human immune system can react differently than primates which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use  These cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems  Several experimental drugs are in development but none has been effective in humans The market for these drugs is small  Ebola is a rare disease almost completely confined to poor countries  so funding for drug development has come largely from government agencies  In March the NIH   to establish a collaboration between researchers from  institutions who were working to fight Ebola On Wednesday Wellcome Trust and the United Kingdoms Department for International Development announced money for Ebola research will be made available from a   An ethics panel convened by the World Health Organization concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one but that doesnt mean it will happen  Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult Doctors Without Borders says Experimental drugs typically are not massproduced and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce In an opinion article published in the journal Nature this week epidemiologist Oliver Brady says   in West Africa would have so far required treatment in this outbreak if it was available For the record vaccine and treatment are not interchangeable terms A vaccine is given to prevent infection whereas treatment generally refers to a drug given to a patient who has developed symptoms There are several Ebola vaccines in development The Canadian government has donated between  and  doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO The drug called VSVEBOV is Canadianmade and owned having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory Its never been tested on humans but has shown promise in animal research the agency says We dont know if the vaccine has been given to anyone on the ground The   of an Ebola vaccine will start as early as September
