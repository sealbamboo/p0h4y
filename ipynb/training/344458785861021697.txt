For decades dentists have urged all adults to schedule preventive visits every six months But a new study finds that annual cleanings may be adequate for adults without certain risk factors for periodontal disease while people with a high risk may need to go more often  have a form of chronic inflammatory gum disease that can ultimately lead to tooth loss   published on Monday in The Journal of Dental Research suggests that the frequency of dental visits for cleanings and other preventive services should be tailored to each persons risk factors for periodontal disease The findings suggest that for lowrisk patients a yearly prophylactic visit does prevent tooth loss over a protracted period of  years and theres no significant difference in an added visit said Dr Robert J Genco a periodontist and SUNY distinguished professor of oral biology at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the study They found if you had more than one risk factor that maybe two visits isnt optimal Prevention reduces tooth loss but there has been   The new study looked at insurance claims data for  adults primarily in Michigan to determine whether tooth extraction was linked to a previous history of one or two dental visits a year in patients with varying risks for periodontal disease The subjects were classified as high risk if they smoked or had diabetes or certain variations in the   gene which some studies have suggested may be linked to periodontal disease in white people Subjects were deemed low risk if they had none of these risks Researchers found no statistical difference in tooth loss among lowrisk patients whether they went for a checkup once or twice a year But in the highrisk group roughly  percent of patients who had had two visits a year had a tooth extracted compared with roughly  percent of those who had had just one a year The researchers said that even two visits a year might not suffice to reduce tooth loss in patients with multiple risk factors If you are high risk it is much more important for you to be seen frequently but for the lowrisk people its not said Dr William V Giannobile the studys lead author and the chairman of the department of periodontics at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry The takeaway is not that you dont need to see the dentist its that each patient needs to be treated in their own individual way he added Two authors of the study own shares in Interleukin Genetics the company that makes the genotype test for interleukin The company helped finance the study along with the National Institutes of Health Dr Genco called the paper a major advance in using risk profiles to tailormake a preventive regimen But Dr Ray C Williams a periodontist and the dean of the School of Dental Medicine at Stony Brook University faulted the study for not directly addressing the subjects oral hygiene a significant factor in tooth loss Nonetheless he praised the research because it sounds the signal that it is time to make dentistry more individual and more personalized and added We ought to be able to tailor the treatment to the need Dr Paul Beirne the lead author of a   and a dentist said that no conclusions could be drawn from the new study about the optimal frequency of dental visits for cavity management because risk factors for tooth decay were not addressed The findings are not applicable to children he noted Of the more than  adults invited to participate roughly  percent returned cheek swabs for the genetic test It is not known if there are systematic differences between those who participated and those who declined so results should be interpreted cautiously he said Still the new study provides evidence that a one size fits all preventive regimen is inappropriate said Dr Beirne a lecturer in epidemiology at University College Cork in Ireland
