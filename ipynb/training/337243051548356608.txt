Id like to bring you up to speed on whats going on the doctor said He had a red goatee and was wearing a white coat He said that my father had pneumonia and needed a breathing machine and that he also had sepsis and acute lung injury The statistics are not too good he said solemnly Around  percent of people who are just like him will die from this I felt anxious even though this doctor was actually an actor in a video simulation devised by University of Pittsburgh researchers to see   The situation he described is common in ICUs and not so different from what I confronted when my father actually went to an emergency room last winter The doctor eventually asked whether as my relatives surrogate I wanted the staff to perform CPR if his heart stopped He pointed out that only about  percent of such patients receiving CPR would survive Its a very vulnerable time said Amber Barnato the preventive medicine specialist who helped develop the experiment A turn of phrase by a doctor can make a lot of difference Dr Barnatos study just published in the journal Critical Care Medicine drew my interest because of one of those phrases   Both she and I had read the same article in a nursing journal a few years ago proposing to substitute this wording for do not resuscitate The author a nursing educator had found that medical professionals liked the new wording But what about family members faced with the decision Would they be more likely to consent to or decline CPR depending on whether the medical order was do not resuscitate versus allow natural death Dr Barnato proposed to find out Brief digression Its interesting how often a particular patient vividly remembered sparks a researchers efforts When she was an intern Dr Barnato told me a woman in her s suffering from a serious stroke and sepsis communicated  by writing and blinking  that she wanted to be removed from a ventilator Instead the woman got a psychiatric evaluation Prozac and eventually bilateral chest tubes a feeding tube and a tracheostomy before being moved to a longterm care facility Interns dont have much authority in such cases but Dr Barnato feeling morally distressed embarked on  years of research into endoflife practices The video simulation I saw was viewed by  people a nonrandom sample of volunteers from eight cities average age  who actually were designated health care surrogates for parents or spouses In this hypothetical case they listened to the doctor say various things then decided CPR Or DNR Most agreed to CPR despite low odds of survival  percent was the average Some manipulations had little effect on that decision Being emotionally aroused  by a photo of a loved one and an exercise designed to prompt memories of him or her  didnt make participants more or less likely to choose CPR Nor did sympathetic expressions from the doctor In some simulations he said things like This must feel really overwhelming to have everything happen so suddenly It didnt significantly change decisions Nor to Dr Barnatos surprise did framing the decision as what the patient would want as opposed to what the surrogate wanted So what did make a difference Two factors  What other people reportedly chose When the guy in the white coat says that in his experience most people want CPR  percent of surrogates said yes to it When he says that most people dont want it the proportion dropped to  percent A person who is acting with very little knowledge might think Those other people know something Dr Barnato theorized The standard choice is what people will choose Thats whats normal  The phrase allow a natural death Even though they mean the same thing in this experiment when the fake doctor framed the option as do not resuscitate  percent asked that CPR be performed But only  percent of participants wanted CPR when asked if the staff should allow a natural death It sounds kinder and gentler Dr Barnato said By contrast DNR suggests withholding or relinquishing the feeling of not getting something Besides we like natural things she added As many commenters pointed out the last time we discussed this the phrase may be too vague for physicians comfort They want specifics and   more effectively than allow a natural death But family members Based on this first small experiment they like the sound of it
