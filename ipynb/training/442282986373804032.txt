At lunchtime on the North Harris campus of Houstons   Community College students stream through the lobby of the student services center plugged into their headphones or rushing to class Many walk right past a small information table about the Affordable Care Act The table is the brainchild of   a health and fitness professor at Lone Star She knows that young people may be key to the success of Obamacare The insurance plans need a mix of ages and a mix of healthy and sick people to balance out the costs for everyone  and young people tend to be healthier But many young people are confused about how to sign up Others feel like they cant afford insurance and dont realize there are subsidies available that could help them Just getting overworked students to stop and learn about the law Franks says is tough If you say Obamacare they know what youre saying If you say Affordable Care Act they walk by without any ding ding ding of recognition she says So then we throw out the word penalty Zoom Theyve  before Penalty That really tends to be a hook more than Gee you really need health care  Franks says many students at Lone Star are lowincome They often work Some have families to support Others struggle to find gas money to even get to class I still think so many of them are in survival mode Health insurance Really You know Ive got to get to work  she says She could be talking about Adan Castillo Hes  and hoping for a career in law enforcement or maybe the Marines In addition to his classes he also works Castillo actually used to be insured He paid his parents  a month to keep him on their health plan But he says it just felt like throwing money away I just stopped giving it to them he says There are other important things I have to do like paying for my college books classes  gas Gas is expensive nowadays But Adans girlfriend Leslie Gonzalez says insurance is important Shes an accounting student Well he needs it Gonzalez says Because what if  lets say he doesnt have it right now and he gets in an accident Hes going to have to pay everything out of pocket and what if he doesnt have it Gonzalez works part time as a bank teller She says she will sign up for insurance at work as soon as she is eligible The stereotype about young people is that they think theyre invincible that they dont need insurance because theyre young and nothing bad will happen to them for years But most young adults dont actually think that way Two recent surveys   from the Kaiser Family Foundation and   from the Commonwealth Fund reveal that cost is the real issue Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation Young people   health insurance is expensive and they assume they cant afford it Often they simply dont know about the subsidized plans offered under the law or how to get them Taylor Castille is a nursing student in her second year at Lone Star She has logged on to   but says her first visit didnt go very well I finally got on the website the other day Castille explains and it was kind of confusing to me because I didnt understand  if I would have to pay what would I pay what Im not paying It was really confusing and I got stressed out all over again just looking at that So I just left the site and didnt even bother to go back Castille still wants health coverage Last fall she suffered a series of fainting spells and seizures After a few visits to a hospital emergency room she now has  in medical debt And she still doesnt have a diagnosis I have all this debt  and Im  she says I havent bought a car I havent done anything I dont have the debt because I was being irresponsible I have the debt because I was sick And I couldnt control that so now Im stuck with that Castille later visited the campus information table and got a flier on how to sign up for a health plan So far only about  percent of adults who have signed up are younger than  The federal government is   to nudge that proportion closer to  percent The deadline to enroll  for all ages  is March
