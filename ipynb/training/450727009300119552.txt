A deceptively simple leg brace is changing the lives of hundreds of wounded service members Soldiers with badly injured legs who thought theyd have to live with terrible pain can walk and run again painfree Earlier this month Army Spc Joey McElroy took his first steps in the Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis or IDEO pronounced eyeDAYoh The device squeaked a bit as he stepped briskly on an indoor track McElroy was hit by a car and thrown from his motorcycle on Dec   I knew that when I looked down there was bones comin out of the leg that didnt look correct And my leg didnt work he says Doctors were able to save McElroys mangled leg but he had to learn how to walk again Running was out of the question You dont realize how much you miss something til you dont have it anymore he says The ability to be able to run again for my own health is a very big deal McElroy is known as a limb salvage patient since he avoided amputation Physical therapists say some patients like McElroy later decide they would be better off without the leg when see their amputee buddies running around easily on prostheses For a while there I was like Just get rid of it If I can be on a prosthetic in a week or two and be running just lop it off McElroy says But with the IDEO brace Now Im glad its here The brace which was developed at the Center for the Intrepid at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio is molded out of lightweight black carbon fiber and customfit to each person A foot plate inside a shoe attaches to a strut that runs up the back of the calf to a cuff The inventor prosthetist Ryan Blanck says it works kind of like a spring Force applied to the foot plate bends the strut As a person steps down it bends the foot plate transferring energy forward And if you use it correctly it takes pain out of the equation The biggest challenge with the IDEO comes in relearning how to run A patient cant land on toes or heel  instead they have to adjust their stride to hit midfoot After trying to run for the first time McElroy breathes heavily but is all smiles Its exhausting but its awesome he says I just wanna go faster So far the Center for the Intrepid has fitted more than  service members with the IDEO  an orthopedic surgeon and director of the center says the IDEO has made for less business in the operating room  and thats a good thing Its great to have a bunch of people around here who I dont know their names Gajewski says Because if Im getting involved with their care Im taking a limb off Gajewski admits the IDEO is not right for everyone Some patients still have pain with it so they opt for an amputation But for most the orthotic device has allowed them keep their leg Some have gone on to run marathons surf and jump out of airplanes About  percent of IDEO users will return to active duty Blanck the inventor is now working in the private sector to bring the device to civilians It costs around  At the Center for the Intrepid theres a waiting list of two to three months
