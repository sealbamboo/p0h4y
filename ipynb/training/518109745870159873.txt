When nine children in one hospital in Colorado come down with a mysterious form of paralysis in less than two months its hard not to worry Colorado has been   by enterovirus D a virus that has caused severe respiratory illnesses in children around the country over the past few months All of the children had had been ill within a few weeks of suffering weakness in their arms or legs a drooping face or difficulty swallowing But just four tested positive for EVD according to a  published Friday in   So its not certain that the enterovirus is whats causing the paralysis Theres the association says   clinical director for the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke and a member of the American Academy of Neurology Now the issue is whats the causation To find out if the virus is indeed causing the weakness it would need to be found in the childrens spinal fluid Nath told Shots So far its been found only in their noses Still the possibility that this virus may be doing something is certainly worthy of consideration The association between paralysis or muscle weakness and EVD first cropped up in California in August  when a yearold man with sudden paralysis was referred for testing for the virus that causes   Thats also an enterovirus He didnt test positive for polio or any other enterovirus there are upwards of  Since then  other cases of acute flaccid paralysis of unknown origin have been reported in California almost all of them in children Most of the children had an upperrespiratory infection or stomach bug shortly before Two of the patients had EV in their noses according to a   also published Friday in   Still hearing that paralysis is even just associated with upperrespiratory infections in children is enough to make any parent nervous But these cases are quite rare Nath says There are a lot of respiratory infections even with this same virus and the paralysis occurs in a very very few Enterovirus D is itself a bit of a mystery Until this year   only rarely caused illness in the United States Public health types dont know why its suddenly making many children ill Some have developed breathing problems and required hospitalization Many of those children have asthma or wheezing Eight Colorado children diagnosed with paralysis are still having problems with weakness according to the   report There is no vaccine or antiviral medication for EVD But if a child does appear to have muscle weakness its important to take them to a pediatrician or neurologist right away Nath says This sort of paralysis can be caused by a number of things including   and   And even though polio no longer exists in the United States the MMWR report says that doctors should always test to see if a child with symptoms has been vaccinated against polio because its still endemic in parts of Africa and Asia The mystery of these new cases of paralysis and whether they are indeed related to EVD wont be solved until doctors have a clearer sense of the symptoms and how the virus might cause them If it does prove to be the cause then someone would need to develop a drug to slow it or a vaccine to stop it No small order Youve got to start somewhere Nath says
