Thirty or so attendees at St Mary Primitive Baptist Church in Tallahassee Fla gathered on a recent evening to hear a presentation by the Obamacare Enrollment Team on their options to get insurance under the Affordable Care Act If anybody is interested in getting enrolled we can get you enrolled tonight they were told Signs outside the church looked official A familiar large O with a blue outline white center and three red stripes But the presenters Pastor HB Holmes and Katrina Copeland are not part of the federal government nor are they credentialed by the federal government to be   Im a registered lobbyist with the Senate and House so I dont have to have a navigator license Copeland said I have my credentials from the US Senate and House of Representatives Actually she   have to be licensed Real navigators and certified application counselors have received federal approval to impartially assist people in signing up for insurance through HealthCaregov the federal website where people are supposed to be able to browse all the plans available figure out what subsidies they might qualify for or if they qualify for Medicaid and apply for coverage with a private insurer The Obamacare Enrollment Team didnt mention HealthCaregov during their presentation at St Mary Instead they offered a narrower choice of plans than consumers can find on the federal site In fact Copeland and Holmes work for health insurance agencies and agents specifically the Fiorella Insurance Agency in Stuart Fla The agencys vice president Nick Fiorella runs Obamacare Enrollment Teams in various states  particularly in urban communities where we feel there is a lot of misinformation and education that needs to be done in order to inform individuals of their health insurance options in regard to health care reform he says After questioning Holmes reluctantly acknowledged that he and Copeland werent working directly with HealthCaregov and were instead marketing for specific insurers including Florida Blue and Humana What the Fiorella insurance agents   licensed and authorized to do is to sell insurance to consumers Florida Blue officials did not return a request for comment and Humana officials declined to be interviewed However in a statement company spokesman Mitch Lubitz confirmed Humana does business with Fiorellas agency but that Humana does not endorse nor participate in Fiorellas health reform or Affordable Care Act seminars Other insurance agents trying to navigate the new health insurance market see the Obamacare Enrollment Teams as giving their industry a bad rap Transparency has to be at the forefront because  theres a void of education says Bart Gunter executive vice president of Rogers Gunter Vaughn Insurance company in Tallahassee People are vulnerable When people dont know the darker side kinda comes in and takes advantage of that When asked about the similarity of the Teams promotional materials to the Obama campaign logo Fiorella said Whenever were made aware of materials that are not approved we make our best efforts to get those materials out of circulation As of now the familiar symbol is gone from the Enrollment Team   Several attendees at the St Mary church event who did not want to be identified or directly quoted said they were worried about the lack of transparency but were grateful the Obamacare Enrollment Team had come into their community  and openly questioned why the federal governments own navigators and counselors werent present The US Department of Health and Human Services didnt comment for this story but in a statement a spokeswoman says allegations of fraud are taken seriously A complaint against the Obamacare Enrollment Team has been filed in Illinois regarding the groups website but it was cleared of any wrongdoing Consumers also have   in Michigan too where people say they were led to believe the group is affiliated with the federal government Another complaint was filed   and now state regulators there are looking into the groups activities as well
