DNA testing can predict which men face the highest risk of deadly prostate cancer scientists say The team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London say men could soon be offered genetic screening in a similar way to breast cancer in women They have shown  separate mutations can greatly increase the odds of aggressive prostate cancers which could form the basis of a test Prostate Cancer UK said such testing could revolutionise care for men Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men in many countries including the UK  where more than  people are diagnosed each year  But not every patient has or needs invasive therapy that results in severe sideeffects Identifying which men will need treatment  those who are likely to develop the most aggressive and deadly form of the cancer  is a huge challenge The researchers took blood samples from  men with prostate cancer and at least three close family members with the same condition Each was tested for risky mutations  this included the BRCA genes that are involved in repairing DNA and already linked to breast and ovarian cancers The results published in the British Journal of Cancer show that  of the men had one of  highrisk mutations  The researchers said that it was also these men who had the aggressive prostate cancer that had started to spread around the body One of the researchers Dr Zsofia KoteJarai told the BBC I can see in two to three years offering screening to men with prostate cancer and to men worried about their family history However she said it was unlikely these men would immediately opt to have their prostate removed  Many women with a high risk of breast cancer for example Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie opt to have their breast tissue removed A mastectomy is removing an organ we dont really need and there is excellent plastic surgery afterwards Radical prostatectomy has really big sideeffects It is more likely men will be monitored more closely The sideeffects include infertility difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urination However the screening is not ready yet The research group is already running a larger trial involving  men and testing  genes Dr Iain Frame the director of research at the charity Prostate Cancer UK said We urgently need to understand more about which men are at risk of developing prostate cancer and in particular aggressive forms of the disease  Genetic testing to predict risk could revolutionise how we treat the  men diagnosed with the disease every year in the UK  These results are exciting as they add to the growing weight of evidence that men with a family history of prostate cancer who possess certain genes may be at higher risk providing us with another crucial piece of the jigsaw
