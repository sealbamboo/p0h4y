he autumn statement just a week ago confirmed the genius of NHS boss Simon Stevens   Swiftly subtitled by the media as   it has framed the debate about the future of the health service since it was published in October Its crisp clear sensible and more or less achievable solutions make it hard for politicians to duck and weave around the more money question But it doesnt settle the issue Defining the problem and describing how it might be tackled is one thing Making it happen is quite another It would be a mistake to imagine the crisis is over Without the Forward View you can bet George Osborne would not have trailed the bn a year he pledged in the Commons last Wednesday As it happens   since m was recycled from elsewhere in the health budget But even if it were a pot of allnew money it is not clear that it would be enough to meet the familiar pressures of an aging population with multiple health problems and the costly demands of new technology At least on the Osborne projection the new cash would be onstream immediately Labour plans to meet the cost of its pledge of   which would not be in place until halfway through the next parliament The Lib Dems promise just bn and want the catastrophically inadequate funding for mental health to take priority The gritty awkward detail and the political commitment to the NHS rarely seem to match Even the Stevens report treads lightly on some of the difficulties None of the independent health thinktanks believe that the  efficiency savings on which the sums depend can really be delivered The   reckons half that would be a more realistic assessment According to the Forward View best forecast a realterms increase of  a year would set the NHS back on its feet Hmm With the new money next year it will have had a  increase And no one thinks it will be alright The acute hospital sector is teetering on the edge of viability condemned as   The last five years of efficiency savings have been achieved partly by clamping down on NHS pay But that is unsustainable and it has worsened the shortage of nurses The perverse effect of it has been to inflate the bill for agency staff which has soared from bn to bn in a single year Social care budgets beyond NHS control but exacerbating pressure on it have been cut by  since  Just propping up this fragile edifice could easily take all the new cash available without beginning to tackle the transformation thats needed to make the NHS more efficient and more effective At least healthcare will get more money whoever wins the election But it cannot all go to patch up the existing service   Another m a year will be used to modernise primary care  bn over four years  and some of the remainder will be saved as an emergency fund to bail out floundering hospitals and commissioning groups That means   Only this time each year will be worse than the last On current projections the  years from  will be the most austere decade the NHS has ever endured Everyone can see this coming but no one is admitting what needs to be done That needs a tangible commitment to developing new systems and running them in parallel with existing ones in order to save in the longer term Instead we are getting what amounts to a political bung to keep healthcare out of the headlines and down the political agenda Failing to address the real problems can only erode public confidence  and strengthen the hand in the longterm of the politicians who for ideological reasons still view as incomprehensible the principle of a national health service
