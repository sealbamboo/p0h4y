Everyone gets nervous or anxious from time to timewhen speaking in public for instance or when going through financial difficulty For some people however anxiety becomes so frequent or so forceful that it begins to take over their lives How can you tell if your everyday anxiety has crossed the line into a disorder Its not easy Anxiety comes in many different formssuch as panic attacks phobia and social anxietyand the distinction between an official diagnosis and normal anxiety isnt always clear Heres a start If you experience any of the following symptoms on a regular basis you may want to talk with your doctor The hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder GADthe broadest type of anxietyis worrying too much about everyday things large and small But what constitutes too much In the case of GAD it means having persistent anxious thoughts on most days of the week for six months Also the anxiety must be so bad that it interferes with daily life and is accompanied by noticeable symptoms such as fatigue The distinction between an anxiety disorder and just having normal anxiety is whether your emotions are causing a lot of suffering and dysfunction says Sally Winston PsyD codirector of the Anxiety and Stress Disorder Institute of Maryland in Towson Trouble   or   is associated with a wide range of health conditions both physical and psychological And of course its not unusual to toss and turn with anticipation on the night before a big speech or job interview But if you chronically find yourself lying awake worried or agitatedabout specific problems like money or nothing in particularit might be a sign of an anxiety disorder By some estimates fully half of all people with GAD experience   Another tipoff that anxiety might be involved You wake up feeling wired your mind is racing and youre unable to calm yourself down Some anxiety isnt generalized at all on the contrary its attached to a specific situation or thinglike flying animals or crowds If the fear becomes overwhelming disruptive and way out of proportion to the actual risk involved its a telltale sign of phobia a type of anxiety disorder Although phobias can be crippling theyre not obvious at all times In fact they may not surface until you confront a specific situation and discover youre incapable of overcoming your fear A person whos afraid of snakes can go for years without having a problem Winston says But then suddenly their kid wants to go camping and they realize they need treatment Nearconstant muscle tensionwhether it consists of clenching your jaw balling your fists or flexing muscles throughout your bodyoften accompanies anxiety disorders This symptom can be so persistent and pervasive that people who have lived with it for a long time may stop noticing it after a while Regular exercise can help keep muscle tension under control but the tension may flare up if an injury or other unforeseen event disrupts a persons workout habits Winston says Suddenly theyre a wreck because they cant handle their anxiety in that way and now theyre incredibly restless and irritable Anxiety may start in the mind but it often manifests itself in the body through physical symptoms like chronic digestive problems   IBS a condition characterized by stomachaches cramping bloating gas constipation andor diarrhea is basically an anxiety in the digestive tract Winston says 
                  IBS isnt always related to anxiety but the two often occur together and can make each other worse The gut is very sensitive to psychological stressand vice versa the physical and social discomfort of chronic digestive problems can make a person feel more anxious Most people get at least a few butterflies before addressing a group of people or otherwise being in the spotlight But if the fear is so strong that no amount of coaching or practice will alleviate it or if you spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about it you may have a form of social anxiety disorder also known as social phobia People with social anxiety tend to worry for days or weeks leading up to a particular event or situation And if they do manage to go through with it they tend to be deeply uncomfortable and may dwell on it for a long time afterward wondering how they were judged Social anxiety disorder doesnt always involve speaking to a crowd or being the center of attention In most cases the anxiety is provoked by everyday situations such as making oneonone conversation at a party or eating and drinking in front of even a small number of people In these situations people with social anxiety disorder tend to feel like all eyes are on them and they often experience blushing trembling nausea profuse sweating or difficulty talking These symptoms can be so disruptive that they make it hard to meet new people maintain relationships and advance at work or in school  can be terrifying Picture a sudden gripping feeling of fear and helplessness that can last for several minutes accompanied by scary physical symptoms such as breathing problems a pounding or racing heart tingling or numb hands sweating weakness or dizziness chest pain stomach pain and feeling hot or cold Not everyone who has a panic attack has an anxiety disorder but people who experience them repeatedly may be diagnosed with panic disorder People with panic disorder live in fear about when where and why their next attack might happen and they tend to avoid places where attacks have occurred in the past Reliving a disturbing or traumatic eventa violent encounter the sudden death of a loved oneis a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD which shares some features with anxiety disorders Until very recently in fact PTSD was seen as a type of anxiety disorder rather than a standalone condition But flashbacks may occur with other types of anxiety as well Some research including a    in the   suggests that some people with social anxiety have PTSDlike flashbacks of experiences that might not seem obviously traumatic such as being publicly ridiculed These people may even avoid reminders of the experienceanother symptom reminiscent of PTSD The finicky and obsessive mindset known as perfectionism goes hand in hand with anxiety disorders Winston says If you are constantly judging yourself or you have a lot of anticipatory anxiety about making mistakes or falling short of your standards then you probably have an anxiety disorder Perfectionism is especially common in obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD which like PTSD has long been viewed as an anxiety disorder OCD can happen subtly like in the case of somebody who cant get out of the house for three hours because their makeup has to be absolutely just right and they have to keep starting over Winston says In order to be diagnosed with obsessivecompulsive disorder a persons obsessiveness and intrusive thoughts must be accompanied by compulsive behavior whether its mental telling yourself   over and over again or physical handwashing straightening items Obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior become a fullblown disorder when the need to complete the behaviorsalso known as ritualsbegins to drive your life Winston says If you like your radio at volume level  for example and it breaks and gets stuck on  would you be in a total panic until you could get it fixed Persistent selfdoubt and secondguessing is a common feature of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder and OCD In some cases the doubt may revolve around a question thats central to a persons identity like What if Im gay or Do I love my husband as much as he loves me In OCD Winston says these doubt attacks are especially common when a question is unanswerable People with OCD think If only I would know  for sure whether I was gay or straight either one would be fine but they have this intolerance for uncertainty that turns the question into an obsession she says
