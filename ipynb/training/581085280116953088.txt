Surgeons in Cambridgeshire have performed the first heart transplant in Europe using a nonbeating heart  Donor hearts are usually from people who are brainstem dead but whose hearts are still beating   In this case the organ came from a donor after their heart and lungs had stopped functioning socalled circulatory death Papworth hospital says the technique could increase the number of hearts available by at least  The recipient Huseyin Ulucan  from London had a heart attack in  He said Before the surgery I could barely walk and I got out of breath very easily I really had no quality of life He said he was delighted with the improvement in health since the transplant  Now Im feeling stronger every day and I walked into the hospital this morning without any problem he said There have been  heart transplant in the past  months in the UK But demand exceeds supply and some patients have to wait up to three years for a suitable organ  Many patients die before an organ becomes available Nonbeatingheart donors provide kidneys livers and other organs but until now it has not been possible to use the heart because of concerns it would suffer damage The new procedure involved restarting the heart in the donor five minutes after death and perfusing it and other vital organs with blood and nutrients at body temperature The lead transplant surgeon Stephen Large said We had the heart beating for about  minutes and by monitoring its function were able to tell that it was in very good condition The organ was then removed and transferred to   machine where it was kept nourished and beating for a further three hours before the transplant surgery at Papworth The organ care system is also used for maintaining lung liver and kidneys outside the body The standard method for transporting hearts and other organs for transplant is to pack them in ice but some organs can be damaged by this process The Papworth team said that restoring the heartbeat after death and keeping the organ nourished had helped reduce damage in the heart muscle The first heart transplants in the s used organs from nonbeating heart donors but the technique was abandoned because they deteriorated too quickly Last year surgeons in Australia performed the worlds first transplant using a nonbeating heart supported by the innovative heartinabox technology TransMedics the US company that makes the organ care machine said each unit cost  plus  per patient transplanted    Papworth and Harefield hospitals are the only two heart transplant units in the UK who use the device Prof James Neuberger associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant said Sadly there is a shortage of organs for transplant across the UK and patients die in need of an organ  We hope Papworths work and similar work being developed elsewhere will result in more hearts being donated and more patients benefiting from a transplant in the future We are immensely grateful to the donors family and we hope they are taking great comfort in knowing that their relatives organs have saved lives and have also made an important contribution to heart transplantation in the UK
