Dogs can sniff out prostate cancer with uncanny accuracy Italian researchers reported on Sunday While its not a test that is ready for prime time the findings suggest quick and accurate new ways to screen for the disease which kills  US men every year And the report joins a growing list of studies showing that dogs can smell the byproducts of various types of cancer These dogs were really able to detect these particular compounds with a high degree of accuracy said Dr Stacy Loeb of New York University a urologist who was not involved in the study Gianluigi Taverna of Humanitas Research Hospital in Milan and colleagues took urine samples from  men with prostate cancer and  without it The men with cancer had all different stages of the disease from very lowrisk slowgrowing tumors to cancer that had spread Some of the men in the nonprostatecancer group had other diseases or conditions including other types of cancer One of the dogs detected every single prostate cancer case and only hit false positives  when it identified cancer when it wasnt there  in  percent of cases The other dog was almost as accurate Taken together the two dogs had an accuracy rate of  percent the team reported to the annual meeting of the American Urological Association Sunday We have definitely turned what used to seem a myth into a real clinical opportunity they wrote These data show analysis of volatile organic compounds in urine is a promising approach to cancer detection said Dr Brian Stork a urologist at West Shore Urology in Muskegon Michigan who also was not involved in the study The possibility of using dogs identifying cancer is something most would never have considered possible a decade or two ago Its an interesting concept that mans best friend could help save your life The findings replicate a smaller study done with a single dog in France who sniffed out prostate cancer in  samples Dogs have also sniffed out   and they are being tested to see if they can detect   Loeb points out that it is far too soon to say the dogs could be put to work screening men for prostate cancer The dogs could smell compounds associated with prostate cancer she noted What the researchers dont say is how good these compounds are for predicting prostate cancer and more important for predicting aggressive prostate cancer she said Were very good at diagnosing prostate cancer she added What we really need are diagnostics that are better at helping us identify lifethreatening prostate cancer Prostate cancer  more than  US men a year Theres a debate now over whether too many men get diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer that never would have caused them any harm Thats because the disease can grow very slowly and its difficult now to predict whose cancer is slowgrowing and whose is dangerous
