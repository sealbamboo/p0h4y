The true answer is I dont know However while my answer is as uninteresting as it is brief the response it elicits time and time again never fails to fascinate me Whatever you do make sure you specialize Dont go into primary care On the surface I understand their advice Why spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on eight years of schooling only to make  as a primary care doctor when I can make almost triple that amount as a specialist and give my mom the joy of talking about her son the cardiothoracic surgeon  Still for the life of me I cannot remember the name of that neurologist I once saw when I had those annoying headaches or that endocrinologist I went to when I was afraid I was too short  Yet without hesitation Ill affectionately tell you the name of the doctor who has cared for me for the past  years Medical specialists enjoy an unparalleled prestige in this country and a paycheck to match Our health care system centers itself around specialty care and belittles the care provided by regular doctors  Primary care accounts for roughly  and yet only    Surprisingly our disproportionate investment in specialty care isnt delivering the expected results In one   investigators found that counties dominated by specialists had higher mortality rates from heart disease cancer and neonatal death than those with more primary care physicians not to mention higher surgical rates and overall health care costs Our primary care shortage is not limited to just a few counties The need is national and its consequences severe  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that  million Americans are living with at least one chronic illness accounting for more than  of all health care costs and  of annual deaths  The tragic irony is that chronic illnesses notably heart disease certain cancers and diabetes are largely preventable Maybe were so sick in this country because we prioritize treating sickness over maintaining health fixing our problems instead of preventing them Its time we realized that doctors can be our partners in health not just reversers of illness Its time we valued the heart attack that never was as much as the heart attack patient narrowly saved Its time we placed a premium on primary care As health care reform takes full force we must concern ourselves not only with how our health will be insured but with how it will be delivered  With tens of millions of Americans becoming insured for the first time we need primary care doctors now more than ever  Acknowledging this need the Affordable Care Act is testing innovative new payment mechanisms to encourage and reward effective primary care the most notable of which is the formation of Accountable Care Organizations  Traditionally primary care doctors have been paid on a fee for service basis meaning that physicians are reimbursed predetermined amounts for the particular service they provided This payment mechanism gave primary care doctors an incentive to provide a long list of services whether necessary or not just to scrape by  In the new model spearheaded by Medicare doctors are encouraged to form Accountable Care Organizations where doctors will be rewarded not just for services provided but also for value added to the patient  Appreciating that quality primary care has the power to prevent expensive hospitalizations and trips to the emergency room physicians participating in an ACO can receive a portion of the money that insurance companies save as a result of their services  This new model if successful has the potential to both reemphasize our health system around primary care and curb the rising cost of health care  Despite Obamacares best efforts a career in primary care still lacks the same allure as specialization   indicated that only  of internal medicine residents aim to practice primary care Why is it sexier to treat organs in the United States than it is to treat people If we are to secure a healthier America we are going to need providers who know our names without having to look at a chart No payment reform is going to build the army of primary care physicians we need only a culture shift can do that  Its still true that I dont know if I want to be part of that army The next time I come home for the holidays however I sure hope someone tells me I should
