But by the third generation, more than half of the rats (think of them as the great-grandchildren) showed dramatically higher levels of fat and weight gain, even though they were never exposed to the pesticide themselves.. "Here is an ancestral exposure in your great-grandmother, which is passed on to you and you're going to pass on to your grandchildren," said Michael Skinner, a professor of biological sciences at Washington State University who led .  published in the journal BMC Medicine.. At work is a .  discovered more than 15 years ago, Skinner said.. A series of experiments on lab rats found that chemicals known as endocrine disruptors, including fungicides, dioxin and bisphenol-A, or BPA, can alter the molecular processes around their DNA without changing its sequence, Skinner said.. "We've all been taught that the primary way for us to inherit things from our parents is genetics," Skinner said. "This is a totally new concept for how we inherit things from our ancestors.". DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, but more recently, the World Health Organization and other global health groups .  to control mosquitoes in countries with high rates of malaria..
