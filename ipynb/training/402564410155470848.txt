Long ago I carried two seatbelts in my luggage When the car that we rented for a month to drive around Turkey had no seatbelts in the back as my husband and I had been warned we took the two in my baggage to a body shop paid to have them installed and strapped our children in For years when I counseled families about travel I would bring up those seatbelts whats dangerous for your children at home will be dangerous on a trip Traveling safely with children means taking familiar precautions in unfamiliar settings as well as learning to handle some unfamiliar precautions and exotic risks  all while trying to make sure everyone has a good time Many children on the road during the holidays fall into a category known in travel medicine as VFR visiting friends and relatives They are the group of patients that carry the highest risk of contracting medical problems while traveling abroad said Dr Stefan Hagmann a pediatrician who is director of the   at BronxLebanon Hospital Center Yet as parents we dont always see where the dangers lie The degree of expertise that families have in preparing for a trip is very variable said Dr John C Christenson director of the pediatric travel medicine clinic at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis Talking about healthy travel he said can involve what type of clothing they should have what type of insect repellent they should have what do they know about the country and how safe it is Car accidents are probably the greatest threat to traveling children just as they are a leading cause of injury and death at home Roads in the developing world often are in poor condition cars dont always have seatbelts signs may be in unfamiliar languages and the rules of the road may be a little or a lot different For small children traveling to developing countries its important to be vigilant about animal bites especially where rabies is still a problem I talk to the kids about how animals in many countries are not pets the way they are here said Dr Elizabeth D Barnett a professor of pediatrics and director of the international clinic at Boston Medical Center I remember lying awake during a longago vacation worrying because my yearold daughter had been bitten by a monkey It wasnt a serious bite but I had a friend contact the   only to be reassured that rabies was not a risk there at the time We were lucky bites can be dangerous and monkeys do carry diseases In a  review of travelrelated infections in children Dr Christenson and his colleagues noted the  Depending on where theyre going children like their parents may need antimalaria medication and immunizations against diseases like     and   found all over Asia They also need to be uptodate on regular immunizations since those diseases including flu measles meningitis polio and hepatitis A will be more prevalent in the developing world In fact traveling babies as young as  months can get an early measles vaccine to keep them safe Dr Hagmann was the lead author of a  study in the journal Pediatrics finding that children who were sick after international travel were more likely than adults to be hospitalized  and   Still kids who get sick overseas tend to get sick with illnesses they would have gotten at home ear infections rather than malaria or   said Dr Karl Neumann a New York City pediatrician who maintains a   and electronic newsletter about traveling with children He suggests a   that might include a filled prescription for antibiotics for a child prone to ear infections and contact information for home doctors Parents traveling with small children in countries where the water supply is not safe need to be   boil it cook it peel it or forget it If children do get diarrhea they need to keep drinking fluids if they start to get dehydrated or develop fevers severe stomach pains or bloody diarrhea its time to seek medical help Skin problems are common during and after travel In a large review of skin conditions in young travelers published online this month Dr Hagmann and his colleagues noted that children sustained insect bites and infections including a parasitic infection   that was common in travelers to the Caribbean and sometimes picked up by running barefoot on the beach There were other animal bites as well and the familiar and preventable   Dr Neumann points out that children on cruise ships are at risk Its often in the winter kids have lost their tan from the previous summer and are quite prone to sunburn The first rule of travel medicine is to see a doctor and get advice at least a month before you leave so the immunizations can take effect Consult the CDC websites about   and   Finally remind doctors even months after your return that you were traveling should any medical issues arise Those who practice in this field believe that travel with children can be managed to make it safe and healthy I encourage people to go to exotic different places Dr Christenson said I always tell them you can go most everywhere around the world with a child The most important thing is you need to be prepared
