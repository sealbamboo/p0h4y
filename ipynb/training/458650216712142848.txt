Is a journey better than a battle We talked here recently about the    the wellintended encouragement to keep fighting to declare someone a fighter to never give up And then when someone dies to describe him or her as having lost the battle with a disease That post led me via Twitter to researchers at Lancaster University in England who have been analyzing the actual language patients caregivers and health care professionals use to describe responses to disease The    developed by linguists a palliative care specialist and a computer scientist  has used specially developed software to comb through about  million words gathered from interviews and from posts on healthrelated websites based in Britain People working in health care there have been discussing military imagery for a decade said Elena Semino head of linguistics at the university Theres a lot of awareness that battle metaphors can be very harmful to patients she told me Professionals are conscious of the problems and theyre advised not to use them Instead British public health leaders and medical practitioners are more apt to talk about the end of life as a journey instead of a war with pathways and steps instead of fights and weapons A page report from the British government   on cancer treatment published a few years ago was almost devoid of fighting words for instance Though it occasionally talked about tackling some aspect of cancer it was more likely to talk about progress On websites for cancer organizations in the United States like   and the   on the other hand I found frequent references to battles The fight metaphor assumes an opponent Dr Semino said Fighting has connotations of violence and competitiveness The goal is to win and if you dont succeed you can feel like a failure A journey she noted doesnt involve an enemy it suggests sojourners passing various milestones Still the Lancaster researchers found plenty of fight metaphors in their analyses Among patients and caregivers about one or two words in every thousand were violence metaphors Health care professionals used them less often perhaps reflecting their continuing discussion of appropriate language and in somewhat different ways How you speak about your own health and the decisions you make about it are highly individual of course It may be easier to accept the inevitable end of a journey if youre very old and like most older adults have multiple illnesses Indeed British lawmakers are currently debating   a frank discussion hard to imagine in the United States The continuing use of battle imagery in the Lancaster study could be associated with younger age The researchers dont know the ages of the people posting anonymously on websites the source of a majority of those  million words but since younger adults remain more likely to use the Internet thats a reasonable assumption Personally Im not fond of either battling or journeying and prefer dying when thats whats happening but thats probably a minority opinion Moreover the researchers have found some people use fight metaphors in what can only be described as an empowering way Dr Semino said They talk about fighting with a sense of pride and purpose So when it comes to fight metaphors at the end of life Dr Semino said our view is that shouldnt be censored but its limitations should be recognized She added that metaphors are resources tools ways to make sense of your experience Some serve better than others but we each get to pick our own
