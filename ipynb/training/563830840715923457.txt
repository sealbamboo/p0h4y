Its   but the study found even a small amount of physical activity made a real difference  What counts as moderatetovigorousintensity exercise   It means walking at a moderate or brisk pace backpacking hiking bicycling doing yoga boxing tennis or  So get out there and get physical A healthy diet was based on the    Thats a fancy term the US Department of Agricultures Center for Nutrition

you exercise sometimes try  If you have chosen to sit in front of the TV most nights keep your diet to  calories Its not just about counting calories though You should be eating a balance of food from all the major food groups If its been a while since you stared at one of those food posters in health class that means  Eat  cups a day of vegetables cooked or raw or salads   Eat two cups of fruit raw or cooked Or it can come in the form of a cup of juice if it is  fruit juice rather than some sugary substitute your kids love   Eat  ounces of grains That could mean half a cup of rice or pasta or a slice of bread   Eat three cups of dairy It could be yogurt  ounces of cheese or drink a cup of milk or soy milk   Eat  ounces of protein That means seafood or nuts or beans or peas Lean meat or eggs or poultry work too   Repeat  It may sound like a lot but the good news is that your menu would have variety and give you a lot of options for meals Youre not stuck eating only grapefruit or

the report is that women who followed just one of these six habits improved their chances of avoiding heart disease It is not do all or nothing to succeed said Chomistek an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Indiana University Bloomington Even if you targeted one two of these behaviors your chances improve significantly The other takeaway she said is that you should start doing one or all these things while you are still young long before you may show any signs that you could be heart sick    People in their s and s often feel invincible and dont feel they need to worry about heart disease but thats not the case she said We saw plenty of cases of heart disease in that category not a huge number but women did develop risks These are simple things women can do to avoid going in that direction
