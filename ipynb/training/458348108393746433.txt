Nearly half of the nations  drug overdose deaths in  involved painkillers like   and     These narcotics now kill more adults than heroin and cocaine combined sending  Americans to emergency rooms each year So many state health officials and advocacy groups were incredulous last fall when the Food and Drug Administration    against the advice of its own expert advisory committee The drug is Zohydro ER a longacting formulation of the opioid hydrocodone The shortacting form sold under brand names like Vicodin and Lortab is already the most prescribed drug in the country and the most abused In March Gov Deval Patrick of Massachusetts sought to ban Zohydro outright calling it a potentially lethal narcotic painkiller The manufacturer Zogenix of San Diego went to court and last week   pending further legal action But other states in New England are moving to restrict the use of Zohydro and  state attorneys general have asked the FDA to reconsider its approval People are fearful this will be another original OxyContin said Sharon Walsh director of the   at the University of Kentucky referring to an early formulation of the painkiller that resulted in   in the s and early s OxyContin is now available in an abusedeterrent formulation Zohydro is pure hydrocodone in an extendedrelease formulation It is intended for people suffering from chronic pain who now must take shortacting hydrocodone pills every few hours around the clock Since it does not contain   the new drug will provide steady relief without the risk of liver damage according to officials at Zogenix Dr Bradley Galer chief medical officer for Zogenix said the company had fulfilled all of the FDAs requirements for approval and there was no reason to treat the medication differently from other extendedrelease opioids already on the market But critics note that Zohydro is being made available in doses of up to  milligrams of hydrocodone  or five times greater than the largest doses of immediaterelease pills Moreover Zohydro is sold in capsules that can be crushed into doses to be snorted injected or sold And it is not available in an abuseresistant formulation though company officials say they are doing research to develop one At the moment the company is offering pill bottles with combination locks on the caps as well as lockboxes for storing the drug FDA officials say they have an obligation to approve new treatment options for the   who live with chronic pain which can be debilitating and can prevent them from working and living productive lives though that figure has been questioned To say to people with chronic pain who are taking opiates around the clock that we shouldnt offer them an extendedrelease option is unnecessarily penalizing the patient   director of the agencys Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in an interview We need to balance the medical needs of people in severe pain with the risks of these medications including the risk of abuse and addiction The FDA has instituted a slew of new measures intended to restrict access to opioids and curb abuse The agency has eliminated automatic refills and strengthened the language on warning labels Earlier this month the agency   a prescription medication that can be used as an injection to treat someone who has overdosed on opioids Officials are requiring postmarketing studies of Zohydro to monitor abuse addiction overdoses and deaths as well as a reaction called hyperalgesia a condition that makes users of painkillers even more sensitive to pain over time Members of the FDA committee who voted against approval acknowledged they were influenced by the drug overdoses claiming more and more lives each year But they were also disturbed by red flags raised during the clinical trials of Zohydro Several pointed to what one member called very modest reductions in pain scores among trial participants And some members felt a week trial was not long enough to prove Zohydro was effective for chronic pain which is defined as lasting more than three months Many experts do not recommend opioids for chronic pain When you talk to pain specialists in our field they will all tell you one indisputable fact  opiates are lousy drugs to treat chronic pain   an anesthesiologist and committee member told her colleagues according to a   of the Dec   meeting A number of patients had to leave the study because they had serious adverse side effects or didnt comply with the terms of the trial Many could not account for all of the pills they had been given Fewer than  subjects made it through a full year in the longterm safety trial and there were five deaths Two were attributed to serious terminal illnesses one participant committed suicide and another died of a toxic mix of drugs A third committed suicide  months after the study ended that death also involved drugs You still have a  percent almost death rate from this drug said Dr Jeanmarie Perrone a committee member from the University of Pennsylvania What will happen in the doctors office she wondered where those receiving the drug will not be as carefully screened Among the most vocal opponents of Zohydro are parents who have lost children to   and addiction But millions of others live with chronic pain caused by   accidents and other issues The right answer would be medication that takes away the pain and isnt addictive said Paul Gileno president of the   That would be perfect
