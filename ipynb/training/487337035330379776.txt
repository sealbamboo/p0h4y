Doctors have gotten much better at diagnosing and treating sportsrelated concussions which is a good thing since Americans suffer up to  million sportsrelated concussions a year But were not so good at is following their advice Student athletes and parents sometimes balk at doctors recommendations to avoid play until concussion symptoms are gone or to cut back on schoolwork Both have been shown to speed recovery and getting another hit on a vulnerable brain increases the risk of longterm problems Doctors shouldnt wimp out according to a   released Wednesday by the American Academy of Neurology Sometimes what will happen is that an athlete will come to you and theyll be a few days out from their concussion says   a pediatric neurologist at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and lead author of the committee that wrote the position statement which was published in   Theyll be a few days out from their concussion and theyll still be symptomatic Theyll still have deficits on their neurocognitive testing Kirschen told Shots And theyll say Yes but I really want to play Theres a big game Saturday There will be a recruiter there And the parents say theyre OK with them playing Other times parents will worry about damaging a childs chance for an athletic scholarship though the paper delicately hints that those scholarships might not be as  as parents expect The physician has to sit back and say The risks are too great You cant go back in  Kirschen says Educating parents students and coaches on   will help make that easier the doctors conclude and thats starting to happen thanks to laws in all  states that require concussion education and removal from play But doctors are stuck Kirschen says if they cant talk with schools or coaches about a childs injury due to health privacy laws They would like patients and parents to sign waivers that would let doctors share that information But those arent in wide use now Thats one ethical conundrum the neurologists wrestled with Another is whether a patients right to autonomy trumps the doctors responsibility to protect the patient from harm They acknowledged patient autonomy as a fundamental right Kirschen says but the ultimate priority needs to be protecting the health and well being of their athlete patients
