Even after the second stroke robbed Betty Woodruff  of her sharp mind and memory she fought to stay mentally active in the ways she had always loved like participating in her regular bridge game  Her daughter Rosemary  one of five siblings lived nearby in Shaker Heights Ohio and she tirelessly assembled the bridge group sitting beside her increasingly diminished mother and guiding her as inconspicuously as possible through each hand  Eventually her mother had nothing to work with Rosemary Woodruff said and the games ended Scrabble puzzles and finally Rummikub a cross between dominoes and mahjongg suitable for children age  and older all became too difficult for her mother to comprehend But that did not mean Ms Woodruff was going to let her mother sit glassyeyed in a nursing home lounge her wheelchair parked in front of the communal television with nobody looking out for her soul  So Ms Woodruff decided to figure out what her once vibrant mother still could do She found the solution in the vast collection of childrens books that she had once read to her own sons now grown and that remained for sentimental reasons in her home  Betty Woodruff had bounced back quickly from her first stroke but the second stroke left her unable to walk swallow or control her bladder or bowels Following extensive therapy Mrs Woodruff can now speak and even read although it is unclear what she understands and what she doesnt Every day is different And she can also still play bingo  well enough to cheat putting her chips on numbers that havent been called with a sly grin on her face Mom you cant do that her daughter tells her Oh be nice Mrs Woodruff answers in a way that persuades her daughter that she knows what shes up to Mrs Woodruff now lives in a nursing home that her daughter describes as excellent But even the best skilled nursing facilities cant afford sufficient staff to tailor activities to the ability level of individual residents A paid companion spends weekdays with Mrs Woodruff while her daughter works full time as a property specialist for the county Weekends she takes over  But at this stage in her mothers deterioration Rosemary and her husband a psychologist are the only family members whom Mrs Woodruff recognizes The ritual that outlasted all others and has bound together mother and daughter  discovered in the make it up as you go along way so recognizable to caregivers of the elderly  is reading childrens books I hit on the book thing last year Ms Woodruff said I was trying to keep up the trappings but more and more I had to admit she was like a secondgrader maybe even younger maybe more like kindergarten  When Mrs Woodruff isnt cheating at bingo she and her daughter read from the very same books she had read her children The Story of Ferdinand the pacifist bull Mama Do You Love Me a board book set in Alaska about an Inuit mothers unconditional love of her daughter and The Cat in the Hat The Little Engine That Could and the Redwall series about swashbuckling mice  She just touches the pages Ms Woodruff said Theres so much wonderful art and its not all jumping around like TV They take turns reading to each other Sometimes she gets to be my mother Ms Woodruff said And sometimes I get to be her mother too Her voice catches not in pain but in wonder  Rosemary Woodruff happened my way through   in reply to Dwight Garners   a lament about packing and moving to the attic the books that he and his wife had read to their children now ages  and  Theyre the last books the four of us are likely to ever read again at anything like the same moment Mr Garner wrote 
Well yes But I wonder if the Garners will ever need to take a page from the Woodruffs book and create a new iteration of their family book club  Our beloved bedtime companions have given me many new memories Ms Woodruff wrote to The Times She also referred to her mothers second childhood but the phrase was removed by the editors of the letters page who worried it was insensitive Ms Woodruff took no offense at their decision In our conversation she mused about the notion of a second childhood as set forth in As You Like It in which Shakespeare defines the seven ages of man from infancy to advanced old age The infant begins mewling and puking in the nurses arms Shakespeare wrote But this strange eventful history ends with a second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
