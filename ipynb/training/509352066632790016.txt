Now that the federal health law forbids denial of insurance for preexisting condition some people have wondered if they can wait until they get sick to buy health coverage Its unlikely that this hypothetical person would be able to sign up for coverage after being injured says Judith Solomon a vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Its true that you cant be denied because you have a preexisting medical condition but you generally have to sign up during an open enrollment period says Solomon Employers generally offer insurance through an enrollment period in the fall People buying coverage individually on or off the online marketplaces set up under the health law can   starting Nov  But theres a lag between when a person signs up and when coverage begins The reason for open enrollment is clear If people could sign up anytime chances are they would wait until they got sick to do so wreaking havoc on the health insurance market that relies on spreading the insurance risk among sicker and healthier people Hospitals may   for patients existing policies or enroll people before they get sick But in general its not possible to purchase coverage after youve already been injured and admitted to the hospital says Solomon There is one important exception however Enrollment in a states Medicaid program for lowincome people is open yearround If someone lives in a state that has expanded Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to  percent of the poverty level currently  for an individual enrollment would generally be retroactive to the first day of the month that the person applied for coverage In addition if   during the three months preceding the application medical care received during that time could be covered as well The answer depends on your circumstances Most people can opt to buy a marketplace plan during open enrollment rather than sign up for employer coverage if they want theres nothing in the health law that prohibits it The real question is whether youre eligible for subsidies to make coverage more affordable if you do so If you have good affordable employer coverage available  meaning it costs less than  percent of your income and covers at least  percent of your medical costs  you wont be eligible for subsidies Nor will you qualify for subsidies if your income is more than  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual next year If you take subsidies out of the equation however theres no reason not to buy a plan on the state marketplace if you prefer it over your onthejob coverage says Solomon The excise tax that will be assessed on socalled Cadillac health plans with very generous benefits starts in  It isnt related to how much the employer or employee pay in premiums The tax will be charged based on the total value of a plan including both employer and employee premium contributions Under the health law if the total value is more than  for individual coverage or  for family coverage   for paying a  percent tax on amounts over those thresholds Theres nothing to preclude an employer from passing along some or all of that tax to an employee says Amy Bergner managing director at tax and human resources consultant PwC By the time the tax takes effect in  expect the thresholds to be higher says Bergner because of consumer price index adjustments among other things
