Two newly published studies investigate the enticing possibility that we might one day be able to gain the benefits of exercise by downing a pill rather than by actually sweating But while some of the research holds out promise for an effective workout pill there remains the question of whether such a move is wise The more encouraging of the new studies which   expands on a   In that study a team at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter Fla  reported that a compound they had created and injected into obese mice increased activation of a protein called REVERB which is known to partially control animals circadian rhythms and internal biological clocks The injected animals lost weight even on a highfat diet and improved their cholesterol profiles Unexpectedly the treated mice also began using more oxygen throughout the day and expending about  percent more energy than untreated mice even though they were not moving about more than the other animals In fact in most cases they were more physically lazy and inactive than they had been before the injections The drug it seemed was providing them with a workout minus the effort Intrigued the Scripps scientists in conjunction with researchers from the Pasteur Institute in France and other institutions set out to see what their compound might be doing inside muscles to provide this ersatz exercise They knew that their drug increased the potency of the REVERB protein but no one yet knew what REVERB actually does in muscles So they began by developing a strain of mice that could not express very much of the protein in their muscle cells Those animals proved to be antiathletes One of the hallmarks of regular aerobic exercise is that in muscles it increases the number and vigor of the mitochondria the cellular structures that help to generate energy while consuming oxygen But these animals muscles contained woefully few mitochondria As a result the animals had diminished endurance with a maximal oxygen capacity about  percent lower than normal They reached exhaustion on treadmill testing long before their unaffected labmates But when in a separate part of the experiment scientists added their compound to isolated muscle cells from the deficient mice the cells began pumping out far more REVERB Those cells subsequently began creating large numbers of new mitochondria and strengthening the existing ones Finally the scientists injected their compound into sedentary mice stimulating their production of REVERB beyond what would be considered typical When they set the sedentary mice loose on little treadmills they ran significantly longer both in time and distance than untreated animals the authors wrote even though they had not been training beforehand The drug certainly seems to act as an exercise mimic said a coauthor Thomas Burris now the chairman of the department of pharmacological and physiological science at St Louis University School of Medicine It is not inconceivable he adds that at some point in the future such a drug might allow people especially those who are disabled or cant otherwise exercise to enjoy the health benefits of endurance without the exertion But that time is still distant with many questions unanswered Its still unknown for example whether increasing levels of REVERB in healthy people is possible and whether athletes could use the compound to dope Dr Burris said hed been told by other scientists who have published data about potential exercise pills to expect some weird phone calls from athletes and their support crew And a larger concern is whether any single pill can hope to replicate the bogglingly complex physiological effects of physical exercise and whether in trying to create one we risk unanticipated consequences  That issue provided the subtext of the other new study   In it scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis tried to replicate earlier work showing that large doses of resveratrol the chemical found abundantly in grape skins and red wine increase the creation of new mitochondria in isolated muscle cells mimicking aerobic exercise After those earlier studies resveratrol too had been hailed as a means of counterfeiting exercise pharmacologically But the new study punches holes in that hope When the scientists fed both rats and mice medically tolerable levels of resveratrol in their kibble the animals did not produce more mitochondria in muscle cells Only at extremely high doses did resveratrol lead to more mitochondria Unfortunately at these exaggerated doses the substance has a toxic effect said Dr John O Holloszy a coauthor of the study and a professor of medicine at Washington University It poisons two of the steps involved in developing healthy mitochondrial function Dr Holloszy said Still the dream of effortless fitness remains alluring I know there are probably plenty of people who would prefer to pop a pill rather than jog a few miles Dr Burris said But he adds the fundamental aim of his and similar research is to aid those who cant exercise not those who decline to and even the beneficiaries inevitably will be shortchanged Exercise has so many health benefits and no drug can recreate all of them he concludes Meaning that a good stroll or swim will probably never be fully reducible to tablet form
