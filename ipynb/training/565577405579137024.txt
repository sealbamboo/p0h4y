Google is rolling out a health feature that provides information about common medical conditions in response to related searches The facility provides medical illustrations possible treatments and other data ahead of its traditional links to others sites The firm says it worked with doctors to develop the service but adds that it is not intended to replace visits to a professional It is initially limited to the US But the firm adds that it plans to extend the service across the globe adding rarer ailments in time British doctors have welcomed the initiative but caution that the information needs to be edited to become suitable for local markets One in  Google searches are for healthrelated information said Prem Ramaswami   Well show you typical symptoms and treatments as well as details on how common the condition is  whether its critical if its contagious what ages it affects and more  For some conditions youll also see highquality illustrations from licensed medical illustrators Once you get this basic info from Google you should find it easier to do more research on other sites around the web or know what questions to ask your doctor The effort is the latest in a series of moves into health by the search giant Last year it revealed it was funding development of a cancer and heartattack detector which would involve placing nanoparticles in users bloodstreams  It has also bought the maker of a spoon for Parkinsons patients is working on smart contact lenses for people with diabetes and has invested in andMe a startup that sells genetics tests to the public The latest service is an extension    a Google initiative to map the various connections that link together different objects facts and concepts The company introduced the information tool in  and uses it to provide boxed summaries that appear to the top righthand side of desktop searches and above the results of its smartphone Search app Much of Knowledge Graphs information is sourced from Wikipedia the online encyclopedia written by its readers While Wikipedia is hugely popular its crowdsourced nature means its entries can include inaccuracies To minimise the risk of errors in the healthrelated tips Google says it has had the information checked by doctors employed by itself andor by Minnesotas Mayo Clinic Dr Andrew Goddard from the UKs Royal College of Physicians cautiously welcomed the development The public have come to rely on Google and other search engines so it is important we understand how best to use these resources to allow people and patients to be engaged with their health and healthcare he said The involvement of the Mayo Clinic is reassuring but if it were to be rolled out in the UK we would like to see a UK badge of quality assurance Dr Richard Vautrey deputy chair of the British Medical Associations GP committee added that the initiative had the potential to reduce pressure on family doctors if it encouraged the public to take care of minor conditions But he too had concerns about Googles willingness to adapt to the UKs health system This experiment from Google may well have benefits although we will need more detail to see how practically it will work he told the BBC Most importantly it must be underpinned by clinical guidance from UK based health professionals as there are stark differences between the UK and the USA health systems and culture  Some evidence suggests that many patients in America are often exposed to unnecessary investigations and treatments that are not recommended here partially owing to the profit driven incentive that underpins the USAs private health care system
