Two outbreaks two entirely different outcomes The World Health Organization has  of Ebola over in the Democratic Republic of Congo after just  cases and  deaths It lasted three months Yet the epidemic in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guineas been going for nine months with more than  cases  deaths and no end in sight Whats the difference Experts say experience matters  it was the seventh outbreak in the former Zaire But equally important is the fact that the village where it started was extremely remote and the country has a rudimentary system of healthcare workers who know to look out for   The latest outbreak started when a pregnant woman was preparing game her husband had brought home for the family in Ikanamongo a village in northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo DRC After she died of an unknown illness healthcare workers performed a cesarean section to remove her fetus Its local custom  you cant be buried with a fetus inside said Ben Monroe a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist whos worked in both the DRC and Liberia All the health care workers involved fell ill Within a week of the unfortunate womans death on Aug  there were  other cases and  of them had died That raised a lot of alarm in the system Someone in  the health authority there recognized what was going on said Monroe Congolese people have been hearing about Ebola for years and years and years Monroe added They put a fair amount of effort into preparing for situations like this Not too far away the Ebola River flows   who discovered the Ebola virus in  named it after this river It also didnt hurt that the CDC had been studying monkeypox in the same forests since  We go every year and train health care workers on infection control and disease surveillance Monroe said Theres been a lot of public education in this particular region in addition to training health care workers Local health experts knew to quickly identify potential cases and isolate them It doesnt help the patients much  the death rate is still very high  but it keeps the virus from spreading Isolation is also not difficult The areas very heavily forested and most people live along the rivers Theres not much travel or trade Compare that to the area where Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone come together in West Africa The current boundaries cross over ancient kingdoms and people travel freely across the borders in trucks by canoe on motorcycles and on foot Theres a lot of informal trade and commerce Years of civil war have left little infrastructure and even less trust in government especially in Liberia Ebola had never been seen there When someone shows up with fever at a clinic health workers usually assume its malaria and if there are more severe symptoms they might suspect another viral hemorrhagic fever Lassa fever or yellow fever Ebola didnt enter anyones minds for months as the virus was carried across borders and finally into crowded cities like Monrovia Malaria isnt contagious from person to person Its spread by mosquitoes So is yellow fever Lassa is spread by rodents but can spread person to person though its not as deadly as Ebola And when people die of these diseases their bodies are not hotspots of infection the way an Ebola victims body is So West Africans were completely unafraid of handling dead bodies They were totally unprepared for Ebola United Nations World Bank and World Health Organization officials met in Washington DC Friday and warned that the West African epidemic is   Volunteers from around the word have been educating local residents about Ebola about the need to quickly isolate people with potential symptoms so they dont infect anyone else and about ways to safely bury someone whos died of Ebola Ironically many of the DRCs Ebola experts were not even on hand for the recent outbreak there They were in Guinea Monroe said The DRC actually exports their Ebola expertise to other countries So long as the epidemic continues the whole world risks seeing at least some Ebola cases There have been  in the US four diagnosed in the US and the rest transported for treatment with two deaths is fighting off an outbreak that started when a religious leader crossed the border from Guinea with what health workers didnt recognize was Ebola Five other people became infected and died and experts are now tracking close to  people who either treated him were at two funeral ceremonies in Mali and Guinea or were in contact with one of the other victims In   authorities stopped an outbreak with contact tracing and isolation Genetic testing makes clear the West African outbreak started locally  probably when someone hunted and slaughtered an infected animal So the virus is in the forest and could pop up again This is why its   everywhere say experts from WHO the CDC and other agencies Anywhere you have marginalized populations that rely on wildlife this kind of stuff happens Monroe said It can happen anywhere So long as we have these weak public health systems and the world is not investing in them this kind of thing can occur
