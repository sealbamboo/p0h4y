Movie theater chains will have to inform patrons how many calories are in those giant buckets of popcorn and restaurants with at least  locations will have to reveal the calorie content of their specialty cocktails under new rules unveiled by the Food and Drug Administration The FDA rules published Tuesday aim to set a national standard for posting calorie information on virtually all menu items sold in chain restaurants entertainment venues and vending machines When fully implemented two years from now they will bring uniformity to the patchwork of state and local calorieposting requirements that exist today The rules drafted under a provision of the Affordable Care Act will apply to chains that have  or more locations operating under the same name and offering basically the same menu items the FDA said Increased awareness about the choices we make certainly does not mean that we always eat what is healthy FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg wrote Tuesday on her blog But whether we choose to eat French fries or a tuna sandwich those selections should reflect informed decisionmaking That can only happen if the right information is available to make those choices Hamburg underscored that for all the political wrangling over Obamacare and antiobesity measures such as soda taxes calorie posting is a measure that has enjoyed bipartisan support inasmuch as it aims to inform consumers and leave buying decisions in their hands Several years in the making the new standard relieves hungry consumers of some arithmetic judgments while adding others It requires restaurants and other establishments to post calorie counts per serving A diner planning to eat two or three slices of pizza for instance would have to do a little math At the same time the new rules will challenge consumers to understand their food choices in the context of their overall daily diet Menus and menu boards will be required to advise customers that  calories a day is used for general nutrition advice but calorie needs vary That leaves consumers  who are by and large poor at making complex calculations while gazing at a menu  to decide what proportion of their daily calorie allotment they are willing to expend in a single order During a drivethrough visit to McDonalds for instance an individual must determine whether she can afford to add a sweet tea  calories and an order of French fries  calories to her crispy chicken club sandwich  calories and still wrap up her day consuming  calories or fewer In the process she might also ponder whether she can in fact maintain a stable weight while consuming  calories a day  a total that may be low for a teenage athlete and high for a postmenopausal office worker Research suggests that the consumers most poorly equipped to perform such mental calculations on the fly are also those most likely to be obese Americans from lowincome households members of ethnic minorities and those with literacy challenges The new slate of rules comes amid an ongoing debate among doctors nutritionists and public health experts over how to get Americans to make better food choices Studies have shown that fewer than  of consumers even notice calorie labeling where it is available and only a small portion of those say the postings influence their orders Evidence that calorie counts improve consumers choices is pretty weak said Sara Bleich an obesity expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore While she called the FDAs national standards a great first step she added that researchers have already found better ways to convey the significance of a menu items calorie content and nudge consumers toward better choices A  study of teenagers pondering the purchase of a soft drink after school showed that they were half as likely to choose a sugarsweetened soda or bottle of fruit juice when a sign informed them it would take  minutes of running to work off the calories Posting such sweat equivalents was more powerful than posting calories alone Other strategies that have been shown to work include listing menu offerings in order of their caloric density displaying healthful foods more prominently than their highcalorie counterparts and making lowercalorie offerings the default option in preset meals But Bleich said calorielabeling rules have had a powerful effect on restaurants and other businesses that sell food and drinks In an article published last month in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine Bleich and her colleagues calculated that new menu offerings at large chain restaurants induced diners to consume  fewer calories per visit on average compared with levels seen in  and  That  reduction appeared to be the result of the restaurants voluntary decision to offer lowercalorie entrees beverage and childrens meals and to reformulate some popular items to reduce their calorie counts Faced with the prospect of publicly acknowledging they serve calorie muffins and calorie specialty coffee drinks chain restaurants responded by revamping their menus Bleich said In the end the biggest effect of this national legislation will be less on consumer choices and more on the supply side she said For those watching their intake of salt carbohydrates or fiber the new FDA rules require chains to offer more detailed information upon request Consumers must be notified on
