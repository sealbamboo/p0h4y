Most research on memory loss in the elderly focuses on dementia Alzheimers disease or other brain diseases But neuroscientist   from Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine knew there is great variation in how good memory is in older people Most have memory loss to varying degrees but some have strong memories even well into old age Rogalski wanted to know just how good So she began recruiting volunteers age  and up from the Chicago area to test their memories The   appeared in the   The volunteers came into Rogalskis memory lab and were given a barrage of tests Rogalski says she told the participants We want individuals who are over age  to perform on memory tests like  to yearolds or better Participants had to memorize a list of random words and recall the words some time later Or they listened to stories and were later tested on the many small details in them The memory tests were very hard says Lou Ann Schachner  who volunteered for the study along with her yearold husband Jay What Rogalski found was that some of the elderly participants had outstanding memories they did as well as  if not better than  people in their s But such individuals who do really well on the memory tests are not common she adds Of those who came in to have their memories tested only about  in  had exceptional memories This group Rogalski calls superagers Once this group of superagers was identified Rogalski was eager to find out what explains their exceptional memories Her first step was to see if the brains of the superagers looked any different than those of other yearolds Each superager was given several MRI scans Rogalski then analyzed the brain pictures exploring the outer layer of the brain called the cortex which is critical for thinking and memory The cortex is comprised of dense layers of nerve cells and its thickness indicates the health of the brain In Alzheimers for example the cortex gets thinner and shrinks But in the superagers Rogalski says What we found was quite remarkable We found that the cortices of individuals who are superagers look more like those of  to yearolds There was no significant thinning or shrinkage of the cortex in the superagers compared to people  or  years younger At first Rogalski didnt believe what she had found So she analyzed the MRI scans again confirming the findings Then we found something even more surprising which was even harder to believe she says In an area called the anterior cingulate of the brain it was actually thicker in the superagers than it was in the yearolds The anterior cingulate is a small brain region important for attention and memory A youthful cortex and thicker cingulate suggest to Rogalski that these two brain regions have been spared the typical agerelated shrinkage which may be what protects against the memory decline seen in most elderly people Superagers also have   for Alzheimers than typical yearolds she notes But there may be other explanations for the exceptional memories of these superagers Perhaps theyve always had bigger brains maybe they have an excess of reserve that the majority of elderly people do not Another possibility Rogalski says is that the memory of a superager declines much more slowly To check out these possible explanations for why  in  individuals over age  has an exceptional memory Rogalski    more yearolds with exceptional memories Shes currently in the process of analyzing their brain scans So stay tuned she says But for now the takehome message is that the loss of memory as we age is not inevitable
