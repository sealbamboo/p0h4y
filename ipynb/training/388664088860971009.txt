After mastectomy women usually have two choices Learn to love your flat chest or surgically reconstruct the breast or breasts that were taken away But some breast cancer survivors are choosing a third option adorning their scarred chests with intricate and colorful tattoos transforming what can often be a landscape of pain into something beautiful powerful and unique Perhaps the most wellknown example of the postmastectomy tattoo belongs to Inga Duncan Thornell a yearold Seattle life coach who chose to have a prophylactic double mastectomy in  shortly after her stepmother died from the disease and her mother was diagnosed with it The tattoo inked in segments a few hours every month took nearly two years to complete and has since taken on a life of its own appearing in an MSNBC documentary a   and earlier this yearÂ   when it was first removed  and then officially approved  on Facebook Im a shy person but the tattoo really isnt says Thornell I cant remember the last party when I didnt end up in the bathroom or spare bedroom with someone or half a dozen somebodies showing my tattoo Thornell says many survivors seem to gather strength and healing from her tattoo I think its a neat option she says You step out of the shower and you look like yourself You dont look scarred I understand why women would reconstruct and totally respect their decision to do that to be more normal but the thought of having more surgery more discomfort didnt appeal to me at all Other women like Wendi Duvall of Houston Texas use tattoos to make their reconstructed breasts completely their own I broke my plastic surgeons heart when I decided I didnt want to do nipples says Duvall a yearold crime victims advocate who had a double mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in  after being diagnosed with   They would be always erect and I didnt want to have headlights on all the time He said Do you really want to be  years old and have flowers on your breasts I didnt know what I wanted but I knew I wanted to be nontraditional It took three years for Duvall to figure out what felt right a pair of lotus blossoms that cover the nipple area of both breasts For her it was all about the symbolism Lotus flowers have to grow in mud not in clean water which is a beautiful metaphor for cancer she says Something beautiful coming from something so ugly I liked the person I was before cancer but I really loved the person I became after cancer It changed me in beautiful ways In a similar fashion postmastectomy tattoos change surgery and treatmentravaged chests into floral gardens undersea landscapes or scenes from fairyland Lotus flowers are a popular meme among survivors whove been tattooed as are cherry blossoms morning glories butterflies and birds Most of my designs tend to be things from nature says Vyvyn Lazonga a Seattle tattoo artist who specializes in designs that cover mastectomy scars Ive done dogwood flowers with a robin sitting on one of the branches for one of my mastectomy pieces Ive done tiger lilies down a womans side Growing interest in postmastectomy tattoos has even led to an annual event in New York City that connects survivors with tattoo artists Founded by Noel Franus a Boulder Colo ad agency executive whose sisterinlaw opted for a tattoo following her diagnosis treatment and breast reconstruction PINK Personal Ink features nearly  images of postmastectomy tattoos which he hopes will become a place for inspiration and hopefully action for breast cancer survivors In addition to sharing information and images the organization is sponsoring its second annual PINK Day which will connect  breast cancer survivors with  tattoo artists in New York on Oct  Survivors will fly there on their own dime but the tattoo artists fees which can run up to  for an involved design will be covered by a   Women say its given them a chance to reclaim their identity to take back something they thought cancer had taken from them he says They have a chance to put their own badge on an experience they had no control over Tattoos arent exactly painfree of course even for women whove had a nervedecimating mastectomy Thornell says she felt pain in certain spots but nothing in others Duvall who refers to her lotusblossomed breasts as her tattoobies says she didnt have pain during her tattooing but did experience some bittersweet moments afterwards My breasts are numb so all I felt was a little bit of pressure but while they were healing I actually had sensation in that area again she says It resembled nipple sensation Once they were healed that went away but I got to reexperience that again which was nice It brought tears to my eyes Dr Claire Buchanan a breast cancer surgeon with the True Family Womens Cancer Center at Swedish Hospital in Seattle says breast cancer survivors should check with their doctors first if theyre considering a tattoo Some of the skin being tattooed may be altered by surgery or radiation or they may have compromised lymphatic systems she says But overall she says I dont believe that a tattoo after mastectomy or lumpectomy would impair our ability to detect a recurrence  And while shes only seen a handful of tattoos in her patients there is genuine delight in showing something beautiful about themselves and thats a wonderful thing to see
