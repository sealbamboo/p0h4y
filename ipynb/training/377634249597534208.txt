Dont wait for a crisis I told a friend whose elderly parents were struggling to care for themselves and a big Connecticut home  Dont wait for a crisis I told another friend his mother recently widowed lonely and overwhelmed rattling around in a family house that was now her solo responsibility  Dont wait for a crisis I told a third friend whose widowed fatherinlaw dropped his daily insulin regimen after his livein girlfriend left him  Dont wait for a crisis Ive told readers of The New Old Age no doubt ad nauseam   As just about everyone who has cared for an aging parent knows getting old is both an inexorable and maddeningly unpredictable forward march Everything is OK Then its not Then it is again What felt early on like a roller coaster becomes the new normal In between swerves and plummets it is almost possible to doze off  And planning for all possible eventualities is useless  after the essential documents are in place the family has talked openly and often about endoflife wishes they understand the difference between Medicare and Medicaid they know how much money is available and that it is probably not going to be enough  Caregivers and their elderly charges both know in a spoken or unspoken way that on the horizon is The Crisis Thats the one that demarcates before and after Your parents are at home say when they really shouldnt be and dont want to leave The Crisis when it appears will be an awful milestone for them and probably so for you the adult child  Then one day the roles shift and the crisis on the horizon could be yours Maybe your parents are dead or maybe not but youre now an old person It happens even if youre diligent about antioxidants and fish oil exercise both body and mind have a cheery attitude good genes and a wide social network If youre not there yet youll have to take my word for it  So today on my th birthday I can call myself middleaged but it isnt true The Census Bureau offers one kind of proof The various body parts that dont work like they used to offer another kind It obviously didnt happen overnight but sometimes it seems that way Young yesterday Old today  So this is putuporshutup time I either take my own hardwon advice or Id better stop dishing it out  Dont wait for a crisis I am weary of shoveling snow and bailing a flooded basement Unsure about the risk versus benefits of trying to change those highhat lightbulbs in the ceiling by myself Plain lucky to wind up with only carpet burns after falling down the stairs And another hurricane season looms None of these in isolation is The Crisis But theres certainly a trend developing around here So Im moving  For a long time Ive known I wanted to quit the suburbs even if it meant trading the chirp of crickets for the screech of car alarms and depriving my dog the woods outside our back door I want ambient street life endless opportunities to eavesdrop takeout menus shoved under my door grocery stores that stay open past  pm a MetroCard instead of parking tickets movie theaters within walking distance My friends  Maybe I dont need AccessaRide and a MedicAlert pendant  yet Until I do the city will be fun After I do itll be necessary  After  years in the most wonderful place Ive ever lived Ive sold my house My feelings are mixed to put it mildly Ive loved the proud stewardship of a small piece of local history the only property remaining from when this tract of land was the LeBoutillier Estate with its own drawer at the Hastings Historical Society  But this is a bad place to be a spinster lady Im allowed to put it that way because Im talking about myself and have always liked the word The deal was sealed after a year of eye surgeries that made driving impossible and a night cowering in the basement with the dog while Hurricane Sandy sent gigantic spruce trees within inches of the house  This is a place for someone younger than I am  or someone with a strong man whos good with power tools Id rather move while I can make these decisions semivoluntarily not after Ive amputated a hand using a rented chainsaw  Writing to my neighbors on the local email list telling them the news and describing the buyers I said Especially after so many years writing about elderly parents and their grown children and giving others advise about not waiting for The Crisis how foolish Id feel if I waited for The Crisis myself Moving is hard enough without it also being a signifier of old age Scribbling anxiously on Postits helps me Have the painter find a peachy color but a little deeper than here Get the rugs cleaned in town because its probably cheaper  Hire my friends children to help run a tag sale furniture in mint condition and rusty egg beaters At what point do I sell the car and wheres the title Dog groomer Veterinarian When I lose one of the Postits my first reaction is to freak Is my mind going already or have I just overloaded the circuit board Then I remember why Im doing this at  not
