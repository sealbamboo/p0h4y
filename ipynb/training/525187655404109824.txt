The   is asking for an additional bn by  to implement a radical plan including switching funding from hospitals into other services including GP surgeries which bosses say is vital to ensure the service can safeguard its future NHS bosses warn the Westminster parties to accept the need for the services funding to increase from just under bn this year to around bn by the end of the next parliament  an extra bn on top of planned increases in line with inflation  or risk patients suffering severe consequences The challenge comes in an unprecedented blueprint drawn up by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and published today which details the farreaching overhaul the service will push through between  and  in order to relieve pressure on hospitals and GP practices and give patients better care The NHS Five Year Forward View envisages GP surgeries becoming like minihospitals with patients able to have a CT or MRI scan or undergo minor surgery as many traditional hospital services start being delivered elsewhere The overhaul is also likely to lead to some hospitals offering fewer acute services and instead concentrating on outpatient clinics diagnostic tests and other nonurgent care It also contains proposals for  An allout assault on chronic public health problems such as obesity smoking and alcohol misuse  A major shift of NHS funding away from hospitals into out of hospital services including GP surgeries  Urgent and emergency care services such as AE out of hours GP services and the NHS  advice line to work more smoothly together  Employers to offer staff cash incentives or vouchers in return for healthier lifestyles such as losing weight    to employ GPs which is currently not allowed The NHS has undergone significant improvements in recent years and coped remarkably well with its biggestever budget squeeze said Stevens But the NHS is now at a crossroads As a country we need to decide which way to go With the election less than seven months away and the NHS set to be a key issue Stevens raised the stakes by warning bluntly that NHS services would deteriorate unless ministers provide the bn Otherwise patients will bear the brunt said Stevens We have no choice but to do this If we do it a better NHS is possible if we dont the consequences for patients will be severe he added Seeking to dispel the gloom surrounding the services future which has seen thinktanks the former Labour health minister Lord Warner and some doctors argue that charging patients for access to services or greater rationing of treatment will become necessary to balance the books Stevens added It is perfectly possible to improve and sustain the NHS over the next five years in a way that the public and patients want But to secure the future that we know is possible the NHS needs to change substantially and we need the support of future governments and other partners to do so His intervention in the intense debate about the NHSs future could force Labour the   and the Liberal Democrats to rethink funding commitments set out over the past month as he is seeking more money than any of them has promised The document which has been backed by the five other major NHS organisations calls for whichever party forms the next government to end the ringfence around NHS spending which has delivered inflationproof increases since  around bnbn a year and give the NHS a minimum of bn extra a year during the next fiveyear parliament Dr David Bennett the chief executive of Monitor the NHSs economic regulator said a realterms increase equivalent to  of the services budget was necessary to produce an NHS that really is fit for the st century The cumulative effect of the NHS receiving inflationproof rises plus the extra  a year to cope with the ageing and growing population would see its budget come close to bn But the NHS bosses also want ministers to provide further additional cash for a change fund at an estimated bn a year over the parliament to keep hospital services running smoothly while new services are set up in local communities to provide care that is more convenient for patients and helps the ill avoid unnecessary stays in hospital The extra funding would be investment to lubricate these changes envisaged added Stevens Failure to make the extra funding available would make it impossible to improve the early diagnosis of cancer and save the hopedfor  lives a year  a key government target  or provide some new cancer treatments The report says that if rising demand for healthcare can be checked through helping patients stay healthier and out of hospital and public health measures reduce lifestylerelated illness the NHS can bridge the expected bn gap in its finances by  through a combination of  annual productivity gains better care for patients  and the extra bn from the government The page document should set the agenda for the next parliament and throws down the gauntlet to the political parties to back fundamental changes to health services that could significantly improve care for patients said Professor Chris Ham chief executive of the Kings Fund health thinktank and an excoalition Downing Street adviser on the NHS Last night all three parties claimed that the blueprint endorsed key planks of their own health policies Labours Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said the review shows that the Toriess NHS spending plans  continuing the ringfence but with no extra money  would leave a large funding gap and would not be enough to prevent an NHS crisis in the next parliament David Cameron was refusing to pledge to match Labours promised bn a year extra funding for the NHS added Burnham Labour will not provide the full bn until  however Norman Lamb the Lib Dem health minister said Labours record on private finance initiativefunded hospitals on the NHS in Wales and refusal to ringfence NHS spending in this parliament showed it could not be trusted over NHS finances The Conservatives are not promising anything more than protecting the NHS budget in real terms If thats the deal the NHS would crash Only the Liberal Democrats are calling for more funding next year and at least one billion more in each year after that Lamb said  the health secretary said We welcome this important report which demonstrates conclusively that the NHS has improved dramatically in recent years and can do so in the future but only if it continues to implement important reforms and is supported by a strong economy The government plans to respond substantively to the Forward View in due course sources close to Hunt said
