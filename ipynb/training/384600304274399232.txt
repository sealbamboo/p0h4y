Tuesday is a big day for Obamacare The online marketplaces where people can shop for health insurance are supposed to open for business No one really knows who is going to sign up  not the Obama administration not the insurance industry not the presidents critics Yet the success of the law hangs on this question Will the right mix of people sign up In particular will healthy people buy health insurance The danger if you dont get young healthy people signing up  is that this program will collapse says Robert Laszewski president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates We actually have a term for this in the industry says Laszewski who advises health insurance companies We call it a death spiral And many insurance companies have had death spirals so this is not a theoretical exercise Heres how a death spiral happens Most of the people who sign up for an insurance plan are sick It costs a lot to take care of them So the next year to cover the high health costs the insurance company raises its premiums But then only really sick people sign up So the insurance company has to raise prices again Eventually the insurance gets so expensive that no one buys it and the whole system falls apart The designers of Obamacare were aware of the dangers of a death spiral Thats why the Affordable Care Act has both a carrot and a stick to encourage people to sign up The stick is that penalty or fee for people who dont buy insurance But the stick is pretty small in the first year The carrot insurance subsidies for people with low incomes Its a great deal says Zeke Emanuel one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act For an individual making between  and  this is Get health insurance  percent off Where do you see sales like that The first people to sign up when the exchanges go online tomorrow arent likely to be young and healthy says Sherry Glied an economist at NYUs Wagner School The first people who sign up are the people for whom buying health insurance was the number one thing on their to do list she says And buying health insurance is the number one thing on your to do list if you expect you are going to be sick Younger people Glied says are likely to sign up later Maybe it will happen when they go home for the holidays and their parents ask them if they have insurance
