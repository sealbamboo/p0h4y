Reflecting unanimous agreement from a panel of experts the World Health Organization said in a statement today  that it is ethical to offer unproven drugs to treat or prevent the spread of the Ebola virus The panel including ethicists researchers regulators and patient advocacy experts met to consider the dilemma brought to the forefront after two American health care workers and one Spanish clergyman who later died were treated with experimental drugs in scarce supply The virus spreading out of control through West Africa has already infected more than  people killing more than  The WHO did the easy part says Alta Charo professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin Madison The moral quandary posed by a rapidly spreading deadly disease that might be helped by asyet unproven drugs runs much deeper The biggest is who gets a drug that is in scarce supply Its a classic rationing problem In a public health crisis there are certain approaches One is if we have only very small amounts of a drug we might give it to people who can save other people like health care workers and other first responders You need to keep them alive After that there are a number of choices You can give it first to the people most likely to benefit Those people may not be evenly distributed in the population They may be clustered in cities and they may not be the sickest people To give it to the sickest people might seem the most compassionate choice  but they may be the people most unlikely to benefit and die anyway Or you can focus on one geographic area so you have a better opportunity to closely monitor how theyre reacting Its much easier to learn if there are lots of patients in one place But it can seem arbitrary and people might see it as unfair if one hospital gets all of the drug available while others get none Right now Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc maker of the experimental drug ZMapp is only making enough for research Scaling up manufacture of a drug poses some challenges You cant just double the recipe Larger amounts may need to be mixed differently And its expensive How much do you give At what stage of the illness is the drug most effective How are patients responding The WHO made an interesting comment that theres a moral obligation on the part of the people who get these drugs to allow themselves to be studied so that people can learn from this Thats important Under American law the Food and Drug Administration can permit a drug manufacturer to provide an unapproved drug to patients if they dont have any alternatives and the consequences are severe Its called compassionate use and most of these exceptions are granted when the drug is in a clinical trial testing its safety proper dose and efficacy The most profound example of this comes from the s in the early days of the AIDS epidemic There was no approved drug that had any effect and people were dying Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was key to changing this approach and expanding access to AZT outside of clinical trials But this is different in that the drugs for the Ebola virus have not yet entered clinical trials in humans The real help will come from efforts to prevent the spread of disease Theres no question that this is a disease that needs a public health prevention approach more than a medical drug treatment approach In families where people are caring for one another the more compassionate and caring they are the more they risk getting sick themselves The challenge is to isolate the sick quarantine them and take very careful precautions when treating the sick and burying people If you take precautions about being in close contact with the sick you can stop the spread You   stop the spread
