 Older women may not need to have a mammogram every year according to researchers from University of California San Francisco In fact women older than  may only need a   every two years say researchers who found that for women between   and  having a mammogram every two years led to significantly fewer   and was just as beneficial in detecting cancer as having an annual mammogram Their findings were published online today in the   To reach their conclusion the researchers analyzed data that was collected on  women who received mammogram testing at participating facilities from January  to December  The women were ages  to  at the beginning of the study Fortyeight percent of the women between the ages of  and  who were screened every year had false positive results compared with  percent of women in the same age range who were screened every two years There was no difference in rates of latestage breast cancer between women screened annually and those screened once every two years Moreover the presence of other illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease made no difference in the ratio of benefit to harm said lead author Dejana Braithwaite PhD a UCSF assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics in a press release False positives happen when a radiologist looks at a mammogram and sees something on it they cannot definitively say is normal breast tissue Such a finding usually results in more testing such as an ultrasound MRI or biopsy says   medical oncologist at New York Universitys Cancer Institute Prior studies have that found younger women have an even higher likelihood of having false positive results on mammograms because their breasts tend to be dense and mammograms cant penetrate dense tissue very well according to Dr Smith Young premenopausal women have dense breasts because the whole purpose of the breast as an organ is to make milk in the reproductive years so theres more glandular activity before menopause says Smith After menopause breasts no longer have the job to make milk so the glands kind of shrink up and a higher percentage of the breast tissue becomes fat after menopause Smith says this study raises an important issue and women have to be educated about how to weigh the possible risk of overtesting and getting a falsepositive mammogram result against the risk not having mammograms as frequently and potentially missing an opportunity for early breast cancer detection Its not clear that we should start screening everyone less says Smith There are women who dont need as much screening and would probably benefit from being screened less in terms of fewer false positives but there are other women for whom more screening is more appropriate We cant give blanket statements and we have to move towards individualized understanding of the disease and treatment and screening options for every individual woman she says
