Finally A scientific explanation for Johnny Knoxville  he of Jackass fame  and the fans who keep him at his dangerous and moronic antics Male Idiot Theory New   has rigorously tested Male Idiot Theory which posits that well men are idiots and are driven to take ridiculous risks despite the clear prospects for selfharm and for no defensible reason Newly published by the venerable   in its annual BMJ Christmas issue the landmark study has shown that Male Idiot Theory holds up under strictly scientific scrutiny While the latest research does confirm that males can be idiots it fails to shed light on a larger mystery that has preoccupied this correspondent since girlhood growing up in a household with six brothers How did these idiots ever convince the nonidiot gender that they were somehow superior and worthy of earning close to  more on average in the United States But I digress The latest BMJ inquiry plumbs an important but littleknown database to assess gender differences in an individuals likelihood to engage in profoundly idiotic behavior the   Winners of the Darwin Awards which are handed out at random times and almost always posthumously must be found to have died or to have sterilized themselves in the conduct of activity that is so stupid pointless and predictably selfdestructive that they can truly be said to have done humanity a great service By removing themselves from the human gene pool the awards note these honorees have done their part to eliminate impediments to the sustained survival of humankind note that I do not write   Since   nominations have been forwarded to the Darwin Award committee and  have been independently verified and confirmed by the awards panel Recipients of this award include the terrorist who posted a letter bomb with insufficient postage and who unthinkingly opened his own letter when it was returned apparently because he was conscientious enough to include a return address The award was bestowed on a thief who died after unbolting the steel clamp from an elevator while standing inside causing him to plummet to his death But the rules did not allow the award to go to a man who in the course of using a belt sander as an autoerotic device merely lost a testicle The latters case for award eligibility was done further damage after he salvaged his remaining testicle with a staple gun though he did merit an honorable mention After excluding urban legends unverified accounts and honorable mentions the studys four authors all maleÂ  found that  awardees met their studys eligibility requirements A lopsided  of those awardees    were male If men and women were equally prone to idiocy that would be a statistical improbability the authors concluded Null hypothesis discredited QED Men are idiots Embracing a broad view of evolution Wendy Northcutt the UC Berkeley graduate who founded the Darwin Awards has suggested that awardees may perhaps unwittingly be engaged in some form of altruistic behavior By sacrificing themselves  or their ability to reproduce  they have contributed the survival of the species We believe this view to be flawed write the authors who were led in their analysis by Ben Alexander Daniel Lendrem a student at the   in northeast England Nevertheless the authors wrote the nowdemonstrated phenomenon of Male Idiocy should be seen in evolutionary terms
