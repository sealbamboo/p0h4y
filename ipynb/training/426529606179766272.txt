The nations uninsured rate dropped modestly this month as the major coverage expansion under President Barack Obamas health care law got underway according to a closely watched survey released Thursday The Gallup numbers could be the first evidence that core provisions of Obamas muchdebated law have started delivering on the promise of access for nearly all Americans The   found that the uninsured rate for US adults dropped by  percentage points in January to  percent The biggest change was for unemployed people a drop of  percentage points That was followed by a  percentagepoint decline for nonwhites Traditionally both groups are far more likely to be uninsured than the population as a whole The survey of  people found no appreciable change among young adults ages  Members of that coveted lowcost demographic have been ambivalent about signing up so far The overall drop in the uninsured rate would translate to approximately  million to  million people gaining coverage Major elements of the health care law took effect with the new year Virtually all Americans are now required to get covered or risk fines Insurers can no longer turn away people with health problems New statebased markets are offering taxpayersubsidized insurance to middleclass households Medicaid signups are also rising Thats partly because of a program expansion accepted by half the states and partly as a consequence of previously eligible but unenrolled people now forced to comply with the laws individual coverage mandate The uninsured rate had been expected to come down as the Affordable Care Act was implemented said Frank Newport Gallups editorinchief That would be the most reasonable hypothesis Nonetheless Newport said it could take a calendar quarter  three months  to discern a full trend Other factors could also be behind the shift including an improving economy Its a drop but not extraordinary said Newport The glass is half full for proponents of the Affordable Care Act because things are moving in the right direction But the glass is half empty because things havent moved much The increase in coverage among unemployed people comports with what the Affordable Care Act was intended to do he added Gallups numbers are not comparable to various figures cited by the Obama administration estimates that have ranged as high as  million people benefiting The administrations numbers include   in the new insurance exchanges Medicaid enrollees and young adults who can stay on a parents plan until they turn  But some of those people may have been insured previously they either had to switch coverage because of the law or they joined a new plan because it turned out to be a better deal The coverage rollout has been a  for Obama and congressional Democrats who battled to pass the law four years ago against lockstep Republican opposition The federal enrollment website serving  states went down when it was launched Oct  and it took two months to make needed fixes Meanwhile at least  million people had their existing individual policies canceled because those plans didnt meet the laws requirements Republicans hoped Obamacare would implode The story still could take unexpected turns because open enrollment season doesnt end until March  While the technical problems with HealthCaregov have largely been cleared up insurers are still reporting glitches And consumers getting familiar with the new plans are finding that some tightly restrict their choices of doctors and hospitals The GallupHealthways survey found that the uninsured rate dropped in January across major subgroups Women saw a decline of  percentage points about three times greater than the  percentagepoint drop for men Uninsured rates also fell all along the income ladder with those making  seeing the greatest drop  percentage points The survey was based on telephone interviews from Jan  with a random sample of  adults aged  and older in all  states and the District of Columbia For results based on the total national sample the margin of sampling error is plus or minus  percentage point
