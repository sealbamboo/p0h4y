When sweeping new advice on preventing heart attacks and strokes came out last November it wasnt clear how many more Americans should be taking daily statin pills to lower their risk A   provides an answer a whole lot Nearly  million more to be precise If the   were followed to the letter about half of all Americans over  would be on cholesterollowering statins  more than double the current level Even more striking the new recommendations would make prescription of the drugs almost universal among older men What was personally most surprising to me is that it turns out the difference between the old and new guidelines is very small in younger adults   to  says Duke University biostatistician   lead author of the study The vast majority of those affected by the new guidelines are between  and  he says So much so that  percent of men  to  and  percent of women in that age range should be on statins The great majority of Americans newly recommended for statin treatment have no known heart disease Pencina and his colleagues say The analysis was published online Wednesday by the  Statin drugs are pretty cheap these days Most are generics Common doses of atorvastatin the generic form of Lipitor can be had for  cents a day Older statins cost even less Still the number of potential patients is so huge that the recommended expansion in treatment has major cost implications If all those newly recommended for treatment got the drugs the expansion would cost from  billion to  billion a year more than the price tag under the old guidelines which is  billion to  billion depending on cost assumptions for a years worth of the drugs In fact far from everybody eligible for treatment under the previous guidelines is taking statins Pencina and his colleagues calculate that  percent of adults between  and  are on statins now  about  percent of the recommended number About  million people take statins now at an annual cost of about  billion to  billion The new guidelines more than double the potential number of statintakers to  million people Pencina says over  years the change in statin use could potentially prevent nearly a halfmillion heart attacks strokes and cardiovascular deaths He thinks the benefit could be worth the lifetime cost of statin treatment which he thinks could be well below the cost of treating the victims of heart attacks and strokes over their remaining lifetimes Were going to identify more people at truly high risk and give them more statins so well potentially prevent more cardiovascular deaths Pencina says But the price will be a good deal of overtreatment We will treat a fair amount of people who will not have developed the disease he says And the drugs   including an increased risk for developing diabetes The new guidelines formulated by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are a major departure from those in place for decades They throw out the notion that doctors should prescribe cholesterollowering drugs when a patients LDL or   reaches a certain threshold  in recent years above  Instead the new guidelines say everybody with known heart disease should be taking statins And for adults over  without known cardiovascular disease the new trigger for statin use is a year risk of heart attack or stroke of  percent or more according to a new   The old guidelines using a different calculator prescribed statin use at a year risk above  percent along with an LDLcholesterol reading above  Under the new guidelines statin therapy is urged for everybody over  who has diabetes The drugs are also recommended for younger adults if their LDL cholesterol is over  Its not yet clear what the impact of the new recommendations has been Theyre complicated for doctors and patients to understand and theyre controversial in the medical community Ive hear very varied responses Pencina says Some say the guidelines overtreat in the older age group And I have colleagues who say the guidelines dont go far enough in the younger age group The new analysis used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination surveys to estimate the effect of the current cholesterol guidelines
