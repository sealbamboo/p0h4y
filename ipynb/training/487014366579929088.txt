The total doses of antibiotics sold in clinics and pharmacies around the world rose  percent from  to  scientists reported Wednesday The finding   in   comes from the first study to look at global antibiotic consumption in the st century And it seems like good news right More people in poor countries are getting livesaving drugs says the studys lead author   who directs the Center for Disease Dynamics Economics  Policy Thats absolutely good news But the worlds insatiable need for penicillin and Cipro also has a dark side the rise in drugresistant bacteria Now even the lastresort antibiotics  the ones that are used after all others fail  are in jeopardy of losing their effectiveness Laxminarayan says The concern is that the consumption of lastresort drugs has also gone up significantly since  he says If drug resistance develops to these antibiotics we have nothing else left to use Over the past decade bacteria have evolved to evade nearly every type of antibiotic Most of us are familiar with   methicillinresistant   which causes deadly skin infections But theres also a superbug version of   and a vicious gut pathogen called   or CRE which may kill up to  percent of people it infects Doctors still have a few potent weapons against these pathogens such as cephalosporins for gonorrhea and polymixins for CRE But to keep these antibiotics effective we need to make sure their use is limited These are second and thirdline drugs that need to be used carefully Laxminarayan says Unfortunately theres not a lot of guidance for how these drugs are being used The current study found that threequarters of the increase in antibiotic consumption occurred in Brazil Russia India China and South Africa  countries where most people have incomes high enough to buy the drugs Lastresort antibiotics are available overthecounter throughout these nations Even when a doctor is required to give a prescription theres no guarantee the drug is being used appropriately Laxminarayan says Theres really no evidence that physicians are better gatekeepers of antibiotics than pharmacists Laxminarayan and his colleagues analyzed pharmaceutical sales of  antibiotics in  countries over the year period Overall India and China are now the two largest consumers of the antibiotics for human use The US isnt far behind in third place And the US still has the highest per capita use in the world The study couldnt tease out the cases in which the drugs were taken appropriately to treat bacterial infections from the times when they were wrongly prescribed for viruses or other types of infections And the study didnt look at the use of antibiotics on farms So the estimates are only minimum values Theres potentially a massive increase on farms and we have no idea whats going on there Laxminarayan says Were working on a study about that now But its too soon to say anything Antibiotics are a natural resource just like fossil fuels Laxminarayan says As we run out finding new ones will be hard and expensive Penicillin costs pennies Newer antibiotics may cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars
