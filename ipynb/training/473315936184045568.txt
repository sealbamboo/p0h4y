Some antismoking advocates fear the rise of a new batterypowered Joe Camel as researchers find that more young people are being exposed to unregulated electronic cigarette ads mixed in with popular TV shows More than four decades after President Richard Nixon banned ads for tobacco cigarettes on radio and television the airwaves are burning up with ecigarette ads targeted at adolescents and young adults according to a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics This is what we saw back in the s and s and the study is deeply concerning to me says Matthew Myers president of the Washington DCbased Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids Congress banned this TV ads precisely because of the unique impact it can have on kids Ecigarettes are doing the exact same thing Researchers from RTI International found that kids aged  to  experienced a  percent increase in exposure to ads touting ecigs during the study period of  to  The exposure of young adults those ages  increased by  percent Unlike traditional cigarettes esmoke advertising is not federally regulated The cylindrical vaporizers werent around when the big tobacco companies regularly made headlines over their advertising tactics But now according to the researchers marketers are using the power of the small screen to promote various brands in a similar fashion to what was aired when tobacco was king Today though more than  percent of ecig ads were shown on cable networks including AMC Country Music Television Comedy Central WGN America TV Land and VH Researchers also found that ecigarette ads appeared on programs like The Bachelor Big Brother and Survivor all of which were among the  highestrated youth programs for the  TV season More than  percent of the ads were for a single brand blu eCigs To figure out just how pervasive ecigarette TV ads were during the last few years the researchers used a standard unit of TV exposure measurement called Target Rating Points or TRPs These points are measured for a specified audience as a function of an ads reach basically the proportion of people exposed to an advertisement as well as frequency or the number of times an advertisement is potentially viewed The researchers used a common measurement to gauge how many people saw an ecigarette and how often they likely saw it Based on that data they estimated that  percent of all kids between the ages of  to  in US TV households were exposed to an average of  ecigarette ads from October  through September  They also say data could represent an exposure to an average of  advertisements for  percent of all US youth or an exposure to an average of  ads for  of all US youth over the year period Those numbers have researchers and other public health advocates worried We dont know the extent to which an ecigarette is really a gateway to other tobacco products explains lead researcher Dr Jennifer Duke senior public health analyst at RTI What we do know is that nicotine spurs changes in the brain that leads to addiction And no one knows what the ramifications of ecigarettes and potential addiction will be Indeed ecigs are growing in popularity with about  billion in sales as of August  As of  an estimated  million middle and high school students had ever used ecigarettes according to the researchers With tobacco companies like Lorillard which bought blu eCigs entering into the mix makers of ecigs have gone Hollywood with celebrity endorsers like Jenny McCarthy and Stephen Dorff touting the benefits of blu and punk queen Courtney Love plugging another brand called NJOYs For doctors on the frontlines of treating and preventing disease among children and young adults the prevalence of ecig use among youth is one more battle they must fight to try and keep kids healthy This whole study is tremendously concerning to me says pediatrician Dr Deb Lonzer of Cleveland Clinic Childrens Celebrities have enormous power and they are touting the benefits of smoking Im just a nerdy little pediatrician how can I compete with some celebrity or the deep pockets of a tobacco company Neuroscientists now recognize that adolescent brains are still developing and dont reach full maturity until the early s The last part of the brain to develop includes areas linked to impulse control and planning Just because a young person has a cell phone like an adult or holds down a job like an adult does not mean they are adults in terms of a mature brain Lonzer said That means they cant make decisions like an adult and when they are exposed repeatedly to things that seem to be the social norm trust me they will try those things According to a report released by the antismoking organization Legacy ecig manufacturers spent  million in advertising from June through September  much of it targeted to youth Although some manufacturers would welcome regulation they do dispute they target Americas young The products are being advertised to adults   executive director of the Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association If children are watching during that time its possible but they are being marketed to adult consumers to adult smokers
