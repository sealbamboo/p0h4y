Many potential new drugs look like they could be big winners  at least when judged by how well they work in mice or other lab animals Over the years there have been a number of promising cancer cures possible Alzheimers treatments and candidate drugs for holding back the ravages of various degenerative diseases But time after time these great promises fade away once the potential treatments are tried in people There are lots of reasons for that Humans arent rodents for starters But now the National Institutes of Health is targeting a more subtle problem in animal studies Labs often dont consider that the   of the animal could also influence research findings There are obvious sex differences in people when it comes to disease Lowdose aspirin affects men and women differently It appears that some of the gene variants that increase the risk of Alzheimers are more potent in women than in men And women are more likely than men to have bad reactions to drugs It should be no surprise then that mice and other lab animals also have sex differences in their response to drugs and diseases Yet scientists often dont take that into account when planning their laboratory studies In fact sometimes they deliberately choose male mice because scientists worry that the cycling reproductive hormones in female animals might make it harder to interpret the results It also appears that males are sometimes favored because thats simply the conventional thing to do Enough says   director of the Office of Research on Womens Health at NIH and NIH Director   Theyre starting to roll out new guidelines to make sure that research on animals  as well as on tissue samples taken from animals  takes into account potential differences between the sexes Clayton and Collins laid out their plans this week in a   These days following an abysmal history of ignoring women in clinical trials in the late th century a bit more than half of all participants in NIHfunded studies are women But there has not been a corresponding revolution in experimental design and analyses in cell and animal research  despite multiple calls to action Clayton and Collins write Scientists who do the research often ignore the issue so do colleagues who review the studies And scientific journals also dont demand that scientists state the gender of animals used in the studies they publish NIH is now developing policies to make sure that scientists who use NIH funding for research take animal gender into account Clayton and Collins say the policies will be rolled out in phases beginning in October  It wont be a cureall Researchers have   other serious shortcomings with animal studies Many are done with so little rigor that they cant be reproduced by other scientists It also  that the gender of the researcher handling the animal can sometimes affect results But getting rid of gender bias in the animals  and their cells  is one way to nibble away at this problem
