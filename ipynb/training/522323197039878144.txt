A second healthcare worker in the US state of Texas has tested positive for Ebola health officials have said Both health workers treated Liberian man Thomas Eric Duncan who died last week after becoming the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US A senior Dallas official said there was a real possibility of further cases and contingencies were being prepared Meanwhile the UNs Ebola mission chief says the world is falling behind in the race to contain the virus The World Health Organization WHO says  people have died from the outbreak mainly in West Africa Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea have been hardest hit by the outbreak which began in December  but was confirmed in March President Barack Obama is due to hold a video conference with British French German and Italian leaders to discuss the Ebola crisis later on Wednesday  The identity of the second Texas health worker has not yet been revealed But Texas health officials said she was a woman who lived alone without pets  The disposition of the pets of people infected with Ebola has been a concern  the first woman infected in the US with Ebola had a dog as did a nurse infected in a Spanish hospital In Dallas the second infected healthcare worker was placed in isolation within  minutes of reporting a fever Daniel Varga the chief clinical officer of hospital operator Texas Health Resources told a joint news conference that she was involved in the care of Mr Duncan and was exposed to the virus some time during his treatment But Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said the authorities were preparing for more possible cases We are preparing contingencies for more and that is a very real possibility he said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said it might take time to deal with the outbreak but the authorities were not fearful We can only beat this moment by moment person by person detail by detail he said at the news conference It may get worse before it gets better but it will get better Last weekend officials said nurse Nina Pham  had been exposed to Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where she was involved in Mr Duncans care Doctors at the hospital said she was doing well on Tuesday This is a reminder that Ebola is a dangerous threat even within some of the best hospitals in world  This is the second case of transmission in Texas on top of the case in Spain Protective gear should minimise the risk to health workers treating Ebola patients But worryingly there have been reports of staff not getting the correct equipment or the necessary training These isolated cases should not become an outbreak as authorities in both countries are monitoring those who came into contact with infected people But each new case of transmission is asking the question  is enough being done to protect healthcare workers A total of  healthcare workers were being monitored for symptoms following the second diagnosed case linked to Duncan Mr Varga refused to comment on allegations from nurses at the Dallas hospital that health workers had been without adequate protective clothing for days during the outbreak  The nurses also said they had received little guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus that Duncan was not immediately isolated from other patients when he was admitted to the hospital a second time and that medical waste was allowed to pile up at least once  It comes after CDC chief Thomas Frieden said there had been a breach of protocol by health workers that led to Ms Phams infection The CDC is saying that protocols were breached but the nurses are saying there were no protocols the head of the national nurses union Roseann DeMoro told reporters on Tuesday There have been  Ebola cases overall including the fatal cases and the WHO says it expects this number to top  by the end of the week  Anthony Banbury told a special session of the UN Security Council on Tuesday that if Ebola was not stopped now the world would face an entirely unprecedented situation for which we do not have a plan In other developments The WHO estimates its figures by taking the numbers of confirmed cases and multiplying them  from Guinea by  from Sierra Leone by  and from Liberia by   to account for underreporting
