 Scientists served MMs to rats in an experiment that showed the brain cant resist sweet and fatty foods The University of Michigan researchers said the urge to overeat tasty treats comes from an unexpected area of the brain called the neostriatum which produces an opiumlike chemical that enhances such desire and may be partly responsible for   among people Previously people thought this area of the brain was only involved in motor function and learning but we found its involved in motivation and generating instant consumption said lead researcher Alexandra DiFeliceantonio a graduate student in biopsychology at the university This finding might have implications for people she added noting that it may be possible in the future to target the area with a drug that could block the impulse to overeat and thus may help people lose   Experts note however that results in animal studies often dont translate to humans The new report was published Sept  in the journal   For the study DiFeliceantonio and her colleagues gave lab rats a drug to artificially boost the action of the neostriatum The animals were then given MMs and proceeded to eat twice as many as they normally would she said Thats the same as a pound human eating seven pounds of MMs in an hour DiFeliceantonio said In addition the researchers noted that the amount of a chemical called enkephalin produced in the neostriatum increased when the animals ate the chocolate treats It is the increased production of this chemical that increases the desire to overeat sweet and fatty foods DiFeliceantonio said When presented with a choice of usual food or MMs the rats with high levels of the chemical consistently ignored their regular food and gorged on chocolates Preferring sweet and   is probably one of the things that helped humans to thrive said Dr David Katz director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center in New Haven Conn We tend to like flavors such as sweet that in nature are associated with lifesustaining foods and tend to dislike flavors such as bitter more often associated with toxins he said The impulses that once helped keep our ancestors from starving however now may contribute to eating disorders and epidemic   Katz added But the fault here is not with the world within us which is the same as it ever was he said It is with what and how much people eat which has made the brains natural functioning backfire rather badly Another expert thinks the research could have implications for addiction and obesity Paul Sanberg director of the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair at the University of South Florida College of Medicine in Tampa said the findings suggest areas of the human brain that might be looked at for eating disorders or addiction
