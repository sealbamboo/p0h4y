Consumers are likely to believe that whole grain canned pasta organic candy and soda that contains antioxidants are more healthful than the same products without those buzzwords on the labels researchers say People say they want to make healthful choices but food marketers are taking advantage of them by misleading those consumers with deceptive labeling said Temple Northup assistant professor in communications at the University of Houston and author of a study published Tuesday in the journal Food Studies  An earlier version of this post misspelled the last name of University of Houston assistant communications professor Temple Northup as Northrup  We live in a labeled world said   an assistant professor of communications at Cornell University who was not involved with the study Food manufacturers have invested heavily in getting people to buy their products that is their job he said At the end of the day its still soda If you dont want your children consuming sugar you shouldnt give it to them whether it has antioxidants or not Schuldt said Northup was motivated by the idea that overconsumption of unhealthful foods is a major contributor to obesity and its attendant diseases including diabetes He used Chef Boyardee a ConAgra label as an illustration In  he wrote its commercials began showing parents trying to hide the healthful aspects of the canned pastas including vegetable content from their children with mothers worried that telling the children about the vegetables would ruin their favorite afternoon snack The commercials place a health halo around the pastas that is not justified Northup said He notes that the Chef Boyardee beef ravioli claims to contain a full serving of vegetables The ingredient label lists tomatoes and carrots  though the carrots rank behind salt in volume This is presumably not what consumers have in mind when they pick up a product boasting of its vegetable contents and nutritional value he writes The soda analyzed in the study Up cherry antioxidant was taken off the market last year to maintain consistency with other company products Chris Barnes a company spokesman said in an email ConAgra did not comment in response to requests But the Grocery Manufacturers Assn trade group issued a statement saying that industry government parents communities and healthcare providers all must help solve the problem of obesity Americas food and beverage companies enthusiastically support First Lady Michelle Obamas goal and in recent years we have accelerated our efforts to provide consumers with the products tools and information they need to achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle the statement said The trade group said it agrees with and supports federal laws requiring food labels to be truthful and nonmisleading and that its claims are meant to provide positive dietary guidance messages to consumers Food packages contain nutrition panels usually on the side or back of a product that lists what the federal government has required in nutrients calories serving size and ingredients Northups study looked at those panels and at the words that appear on the front of packages A total of  undergraduates completed an online survey looking at packages and at nutrition panels They were asked to look at two versions of a product the real one and the same one with words such as organic or whole grain removed The participants found every version with the words included to be significantly more healthful the study said Some examples Annies Bunny Fruit Snacks with and without organic cherry Up with and without antioxidants and Tostitos tortilla chips with and without all natural Then they were asked to look at two nutrition panels They were told the category such as cereal but not the name of the product They were asked to rate healthfulness Based just on those numbers  of participants chose Spam as more healthful than salmon for example Seventynine percent chose the less healthful cereal in a pair But participants did choose juice over soda and carrots over potato chips Theres a lot of support backing up and complementing those findings Schuldt said Tuesday It builds on the psychological theory that people assume all sorts of wonderful things about beautiful people Applied to food people might assume a food labeled lowcholesterol was nutritious in ways that have no relation to cholesterol he said He cited research that people viewed chocolate labeled fair trade  a way to evaluate the social ethics of a company  as having fewer calories Rationally it doesnt make any sense but psychologically it makes a lot of sense Schuldt said Consumers are confused and no one wants to spend much time doing arithmetic to compare labels while they shop Northup said Eight grams of sugar Is that a bad thing or a good thing Another issue can be serving size The canned pasta in the study was labeled as containing two servings per can Northup said Not to out my mom but we ate those all the time when I was growing up We opened a can and ate the whole thing unaware of the serving recommendation Northup suggested solutions including consumer education improved labeling and corporate responsibility It is perhaps time that the food industry take responsibility for how they market their foods and acknowledge the role they play in keeping consumers in the United States misinformed about what is healthy to eat he wrote Studies like Northups can empower consumers Schuldt said If labels really do have these effects dont submit yourself to them he said suggesting people shop for whole foods that dont make health claims such as fresh produce The required labeling is under review by the government and reforms are expected Some other countries have adopted a traffic light labeling system with red for eat rarely yellow with caution and green for the most healthful foods Northup said he does not expect such a system to be mandated in the United States
