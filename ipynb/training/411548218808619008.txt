I was planning to devote this weeks Recipes for Health to walnuts as the California walnut harvest took place just a few weeks ago and the walnuts I am buying in my farmers market couldnt be fresher well they could be a little fresher  slightly moist the way fresh undried walnuts are sold in French produce markets But the California growers dry their nuts before sending them to market as the spoilage risk for moist fresh walnuts is high I began working on recipes and once I had written out and begun testing I realized that each dish was a winter greens recipe that included walnuts The two foods go wonderfully together Greens and brassicas are the vegetables that I rely on from November through February in California and on into April in colder climates The walnuts and greens combo packs an impressive nutritional punch whether you are adding the omega rich walnuts to a salad made with equally omega rich mche and antioxidantrich radicchio or a kale and cabbage coleslaw or grinding them with basil in a pesto to toss with broccoli and pasta or combining the walnuts with other seeds and spices in a dukkah to sprinkle over cooked spinach I also combined walnuts with kale rice and black quinoa in a delicious wonderfully textured mixed grains risotto  Here are five new ways to add walnuts to your meal 
 
 
  A salad that is high in omegas and doesnt need much dressing 
  Small broccoli florets soak up the sauce in a delicious way in this creamy dish 
  A briny slaw that gets its crunch from red cabbage and walnuts 
  A healthy dish inspired by a favorite Middle Eastern spinach recipe
