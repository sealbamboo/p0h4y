Doctors at Londons Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bonemarrow transplant technique  They say the method should help with donor shortages since it does not require a perfect cell match  Mohammed Ahmed who is nearly five years old was among the first three children in the world to try out the new treatment  He has severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and had been waiting for a suitable donor for years Mohammed who lives in Milton Keynes was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital when he was a year old His condition  a weak immune system  makes him more susceptible to infections than most and a bone marrow transplant is the only known treatment  While Mohammed was on the transplant waiting list he became extremely sick with swine flu  At that time his doctors decided Mohammeds only real hope was to have a mismatched bonemarrow transplant with his father acting as the donor  Mohammeds dad Jamil agreed to give the experimental therapy a go  Before giving his donation Jamil was first vaccinated against swine flu so that his own bonemarrow cells would know how to fight the infection  Mohammeds doctors then modified these donated immune cells called Tcells in the lab to engineer a safety switch  a selfdestruct message that could be activated if Mohammeds body should start to reject them once transplanted  Rejection or graftvhost disease is a serious complication of bonemarrow transplants particularly where tissue matching between donor and recipient is not perfect and is one of the most difficult challenges faced by patients and their doctors Mismatched transplants in children  where the donor is not a close match for the child  are usually depleted of Tcells to prevent graftvhost disease but this causes problems in terms of virus infections and leukaemia relapse  The safety switch gets round this  plenty of Tcells to be transfused and later killed off if problems do arise  Thankfully the transplant carried out in  was a success  Mohammeds doctors did not need to use the safety switch  Although Mohammed still has to take a number of medicines to ward off future infections his immune system is now in better shape  Jamil said We waited for a full match but it did not come By the grace of God we took the decision to have the treatment  Now he is all right Sometimes we forget what he has been through We are just so grateful He said Mohammed would still need close monitoring and regular health checks over the coming years but his outlook was good  Dr Waseem Qasim consultant in paediatric immunology at Great Ormond Street Hospital and lead author for the study said the new approach should hopefully mean children who received a mismatched transplant could enjoy the same chance of success as those given a fully matched transplant  We think Mohammed is cured of his disorder He should be able to lead a fairly normal life now A full report about Mohammeds therapy and the research by Great Ormond Street Hospital Kings College London and the Institute of Child Health has just been published in PLoS One journal  There are currently about  people in the UK waiting for a bonemarrow transplant and  worldwide Just  of people will find a matching donor from within their families Donations involve collecting blood from a vein or aspirating bone marrow from the pelvis using a needle and syringe
