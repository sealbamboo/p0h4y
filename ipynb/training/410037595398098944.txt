Alcohol is still killing the equivalent of  people a week in Scotland despite a fall in boozerelated deaths it has been warned NHS Health Scotland called for further action to ensure that reductions in alcohol deaths continue There were more than  recorded in  The organisation has published its third annual report on Scotlands alcohol strategy The Scottish government said the harm caused by alcohol was still too high Alcoholrelated deaths and hospital discharge rates in Scotland have declined in recent years but death rates are still twice what they were in the s and higher than in England and Wales  Alcohol sales also remained  higher than in England and Wales driven by the purchase of more offsales spirits particularly vodka But new analysis also cited the economic downturn as a factor in alcohol affordability and the current decline in death rates and illness Despite improvements NHS Health Scotland said women aged  years were not experiencing the same improvements in hospital discharge rates particularly for alcoholic liver disease  The report also noted that significant sales of cheap strong alcohol continued  In   of alcohol sold in Scotlands supermarkets shops and off licenses was sold at below p per unit the initial level proposed by the Scottish government for minimum pricing Clare Beeston principal public health adviser at NHS Health Scotland said It is pleasing that overall alcohol related deaths rates are falling  However there were still over  alcoholrelated deaths in  with the equivalent of  people dying every week as a direct result of alcohol This is still too many Furthermore in the  months to end of March  nearly  people were hospitalised at least once due to alcohol It is also worrying that the rates of hospitalisation for women aged  years have been increasing recently Neil Craig public health adviser at NHS Health Scotland and one of the reports authors said the most deprived groups in Scotland experienced the biggest falls in deaths  Our findings suggest this may be because these groups experienced falls in income that started before the recession in  he added  If so as the economy picks up recent reductions in sales and harms might not be sustained especially if affordability starts to rise again after the recession Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen by  over the past three years  Speaking on BBC radios Good Morning Scotland programme Health Secretary Alex Neil attributed the fall in alcoholrelated deaths and admissions to recent government policies He said this included the abolition of multibuy promotions and an increase in the use of Alcohol Brief Interventions  when health professionals speak directly to patients or clients and urge them to consider changing their drinking habits However he said that until something was done about price we wont crack this problem Theres very clear evidence here that there remains a very strong link between the price of alcohol and the consumption of alcohol particularly cheap drinks that do so much harm to people he said Its about breaking that link which is why we need minimum unit pricing The Scottish Parliament has passed legislation which seeks to introduce a minimum price of p per unit  The plan has faced legal challenges from European wine and spirit producers and the Scotch Whisky Association Scottish Labours public health spokesman Dr Richard Simpson said the Scottish government had pinned all their hopes on minimum unit pricing which is currently languishing in the courts We cant wait to see what happens so we are working on a members bill that would tackle alcohol abuse head on and we would encourage all concerned parties to back our proposals he said He said the issue needed to be addressed with a fullyrounded plan that included tighter advertising controls caffeine limits in premixed drinks and a crackdown on those who buy alcohol for underage drinkers Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said This report illustrates once again Scotlands grave relationship with alcohol We need the Scottish government to lead from the front with conviction on this critical matter It says it wants to try minimum pricing something we supported but nothing has happened since it was passed more than  days ago The SNP has to come clean on what is happening with this initiative If it has been dropped now is the time to introduce other measures in its place otherwise there will be a risk of even more deaths Meanwhile the Scotch Whisky Association SWA is to launch a  action fund to tackle alcoholrelated harm in Scottish communities The trade body said the move extended its commitment to addressing misuse and promoting responsible drinking A total of  will be made available each year until  to projects run by charities and other organisations working to reduce alcoholrelated harm  SWA said the action fund would back projects delivering targeted interventions to tackle harm among young people aged  and under families affected by misuse and communities suffering as a result of irresponsible or excessive consumption of alcohol
