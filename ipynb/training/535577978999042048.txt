A lot of us make the assumption that there are two kinds of drinkers moderate drinkers who have a glass of wine with dinner and on the other end of the spectrum alcoholics But this is not an accurate picture according to researchers The reality of the situation is that most adults who drink theyre drinking maybe a couple drinks during week and then typically drinking larger amounts on weekends says   an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and coauthor of a new   published in   And what that means is that  in  adults drinks excessively What counts as excessive Less than you might think Women who consume eight or more drinks per week are considered excessive drinkers And for men excess is defined as  or more drinks a week The researchers defined a drink as just  ounces of wine  ounces of beer or  ounces of spirits So say I have a smallish glass of wine with dinner most nights of the week Then I go out on Saturday night and have a cocktail and a beer or maybe more wine Does this means I am drinking excessively Thats correct as a woman if you were to drink eight or more drinks per week that is considered in the category of excessive drinking Brewer says Turns out a lot of us are not the moderate drinkers we thought we were Now Brewer points out that most excessive drinkers follow much more of a bingelike pattern where theyre drinking four or more drinks per occasion And from a health perspective the more people drink to excess the higher their risks Brewer points to a host of diseases that are linked to excessive alcohol use over time This could include breast cancer for example liver disease liver cancer heart disease to name a few Excessive alcohol consumption according to the CDC is responsible for  deaths per year and costs the US more than  billion Now theres also a surprising finding to the new study  percent of excessive drinkers are not alcohol dependent ie alcoholics This study shows that contrary to popular opinion most people who drink too much are not alcohol dependent says Brewer This means that despite drinking a lot of alcohol they dont experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking nor do they report an increased tolerance for alcohol There are several other criteria for alcohol dependence as well The findings are based on survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health About  participants were asked a series of questions about their drinking patterns and alcohol dependence Researchers acknowledge that some participants could have underestimated their consumption or dependency But Brewer says its important to understand that the excessive drinkers who are not alcohol dependent are unlikely to need addiction treatment They may also respond to interventions such as increased alcohol taxes to drink less
