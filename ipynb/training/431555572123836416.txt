San Franciscos Chinatown is a city within a city Built by immigrants in the latter half of the th century Chinatown was a refuge from the eras vicious prejudice But the crowded blocks of Chinatown were also a kind of prison Chinese residents feared leaving the area after dark and they were barred from local schools and the citys hospitals  even during an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco It was painfully clear that when it came to medical care they had to provide for themselves Chinese Hospital Association really formed back in  back in the days when really a lot of the residents in Chinatown didnt have access to modern health care says Larry Loo the director of business development and operations for   On a recent winter day Loo dashes through a maze of alleyways to Chinese Hospital In its early days the hospital was called the   and it was the only facility offering Western medicine inside Chinatowns gates The dispensary was destroyed in the  earthquake and rebuilt in  Even after ChineseAmericans and other Asian immigrants were welcomed elsewhere in San Francisco loyalty for the hospital endured Even   was born there The great thing about the hospital here is the staff can speak multiple languages The doctors speak multiple languages Your pharmacy speaks multiple languages says Loo And he adds with a laugh that it also has very good Chinese food The hospital now runs its own health insurance company called Chinese Community Health Plan and its competing against wellknown brands like Anthem Blue Cross in Californias health insurance marketplace The Chinese Community Health Plan is tiny by industry standards with just  members It has long sold health coverage to Medicare beneficiaries and local businesses but it is finding success with a new group of customers young uninsured Chinese immigrants who work in the citys restaurants laundries and produce shops At a nearby insurance enrollment center in Chinatown there is a steady line of people waiting to buy coverage Erika Zhou  sits across a desk from Sam Ho who is an enrollment specialist for people shopping on the states insurance exchange Zhou emigrated from China to the US a year and a half ago received her green card and has since found a steady job as a waitress Her job doesnt come with health insurance and like many people in Chinatowns tightknit community Khou is keenly aware that she could face federal tax penalties for failure to have medical coverage Ho shows Zhou her coverage options on a computer screen HealthNet Anthem Blue Cross Kaiser Permanente The Chinese Community Health Plan appears in Chinese characters Zhou earns too much to qualify for a subsidy and she picks the Chinese plan since its the lowest price by far and she doesnt expect to use it much I didnt go anywhere to see doctor Zhou says I didnt get sick for whole year Although Zhou is beginning to learn English she says she wants to speak to her doctors in Cantonese if she were to get sick Language access is critical to ChineseAmericans Among the many immigrant groups in the US they are among the least likely to speak English Although Asian Americans make up  percent of the   in San Francisco   and the vast majority of them are Chinese That could explain Chinese Community Health Plans remarkable success selling policies on Californias   The company has surpassed its signup goal for the entire year before the end of January Irene Louie director of member services says the walkin center off a bustling street in Chinatown caters to Chinese sensibilities We like to talk to people in person Louie says Facetoface Just get it over with it Have the question and resolved right away There are other cultural distinctions When customers do call in its considered impolite to ask their first name or other personal details at the beginning of a conversation And dont expect sterling customer reviews Even though the service  and the hospitals famed rice porridge  might be excellent Louie says ChineseAmericans are tough customers We tell them  to  how do you like the service They will say I will give you a  And then we ask Why can you give us higher score than  They say Oh no no no I think  is very good They are afraid if I give you the highest score then you wont make any improvement Louie says Any bitterness among ChineseAmericans over the years of exclusion from San Franciscos hospitals has long since subsided says the health plans Larry Loo In fact he hopes to attract nonChinese customers to the health plan Even though the delivery system has a strong mission to ensure Chinese community is taken care of its still here to serve everyone else Still Chinatown is investing in its own once again A new more modern Chinese Hospital is under construction
