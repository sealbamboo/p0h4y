A Washington state firm is recalling more than 100 tons of dried egg products because they may be contaminated with salmonella, federal health officials said.. Nutriom LLC of Lacey, Wash., issued the voluntary recall of some 226,710 pounds of egg products that were shipped nationwide and to U.S. military installations in the country and abroad as well as to Canada.. U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection officials designated it as a Class 1 recall, which means it carries a high health risk. However, no illnesses have been reported so far in connection with the products to the firm or to health officials. Salmonella infections can range from mild to severe and may be dangerous to children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.. The dried egg products were made in the past year, between Feb. 28, 2013 and Feb. 8, 2014. They are labeled with “INSPECTED EGG PRODUCTS PLANT 21493G” inside the USDA mark of inspection.. The problem was discovered by Washington state laboratories in response to a billing inquiry by Nutriom LLC. The laboratory then notified FSIS personnel of the discrepancies in laboratory results.. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare and consume egg products that have been cooked to a temperature of 160° F.
