Viruses are masters at mutating So the big concern with deadly viruses like Ebola and hepatitis C is that they will evolve into more dangerous forms over time It looks like just the opposite is happening with HIV  although its happening slowly HIV can generate any mutation in the book on any day says virologist   at the University of Oxford Over a year period HIV has picked up mutations that make it slightly less virulent in parts of southern Africa Goulder and his team   Monday in the   That means it could take a little longer for some people to develop AIDS if they dont get HIV treatment The mutations push back the average time to develop AIDS in Botswana from about  years to about  years Goulder says It doesnt sound like a big deal he says But those changes in the virus occurred in just  years If we roll forward a few decades the evolution of the virus could have a massive effect Well have to see if the trend continues Right now though HIV is still deadly and dangerous Goulder is quick to point out Although these findings are good news and a step in right direction he says it may be decades even centuries before   stops causing AIDS Thats a long long way down stream To figure out how HIV has changed over time Goulder and his team sequenced the virus genes from about  women in Botswana and South Africa The HIV epidemic started in Botswana about a decade earlier than in South Africa During those extra  years the virus picked up mutations that help it evade the human immune system That sounds like a bad sign But those mutations came at a cost for the virus Goulder says They crippled HIV The mutations picked up in Botswana slightly slow down the speed at which the virus replicates inside a persons blood Goulder and his team found The speed drop by about  percent on average That small slowdown could make a difference in whether someones immune system can control the virus or not says virologist   of the Ragon Institute in Cambridge Mass A small effect like that could have a substantial clinical impact says Allen who wasnt involved in the study The effect gets magnified because it occurs every time the virus replicates Scientists have observed these same crippling mutations in HIV for years inside the lab Allen says But this study demonstrates that this evolution happens outside the lab and on a larger scale Its the first time scientists have really shown that HIV is slowly losing its oomph on a population level he says The findings Allen says also offer new clues for developing an    a task thats been fraught with failure This study adds to the understanding of whats required to control HIV he says It highlights the parts of the virus that we should be targeting to start crippling HIV with new drugs or even a vaccine Those clues he says may prove more important for ending HIV than the natural evolution of the virus
