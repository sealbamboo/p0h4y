The Food and Drug Administration has backed away from new rules requiring doctors to treat human stool as an unapproved drug meaning fecal transplants used to treat lifethreatening gut infections can continue as planned in the US FDA officials said this week that the agency will not enforce new requirements to obtain investigational new drug applications or INDs before doctors can perform the procedure that uses doses of donor stool to repopulate infected colons with healthy bacteria  However doctors must document that theyve informed patients suffering from recurrent infections caused by a nasty germ known as C difficile about the risks and benefits of the procedure  In short the physician at minimum must inform the patient that the procedure is investigational said Curtis Allen a spokesman for the FDA  The move came after pressure from groups like the American Gastroenterological Association whose members said that the requirement to obtain timeconsuming INDs would virtually stall the potentially lifesaving therapy in the US  AGA members praised the move in a letter to members this week  At this time there are no negative consequences if a practitioner chooses not to obtain an IND provided they have informed consent and are using FMT fecal microbiota transplantation to treat their patients with recurrent C diff the group wrote  C difficile infections strike more than  people in the US each year and are linked to more than  deaths according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  They typically occur when people take antibiotics that wipe out good bacteria in the gut along with the bad allowing C diff to flourish  There are probably only about  doctors routinely performing fecal transplants in the US now experts say Between  and  patients have received the procedure worldwide according to doctors estimates  FDA officials have always had authority to require INDs but agency officials only recently decided to enforce the rule in part to bring regulatory clarity to the growing field of fecal transplants Allen has said  But then came protests from doctors and patients eager to use the therapy that some studies show can cure  percent of C diff infections quickly The FDA still wants doctors to apply for INDs but they agency will allow the procedures to continue in the interim  Thats a relief for patients like Nora Bagusky  of Hanover Township Pa who is suffering from her fourth recurrent C diff infection in  months making her so ill shes been unable to work at her job as a rape crisis counselor She feared she might have to wait up to six months for a fecal transplant under the rule  Thats probably the best news Ive heard in my entire life Bagusky said Im waiting for my doctor to call me back Fingers crossed I will be having the transplant very soon
