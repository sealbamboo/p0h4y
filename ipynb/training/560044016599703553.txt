The US is considering approving an injection designed to combat chin fat.. The double-chin jab is an injection of a synthetic chemical that destroys fat cells.  . Regulators at the Food and Drugs Administration have received a submission from the makers of the jab, Kythera Biopharmaceuticals.. Discussions are scheduled for March. And if these are positive, the injection, called ATX-101, could become available in May.. If it gets the go-ahead, it will be the first injection of its kind for this cosmetic purpose. . Botox and other dermal filler injections are already available to smooth and plump the face, but none is available for reducing chin fat. . ATX-101 is a man-made version of a naturally occurring molecule in the body, called deoxycholic acid, which helps breakdown dietary fat. . The jab has been tested in more than 1,600 people in clinical trials.
