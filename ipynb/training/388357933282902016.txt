Researchers in a memory lab at Texas AM University noticed that all the older people coming in as volunteers were really worried about how theyd do So the scientists decided to measure how taking a memory test affects a persons subjective sense of age Before the test the  participants felt pretty darned good Even though their average age was  they said they felt about  Then they were given a list of  nouns told to study them for two minutes and then asked to recall as many of them as they could in three minutes The participants did fine on the memory test But when they were asked afterward how old they felt they said they felt about  they had aged five years in five minutes It really demonstrates the power of context   an associate professor of psychology at Texas AM and a coauthor of the study tells Shots Putting the test subjects in a situation that reminded them of their greatest fear of aging Geraci says affected their selfperception The   online in the journal   OK but this is a really small group of people Maybe everybody feels old and haggard after participating in a psychology experiment To find out Geraci and her crew ran a similar study with two groups  older adults and  adults in their s Both groups did well on an online memory test But the older adults again said they felt about five years older after the test while the younger participants subjective age didnt shift Well then maybe its the memory part of the test that does it So the researchers took  older adults and had half do a memory test while the other half took a vocabulary test The ones taking the memory test said they felt five years older afterward while the vocabulary test folks reported no age difference Other studies have shown that subjective age can affect health and performance in real life When older adults were told they did better than others on a strength test they reported not just that they felt younger but they actually were stronger when they repeated the strength tests In another experiment when older people were given blurred text to read without explaining that it was printed that way they felt older So the answer to feeling good in old age is never take a memory test Geraci says the answer may be to take a test you can ace Older people tend to be great at word puzzles and vocabulary tests Geraci is now running a series of experiments using both memory and vocabulary tests Shes finding that if people take the vocabulary test first they do better on the memory test Older people do much better on memory tests when they expect to excel says Geraci who studies learning and memory in both older adults and college students It shows that you can create experiences to improve performance and even well being And priming the pump for success should work in real life too she says Older adults are really good at a lot of things but we dont focus on that she says We focus on what they cant do Making a conscious effort to play to the strengths of age she says could affect both a persons subjective sense of age and his abilities
