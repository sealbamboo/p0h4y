The government is expected to make an extra £150m available for A&E units in England as they gear up for what looks set to be a tough winter, the BBC understands.. Ministers are known to be worried about how hospitals will cope this winter.. The major A&Es are already missing the four-hour waiting time target even though winter is just beginning.. The money comes on top of the £500m bailout fund announced in the summer, which is being spread over two years.. When that pot was announced, ministers said it would allow the NHS to prepare properly.. Only last week NHS England deputy chief executive Dame Barbara Hakin was saying the NHS was "ready for winter".. The College of Emergency Medicine welcomed the news, saying: "This winter is likely to present real challenges to A&Es.". More details on where the money will go are expected to be revealed by the government soon.
