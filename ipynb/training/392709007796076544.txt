Americas relationship with meat is an indulgent one At  pounds of meat per person per year Americans consume more than almost anyone else in the world Mostly we have our livestock producers   to thank for making meat cheap and abundant for us But as weve often reported on this blog the conversation about our meat consumption is increasingly turning critical From   to   to the   the meat that dominates our plates is being called excessive and detrimental to health the environment the animals we raise for food and rural economies Chiming in to this critique since  is the Meatless Monday campaign a partnership between an advertising whiz and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to market dietary change The campaign which celebrates its th anniversary this month encourages cutting out meat one day a week to improve   Why Monday Because several   have demonstrated that people are more likely to try to quit smoking begin a diet or exercise regimen schedule doctors appointments or adopt other healthy behaviors on Monday than any other day And while many Americans may never have heard of Meatless Monday or reject the idea of avoiding meat one day a week the campaign points to many feathers in its cap Meatless Monday is now active in  countries And in the US more than  schools food service companies and restaurants including Mario Batalis famed eateries have signed on to offer Meatless Monday options according to the campaign For many this hasnt meant eliminating meat entirely from the Monday menu And thats just fine with the campaign Overall whether its meatless or flexitarian we are promoting more plantbased options and less meat and fat says   president of The Monday Campaigns which includes Meatless Monday As NPR   in  The Monday Campaigns were founded by Sid Lerner  who decided to use his advertising savvy for public health when he learned about the risks and environmental concerns about high meat consumption in the US Lerner was one of the original Mad Men of Madison Avenue best known for his Squeeze the Charmin toilet paper campaign For more on Lerners career watch   produced by his alma mater Syracuse University At a symposium to   and Meatless Mondays year anniversary at Johns Hopkins on Thursday Neu who also comes from the advertising industry said everyone on the team has been astonished by the success of the Meatless Monday idea and how much it has spread on its own Its rare that you get a big idea like this one that gets as much grassroots traction as this one has said Neu Even Johns Hopkins dean emeritus Alfred Sommer remarked on the unique effectiveness of the Meatless Monday idea There are not many behavior change health issues that transcend like this one Here at NPR our caterer Guckenheimer voluntarily embraced Meatless Monday and offers a vegetarian entree every day According to Guckenheimers chief marketing officer Karla Lacey between  and  of the companys accounts get Meatless Monday options In some ways Meatless Mondays were a great way to train people to notice and try nonmeat options Lacey tells The Salt in an email Once they get more familiar with them we start integrating the nonmeat options into the menus every day It can be extremely tricky to measure the impact of any campaign aimed at changing behavior But The Monday Campaigns tried to do so in  by hiring the FGI Research firm to conduct an online survey of  American adults Some  percent said in the survey they were aware of Meatless Monday And among those  percent said the campaign has influenced their decision to cut back or consider cutting back on meat But the surveys most significant finding according to the campaign Some  percent of respondents who said they were influenced by Meatless Monday report that theyve tried to incorporate it into their weekly routine The meat industry meanwhile has questioned the true reach of the campaign In a   released Oct  the Animal Agriculture Alliance said that Meatless Monday has grossly misrepresented its enrollment and prevalence According to AAA several of the institutions listed on the campaigns website as participants told the meat industry trade group that they had either never heard of Meatless Monday or had ended the program Neu readily admits that the Meatless Monday campaign has been unpopular in some places including college campuses where meat was eliminated from the menu on Monday and students didnt have any choice But even in those places where theres pushback its starting a dialogue about whether we should be eating so much meat The AAA report wasnt the first time industry has taken a swipe at the movement As our friends over at the TwoWay reported the industry   the US Department of Agriculture into redacting its endorsement of the movement in an internal newsletter last summer The true influence of the movement aside there may be a broader societal trend happening to reduce meat consumption Since  Americans have been eating less meat per person We found that in our own poll conducted in  where  adults across the country were   about their meat consumption as part of an NPRTruven Health Analytics Health Poll Our poll found that  percent said they eat less meat than they did three years ago Some  percent said their meat intake hasnt changed in the past three years Among those who are eating less meat  percent said theyre worried about the health effects  percent said cost is a factor while  percent were concerned about animal welfare and  percent have limited their meat intake out of a concern for the environment
