 said he suspects a woman he treated this weekend was suffering from krokodil addiction Singla is an internist and addiction specialist at Joliets   The patient lost significant portions of her legs he said   Its a zombie drug  it literally kills you from the inside out Singla said If you want way to die this is a way to die Krokodil causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis according to a  PDF The soft tissue damage happens around the injection site The drug also seems to clump in the veins as it fails to dissolve completely in the blood The clumps make their way to distant places in the body and start to damage tissue said  medical director of the    Geller said he hopes the drug doesnt show its ugly face in Georgia but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug  So far there are no officially confirmed American cases of krokodil abuse To have official confirmation the Drug Enforcement Administration would need to have a sample of the drug that caused the problem  A DEA   about the drug released this month said the National Forensic Laboratory Information System the DEA database that collects scientifically verified data on drug items and cases identified two exhibits submitted to these labs as desomorphine in  but none since then Its not clear how widely used it is in the US Geller said  CNN affiliate  in Oklahoma City spoke with a woman who said her best friend from Duncan Oklahoma died after using krokodil last year  The doctors say it ate him from the inside out Chelle Fancher told the TV station It wasnt until the next day that they told us that it was krokodil But Mark Woodward a spokesman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics said krokodil was ruled out in the Duncan case through an autopsy We watched the reports carefully to see if it was here he said It was just a drug overdose and nothing in the system consistent with krokodil There have been many confirmed cases of krokodil abuse in Russia and Ukraine  An estimated  in Russia and around  people in Ukraine are estimated to have injected the drug in  according to a   that ran in the International Journal of Drug Policy this year Experts theorize the drug first spread across Russia and Ukraine when heroin became less available  Krokodil is cheaper than heroin and can be easily cooked up in someones home much like meth   People making krokodil combine the painkiller codeine with easily available chemicals They can use iodine strong alkalies such as Mr Muscle a kitchen and bathroom cleaner hydrochloric acid red phosphorous from matches andor organic solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner according to the study  Mortality rates are high among users according to the study  In Russia users frequently are young people with relatively short drug histories the study found Medical help is often only sought after users are in the late stages of their addiction and end up with severe mutilations rotting gums bone infections decayed structure of the jaw and facial bones sores and ulcers on the forehead and skull as well as rotting ears noses and lips and liver and kidney problems  This may be an inexpensive high compared to other drugs according to its reputation but it is more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms and be a real problem for users Geller said My advice is to wouldbe users Dont This is a risky way to try and get high The short halflife of the drug means a users attention is narrowed to the process of acquiring and preparing and administering the drug leaving little time for matters other than avoiding withdrawal and chasing the high according to one medical study hence its reputation for creating zombies  Binges on the drug reportedly last over several days During the binge a user can show irrational behavior and experience sleep deprivation and exhaustion memory loss and speech problems According to the Joliet hospital the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin  I think its the tip of the iceberg I think its going to get a lot worse before it gets better said Singla the addiction specialist I think if it stays on the market long enough youre going to have people who are desperate addicts that cant support their heroin habit but can utilize this drug not really caring about the consequences and get the same high for a third of the price
