Frostbite isnt usually a major worry here in Washington DC but with wind chills below zero forecast for half of the Lower  by Tuesday morning millions of people from the Plains to the East Coast will have to start thinking like Arctic explorers while waiting for a school bus or heading to work Noses fingers toes and ears face the biggest risk Those body parts have less blood flowing through them and a lot less mass than the bodys core Theyre also more likely to be exposed to the elements Obviously bundling up those tender parts is key Some of the things that people try to prevent or treat freezing injuries do more harm than good doctors say That includes drinking alcohol to warm up when it can actually cool you faster by dilating the blood vessels near the surface of your skin And rubbing frozen skin instead of gently warming it To get up to speed on   protocol we called   a vice chair of emergency services at the Cleveland Clinic It was  degrees in Cleveland at  pm Monday with blowing snow And the mercury was dropping fast In those sorts of conditions frostbite can develop in  minutes or less according to the   Prevention really is key Podolsky told Shots The more time and the more skin exposed the worse it is When Podolsky worked in Colorado extremely cold weather wasnt so unusual You always had an emergency kit in the car because you never knew when you were going to get stuck he said That meant not just warm clothing but blankets or sleeping bags Those measures will also reduce the risk of the other big coldrelated health problem   A body temperature below  degrees can lead to death if not quickly treated In frostbite tissues literally freeze Bad frostbite can destroy blood vessels leading to gangrene and loss of extremities Its been a longtime risk for soldiers in war as well as for Arctic explorers and highaltitude mountaineers Fortunately for us novices that sort of catastrophic damage is relatively rare And frostbite has an early warning sign called frostnip The skin reddens and stings and can feel numb Thats the signal to get out of the elements fast If you do end up getting frostbite you need to seek care of a physician Podolsky says In the meantime get to a warm place and take off wet clothing Try to remove rings or other jewelry because frostbite causes serious swelling Forget that old saw about rubbing snow on numbed skin thats just making skin colder In fact dont rub skin at all Podolsky says because that can further damage already injured skin The emergency room treatment is simple We warm you We take off your clothes he says We may use a warm water bath If its truly frostbite the thawing process is unfortunately painful as blood flow returns and tissues swell Frostbitten skin usually blisters so warm bulky dressings are used to protect the skin and prevent infection A tetanus shot is a good idea Podolsky says Some   have found that using aspirin warfarin or other blood thinners may help reduce the risk of longterm damage In the emergency rooms of Cleveland people who show up with frostbite injuries are typically a mix of outdoor enthusiasts and homeless people with no place to get out of the cold We do expect well see different types of cold emergency in this big chill Podolsky says including people who just didnt realize how quickly they can be hurt in this intense Arctic chill But were hoping that school will be canceled
