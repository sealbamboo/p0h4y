A woman who says she was raped more than  times while at an NHS psychiatric hospital has told BBC Radio  live such institutions are an open playing field for predators  Catherine told the Victoria Derbyshire programme about being an inpatient at Little Brook Hospital Kent several times in  months in around   She said she was groomed and repeatedly raped by a care worker at the hospital A man was later convicted of one count of unlawful intercourse with a patient Catherine said it was the result of a nervous breakdown and developing anorexia after getting out of a year abusive relationship that she was admitted to the Dartford hospital The abuse began within days of her arrival the motheroftwo said  I was on a very heavy amount of Valium not to where I was unconscious but add the sedative effect to my already defeated self I was putty  He came in my room pulled the covers back got on top did what he had to do and left all over very quickly I didnt murmur didnt move  She added Very quickly it became every night he was on shift I would expect it  Asked if she knew why she had not offered resistance Catherine said It took me a couple of years after to understand why I asked myself that every day for a couple of years I was a defeated person I wasnt able to care for myself I wasnt washing I wasnt feeding myself  I was like an abused dog that if you went up to and gave another kick to she wouldnt have flinched If someone had come into my room with a knife and stabbed it in me I dont think I would have flinched I was in a bad way and therefore I was hugely open to abuse Her abuser also told her he could help secure her discharge from the hospital if she complied with his demands she said There was no point me telling anybody Whos going to believe a mental patient  a mental inpatient  over a longstanding member of staff who was seemingly highly respected and regarded by his colleagues  Several years after leaving the unit Catherine told a community psychiatric nurse what had happened and the care worker was immediately arrested   In  he pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a patient and was sentenced to  months in prison suspended for two years  He was also told he could never work with vulnerable people again Catherine received a letter of apology from Kent and Medway NHS Trust and  in compensation But this is the first time she has ever spoken publicly about what happened to her  Catherine described psychiatric hospitals as a playing field for predators She said Its a group of people who are probably the most vulnerable in society with regards to being open to abuse and then subsequently being believed  It is an open playing field for predators in that environment Who is going to speak up when they have been in a mental health institution There is a stigma you are ashamed its not something you tell people To then say that a member of staff raped you its probably one of the hardest things Ive ever done and yet I was believed and that was wonderful  However she also recalled the judge saying he was only able to sentence in relation to one offence That again reinforces that in terms of mental health you are deemed not quite a firstclass citizen she said  You are a secondclass citizen so therefore it doesnt matter so much One time  times it doesnt matter The Crown Prosecution Service told the BBC that in cases where multiple allegations were made it was common for a trial to consider a single specimen case  The way allegations of sexual assault are dealt with have changed substantially since    New sentencing guidelines under which sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder can carry a life sentence are due to come into force in April  Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust which runs Little Brook Hospital told the BBC it could not comment on Catherines case because it happened before the formation of the trust But it pointed out that all staff undergo an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service DBS check before they can work in such a unit
