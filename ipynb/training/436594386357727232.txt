The targeted cancer drug extending my life is killing my hair Especially at the top of my head a beige scalp gleams through sparse black and white wires For obvious reasons Im not complaining   During chemo when I lost my hair before I resorted to scarves and hats assuming it would grow back But now I need to continue taking the experimental pills in a clinical trial and therefore suspect that I will continue to lose rather than regain hair   To my eyes malepattern baldness looks worse on me than totallybald cancer patient mindfully contemplating her mortality like a Buddhist nun Not so to my haircutter When I gave her a choice between President Obama and Captain Jean Luc Picard at my last appointment she chose the President albeit with a receding hairline 
 The vast majority of people in cancer treatment suffer from an injured body and an injured body image Baldness but also scars lopsidedness weight gain or loss patches rashes prosthetic devices output bags and ports function like billboards Some courageous patients determine to expose themselves publicly in order to witness and protest the epidemic others become agoraphobic unwilling to leave home Unfortunately I dwell in the latter category  What wouldnt I give now for the hair that drove me crazy in my teens Thick and kinky it led me to sleep with huge plastic rollers To make it look like Chers I would spend hours blow drying or ironing it or using chemicals to straighten it  which would work until the first inkling of humidity turned me into the Bride of Frankenstein In my s I finally relinquished Cher for a cropped Halle Berry not that anyone would have discerned any resemblance whatsoever Maybe the dream of moveable hair crazed though it was could rescue me I determined as I phoned my friend Alexandra a costume designer for a date the next day We drove to the only store in our small town that sells wigs Its jokey name though potentially objectionable to Native Americans seemed a harbinger of moveable hair The Wig Wam  Once inside the rickety house we were greeted by Charlotte the something owner who ushered us into an enclosed porch   After I took off my hat and Charlotte tousled what little hair I had she assured me that I did not need to shave my head wash the wig or do anything except  at this moment she grabbed her own hair and pulled it off her head  wear it and stay away from hot ovens   Why not have fun with this Alex immediately proposed bringing me a black shoulderlength mop fringed with red tips  perfect if I were auditioning for a movie version of The Inferno  But Charlotte firmly placed a short silver mane on my head explaining that there was a woman who sat behind her in church who always tugged on the hair at the nape of her neck to assure herself it was not real If realism was the point the synthetic wig was a dud It looked like a rug no question But what a rug Imagine Meg Ryan in her late s It was definitely moveable hair moveable bangs moveable flip in the back and moveable shaggy sides that could be partly tucked behind the ears and partly smoothed down before the ears against my cheeks     For days afterward it sat in the bathroom atop a phrenology bust that my husband donated from his study The heads scalp was divided into sections with letters and numbers so that thcentury scientists could hazard guesses about real brains to prove that women of all races and all men except whites were endowed by their creator with alienable rights   Getting used to two faces was not easy  Without the wig I look like a sickly Jewish man But with the wig I am a vibrant if older shiksa who could toss her moveable hair at any country club longingly visited by a Philip Roth protagonist I should add that in my family the Yiddish word for a nonJewish woman is spoken with appreciation not opprobrium   The shiksas name is Sally Sally draws on eyebrows while I do not Sally primps before the mirror though I do not Sallys head is generally itchy whereas mine is not  Ensconced in some freefloating anxiety about duplicity Im not trying to fool anyone I assure myself I swear that I am not attempting to pass I wont be her  I mean I wont wear it  all the time Instead Ill let her  Ill let it  help me get through select occasions Still the suspicion persists Maybe I need my head examined but ever since Meg Ryan was spotted at a coffee shop in town I expect that someone will come up to Sally in the supermarket to ask for her autograph Walking down the aisles I decide to choose ingredients to cook something on the stove top not in the oven that Sally might enjoy Ill have what shes having
