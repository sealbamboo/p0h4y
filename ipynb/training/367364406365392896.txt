According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one in three patients infected with HIV do not get tested in sufficient time to benefit from existing treatments The research literature is rife with studies of low rates for colonoscopies mammograms and an array of genetic testing Now researchers in the psychology department at the University of Florida have been trying to find ways to help such patients change from evading testing a phenomenon psychologists call health information avoidance to seeking it For some  years researchers have noted that despite the lifeprolonging value of early detection in countless illnesses many people are reluctant to be tested Even after they have been tested many choose to not find out the results When researchers ask people why they resist getting tested reasons like cost ignorance of the diseases facts and intrusiveness of the procedure are often cited But one of the most common barriers to being tested  or finding out the test results  is fear  For the patient many tests are invasive and timeconsuming with the possible reward being bad news said Dr Anthony L Back an oncologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine who specializes in doctorpatient communication  The patients view he said is very different from that of most epidemiologists who say that through early detection the population benefits The gap between those two stories is why everyone is not rushing to have their colonoscopies or mammograms The University of Florida psychologists carried out a series of experiments that sought to address that divergence asking How can we get people to put aside their emotions and fears and receive potentially bad news about their health said Jennifer L Howell a graduate student and lead author of the study along with James A Shepperd a professor of social psychology  In their most recent work   they tried an approach called contemplation a psychological technique that gets subjects to identify their qualms and think about them   Psychologists who study decisionmaking typically use terms like fast and slow and hot and cold to distinguish a snap emotionally driven process from one that is rational and analytic One process is not unilaterally more sound than the other gut instincts may often lead the decisionmaker to a good result while the analytic path may be neverending if the wouldbe decisionmaker gets stalled by overthinking With health care decisions said Ms Howell patients make decisions often geared to emotion and protecting the self where it is right now not in the long term  the fast hot impulse If patients were led to try contemplation a slower cooler more considered route would they reach a different decision In one experiment the researchers asked  adults whether they wanted to learn their lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease  a serious illness but one which patients can take effective measures to mitigate Half the group was given a contemplation exercise they were asked to list three reasons to learn the results and three reasons not to learn them and to rank the importance of each reason The control group was simply asked to list eight facts they knew about cardiovascular disease Then each group chose whether they wanted to learn their risk In the group asked to examine their motives only  percent chose to avoid learning their risk In the other group  percent did not want the information The contemplation group prompted to consider more carefully their own reasoning had been led to take a slower cooler approach Researchers tried a different experiment They gave a presentation about a madeup disease called thioamine acetlyase TAA that they said led to early death and afflicted  percent of college students though it could be treated by taking a daily pill The fictitious TAA has been used in behavioral  studies since   Once again the contemplation group listed reasons for and against learning their risk while the control group simply gave eight facts they had learned about the disease Contemplation had a similar effect afterward only  percent of the subjects chose to avoid learning more about their personal risk compared with  percent of the controls But when in a separate experiment the researchers presented TAA to other subjects this time describing it as an untreatable illness contemplation had no effect the percentage of subjects who were willing to be tested did not budge  There are times when informationavoidance doesnt get reduced because of contemplation Ms Howell said When a disease is incurable people may think that the benefit of knowing doesnt outweigh the cost of not knowing  Many serious illnesses however can be managed or averted with early detection The experiments showed that when people had the opportunity to slow down and contemplate their fears they often were more likely to move past their initial terrors and see that critical health information could be not just frightening but empowering Amy McQueen a social psychologist and assistant professor in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis who specializes in health behavior research said that to combat fear and uncertainty associated with screening for lifethreatening illnesses like cancer many people say to themselves  I feel fine I dont want to buy into the hype that I have to do all these tests The tests threaten their equilibrium and identity But Dr McQueen said if we could prime people with approaches like contemplation giving them the chance to slow down and think things through they might be more willing to risk learning valuable information in a timely fashion It makes practical sense she said  The intervention studied by the Florida researchers she noted occurs at the beginning of a series of health care decisions that patients must make getting tested learning results changing behavior that might affect the outcome of an illness Dr Back the oncologist said motivating patients at every step was a challenge How do we incentivize people in service of their health that doesnt have a shortterm payoff but has a longterm payoff  The contemplation interventions worked in a research setting But would such exercises or similar conversations translate in a real clinic  He felt that the Florida model pointed the way for individual practitioners to do exactly that We need to help people sit with the scary things in ways that will help them make really good decisions he said
