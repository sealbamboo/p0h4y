For the past few years Mary Lou Guerinot has been keeping watch over experimental fields in southeast Texas monitoring rice plants as they suck metals and other troublesome elements from the soil  If the fields are flooded in the traditional paddy method she has found the rice handily takes up arsenic But if the water is reduced in an effort to limit arsenic the plant instead absorbs cadmium  also a dangerous element  Its almost eitheror dayandnight as to whether we see arsenic or cadmium in the rice said Dr Guerinot a molecular geneticist and professor of biology at Dartmouth College  The levels of arsenic and cadmium at the study site are not high enough to provoke alarm she emphasized Still it is dawning on scientists like her that rice one of the most widely consumed foods in the world is also one of natures great scavengers of metallic compounds   Consumers have already become alarmed over reports of riceborne arsenic in everything from cereal bars to baby food Some food manufacturers   in their products and agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration now   to minimize potential adverse health consequences from eating an excess of any one food  But its not just arsenic and cadmium which are present in soil both as naturally occurring elements and as industrial byproducts Recent studies have shown that rice is custombuilt to pull a number of metals from the soil among them   and even tungsten The findings have led to a new push by scientists and growers to make the grain less susceptible to metal contamination    The highest levels often occur in brown rice because elements like arsenic accumulate in bran and husk which are polished off in the processing of white rice The Department of Agriculture estimates that on average arsenic levels are   times as high in rice bran as in polished rice Although    in the part per billion range  chronic exposure to arsenic even at very low levels   The FDA is now considering   Rice is a problem because its such a widely consumed grain said Rufus Chaney a senior research agronomist with the USDAs Agricultural Research Service who is leading a investigation of metal uptake by food crops But its also a fascinating plant  Like people plants have systems for taking up and absorbing necessary nutrients In plants these transporter systems work to pull minerals such as iron calcium zinc and manganese from the soil  The rice plant has a welldesigned system for taking up silicon compounds or silicate which help strengthen the plant and give stiffness and shape to its stems  Tissues generally referred to as phloem    But that delivery system also inclines the plant to vacuum up arsenic compounds which are unfortunately similar in structure to silicate And the traditional methods of growing rice which often involve flooding a field encourage formation of a soluble arsenic compound  arsenite  that is     The issue with the rice plant is that it tends to store the arsenic in the grain rather than in the leaves or elsewhere said Jody Banks a plant biologist at Purdue University who studies arsenic uptake in plants It moves there quite easily  The highest concentrations of arsenic in ricegrowing regions are mostly found in parts of Asia  including Bangladesh and India  where the underlying arsenicrich bedrock    But arsenic at lower levels is found in all soils including American fields The fertile soils fanning out across the Mississippi River floodplain are   as other parts of Louisiana Mississippi and Arkansas according to studies done by the United States Geological Survey  Its for that reason as well as for water conservation that scientists have experimented with reducing the amount of water used for rice fields But as Dr Guerinot has found that makes cadmium more available to the plant instead   Other plants also take up cadmium Dr Chaney noted usually by the channels normally used to acquire zinc from the soil But the rice plant curiously absorbs nearly all of its cadmium through a manganese transport system And this route  discovered by a determined group of Japanese researchers  brings a new set of complications While zinc is relatively common in soil soluble manganese is less readily found So cadmium has little competition in the rice plants transport system  meaning that it is accumulated with apparent enthusiasm  The association between cadmium in rice and human disease goes back decades  Most scientists cite the identification of itaiitai ouchouch disease in Japan during the s    The name comes from the painful effects of bone fractures one of    Researchers eventually discovered that cadmium pollution from mines and other industry had spread into rice farming areas in Japan causing the grain to be loaded with the toxic metal  A host of similar problems have occurred in China     Scientists say that the cadmium occurring naturally in American soil is not high enough to cause acute disease Still because rice is such an important food crop scientists are searching for ways to block its metalacquiring tendencies There are efforts to breed rice plants that   which would both increase nutritional quality and reduce toxicity  There are also programs including the experiment in Texas that try to breed improved rice cultivars less prone to absorb toxic minerals  And researchers have explored the idea of genetic engineering to make the plants transport systems more precise so that cadmium or arsenic is filtered out  Finally they are looking into using other plants to reduce the toxic elements in the soils themselves   Dr Banks for instance is studying a fern that deftly pulls arsenic from the soil and stores it in the fronds  The plant known as a  or ladder fern is   that the Chinese have approached American scientists about the feasibility of using it to clean up contaminated soils  Of course the ferns eventually have to be incinerated or taken to a toxic disposal site You definitely wouldnt want to eat them said Dr Banks
