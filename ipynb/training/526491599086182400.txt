In  a man named Barry Beck suffered a series of strokes which caused extensive damage to his right occipital lobe and to the brain stem The geologist and author of several books was left completely unable to communicate in a state known as lockedin syndrome The condition was famously described by JeanDominique Bauby in his memoir  which he dictated by blinking But thanks to a team of researchers and some technological advances Beck had another option When I first saw him he had a little bit of eye movement and that was really the only way he could communicate says Eric Sellers who directs the   at East Tennessee State University His lab studies how brain activity can be measured and used to control computers helping people with severe motor disabilities to communicate Becks wife heard about Sellers research and contacted him Ten months after Becks strokes Sellers and his team start started working with the patient setting him up with a braincomputer interface Sellers describes the technology as a virtual keyboard Its basically instead of using your hands to press keys on the keyboard youre using brain waves to press the keys To use the system you wear a noninvasive electrode cap and sit in front of a monitor that has a picture of the keyboard Groups of letters will flash at random If you want to choose the A you pay attention to the A and then every time the A flashes your brain produces this response Sellers explains That response is called a P This P is like an aha response so your brain kind of says Aha thats the one I want to select  The technology has been used to help people with Lou Gehrigs disease compose messages Its also allowed people to control wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs just by thinking But Beck was one of the first patients with a severe brainstem injury to use it successfully Sellers research about his work with Beck was published in October  Sellers and his team started slow with just four letters  Y for yes N for no P for pass and E for end The first major interaction we had was a question dialogue that ended up in us determining that he wanted more information regarding his prognosis Sellers says Once they knew he was able to use that they finetuned the settings and eventually presented him with the full alphabet so he could spell out words One of the first messages that he spelled was to his wife He spelled out Thank you for all of your hard work  Sellers says He on a couple of occasions also asked me to make the system go faster And I of course told him that I was trying  Im doing my best Still the system is very slow It took Beck  seconds to select each character Much of Sellers research is focused on making the machine faster and more accurate his lab has experimented with predictive spelling programs like those found in many smartphones which anticipate what words the user is trying to spell But for Beck the painstaking task was worth it In addition to helping him communicate it was also something that gave his wife a lot of satisfaction knowing that he was still in there and for the most part cognitively intact His kids would visit while he used the BCI so it had a really large effect on the family as well Sellers and his team worked with Beck for over  months conducting therapy sessions in the nursing home where he lived Beck died in November  at the age of  In those months before he died he helped contribute to making this technology more accessible for other lockedin patients For the people who are participating in our research program they understand that they may not benefit from this technology but they also realize how important it could be for people who are in similar situations says Sellers Sellers imagines a future where BCIs are available in hospitals If someone has some type of injury automobile accident or something like that and they have to be intubated and on a respirator  you could imagine that emergency rooms trauma wards would actually have these he says
