The deadly MERS virus has been identified in the U.S. for the first time, the latest indication of the spread of a disease that emerged two years ago in the Middle East.. A health-care provider who returned to the U.S. a week ago after working at a health-care facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was sickened by the virus and is hospitalized in Indiana, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday. The agency said it confirmed the infection in its labs Friday afternoon.
