In a Brownsville family clinic a powerfully built bald doctor treats a neverending line of sick and injured patients He has been practicing for nearly four decades but family medicine is not his calling For  years I had a clinic where I saw women and took care of their reproductive needs but mostly terminating pregnancies Dr Lester Minto says He seems an unlikely doctor to perform abortions The son of an Army officer he grew up in a deeply religious family in rural Texas His career path was shaped by an experience in medical school in the early s A young woman whose uterus had been accidentally pierced by a backroom abortionist bled to death in front of him After   was decided the young doctor devoted his career to helping poor and workingclass women terminate their unwanted pregnancies in South Texas Ninetyeight percent were Hispanics Minto says I would go days where I wouldnt speak English because they were all Spanish speakers  which is great Getting this level of care has always been available to rich women Minto points out They can always go somewhere else  another state another country They can go to their gynecologist and get a menstrual extraction or something thats not called an abortion So theyre OK Nearly half of Mintos patients were teenagers and he averaged more than  abortions each year But Minto had to close his clinic after  by the Texas Legislature in  rendered his clinic obsolete It doesnt meet all the standards of an ambulatory surgical center with amenities like extrawide hallways The other important restriction in the new Texas law  this week by a federal appeals court requires all doctors who perform abortions to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association say these two requirements are   If one of Mintos patients were to have a medical crisis during an abortion she would be rushed to the closest hospital emergency room Doctor privileges arent an issue in emergencies Ive been there plus years Minto says In that time only two of his clinic patients have had to go to the hospital he says and that was because they had bleeding conditions that kept their blood from clotting Nevertheless the laws led to the closing of half of the  clinics across the state that offer abortion services Its not just the valley In vast swaths of Texas there are no longer any such clinics in operation Minto has been getting calls from women desperate for help When they hear that Ive closed after all these years they cry he says They ask me What do I do Doctor  But there are plenty of people in South Texas who enthusiastically support the restrictions While the Rio Grande Valley is deeply Democratic its also very Catholic I take the position that life begins in conception and ends in natural death says   a Democrat and Texas state senator who has represented the valley for nearly  years I was an outspoken advocate for the bill Lucio and his allies in the state Legislature say the restrictions increase patient care and reduce medical complications  the closing of clinics that do abortions is a happy byproduct The Texas Legislature has thrown up as many obstacles to abortion as the federal courts will allow including waiting periods ultrasounds and outdated protocols for administering abortion pills that require women to repeatedly return to the clinic And for women on the states border with Mexico theres another barrier  an inland Border Patrol checkpoint on the highway to San Antonio Women whose visas confine them to the border or who are completely undocumented cant get past the checkpoint to San Antonio For Lucio thats a plus Im OK with that he says Because all theyre looking for is putting an end to a life And Im not for that Lucio and his allies had abortionrights supporters on the run in Texas until   intervened in late August and struck down as unconstitutional the requirements regarding admitting privileges and that clinics providing abortions be held to all the same standards as outpatient surgical centers In his decision the judge ruled that the abortion rights of women along the border were particularly endangered by those regulations The requirements erect a particularly high barrier for poor rural or disadvantaged women Yeakel wrote A woman with means the freedom and ability to travel and the desire to obtain an abortion will always be able to obtain one he wrote echoing Mintos sentiments  s essential holding guarantees to all women  not just those of means  the right to a previability abortion the judge concluded Yeakels ruling has had an immediate impact in Texas   the CEO of Whole Womans Health says her group is reopening its clinic to provide abortions in the Rio Grande Valley But with a hearing on Yeakels ruling still looming from the   it could be only a matter of days before Hagstrom Miller is forced to close the clinic for good Im very careful with hope in the state of Texas being an abortion provider Hagstrom Miller says But I am hopeful for a couple of reasons We put on a very strong case with very strong evidence And Im encouraged by the th Circuit giving us two weeks with this injunction instead of ruling immediately The th Circuit is one of the most conservative federal courts in the country and has a history of reversing the legal decisions of its federal judges in Texas whove generally ruled to protect womens rights to abortion Oral arguments begin tomorrow All Things Considered
