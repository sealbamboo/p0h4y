Twelve babies have been born using a potentially safer way of getting eggs for use in IVF UK doctors say The naturally occurring hormone kisspeptin was used to stimulate womens ovaries to produce eggs  The pregnancies reported in the Journal of Clinical Investigation show the hormone can be used successfully Fertility researchers hope kisspeptin will prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS but larger trials are needed to fully assess safety A hormone hCG is normally used to produce a few eggs for IVF But in around  of patients the ovaries go into overdrive and produce too many The condition can lead to kidney failure and potentially death In  UK researchers discovered kisspeptin It is heavily involved in the menstrual cycle and people without the hormone will not go through puberty The team at Imperial College London believe kisspepin would stimulate the ovaries in a gentler more natural way that would prevent OHSS The first human trials have been taking place on  volunteer couples at Hammersmith Hospital in London  Eggs were successfully collected from  women of whom  have since given birth  Prof Waljit Dhillo of Imperial College London told the BBC The first patient who went though the study got pregnant It was the best outcome you could have wanted it was a really triumphant moment We think it should be safer Weve now shown it is effective but we need larger studies The next trials will take place in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who are more vulnerable to overstimulation  If they are successful a further series of trials will be needed to compare the success rates of kisspeptin and conventional therapy Alison and Richard Harper gave birth to baby Owen in October  Alison said I went through several cycles of IVF previously but the one in the trial was the least uncomfortable It was less painful and I felt less swollen Prof David Adamson of the International Federation of Fertility Societies said This is an interesting study that identifies an additional new drug that could potentially make IVF an already safe procedure even safer Other effective strategies to prevent OHSS are already in clinical practice and the new drug would have to go through large clinical trials to confirm its efficacy safety and equivalence to these other medications currently in use Dr Yakoub Khalaf the director of the assisted conception unit at Kings College London said This is an interesting study  Whilst it is plausible that the risk of hyperstimulation syndrome could be reduced following use of kisspeptin the number of patients studied is too small to demonstrate reduction in the incidence The bottom line is an interesting product but more clinical data is needed to demonstrate that kisspeptin is not just safe but also does not reduce the chance of a pregnancy
