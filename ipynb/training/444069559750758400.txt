Drugs taken to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes may have fewer sideeffects than claimed researchers say  Their review of  patients   indicated an increased risk of type diabetes But it suggested reports of increases in nausea muscle ache insomnia and fatigue were actually inaccurate  It is a controversial area as the NHS in England is considering offering the drugs to millions more people The cholesterollowering drugs are already offered to about seven million people in the UK who have a oneinfive chance of heart disease in the next decade The NHS is considering offering the drugs to even healthier people who have only a onein chance of heart problems  A team at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London analysed data from  clinical trials They suggested statins did reduce deaths but contributed to a high rate of type diabetes One in five new cases of diabetes in people on statins were a direct result of taking the drugs Their analysis suggested other sideeffects appeared at a similar rate in people taking statins and those given dummy placebo pills One of the researchers Dr Judith Finegold said We clearly found that many patients in these trials  whose patients are usually wellmotivated volunteers who didnt know if they were getting a real or placebo tablet  that many did report sideeffects while taking placebo  In the general population where patients are being prescribed a statin for an asymptomatic condition why would it be surprising that even higher rates of sideeffects are reported Most people in the general population if you repeatedly ask them a detailed questionnaire will not feel perfectly well in every way on every day  Why should they suddenly feel well when taking a tablet after being warned of possible adverse effects Commenting on the study Doireann Maddock from the British Heart Foundation said Previous research has demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of statins  While all medications have the potential for sideeffects this research may offer further reassurance to the many people in the UK who are prescribed statins
