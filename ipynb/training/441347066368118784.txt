A longterm study of men diagnosed with earlystage prostate cancer in the late s and s concludes that those who were treated with surgery were much less likely to die of the disease  or of anything else than those whose prostates were left in place and received close monitoring from their doctors The   which appears in Thursdays edition of the New England Journal of Medicine also finds that the more time that passed since their diagnosis the greater the benefits of early surgery became The  men in the   all hailed from Sweden Finland or Iceland and all had localized tumors Researchers randomly assigned  of them to radical prostatectomy and the remaining  to watchful waiting For a variety of reasons only  men in the surgery group actually got the operation and  men in watchfulwaiting group were able to avoid curative treatment As of Dec    men in the surgery group and  men in the watchfulwaiting group had died of prostate cancer That means that men who were assigned to have their prostates removed were  less likely to have died of the disease the study authors report More broadly  men in the surgery group and  men in the watchfulwaiting group had died of any cause by the end of  That means men assigned to surgery were  less likely to have died the study says Men assigned to watchfulwaiting were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have their prostate cancer spread elsewhere in the body Those metastases werent necessarily lifethreatening  many of the men whose tumors had spread died of something other than prostate cancer However when metastases were detected that often led to palliative treatment with hormone therapy which is designed to suppress levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the body to make cancer cells stop growing The side effects of the therapy were strongly associated with reduced quality of life according to the study The American Cancer Society lists impotence reduced libido loss of muscle mass and depression   of hormone therapy On the plus side about onethird of the men in the watchfulwaiting group did not see their disease spread As a result they were able to avoid surgery hormone therapy and other disruptive treatments despite getting a cancer diagnosis The research team in charge of the study has been following these men for up to  years and the longer they had tracked them the more theyd been able to say about the benefits of radical prostatectomy For instance surgery was particularly helpful for men under the age of  and men with tumors judged to be of intermediate risk Also after keeping tabs on the men for  years the researchers calculated that doctors would need to treat  men to prevent one death  years out that number had dropped to eight The Scandanavian study began around the time that doctors began screening men for prostate cancer by measuring the level of prostatespecific antigen in their blood The men in this study were not diagnosed through   Meanwhile researchers in the US have been conducting another large longterm study comparing radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting in men whose cancers were picked up as a result of PSA screening That effort known as the   or PIVOT found that men assigned to have surgery were just as likely to die during a year period as men who were assigned to close monitoring by their doctors The authors of the new Scandinavian study noted that use of PSA screening in PIVOT makes it difficult to compare the results of the two studies For one thing the cancers in the US study could have been caught at an earlier stage so the effects of surgery relative to watchful waiting might take longer to become apparent PSA screening profoundly changes the clinical domain of study they wrote in the New England Journal of  Medicine    and like   on Facebook
