Need help for a babys cough In some cases the best treatment may be a placebo Researchers studied  children  months to  years old with coughs lasting seven days or less They included children with nonspecific acute coughs eliminating any child with signs or symptoms of more treatable diseases like asthma or pneumonia or a history of lung disease or other chronic illness   They divided the children into three groups The first was given a dose of agave nectar the second grapeflavored water and the third no treatment at all  Agave nectar is similar to honey in sweetness viscosity and taste Honey has been shown to be an effective cough suppressant in children younger than  but is not recommended for those under  because it can in rare cases cause infant botulism So the authors hypothesized that agave nectar might work for all children and be safer than honey for the youngest The parents who did not know whether they were giving the nectar or the placebo recorded the severity and frequency of their childrens coughs and whether the coughing interfered with their own or their childs sleep The study   found that  the agave nectar and the placebo were significantly more effective than no treatment But parents reported that the nectar and placebo worked equally well The lead author Dr Ian M Paul a professor of pediatrics at Penn State acknowledged that the placebo was probably working on the parents not the child but that recommending one might be a good strategy for pediatricians Coughs not attributable to treatable or chronic illness he said are something you always get better from anyway so which is more important  that the child actually cough less or that parents feel theyre coughing less and then dont call the doctor dont ask for unnecessary antibiotics There are positive benefits to parents simply feeling better about their childs condition The study was paid for in part by Zarbees Inc the producer of the agave syrup
