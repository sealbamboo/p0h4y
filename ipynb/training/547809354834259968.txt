On this holiday eve Danielle Sepulveres admits shes again joined scores of other Americans wrapped in Christmas stress as she worries about money spent work time missed and her desire to somehow see every friend and family member The medley of seasonal anxiety and a ready supply of delicious highfat highsugar holiday treats causes many revelers to gobble more goodies than usual as a coping mechanism But not Sepulveres The funny thing is I dont eat more but it does make me want to drink said Sepulveres  a New Jersey author and public speaker I say yes to drinking and sex Food booze and sex are all what brain scientists call rewards and stress has long been known to increase our motivation to seek reward But   from the University of Geneva in Switzerland may have teased apart the nexus of stress indulgence and the reason why despite giving in to that extra eggnog we tend not to feel all that happy and satisfied afterwards The study released Tuesday and published in Journal of Experimental Psychology used human volunteers and may offer a vital behavioral breakthrough said   an associate adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and an expert in selfcontrol and stress Its not just in terms of holiday eating and selfcontrol in terms of drinking but there could be further implications including strategies for changing unwanted choices The Swiss study built on previous experiments that used lab animals In earlier animal tests scientists showed that stressed animals will work harder by say pushing a lever to obtain treats than will animals not under stress In other words stressed animals wanted that reward more But it turns out that once they got it the animals did not like the reward any more than nonstressed critters They didnt find it any more satisfying scientists determined That meant that wanting and liking involve two separate brain processes Stress has fueled countless jokes about salving dashed love with a big bowl of Ben and Jerrys But the Swiss team is the first to show that not only will people work harder for a reward if theyve been stressed they wont necessarily enjoy the reward any more than people who arent stressed Wanting and liking may be rooted in separate brain systems in people too If the pleasure aspect is not significantly different if you are stressed or not that implies that if you can delay the gratification and seeking the pleasure we may have more strategies to help break the cycle Alvord said That could mean that stressed people could choose to do something as simple as separating themselves in space or time from a tempting reward by say walking out of a room The experiment used  men and women from the university First they were conditioned like Pavlovs dog to associate shapes on a screen with the scent of chocolate Next they were taught that squeezing a handgrip in response to the shapes could release near them a pleasing chocolate scent Half of the participants were then exposed to a mild stress  asked to hold one hand in uncomfortably cold water while an observer stared at them and timed how long they could keep their hands submerged The control group held their hands in warm water The researchers discovered that during the presentation of the rewardassociated cue the stress group mobilized more effort squeezing the handgrip significantly more often trying to release the scent than the stressfree group the study reported Even so the perceived pleasantness of the chocolate odor was not significantly different in the stress and the stressfree group In other words while they worked harder to smell chocolate the stressed people didnt enjoy sniffing any more than did the calm test subjects Learning that we wont fully relish an anxietyfueled treat could bolster our resolve and help us walk away Alvord said Then with the cue out of sight or smell well find it much easier to resist Sepulveres who wrote a comic spokenword performance piece called Take Two Xanax and Call Me When You Land about her extreme flying anxiety said she often arrives at airports early so she can find a bar The preflight cocktail she said seems even more satisfying than usual but thats probably because shed told herself the booze is medicinal and therefore guiltfree Likewise during the holidays when I do decide to indulge it feels three times better than if it was a regular Tuesday night glass of wine But according to the Swiss groups research Sepulveres anxietydriven pleasure sensation may be rooted in the medicinal tale she tells herself  not because the extra drinks truly taste any better or really ease the stress of the season
