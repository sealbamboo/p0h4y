Its a travelers worst nightmare missing a connecting flight But few can say its because they slept through the planes landing Although some people can sleep through just about anything experts say its highly unusual that the noise and commotion of disembarking would fail to wake a passenger This is somewhat atypical says Dr Alon Avidan a professor of neurology and director of the UCLA Sleep Disorders Center I just dont know how it happened I really dont said Tom Wagner a Louisiana boat captain on his way to Los Angeles   to find himself locked in an empty plane He was finally freed when when United Airlines maintenance workers came to check the plane I mean passengers got off You think somebody would have rubbed me or pushed me and say Hey were here The droning of the plane and the motion might have initially lulled him to sleep But sleep disorder specialists know there is more to his deep sleep than this He is probably sleep deprived says Dr Charles Bae a sleep specialist at Cleveland Clinic  Avidan and Bae suspect that Wagner was in stage four sleep also known as slowwave sleep In this stage of sleep the body recovers from sleep deprivation and people are unaware of any auditory or environmental cues People generally spend about  percent of their sleep in this state closer to the beginning of the nights rest       He was completely unaware Avidan says We dont really dream in stage four People in this stage of sleep are very calm and relaxed and not easily awoken Children are especially sound sleepers in this state  even the loudest of noises wont cause them to stir The experts agree that it would take a good shake to wake someone in slowwave sleep And if the flight attendants managed to wake him hed probably be pretty confused  He may have been groggy and had that drunken feeling says Bae The fact that Wagner was so deeply asleep might indicate that he has an underlying sleep disorder  or he needs to get a good nights rest The two recommend that he try to improve his sleep and see a doctor to rule out any sleep disorders  It is a little unusual for his age to be so unengaged and unaware Avidan says
