Dr Martin Salias   is a loss that Sierra Leone can ill afford Hes the sixth doctor to   during this epidemic in Sierra Leone a country that has few to start with Ebola is still spreading out of control in West Africa in part because there are too few health care workers to recognize and fight the virus in the first place And the epidemics not just killing people directly Its effects are filling up hospitals and clinics with Ebola patients or forcing their shutdown leaving people with other health emergencies from childbirth to malaria with nowhere to go Salia wasnt even treating Ebola patients He was a primary care doctor at a Methodist hospital probably infected experts believe when he was treating a patient for other symptoms without suspecting he or she had the virus Every one that is infected is a tragedy both for the response and for their family said Dr Emmanuel dHarcourt senior health director for the International Rescue Committee The World Health Organization says  health care workers have been infected during this epidemic and  of them have died More than  have died in Sierra Leone Thats a lot for a country that started out with just two physicians for every  people and far fewer now by many counts The United States has  doctors per   more than  times as many And its not just Sierra Leone that comes up short There is one doctor for every  people in Liberia Rabih Torbay who heads international operations at the International Medical Corps told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing Tuesday Thats before  died So you can just imagine the gap now he added Salia joins a long list of prominent doctors to fall victim to Ebola in Sierra Leone Others include   medical superintendent of Kambia Government Hospital in northern Sierra Leone who died earlier this month Dr Olive Buck who was in charge of Lumley Government Hospital in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown and died in September Dr Modupeh Cole who died last August at the Ebola treatment center operated by   Medecins Sans Frontieres in the northeastern town of Kailahun and Dr Sheik Umar Khan who   in July Sierra Leones government says it will pay  to the family of any health worker who dies because he or she treated an Ebola patient DHarcourt says his organization is working to help train physicians nurses and other health workers how to protect themselves  especially when treating patients who may not be suspected of having Ebola Youd be surprised but there actually is a lot that can be done that will reduce the danger dHarcourt told NBC News It might not bring it to zero but it will greatly reduce it For example doctors or nurses shouldnt touch the patient at first instead using an infrared thermometer pointed at a persons forehead to take his or her temperature A series of questions should follow quickly to determine whether someones been in close contact with an Ebola patient Symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting are important also If they have fever and two or more of the other symptoms then they are considered very likely to have Ebola dHarcourt said Such patients should be isolated and treated only by people using protective gear unless and until Ebola is ruled out by a blood test In facilities where personal protective equipment PPE isnt available health workers should keep their distance You give them food and water and in some cases medicine but not to handle them if health care workers dont have equipment dHarcourt said We are working very diligently to make sure everyone does have equipment he added But its not getting shipped where it needs to be quickly enough he said There continues to be a challenge in things reaching the ground dHarcourt said The US government is also working to address the shortage of health workers The US Africa Command will   new health care workers a week for six months and longer if needed Four of the Americans treated for Ebola in the US were doctors who served in West Africa Dr Rick Sacra Dr Kent Brantly Dr Craig Spencer and a fourth physician who hasnt been named A fifth patient   was working at a hospital helping medical workers Cuba sent a team of  nurses and  doctors Many countries have offered money but no other country has offered such a large number of workers to go in and help do the most difficult jobs in this crisis said WHO assistant director Dr Bruce Aylward And as doctors nurses and other health workers die from Ebola it can scare off others Many feel the stigma may hurt their chances of resuming normal lives back home or fear forced quarantines could cost them their jobs or at the very least keep them from the normal lives and families for an extra three weeks on top of any time volunteered Brantly who caught Ebola while treating patients in Liberia but has recovered said such worries shouldnt keep skilled volunteers away If you are a medical professional considering traveling to West Africa please dont let irrational fear stand in your way he said in an email distributed by the White House last week I am extremely confident that I did not contract Ebola in the isolation unit in Liberia  but rather in the emergency room of our hospital
