India has lately become infamous for its epidemic sexual violence and discrimination against women Sexual harassment there is so rampant that it even has a nickname   But mothers may be practicing discrimination too in how they treat their daughters in the womb Indian mothers were slightly more likely to seek out better prenatal care when carrying a boy than when carrying a girl economists   in the   An analysis of more than  health surveys across India found that women pregnant with boys were  percent more likely to go to prenatal medical appointments take iron supplements deliver the baby in a health care facility instead of the home and receive tetanus shots than women pregnant with girls The discrepancy rises to  percent in northern India where gender discrimination is more prevalent The survey didnt ask the women whether they knew the babys sex before getting the prenatal care But the studys authors   and   say its common practice for doctors to share that information with parents But even disparities this small between how male and female fetuses are treated harm Indias women they tell Shots Access to prenatal care is linked to a  percent decrease in infant mortality in India And theres a whole wealth of evidence that early childhood health influences outcomes later in life  like educational attainment income fulltime employment says Bharadwaj an assistant professor at the University of California San Diego Decisions your mother makes early in life can affect whether you make it to age  or earn higher wages at age  says Lakdawala of Michigan State University Of course women may make decisions about prenatal care unconsciously especially if they dont know the babys sex And its unclear what exactly could drive this type of gender discrimination But Bharadwaj thinks it might be connected to social disparities For instance if a family knows that a girl is going to earn lower wages then parents may not want to invest as much in her future This idea fits with what the team found in other countries Women in China Pakistan and Bangladesh also slightly increased their prenatal care for boys while those in Sri Lanka Thailand and Ghana  where sexual discrimination is less of a problem  didnt India and China both have populations with many more men than women To try to reverse the trend doctors are prohibited from revealing a babys sex during ultrasound exams Still the practice remains common in both countries Illicit gender identification is a lucrative business in China   recently   one Chinese company that was giving women illegal ultrasounds and abortions in the back of vans for about  to  yuan  to  and  yuan  respectively Another company charged  yuan  to send blood for a gender test in Hong Kong So what about here in the US where knowing the sex of a baby is often a top priority for parents who are expecting Even though theres evidence that Americans generally favor sons a study in    that parents in the US invest equally in prenatal health care for baby girls and boys This was true even among firstgeneration immigrants from China and India
