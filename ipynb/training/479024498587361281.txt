I dont get why you need to say this stuff when you know its not true When you have this amazing megaphone why would you cheapen your show  With power comes a great deal of responsibility The   is in charge of protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive advertising and marketing practices that raise health and safety concerns In May the  sued the sellers of  for deceiving consumers through fake news sites and invented health claims  The commission said that weeks after The Dr Oz Show promoted the benefits of Pure Green Coffee some companies that marketed the product used video from his show to increase sales  The scientific evidence supporting green coffee bean extract as a weight loss supplement is weak  A small study   found chlorogenic acid the main ingredient in green coffee beans helped  human participants lose on average  pounds over  weeks But another study on chlorogenic acid in mice found that the acid did not help mice lose weight and in fact   A   of three studies on green coffee extract found the supplement produced on average a fivepound loss among study participants But all three studies were short term and included a small number of participants leading the metaanalysis authors to conclude More rigorous trials are needed to assess the usefulness of GCE as a weight loss tool Oz told the panel that he does use flowery language to describe certain products on his show but added he believes in them so much he has given them to his family    My job I feel on the show is to be a cheerleader for the audience and when they dont think they have hope when they dont think they can make it happen I want to look and I do look everywhere including in alternative healing traditions for any evidence that might be supportive to them Oz said In addition to green coffee beans McCaskill called out Garcinia cambogia as another weight loss product Oz has promoted   Thanks to brand new scientific research I can tell you about a revolutionary fat buster Oz said on his show  with the words No Exercise No Diet No Effort on the screen behind him Its called Garcinia cambogia  A   of  participants found Garcinia cambogia did not significantly help people lose weight any more than a placebo But a   of Garcinia cambogia studies hedged on the supplements ineffectiveness saying its weight loss benefits remain to be proven in largerscale and longerterm clinical trials Whether it helps people lose weight or not the Garcinia cambogia does   to use some other studies say  Oz testified Tuesday that he could not be held responsible for what certain companies say online about the products He said hes toned down some of his language and will publish a list of products he thinks really can help people lose weight  To not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer Oz said in a prepared statement after the hearing In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate weight loss supplements Under current law companies selling these products do not need FDA approval before marketing them to the public  Just because you see a supplement product on a store shelf does NOT mean it is safe or effective   When safety issues are suspected FDA must investigate and when warranted take steps to have the product removed from the market However it is much easier for a firm to get a product on the market than it is for FDA to take a product off the market These weight loss products even those that claim to be all natural may contain toxic ingredients the FDA says or they may interact badly with other medications Make sure to check with your doctor before taking any supplement   The FTC told Elizabeth Cohen CNN senior medical correspondent that there are just too many weight loss products using deceptive advertising to sue them all But consumers should be wary of certain phrases that are most certainly false the FTC said including any that claim to help you lose weight without diet and exercise  Bottom line  dont believe everything you see Do your homework online and make sure any claim about a weight loss product is backed up by scientific evidence
