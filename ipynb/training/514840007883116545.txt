But Redemption like so many hospitals in Liberia is closed or partially closed out of fear that Ebola patients will infect health care workers Its a fear based in reality In Liberia more than  health care workers have contracted the disease and  have died of it  Next Kamara drove to ELWA Hospital but learned it only takes Ebola patients Then he drove his mother to JFK Hospital but it was overwhelmed and accepting only pregnant women children and Ebola patients   Cooper Hospital was his last chance  Kamara and his mother waited outside By now she was convulsing every  minutes as if someone had put a spell on her he says Her breathing was rapid and shallow  A doctor came out  a tall man Kamara remembers He pointed to a small blood stain on his mothers shirt He wanted to know what it was from  Kamara explained that during one of her seizures his mother had bit her tongue and bled a little But he could tell the doctor was worried she had Ebola because bleeding is one of the symptoms He turned Kanneh away  Lusa Khanneh had run out of options The only place her son could take her was home Four days later on September  she died  Saymon Kamara is angry  If the hospitals were open she wouldnt have died he says This wasnt her time to go  Theres no question that countless Liberians are dying because of Ebola even when they dont have it There are few functioning hospitals or doctors offices Health care services weak before Ebola barely exist vaccination rates for example have plummeted The primary care system here is basically shattered says Sarah Crowe a spokeswoman for UNICEF who is working in Liberia Its an outrage that children are dying of diseases like measles that are preventable and treatable  Even after death Ebola  a disease her son says she never had  haunted Kanneh  Her family heard on the radio that no one should touch a cadaver no matter what the cause of death Call in the announcer on the radio said and a team from Dead Body Management will come for the body  Its simply impractical to test every cadaver for Ebola and sort out who died of what before burial It would dangerously delay the burial to do so and would take up too many resources  So the Kanneh family did as they were instructed On Saturday the day after her death a team of five men in white suits covered head to toe sprayed Lusa Khannehs body with chlorine and buried her  Kanneh didnt receive the burial she would have wanted as a devout Muslim Her family didnt wash her body They didnt carry her to the mosque and pray over her They didnt bury her themselves  These guys who buried her  I dont know these guys Kamara says referring to the men in the white suits with the chlorine spray  I expected my family to bury her but now strangers have buried her But he says he understands I have to accept this because this is the kind of country I live in and the kind of country my mother died in he says I have to accept it with a heavy heart
