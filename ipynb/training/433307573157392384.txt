A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted Tuesday that there isn't enough evidence to say the anti-inflammatory painkiller naproxen is safer than other pain drugs when it comes to heart health.. The committee vote was 16-9 that naproxen, sold as Aleve by Bayer AG, can't be convincingly proven to have greater cardiac safety than ibuprofen, Celebrex and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Ibuprofen is sold under brand names including Advil and Motrin.
