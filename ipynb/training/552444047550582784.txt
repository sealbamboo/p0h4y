Readers of the BBC News website have been sharing their experiences of AE It comes on the day that NHS figures were published showing waiting times in England between October and December were the worst for a decade However despite missing the target of seeing  of AE patients within four hours the performance in England is still better than elsewhere in the UK We dialled  at  requesting an ambulance It didnt arrive until Tuesday morning  she spent more than  hours on the floor She suffers from confusion but has problems with her legs following a hip replacement  My sister is a qualified nurse and was trying to comfort my mum She phoned  four times We were told it would be a twohour wait then four hours then six My father who is in his nineties was up all night looking out of the window to see if there was an ambulance Free at the point of delivery We havent even got to the point of delivery Its not acceptable Its called an emergency service and over  hours waiting is not an emergency service I dont think the NHS is coping Its patently underfunded I think there is an increasingly elderly population and over time these people are going to put greater demands on the healthcare system We have seen a large number of people coming to AE The way to solve the problems  particularly when we hit winter and there is more flu virus coughs colds and pneumonias around  is through collaborative working and innovation Its about thinking about working together as a team to find the best way to treat the patient in the right place at the right time Morale generally in the AE department at Wigan is still maintained Ive not got a sense that our patients are all feeling distressed or let down by the system locally As long as we communicate to patients that there may be a delay in being seen sometimes at very busy periods they are in the main quite accepting of that I have nothing but praise for the staff there  I broke my finger in November and was going back and forth into hospital well into December as at first the fracture was not diagnosed In AE you get a card if you should be seen earlier than some which is a great idea I was told to stay rather than go to minor injuries or anywhere else I had a bit of a wait to see a triage nurse but not too long I waited around two and a half hours  There seemed to be a lot of people waiting who looked as if a GP visit would have sufficed  I cant fault my treatment I think we need to stop knocking the NHS and try to find a way that would wheedle out the abusers of the service  Ive seen staff getting abused and sworn at sometimes the good has to be told There were people who had been assessed as not being urgent and if thats the case of course there is going to be a bit of a wait Id acquired a hacking cough and a temperature Unfortunately Ive also got a low white blood cell count Its a condition that means that if I begin to run a temperature I need to contact my GP or a hospital I rang NHS Direct and after a conversation they told me to go straight to the Princess Royal I got to AE and went through triage Over the phone I was told a doctor would be waiting to see me When I got there it appeared there was an overlap Triage put me in a queue with everybody else Then I was taken through to AE proper and another minitriage AE had clearly been under pressure for some time Reception were abrupt and told my wife and I we could be waiting for six or seven hours After a blood test I was put on a trolley and wheeled away Because of my condition I need to be kept away from others I got into a room at midnight and was there on the trolley until around  the following day  I was told that I was the youngest person there needing a bed but that there wasnt a bed available It was bedlam There was a lot of noise I could hear people coughing and a lot of activity throughout the night including small children crying  it was fairly distressing  Staff were clearly under a lot of pressure Food and drink were in short supply I wasnt at all happy about being left in that situation
