Jack Sims career is in the toilet  literally The yearold Singaporean made his fortune in the construction industry when he was in his s And he wanted to make a meaningful contribution to the world Sim tried his hand at saving historic buildings and answering phone calls from people in distress but neither felt right I was looking for something that was neglected and able to serve large number of people he says Thats when he came across a quote from Singapores thenprime minister in a news article He said we should measure our graciousness according to the cleanliness of our public toilets Sim says Sim had long bemoaned the sad condition of public toilets in his native country At first I was just trying to solve Singapores dirty toilet issue and then I realized that in the world there are a lot of people who dont even have toilets So in  he founded the WTO  the   that is Its a nonprofit coalition of leaders from more than  countries who try to come up with innovative solutions to tackle the worlds sanitation and water problems Together these loo lovers started the World Toilet College and SaniShop initiatives that train entrepreneurs not only to make household toilets but also to maintain them and market them in the developing world More than  people have been trained since  the WTO says that up to  toilets were assembled in  alone The same year WTO was founded Sim and his colleagues established World Toilet Day to draw attention to the fact that  billion people in the world still dont have access to a proper toilet or clean water The United Nations officially   the day last year Today Sim is at UN headquarters speaking about how lack of sanitation takes a particular toll on women To commemorate World Toilet Day what better way than to sit down with the man who now proudly claims the name Mr Toilet  and who did in fact sit on a toilet in a cold and windy field for our photo The interview has been edited for length and clarity When we make people laugh they listen Although the subject is very embarrassing its become very palatable The only prerequisite was that I could make people laugh and I could laugh at myself When they laugh at me its fine Once I got myself psychologically adjusted to that then everything works The toilet is like sex Long ago it was very difficult to talk about sex and then Hugh Hefner came along with   magazine and legitimized sex Now people are singing about making love in songs and all that So I think eventually well be able to sing about going to the toilet in a very natural and enjoyable way I think we have to gentrify this taboo subject by first moving from taboo to funny to sexy and then to normal That if you give toilets to people they will use them Open defecation in a field on the street wherever has a lot of advantages Its free of charge and you dont have to buy soap You dont have to empty the toilet Its a norm from centuries and generations So first you have to make owning a toilet not just rational but aspirational You have to make a toilet come with bragging rights like a Louis Vuitton handbag Aspiration is important as you can see even rich people have really nice toilets  they go for the highest level all the time So this is the same as the poor people They aspire to own products that have bragging rights like a cellphone or television The psychology is exactly the same A toilet should be as good as the house So if the house is simple then the toilet should be simpler When its not compatible interesting things happen When we donated a toilet to a school in rural China later on the principal moved his office into the toilet because he found that the toilet is more beautiful than the school and his office The toilet must be closelooped That means you can empty the waste and you can recycle the nutrients If it ends up in the river and the lake and contaminates the water it spreads disease In the poverty sector women suffer a lot when they have to defecate in the dark early in the morning or at night They face peeping toms rape and molestation During the day they cant go to the toilet because there is no privacy so they try not to drink water and they become dehydrated Girls drop out of school when they are menstruating because schools have no toilet Having a toilet has to become a norm and it has to happen very quickly The first thing is get people to discuss it Then theyll get angry and realize that this is not fair and theyll take action Long ago when Singapore was a developing country I was a child I was born in  It was a very poor country with open defecation with a hut over the pond where we drop our waste and then the fish would come and eat it Today its the thirdrichest country per capita in the world I know that poverty can be transformed if you think of it as an entrepreneurial approach So teach people to produce the toilet and drive demand and supply Make everything efficient and you can solve the problem Ive already thought of a concept  its about lovers dining and wining Then they start quarreling and the girl dumps the flower the boy had given her and leaves And the guy will say The joy is brief but letting go is such a relief Then hes sitting on the toilet bowl letting go and reminiscing about the wonderful time with his girlfriend by the river But everybody is defecating in the river So he stops them and all the people who were defecating start walking into toilets The river becomes clean again and his girlfriend comes back to him That would be a really nice song if I can find a singer a scriptwriter and a videographer all together Maybe Adam Sandler I think that there should be a lot of comedians who can do a good job and who are not too shy Maybe Jennifer Lawrence  she would be perfect for it and I could listen to her talk about toilets all day long
