The United States is facing a health care crisis  Our supply of blood is dangerously low The American Red Cross reports that across the nation blood donations were down an estimated  percent in June  about  fewer donations than in May In the face of a blood supply shortage that is bad and likely to get worse there is a group of people  gay men  who might ease the situation if only they were allowed to help  Gay men who want to donate blood are forbidden because of an outdated nonscientific regulation that bans anyone who has had sex even once with another man since  It is long past time to let those who want to help others by donating blood do so Our blood supply depends on a tiny handful of heroic repeat donors But making things worse there is emerging concern about the danger of donating blood too often Donations are down from last year  and last year was a very bad year in terms of the availability of blood The Red Cross which a major collector of donated blood in the US has issued an emergency call for blood of all types and donations of platelets keyclotting components of blood that are often needed by cancer patients One reason for the critically low supply is seasonal People dont donate as much during summer vacation Another reason is school closingsa good amount of donated blood comes from high schools and colleges that are not open in the summer But another reason one that is getting worse year after year is too few donors Only about  percent of eligible Americans donate blood Of that number many donors as high as  percent come from a much smaller number of repeat donors And that group is shrinking since older donors  the members of the World War II and Korean generations  give at higher rates than younger individuals There is growing concern that giving very often can lead to iron deficiency That can lead to fatigue compromised mental function and eventually   A major study has been launched to find out how often a person can safely donate each year Depending on the studys findings there may be tighter restrictions on the number of times a person can donate in a year That could mean even more trouble for the blood supply Which leads us back to gay men The ban on donation by men who have sex with other men dates from the height of the AIDS epidemic in the early s when there was not even a name for the disease At that time there were no tests to find the HIV virus in the blood supply Many people especially hemophiliacs who rely on regular transfusions died from HIV they got from donated blood Much improved HIV testing has made the old rule obsolete The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that HIV tests are highly accurate with the risk from a unit of blood reduced to about  per  million units in the US The worry is from the risk during the window period which occurs very early after being infected with HIV when even current testing methods cant detect antibodies But   and the   a blood donation advocacy group all support throwing out the ban So does the American Medical Association which just voted on June th to ditch the ban All these groups seek a rule that targets risky sexual behavior that could compromise the blood supply that might not be picked up by todays highly accurate testing  In essence this means a waiting period of months  not decades  for any wouldbe donor who has had risky unprotected sex be it maletomale or unprotected heterosexual sex with multiple partners or prostitutes Canada Britain Australia Japan and New Zealand have all moved to adopt this more reasonable and scientifically sound policy  Dying for want of blood should not happen in America Each of us who is able ought to donate There are no easy estimates how many gay men would donate or how much or how often But a  n July  urged healthy gay or bisexual men to attempt to donate blood at local centers as a protest against the FDA ban saw a large turnout  With the supply as poor as it is the argument for excluding people based on a rule that is based on nothing but fear makes no sense
