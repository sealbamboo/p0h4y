A year after doctors first identified an illness that came to be known as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome researchers are reporting fresh genetic information about the virus that causes it The findings dont bring scientists any closer to understanding where   is coming from In fact the main news is that researchers were wrong about the source of some infections in the largest cluster of cases so far That would be in the province of   in eastern Saudi Arabia the country where most of the worlds  MERS cases and  deaths have occurred The AlHasa outbreak was concentrated in several hospitals Last month an international team of health workers   that  of the  MERS cases in AlHasa were acquired by persontoperson transmission in hemodialysis units intensive care units or inpatient units in three different health care facilities But thats not entirely right scientists   Thursday in  A look at the viruss genome indicates that some of those  cases werent hospitalacquired infections after all When researchers compared the viruses from some patients with those from other patients who were presumed to be sources of the infection the viruses genetic codes were just too different When we mapped the cases based on contacts we were confident we knew the source of transmission study author   tells Shots Hes the Saudi deputy health minister and the official in charge of the kingdoms response to MERS The new genetic analysis Memish says shows that there were more sources of infection in AlHasa than previously thought The hypothesis now is that there were multiple introductions into the hospitals from the community which gives us the clue that there is probably a community source of transmission he says Those sources could be people with unrecognized mild cases of MERS They could be animals that transmitted the MERS virus to people who ended up in the hospital Or both Memish leans toward animals as the likeliest source Whatever the source is it seems to have gone underground for now eluding the Saudis continuing surveillance efforts There does not seem to be you know an ongoing source since we have not seen any more cases in AlHasa since the cluster stopped Memish says My gut feeling is that there is some animal reservoir that is causing the transmission that is still to be found he says Researchers found three distinctly different types of MERS viruses around the nations capital Riyadh Given the pace at which such coronaviruses evolve that means a single introduction of the MERS virus from an animal to a human and then ongoing persontoperson transmission isnt likely Wherever the virus came from it probably was transmitted multiple times So far the virus hasnt turned up in any of the bats camels goats sheep dogs cats or rodents tested Memish doesnt count a   that a small piece of a virus retrieved from a bat was identical to part of the MERS virus from the first reported case One Dutch team recently   evidence that camels had been infected with MERS or a very similar virus But it didnt look specifically for the virus itself We will continue to try to find the actual virus in an animal so we can confirm it Memish says But the animal search is really just beginning Memish says a team from the United Nations   visited Saudi Arabia just this month Were waiting for guidance on what animals to sample what sort of samples how many of them from which part of the country he says Hopefully that will give us some results that will take us forward Some scientists think the effort to find the source of MERS hasnt been nearly urgent enough Whats really troubling here is that we should have had this kind of information long ago says   of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota Osterholm points to steady reports of new MERS cases including  more from Saudi Arabia   as evidence that the virus is circulating mainly among humans  contrary to Memishs hypothesis that MERS is coming mainly from repeated animaltohuman infections Week after week month after month I think the epidemiology suggests unrecognized persontoperson cases Osterholm tells Shots He has urged Saudi officials to do studies with people to figure out whether those people who got infected show specific patterns of exposures like contact with animals or other people with symptoms The fact that we have such incomplete information a year into this is just inexcusable Osterholm says Whats the urgency MERS has a  percent mortality rate among known cases And it could conceivably acquire a few crucial mutations that would allow it to transmit efficiently among humans Thats exactly what   a cousin of MERS did back in  when it transformed from an animal virus to one that spread easily among people Memish is sensitive to criticism that Saudi Arabia isnt doing enough to solve the mystery of MERS I know the criticism has not stopped from some people but I can tell you we are working night and day he says It wont be too long before we find out whats going on This weekend Saudi Arabia is bringing  experts from all over the world to try to solve the problem  or at least figure out how to We will have an amazing faculty he says If all those experts cannot do it you cannot blame us
