When Stephen Wheeler realized he had an aching swollen finger he called his primary care doctor who works for MedStar Health The doctor referred him to   in a strip mall in the Baltimore suburbs Wheeler says he probably would have ended up waiting a long time if hed gone to the doctor And even longer at the emergency room But they are all about speedy service here at the urgent care center Wheeler got in and out in  minutes Theres a timer outside of every exam room so the staff knows how long a patient has been waiting Because Wheeler was already in the system the clinic was able to pull up his electronic health records and find out if he was allergic to any medications or was due for any other care Hospitals already own more than a quarter of the nearly  urgent care clinics in the US that are drawing patients away from emergency rooms Were still in the very early stages of this trend says Tom Charland who runs a consulting company called   that focuses on walkin clinics He cautions that its still unclear whether hospitals will actually be successful at managing urgent care centers Hospitals tend to be good at providing highquality care but theyre not always so good at customer service Things like understanding how to locate an urgent care clinic in the right retail complex keeping the wait times down offering people to book their appointments online  hospitals have yet to prove that they can do that effectively he says But Bob Gilbert who is in charge of ambulatory services for MedStar says hes proud of PromptCares location He says his company is ready Here we are in a local shopping center where youd normally not find health care he says People are used to coming here they know where it is the parking is free The hospital makes money for every patient the clinic refers to a MedStar facility for followup care like a CT scan or an appointment with an orthopedist Patients who dont yet have a regular source of health care can be referred to a MedStar primary care doctor But Gilbert says the clinics are also a longterm investment And the future is this Insurers and Medicare are starting to pay providers to keep patients healthy Providers get a bonus if they manage to lower the cost of the medical services their patients need These clinics could be a key part of this strategy for hospitals The Baltimore location is the first of seven urgent care clinics Gilbert is opening over the next year MedStar is hoping for  in the next few years
