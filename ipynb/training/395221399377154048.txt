In Pennsylvania there were rumors that a person could be charged for doing what a good number of people did to me and do to countless other momstobe A Cumberland County man   after touching the belly of a pregnant woman  a woman he did not know according to attorney Phil DiLucente who is not directly connected with the case but is familiar with the reporting about it There was a woman who was pregnant and a man had touched her belly area which women have to go through all the time and she didnt permit him to do that and then he repeated it so she decided to file charges DiLucente said The Cumberland County district attorney has not returned our call Any time you harass annoy alarm another and theres touching involved without consent someone can be charged with harassment the Pittsburghbased attorney said He added that all states have similar harassment laws on the books although he knows of no other case where the the law was applied to unwanted pregnant belly touching DiLucente said he was surprised by the harassment charge because what was previously considered acceptable behavior is no longer being tolerated at least by one expecting mother From Twitter to Facebook to email I found there was no shortage of opinion about whether it should be illegal to touch a womans pregnant belly without asking Jennifer Bosse a mother of two and host of the blog   said its a really tricky question  Elderly grandmother that exclaims excitedly and touches your belly for the briefest of moments Maybe mildly annoying but not a crime Scary woman or man that grabs at your belly and continues to jiggle you around long after the first no Crime Bosse wrote in an email Dani Mathes said on  Annoying Sure Illegal Heck no We cant have laws for everything We already complain about having so many laws for minor crap If he doesnt know her well then he should not touch her said the person behind the handle lizturn on Twitter adding that although it shouldnt be illegal its still not a good idea Beth Engelman who has an elementaryschoolage son and cofounded the site   thinks people who ask intrusive questions or tell a pregnant woman what to do are way worse than people who pat pregnant womens bellies Its not that I think its OK to go up and pat a pregnant womans belly but I dont think its harassment or should be illegal said Engelman a single mom in Chicago Having strangers pat your belly predict what you are having ask about names or give you unsolicited advice is part of the experience On the other side are readers like Jordan Elizabeth who believe unwanted rubbing of a pregnant womans belly should definitely be considered a crime Would you think someone should be charged with harassment for wandering around rubbing the stomachs of nonpregnant people in public without their permission Because I am fairly certain someone would eventually call the police  or more likely simply hit them she said on  I fail to see what about a woman being pregnant suddenly makes her body in any way the property of society Its inappropriate touching and that is harassment under most penal codes she added Irene Issaias wrote on CNNs Facebook page Any unwanted physical contact is an assault and battery so yes it is and should be illegal if it is not consented to by the mother Carrie Courter also on CNNs Facebook page said If he had touched her breasts without her permission it would be a non story as that is not allowed Why is her belly any different Said MrNickCharles  on Twitter As a former law enforcement officer I always assumed unwanted touching of another is assault While there may be a debate about whether unwanted pregnant belly rubbing should be against the law there didnt seem to be any disagreement when it came to the act itself Just stop doing it folks said many moms Andrea Kristina said that when people would put their hands out to pat her pregnant belly on the grocery store line she would take a step back There is such a thing as personal space and you wouldnt just walk up and touch every round thing that strikes your fancy otherwise so why do that to a pregnant woman Kristina posted on CNN Livings Facebook page Its creepy and rude Laura Weinberg Kovall is a mom of one who runs  in New York which offers fitness classes of all levels to moms She said she never understood the urge to reach out and touch a pregnant womans belly Would it be OK to randomly touch a nonpregnant womans belly Never Weinberg Kovall said Diane Martin also on CNNs Facebook page said she was touched without her permission during both of her pregnancies I got mouthy and pushed hands away she said Before I gave birth in July I had my own personal bodyguard My yearold son told people to not touch my tummy Only me my daddy and the doctor can touch my mommys tummy  Sounds like a solution to me
