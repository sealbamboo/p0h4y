Nearly everyone has had a stomachache at some point But really any organ in your abdomen there are many could be to blame 
                   
                  Tummy trouble can be shortlived come and go or show up only after you eatall clues to the cause Doctors can also run a number of tests to narrow it down says Vivek Kaul MD acting chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester NY 
                   
                  Read more to find out about possible culprits   Gallstones are stones that form in the gallbladder a tiny sac that hangs out under the liver disgorging bile as needed to digest fats 
                   
                  These stones cause swelling and can block the duct into the intestine resulting in pain Gallstone pain tends to strike the right side of the upper abdomen particularly after fatty meals 
                   
                  Such meals trigger the gallbladder to contract If the gallbladder is inflamed any contraction of that nature will be amplified and typically will cause pain to the patient says Dr Kaul Inflammation of the pancreas can cause burning pain in the upper or middle abdomen Some people even have shooting pain that drives right through to their back says Dr Kaul 
                   
                  You may lean forward or lie on your back to try to relieve the pain which may subside into a dull ache nausea and vomiting says Osama Alaradi MD a gastroenterologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit 
                   
                  Too much alcohol can be a culprit says Dr Kaul as are gallstones the gallbladder and pancreas deliver their digestive juices into the intestine via the same duct It often requires hospitalization Gastroesophageal reflux disease or   can cause pain in the upper stomach and lower chest aka   
                   
                  The cause A valve that separates the stomach from the esophagus is weak allowing food and acid from the stomach to splash upwards Ouch 
                   
                  Eating too much food or the wrong type of food fatty for instance can make it worse Losing weight watching what you eat and medication like   can also help Millions of people around the world have lactose intolerance In fact in some areas of the world the lactose intolerant outnumber those who can digest lactose a sugar found in milk and milk products 
                   
                  This type of food intolerance causes mild to severe abdominal pain depending where you place on the tolerance scale says Patricia L Raymond an assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School I advise everyone who thinks they have an intolerance to take a lactose tolerance test she says Its not a yes or no answer because severity comes into play Symptoms include bloating diarrhea burping gas and indigestion and vary based on your level of sensitivity  
                   
                  The solution Skip the dairy products like milk and cheese and be wary of packaged foods Raymond says packaged foods often contain hidden milk products or whey a milkbased byproduct found in many protein powder mixes and other nutritional foods If youre lactose intolrant you can also drink Lactaid milk or take Lactaid pills to prevent stomach aches and pains No drug is without side effects and sometimes that includes abdominal pain A medication itself can be caustic or slow the stomachs emptying causing pain says Dr Raymond Pain medications known as NSAIDs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin have this caustic property and can cause swelling in the stomach lining and may even lead to ulcers 
                   
                  Oral bisphosphonates a popular class of drugs that helps preserve bone density and prevent   can cause swellingand therefore painin the lower esophagus says Dr Kaul Also look out for antibiotics specifically those containing azithromycin and take them after a meal to give the stomach a proper lining for the drug  Narcotic and blood pressure medications relax the stomachs walls and allow food to sit and ferment in your stomach contributing to a queasy feeling Diverticulitis is an inflammation of diverticula or pockets that form in the lining of the intestine usually the colon 
                   
                  These look like punchedout holes in the lining of the colon that tend to get inflamed or obstructed with stool or other foreign material says Dr Kaul 
                   
                  Symptoms can include cramping in the lower abdomen which may respond to antibiotics A highfiber diet can help In more severe cases it can cause abscesses bleeding and even perforations resulting in severe pain or even the need for surgery or a hospitalization Some people react badly to gluten a protein found in wheat barley and rye The most severe form of   is called   
                   
                  The gluten causes damage in the small intestine explains Dr Alaradi The small intestine doesnt work normally it doesnt absorb nutrients Experts and patients are becoming more aware of gluten intolerance and celiac disease which causes gas bloating mildtosevere pain and fatigue 
                   
                  The small intestines inability to absorb nutrients may lead to chronic diarrhea weight loss and even malnutrition Endometriosis only affects women Its a condition that occurs when cells from the lining of the uterus escape and start to grow in other parts of the body usually somewhere in the pelvis 
                   
                  Pain irregular bleeding and infertility can result Endometriosis is difficult to diagnose says Dr Kaul and often requires a referral to a gynecologist and a pelvic ultrasound 
                   
                  If the endometriosis is confined to one small area surgery may help Otherwise it is treated with pain medication and hormone therapy as the menstrual cycle tends to drive painful symptoms Even though the thyroid gland is located in the neck it can cause problems lower down in the body 
                   
                  The thyroid regulates several functions in the body and the digestive tract is one of the systems explains Dr Alaradi 
                   
                  If the thyroid produces too much hormone   it speeds up the digestive tract resulting in diarrhea and abdominal cramps he says 
                   
                  On the other hand an underactive thyroid   slows down the digestive tract potentially leading to pain from constipation and gas No one wants to think that stomach symptoms are due to a parasitic worm or other creature But it happens Parasites can attach themselves to your stomach lining or hang out in the small intestine or colon leading to a host of unwanted symptoms 
                   
                  There are many types but the most common in the US are   and   which you can get by swimming in   or drinking contaminated water Or in some outbreaks unpasteurized cider The tiny protozoa cause cramps diarrhea and nausea about  to  days after exposure for Crypto or  to  weeks later for   Other types of parasites can be picked up in undercooked or contaminated food Dr Raymond says sushi when obtained from a less than reputable source could contain parasites Most people who have appendicitis an inflammation of the appendix experience sudden pain thats bad enough to warrant an emergency room trip 
                   
                  Appendicitis is more common in children and young adults though it can happen to older adults and usually starts with pain in the midabdomen progressing into the lower right part of the abdomen A telltale sign is pain when you bend your leg because its pulling a muscle near your appendix as you make that motion says Dr Raymond If you think you could have the condition learn more about    
                   
                  If the appendix isnt removed it can burst leading to longterm hospitalization and potentially lifethreatening peritonitis Head to the emergency room right away if you think appendicitis is causing your tummy pain Raymond says its extremely normal to have your appendix removed and is a routine procedure Peptic ulcer disease or ulcers in the stomach and duodenum the first part of the small intestine is a common source of abdominal pain says Dr Alaradi 
                   
                  Pain usually strikes the midupper abdominal area and sometimes occurs after meals he adds People with duodenal ulcers can wake in the middle of the night due to pain 
                   
                  NSAID medications and     bacteria are major causes Antibiotics and acidsuppressing drugs are often used to treat ulcers caused by bacteria If you consume too much sorbitol which is found in some sugarfree products it can cause pain and diarrhea According to a  article in   a yearold woman had an pound weight loss abdominal pain and diarrhea as many as  bowel movements a day from chewing about  sticks of gum a day 
                   
                  A yearold man had similar symptoms after chewing about  sticks of sugarless gum and eating sorbitolcontaining sweets daily Sorbitol goes into your GI tract and since your body cant absorb it it gets to the bacteria in your colon which eat it and produce gas and fluids that contribute to diarrhea explains Dr Raymond 
                   
                  To fix the problem cut back on the amount of sugarless gum you chew Stress can cause headaches high blood pressure insomnia and yes tummy trouble Depression has been linked with digestive problems including loss of appetite and weight loss as well as   The relationship seems to go both ways according to a study published in  in the journal   
                   
                  In other words depression may be causing the stomach aches but constant abdominal pain may just as easily lead to depression and anxiety   Food poisoning from viruses or bacteria can cause abdominal pain along with diarrhea and vomiting Many outbreaks of food poisoning have been seen in recent years in the US including  people in  states who picked up   from contaminated beef in  
                   
                  In rare cases food poisoning can be serious or fatal In general the symptoms from food poisoning usually last about  days says Dr Alaradi 
                   
                  However if you have   a stomach bug from food or another person it may last a bit longer Inflammatory bowel disease IBD is an inflammation inside the small or large intestine Dr Alaradi explains It includes   and   
                   
                  The inflammation from IBD can cause scarring and blockage which can lead to abdominal pain along with diarrhea and rectal bleeding Symptoms are chronic but can flare up and subside in cycles making it sometimes hard to diagnose 
                   
                  IBD needs to be monitored closely as it can lead to more serious problems even cancer later in life Irritable bowel syndrome   is not the same as inflammatory bowel disease Although IBS can also lead to chronic abdominal pain and changes in bowel movements such as alternating constipation and diarrhea it is not an inflammatory condition and never involves rectal bleeding says Dr Alaradi 
                   
                  It generally affects more women than men is considered less serious than IBD and can be managed through treatment of symptoms such as pain relievers 
                   
                  And unlike IBD IBS never progresses into more serious conditions such as cancer says Dr Alaradi Pelvic inflammatory disease a bacterial infection of the fallopian tubes uterus or ovaries can cause a low pain under your belly button says Dr Raymond PID can cause scarring of fallopian tubes and risk pregnancy chances so if you experience other symptoms like fever vomiting or signs of fainting you should see a doctor at the emergency room immediately Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause PID and can be prevented by practicing protected sex with condoms Other less likely but possible causes of PID and the resulting stomach discomfort include IUDs childbirth or abortion since these things can disrupt the cervix and cause bacteria to form  causes stomach pain because blocked fecal matter stretches the colon in a manner it doesnt want to be stretched says Dr Raymond If youre experiencing stomach pain and notice you have to strain to have a bowel movement or your trips to the bathroom arent regular constipation is a likely culprit for your stomach aches To better move stool through your system drink more water and consume more fiber However if youve been constipated for more than a few days or get constipated often Dr Raymond suggests eating milk of magnesia Theyre relatively gentle and help when consuming fiber could just give you extremely hard stool Raymond says her patients with defecation disorders also benefit from the use of squatting toilet devices Its uncommon but cancer in any one of the organs located in the abdomenthe liver pancreas stomach gallbladder or ovariescan cause stomach pain but usually only in the later stages says Dr Alaradi 
                   
                  And there are usually other symptoms like a loss of appetite weight loss persistent vomiting persistent bloating of the abdomen and recent changes in bowel habits If a person is used to going to the bathroom once a day and its changed in the past few weeks to one every three to four days that deserves attention says Dr Alaradi Dr Raymond agrees Unfortunately cancer pain feels like a lot of the pain of the upper body she says Its nonspecific feeling so an upper endoscopy or Xray is best way to tell Still stomach cancer is not common is the United States According the the   there is a  in  risk that someone will develop stomach cancer in their lifetime Plus  out of  cases occur in people ages  and up
