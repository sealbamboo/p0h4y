President Obama often tells audiences that he has waged his last campaign But thats not exactly true The White House is gearing up for a massive campaign this summer that will cover all  states plus Washington DC And the presidents legacy may hinge on whether it succeeds or fails The Affordable Care Act or Obamacare has been through more lifeanddeath cliffhangers than a season finale of   After squeaker votes in Congress and a  ruling upholding the law at the Supreme Court now theres another big hurdle getting uninsured people to buy health care when it becomes available Oct  When Obama delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College this month his advice to the graduates  along with working hard and helping others  was to sign up for health insurance this fall Weve got to make sure everybody has good health in this country he said Its not just good for you its good for this country So youre going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people David Simas deputy senior adviser to the president works in a quintessential West Wing office  a windowless basement room  where he oversees one of the top projects on the Obama agenda implementing universal health coverage In the first year the administration hopes to sign up  million people across the country Simas says that will require TV ads door knocking and lots of word of mouth It is an ontheground effort he says It is a social media effort It is a paid media effort It is an earned media effort But its all leading to the same thing which is that man or woman sitting in their living room online comparing different prices for different products and deciding what works best for them The administration is developing an Expediastyle website hoping to make the experience as customerfriendly as possible But just getting people to that website is a huge task Last month   showed that  in  Americans dont even know the health care law is still on the books NancyAnn DeParle who has worked on this issue for years  until recently as Obamas deputy chief of staff  says thats not a cause for concern The truth is that people werent paying attention until now she says Theres so much else going on that even if we had wanted to start a campaign two years ago it wouldnt have been very effective because people werent listening But with the signup date approaching fast the administrations efforts have already stumbled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has repeatedly asked Congress for money to implement Obamacare Republicans have repeatedly said no while they vote to repeal the law Without the money she wanted from Congress Sebelius tried to fundraise for an independent group called Enroll America that is focused on implementing Obamacare When Republicans heard that she was asking insurance companies and health care providers to donate millions of dollars they cried foul Tennessee Sen Lamar Alexander told Fox News Congress has said we refuse to give you more money to implement Obamacare and shes saying Well then if you wont do it Ill go outside and I will raise private money use a private organization and do it anyway  Now two Republicancontrolled House committees are investigating the solicitations Dan Mendelson of the health care consulting group Avalere says that makes donors skittish Much as a health care company might really want to improve enrollment they also need to make sure that they do not run afoul of politicians on either side of the aisle Mendelson says If health care companies hold back he says its going to be much harder to reach all of those people in all of those communities The fact of the matter is that if you starve a media campaign for funding youre not going to have the reach that you otherwise would and thats the situation that we find ourselves in he says Theres another key part of this campaign Sicker and older people without insurance may be eager to sign up Oct  But to make the system work financially young and healthy people who dont need much medical care have to get into the pool too So you can expect administration officials around the country to give lots more commencement speeches this season telling captive audiences of somethings Congratulations on your diploma Now make sure to sign up for health coverage in the fall
