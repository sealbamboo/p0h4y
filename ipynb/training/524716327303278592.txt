Too many people in the middle of a mental health crisis end up locked in police cells after being turned away from hospitals says a report  People are being turned away because of full wards staff shortages or because they are too young or too drunk said the Care Quality Commission CQC Police cells are inappropriate and make people feel punished for being unwell said the charity Mind  Home Secretary Theresa May said the situation was unacceptable  The CQC said in some areas patients were well provided for but that the standard was not universal Between  and  in total  people were detained by the police under Section  of the Mental Health Act   The law says those people should be interviewed by a registered doctor or mental health professional to make arrangements for care   But the CQC said  cases ended up in a police cell rather than safe rooms in AE mental health trusts or childrens hospitals Patients were being turned away from hospitals because they were violent intoxicated disturbed or under  Or because the hospitals either did not have an appropriate place to put them or staff with the right skills to deal with them  Mrs May said the situation wastes police time and leaves people with mental health problems without the care and support they need  We must never accept a situation when a person in crisis is denied care because a healthbased place of safety is full or unstaffed or just because the person is intoxicated she added She said the exclusion was not in line with a plan launched by the government on looking after people in crisis and called upon local health leaders commissioners and providers to improve care  The CQCs survey also found many hospitals did not have the data to quantify if there was a problem and record how many patients were sent away Dr Paul Lelliott of the CQC said the survey findings were not good enough  Imagine if people who had had a heart attack or stroke were regularly turned away from an AE department due to a lack of staff or beds he said  Sophie Corlett at Mind said Being detained in a cell is frightening especially for someone in crisis who is often confused and might even be harming themselves experiencing suicidal feelings or psychosis An emergency is an emergency and those who are intoxicated and in need of help should still receive the same level of mental health care and treatment as anyone else she added She said local agencies should work together to give support
