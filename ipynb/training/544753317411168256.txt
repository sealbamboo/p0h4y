My daughter Hannah Grace was stillborn on my own birthday in August  My wife Sarah had noticed a reduction in Hannahs movements when she was  weeks pregnant The next morning Sarah went to see the obstetrician again concerned that something was wrong The obstetrician reassured Sarah and on finding the babys heartbeat said in jest See you are making it all up arent you For extra reassurance the obstetrician then organised a scan Hannah didnt move for the whole scan and wasnt seen breathing The person who did the scan concluded she was a lazy baby The following morning there was still no movement We went to the maternalfoetal unit for another scan This time there was no heartbeat My wife knew the baby wasnt moving What made her really angry was that the obstetrician was talking to his medical students about her interesting obstetric history and made light of her concerns She felt as though no one was listening to her Two months later I had appendicitis I was unwell after the operation After carrying out an ECG medical staff assumed I was having a heart attack I knew this was not the case But in the hospital where I work the attending doctor told me to be a good patient It was after only a phone call from my brother who is a doctor and my repeated insistence to medical staff to get the surgeon I am bleeding that my life was saved I was eventually returned to the operating room where I had a blood transfusion and ended up in intensive care My experience with the obstetrician and my own colleagues got me thinking We dont listen or we listen to what we want to hear We need to be taught to listen This is what the patient safety agenda has been lacking The reality is that excellent standards of care are delivered by many in hospitals today But people receiving care should not be told to be the good patient  a term that implies to be quiet and do what the clinician tells you We need patients to be BAD  Better informed Ask questions and Discerning The future of the health and quality agenda rests with our students We need to teach them to listen and to think The traditional way we teach our medical students beats the intuition out of them and they have to learn that subsequentl on the wards in clinical departments and in theatre Many of todays junior doctors know their discipline well but few have been taught how to listen to the yearold woman in the hospital bed Students need to be taught much more than a checklist approach to finding out about their patient Being taskorientated is simply not enough They need to learn how to listen to the patient They need to be able to hear the clues the patient gives the half gaps Students need to think about the person The checklist may have been filled out  but have they thought about the obvious They need to ask about a patients life to find out valuable information that could make the difference in a diagnosis Interacting with the patient is like dating healthcare professionals shouldnt talk over patients and equally they need to provide enough information Listening to staff is just as important There is still a pressing need to improve the way we communicate a cultural challenge that has been highlighted in cases like Mid Staffordshire In many hospitals it is the junior nurse at the bedside who must decide whether to communicate information to a senior nurse The senior nurse then makes decisions who he or she will talk to and what to say about the patient The decision to call the junior doctor often depends on who that doctor is There are some people who just do not want to be communicated to And a generational divide means that junior doctors do not like to call senior doctors People do not always comply with policy or procedure We need to really listen to change this Managers need to think much more about what is happening on their shop floor To do this they need to talk to the people on the frontline I would love to see a time when for  months no hospital policies or procedures were written If that time was instead spent talking to junior doctors to junior nurses and other people on the frontline then we could really understand their experiences We are now at the beginning of this exciting journey
