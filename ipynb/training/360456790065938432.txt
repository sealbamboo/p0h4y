In her book My Poets Maureen McLane reminded me of a poetic form called the cento It consists of snippets of verse composed by other writers The genre speaks to me because I am a quilter who cuts out small bits of fabric to join to other small bits of fabric Quilters call the process of sewing together different swatches of cotton piecing After reading a number of poems about cancer I set out to piece a cento by stitching a line or two from one writer to a passage from another I was inspired by poems that appear in collections like The Poetry Cure and Her Soul Beneath the Bone as well as poems that individual poets published in books of their own work Part of the appeal of the cento is its concluding apparatus  the works cited at the end These footnotes offer readers a chance to explore the wider selection of verse abridged here  According to Ms McLane poets make the chaos of inner feeling not only sentient but shareable The chaos of feeling that surrounds disease differs for men and women subjected to quite different cancers So I used visceral verse by both men and women to convey a chaos of feeling that all of us can share Here is a pieced poem with thanks to the authors who are footnoted below it I hope it inspires readers to post a few lines of verse about living with cancer so that together we can piece another poem about our shared experiences
