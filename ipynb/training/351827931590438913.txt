Martha Rhodes experienced her first bout of   at  By her late s she had taken just about every antidepressant there is including   Lexapro and    which did the trick for many years but had side effects  then Effexor Lamictal Seroquel and Abilify After a suicide attempt in  she tried something radically different transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS a treatment in which magnetic pulses are used to stimulate parts of the brain believed to be involved in mood regulation Unlike electroconvulsive or shock therapy which is also used to treat stubborn depression TMS does not generally produce   Every day she spent just over half an hour in a chair with a powerful magnet affixed to the front left side of her head After four weeks I woke up and something was different said Mrs Rhodes who wrote a book   describing the treatment I felt lighter I didnt wake up in the morning and wish I were dead For Mrs Rhodes  a former advertising executive in Danbury Conn TMS treatment was transformative and she no longer needs   But there are still many questions about just how many severely depressed patients respond to TMS which requires daily office visits for several weeks costs thousands of dollars and is often not covered by insurance For the therapy patients sit in a doctors office with a large magnet pressed to the left side of their heads The idea is that a pulsed magnetic field similar to that used in  s creates an electrical current in the surface of the brain that resets the patients mood regulatory system TMS is approved specifically for patients whose depression does not respond to antidepressants or who cannot tolerate the drugs side effects which include weight gain and loss of sex drive Many of these patients are desperate for alternative treatments but its not certain that TMS can provide the help they need While its fairly clear that TMS is effective in some percentage of patients with   its still not very easy to know in advance who those patients are said Dr Steven J Zalcman the head of the   of the National Institute of Mental Health The American Psychiatric Associations practice guidelines say that TMS confers relatively small to moderate benefits and the results of clinical trials have been decidedly mixed The glass is half full or half empty depending on where youre coming from said   a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston Dr George was an investigator in the first independent randomized trial of repetitive TMS to treat resistant depression While that study found that   compared with those receiving a placebo the absolute numbers were still small Only  percent of treated patients recovered compared with  percent in the placebo group A newer variation of the treatment deep TMS developed by an Israeli company called   and approved by the Food and Drug Administration this year brought a higher response rate in a randomized trial   compared with  percent of the control group The device targets deeper regions of the brain like the nucleus accumbens which plays a pivotal role in the reward circuit of the brain company officials say In industryfinanced studies that allowed subjects to continue their antidepressant medications while undergoing TMS treatment which experts say is a more likely situation in the real world   than in the randomized trial conducted by Dr George A recent study as yet unpublished and also financed by equipment makers that followed patients for a year reported   with nearly half the patients maintaining improvement for  months An advantage of TMS treatment is that it is not invasive and unlike medication appears to have few side effects just occasional discomfort or mild pain in the scalp at the site of the treatment or headaches Few patients drop out of treatment because of the pain however Longterm effects are not known but TMS does not take a toll on memory and cognition as   can In rare cases it may cause seizures In a demonstration of TMS at the Manhattan offices of Dr Alan Manevitz the patient a yearold woman who asked not to be identified to preserve her privacy sat in a chair while a small heavy magnet held by a mechanical arm was positioned over the prefrontal cortex of the brain There was no   or sedation The patient was allowed to read or watch TV just not fall asleep Nodding off seems unlikely however since the treatment makes a strident woodpeckerlike ratatat sound that lasts for four seconds followed by  seconds of silence before resuming A daily session lasts about  minutes The patient who has had a full course of TMS and is now receiving occasional treatments said the therapy had pulled her out of severe longterm depression I didnt even realize Id slipped she said I wish Id done this a long time ago
