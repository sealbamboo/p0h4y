When it comes to staying safe from lightning strikes everything you think you know is probably wrong Thats the word from weather experts who worry that outdated advice and persistent myths about thunder and lightning storms may be backfiring putting people in danger instead of protecting them from harm Debunking inaccurate beliefs is vital as we head into summer in North America the peak season for lightning strikes said John Jensenius the lightning specialist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA There are things we just simply dont recommend anymore Jensenius said People misunderstand them and it puts them in danger So far this year there have been seven lightning deaths in the US including a yearold man found lifeless under a tree Wednesday in Ann Arbor Michigan Last year there were  lightning deaths in the US a record low in a nation where the year average is  deaths a year Here are the most common myths about lightning strikes and safety Not true Among the  people killed by lightning between  and  fishermen accounted for more than three times as many fatalities as golfers  and camping and boating each chalked up almost twice as many deaths as golf Its been years since experts relied on the  rule which went like this If it takes less than  seconds to hear thunder after seeing a lightning flash lightning is close enough to pose a threat go indoors And after the storm ends wait  minutes before resuming outdoor activities Instead the new advice is just to go inside either a substantial shelter or a hardtopped metal vehicle at the first sound of thunder Jensenius said Once there experts still recommend waiting a halfhour before going back outside The general rule that we use is that if you can hear thunder youre within striking distance of the storm and you need to go inside right away he said The idea was to squat down low with your two feet together Jensenius said Some had you putting your hands over your head or your ears basically to get yourself into a ball But thats also wrong People are endangered as much by ground lighting as they are by a direct strike For instance lightning can hit a tree and then spread along the surface of the earth Jensenius said If youre crouching on the ground youre likely to get hit Again the best advice is to head to shelter at the first sign of a storm The biggest mistake most people make is not being willing to cancel or postpone activities when dangerous weather crops up Jensenius said Men who make up more than  percent of lightning fatalities are notoriously unwilling to postpone a hike or head back to shore on a fishing trip he noted But that stubbornness may be a deadly decision People are able to hear thunder from about  miles away Jensenius said But any number of factors can interfere with the warning In many cases you cant hear it that far because of background noise he said You wont hear it if youre near a highway or in a crowd at a fair or a ball game And if the wind is blowing it would muffle the sound Bottom line Dont take chances with lightning The odds of being struck may be one in a million in a given year and one in  over a lifetime but its better not to be that one
