SUNDAY Oct  MedPage Today  Stepping up the intensity of a   intervention only for those patients who fail to reach their goal may be a viable alternative to standard lifestyle approaches a randomized trial showed
 There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who achieved a  reduction in weight after  months between the steppedcare group and the standard group  versus  P according to John Jakicic PhD of the University of Pittsburgh
 The average percent weight loss was also similar in the two groups  versus  P Jakicic reported at the Obesity Society meeting here
 So the steppedcare approach may present an effective alternative to standard behavioral weight loss interventions he said
 He added that  to  of the patients in the steppedcare group remained at one of the first two steps which involved monthly group meetings weekly mailed lessons and mailed feedback on a selfmonitoring diary for both steps and one phone call per month for the second step only
 Although behavioral interventions involving lifestyle changes have been shown to be effective at getting patients to lose weight the intensity of such approaches generally remains the same regardless of whether the participants are responding
 A stepped approach in which the intensity is increased only if the participant fails to reach a prespecified goal has been proposed as an alternative but the strategy had not been compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in a randomized trial according to Jakicic
 He and his colleagues designed the Step Up study which randomized  overweight and obese individuals to a steppedcare or standard intervention The mean age of the participants was  and the mean body mass index was  kgm ranging from  to  kgm Most of the participants were female 
 Those in both groups were prescribed dietary goals with the aim of reducing calories and fat intake and physical activity targets progressing to  minutes of moderatetovigorous intensity   per week
 The standard behavioral weight loss program involved group sessions weekly for the first six months twice a month for the next six months and monthly sessions for the final six months The program remained consistent for all participants regardless of weight loss achieved
 In the steppedcare group however participants were scheduled to attend one group session per month throughout the study and to receive weekly mailed lessons as well as mailed feedback on their diaries Those who failed to achieve various weight loss goals   at three months  at six months and  at nine months and every three months thereafter  received more frequent contact
 The intensified steps included up to two phone calls per month up to two individual sessions to discuss weight loss per month and the provision of meal replacements
 Although participants in both groups lost weight the absolute loss was significantly greater in the standard group for the first six months  pounds versus  pounds P as was the percent weight loss  versus  P At each time point beyond six months however there was no significant difference between the two groups for either measure
 Jakicic said that there was more work to be done to evaluate a steppedcare intervention for weight loss including looking at
 In addition he and his colleagues will conduct a costeffectiveness analysis and examine whether the weight loss thresholds for stepping up care need to be adjusted
