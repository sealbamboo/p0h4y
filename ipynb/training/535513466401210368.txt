When I was diagnosed in November  I began counting forward assuming I would die by November  at the latest Prognosis for latestage ovarian cancer is three to five years even with stateoftheart treatment November which happens to be the month of my birthday became a memento mori an annual observance of my projected end A statistical approximation the prognosis tolled in my ears like a death sentence Years after their diagnosis many people observe their cancerversaries the annual recurrence of the date on which they learned the type and stage of their disease along with an estimate of how long they would likely live with treatment Its understandable to want to mark the moment since this information can arrive like a thudding blow a lightning bolt a tornado a crack opening in the earth beneath ones feet Or it can come as an icy chill the blank numbness of disbelief since notknowing may seem preferable to believing and comprehending that life will never be the same as it was before Or oddly it can arrive as it did for me with relief at finally comprehending what is wrong followed by trepidation about what to do about it   In any case the shocking impact of a cancer diagnosis needs to be remembered The date becomes a threshold one door closes another swings open We wander between two worlds one extinct and the other frightfully unpredictable Because cancer undoubtedly existed in the body before its detection the diagnosis date always feels belated and faintly fictive however it marks a disruptive discontinuity in consciousness Its anniversary commemorates an end and a beginning  in this case a traumatic beginning  I figured that my longevity would land squarely within the range of the projected statistical odds unlike Stephen Jay Gould In his  landmark essay   Mr Gould described his response to a diagnosis of abdominal mesothelioma an incurable disease with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery An evolutionary biologist he set out to use his knowledge of statistics to counter the widespread anxiety of cancer patients about their chances of surviving He based his redefinition of what the median means on an assumption shared by evolutionary biologists namely that variation itself is natures only irreducible essence   The median isnt the message because the variation is it trumps the median in significance Mr Gould placed himself amid the variations in part because his disease had been detected at a relatively early stage and noted that graphs of the distribution of variations were rightskewed The rightskewed long tail extended out for years beyond the eightmonth median I saw no reason why I shouldnt be in that small tail and I breathed a very long sigh of relief Happily he turned out to be right and lived for  years after the publication of his essay John Diamond a gifted British columnist had a different way of gauging his chances of surviving throat and oral cancers Regardless of the numbers quoted by physicians he assumed that Either theyd cure me or they wouldnt Everything was  Tragically they didnt and he died at the age of  Endowed with an apprehensive temperament I watched November  approach arrive and depart with astonished bewilderment that I shared with a colleague also dealing with latestage cancer It feels weird to be living on borrowed time I confessed Youll have to come up with a better term she said   Indeed borrowed time does sound parsimonious if not silly Borrowed from whom and to be paid back how I have heard of patients surviving beyond what they call their expiration date but that made it seem as if the life left was spoiled or rancid   A better term surfaced when I read a poem by Raymond Carver about a man confronting a dire diagnosis It reminds him that  years earlier he had been given six months to live unless he quit drinking He had then somehow managed to sober up Working and loving and being loved Mr Carvers seasoned speaker found new ways to be sauced in his second life  even after the onset of terminal disease Like Mr Carvers dying surrogate I have no illusions about a cure The death sentence has not been commuted but temporarily stayed  deferred not by any efforts on my part but by the sheer luck of an unpredictably effective experimental drug Neither do I want my exultation at beating the odds to erase or disrespect those people whose deaths established the grim statistics dear friends among them  Yet this November I am a lucky woman reveling in the unearned bounty of more time and a thicker earthly existence than I had ever expected Counting backward from right now to the predicted death date I picture myself as a lurching yearold savoring pure gravy every minute of it
