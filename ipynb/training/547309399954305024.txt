Garrett Peterson was born in  with a defective windpipe It would periodically just collapse because the cartilage was so soft and hed stop breathing This would happen every day  sometimes multiple times a day It was really awful to have to watch him go through his episodes says his father Jake Peterson of Layton Utah Hed be fine and then all of a sudden start turning blue It was just like watching your child suffocate over and over again It was so bad that Garrett couldnt leave the hospital he spent more than a year in intensive care This time last year doctors werent sure how much longer they could keep him alive Garrett was so sick in the hospital and we  we really really thought we were going to lose him remembers his mother Natalie Peterson The doctors were telling us you know that there really wasnt anything more they could do Then the Petersons heard about some doctors at the University of Michigan who were using D printers to custommake tiny devices they call splints to prop open defective windpipes for   The Petersons rushed their son to Ann Arbor When Shots first reported   back in March Garrett had just gotten his splint and it seemed to be working really well But at that point he was still in the hospital Two weeks later he was finally able to leave the hospital for the first time in his life Since getting home Garrett has still needed some help especially at night his parents say But hes getting better every day He can breathe  like on his own completely says Natalie Peterson Its so nice just to hear him breathe  to be able to hear him take big deep breaths and things that we never knew hed be able to do Other physical problems Garrett was having have also improved such as complications with his heart and digestive system Its just been amazing to see how much its helped him Jake says Its just been completely night and day The Petersons have started living a normal life with their son  they can now do things like roll around with him on the floor read him books on their laps and laugh together at his favorite Mickey Mouse videos Natalie remembers a moment recently when Garrett fell asleep on the floor of their family room which was dark except for the lights on the Christmas tree I was sitting there thinking Wow  she says We never knew if we would be able to get Garrett home To be able to see him just napping  breathing comfortably on the floor in our family room  it was just overwhelming  a pediatric head and neck specialist who treated Garrett says he expects that the boy will continue to improve We know the splint has been opening up the way that we wanted Green says And so the airway is able to grow So at this point were just waiting for further growth to happen and for the splint to eventually dissolve Another boy Green had   on an experimental basis and a third baby who got a splint a few months after Garrett are also doing well Green says So hes now working to get his Dprinted windpipe splints officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration which he hopes will make it easier to help even more babies Im just extremely pleased to see the children doing well Green says It just is the most rewarding thing for a physician  to see somebody that had never been home from the hospital now able to enjoy the holidays I couldnt ask for a better present The Petersons are looking forward to Christmas too Were just so so excited to have him home and to able to you know spend Christmas morning in our pajamas  just hanging out in our family room Natalie says Its going to be great
