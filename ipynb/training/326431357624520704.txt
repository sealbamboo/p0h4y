One video has been viewed more than  million times Another shows the governor of Illinois    But now doctors and poison control experts are warning people that this seemingly harmless dare is more dangerous than it appears A report published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday found that the stunt has led to a growing number of calls to poison control centers and visits to emergency rooms Some teenagers have suffered collapsed lungs and ended up on ventilators  People are being poisoned and sickened because of this said Dr Steven E Lipshultz an author of the new report and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine We have seen a rise in calls to poison control centers around the United States that mirrored the rise in YouTube videos and their viewing And thats just for the acute issues The report found that in  the American Association of Poison Control Centers received  calls related to the cinnamon challenge Then in the first six months of  the number of calls rose to  Thirty of those incidents were serious enough to require medical attention  Dr Lipshultz found that calls to the Florida Poison Information Center in Miami about cinnamon toxicity showed a similar pattern in  and  Most involved adolescents who were suffering from burning in the airways and in some cases nosebleeds vomiting and difficulty breathing  The cinnamon dare has been around for over a decade but its popularity took off about four years ago Google recorded  million hits for the topic in  up from  in  A   claims that more than  videos have been posted on YouTube and it describes the goal of the challenge as trying to swallow a spoonful of cinnamon in  seconds without drinking water The task is not easy because the spice in large quantities triggers a gag reflex The first symptom is inhalation of the cinnamon the site states which is almost immediately followed by dragon breath where the user exhales a big puff of cinnamon Although the spice is harmless and potentially even healthful in small amounts it can be caustic to the airways when inhaled causing inflammation and scarring of the lungs Cases of breathing problems and skin rashes have been reported in workers who manufacture cinnamon from tree bark Dr Lipshultz said And animal studies show that just one instance of inhaling a large dose of the powder can produce progressive lung damage  The problem is that cinnamon powder contains an inert substance called cellulose which can lodge in the lungs The cellulose doesnt break down Dr Lipshultz said So when it gets into the lungs it sits there long term and if its coated with this caustic cinnamon oil that leads to chronic inflammation and eventually scarring of the lungs something we call pulmonary fibrosis Getting scarring in the lungs is equivalent to getting emphysema Dr Lipshultz first heard of the challenge in March last year after several children who were hospitalized because of cinnamon inhalation were put on ventilators Dr Lipshultz and his colleagues soon created a task force At the time neither Dr Lipshultz nor his wife a pediatrician had been familiar with the stunt So Dr Lipshultz brought it up over dinner with his children then ages    and  I asked if they were aware of the cinnamon challenge and every one of them said Of course we know about it and started laughing he said
