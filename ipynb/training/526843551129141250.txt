In the latest tweak to Americas plan to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola disease Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leader Dr Tom Frieden announced changes to the US response to Ebola and the guidance federal agencies are giving to state and local governments The new protocol stops short of the mandatory day quarantines that some states have begun requiring Instead Frieden said it relies on individual assessment and close monitoring He also detailed several categories of risk among both airline passengers and the medical volunteers who he said have been doing heroic work in West Africa High risk individuals Frieden said include those who have cared for an Ebola patient and were accidentally poked by a needle or lacked protective gear Those people Frieden said should isolate themselves in their homes and avoid all forms of mass transit and large gatherings Those in the group would also undergo direct active monitoring in which a medical worker watches as the persons temperature is taken and speaks with him regularly about his condition The some risk category Frieden said includes those who have lived in the same household as an Ebola patient but havent had direct contact with him as well as health care workers who have cared for patients without any equipment problems He stressed that it would be dangerous to treat such medical workers as pariahs as it might discourage staff who are trying to prevent the diseases spread Frieden also gave more details about people who enter the US after being in countries where the outbreak poses the greatest threat Each day slightly fewer than  people travel to the US from Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone he said citing the airportarrivals screening program that began this month Most of those travelers he added are either US citizens or legal residents Of more than  people who have been evaluated Frieden said  of them are health workers The CDC chief noted that Monday marks the start of an increase in postarrival monitoring that his agency recommended last week for incoming passengers That program covers six states New York Maryland Pennsylvania Virginia New Jersey and Georgia where the CDC says some  percent of incoming travelers are headed after landing in the US Frieden opened his remarks by citing previous scientific studies about the disease saying that they had proven the disease is transmissible only via direct contact with an infected persons bodily fluids At CDC we base our decisions on science and experience he said Frieden spoke after a weekend in which a new public debate erupted over how to treat returning American health workers who have volunteered to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa Earlier Monday New Jersey officials said they would allow   a Texasborn nurse based in Maine to leave the hospital where shes been under a mandatory quarantine since she arrived at Newarks airport from Sierra Leone Friday Hickox landed as New Jersey New York and Illinois were installing new policies requiring a day quarantine for anyone who had potential contact with Ebola patients in West Africa Hickox has maintained that she hasnt had any symptoms of the disease and a preliminary blood test was negative for the disease On Sunday she   to help secure her release The nurse works with Doctors Without Borders which issued a statement Monday saying Forced quarantine of asymptomatic health workers returning from fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not grounded on scientific evidence and could undermine efforts to curb the epidemic at its source The agency also warned that if US officials took such steps they would likely be mirrored in other countries The CDC has adjusted its guidelines several times in the past few weeks as the US has recorded its first case of a Ebola patient being treated domestically  and its first death from the disease that has killed more than  people Earlier this month the agency issued new protocols for Ebola screening   New Yorks JFK New Jerseys Newark Chicagos OHare Virginias WashingtonDulles and Atlantas Hartsfield
