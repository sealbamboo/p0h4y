All women should be concerned about their vaginal health but what constitutes a healthy vagina While it depends somewhat on a womans age the vagina generally has an acidic pH contains rich quantities of beneficial bacteria that help fend off infections and is naturally lubricated A healthy vagina also secretes small amounts of discharge While some women might not even be aware of it others can notice anywhere up to a teaspoon or tablespoon of discharge a day says   director of the female sexual medicine program at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto California Discharge is a normal physiologic reaction  its essentially shedding of cervical and vaginal cells But if women experience changes in vaginal odor a change in color of their discharge that may be associated with discomfort  whether its pelvic discomfort or vulvar discomfort itching or burning  any change needs to be evaluated says Dr Millheiser Follow these rule to keep your vagina healthy Normally vaginal pH is about  to  but   can interfere with the vaginas pH levels reducing acidity and disrupting a healthy vaginal biome  the bacterial makeup of your vagina  and setting the stage for bacterial infections If your vagina has a strong or unpleasant odor see your doctor a douche will only cover up the smell without curing the problem thats causing it Avoid using harsh soaps or cleansers on the vulva or inside the vagina as these also can affect a healthy pH balance You may not realize it but following a balanced nutritious diet and drinking plenty of fluids are both key to vaginal and reproductive health In fact certain foods may be effective in treating   problems Yogurt can potentially help prevent   and aid in their treatment Yogurt is rich in   especially plain Greek yogurt so if a woman is prone to yeast infections taking a probiotic that is rich in the bacteria   or eating plain Greek yogurt every day can be helpful notes Millheiser If youre prone to urinary tract infections   suggested it may be helpful to take a cranberry supplement daily Using condoms  either the male or female kind  during sex helps to protect against sexually transmitted infections STIs such as           and   Some of these like HIV and genital herpes have no cure And others like the human papillomavirus HPV that causes genital warts are known to cause cancer You should change condoms when switching from oral or anal sex to vaginal sex to prevent the introduction of harmful bacteria into the vagina You should also avoid sharing sex toys with your partner notes Millheiser as you can spread STIs that way  especially HPV Having regular   is crucial to maintaining your vaginal health   recommends women have their first screening gynecologic exam at age  It is also recommended that women undergo Pap smears starting at age  to screen for changes in vaginal cells that might indicate the presence of cancer   and many primary care physicians are trained to diagnose diseases and disorders that can harm the vagina or your reproductive system as a whole Three types of vaginal infections are common yeast infection   and   If youre prone to yeast infections and you recognize the symptoms its okay to selftreat with an overthecounter medication says Millheiser But if the symptoms dont go away then you need to be seen as soon as possible While yeast is a fungal infection bacterial vaginosis is caused by bacterial overgrowth in the vagina Trichomoniasis is an infection caused by a parasite and is sexually transmitted Treating these infections is crucial because not treating them can lead to unpleasant painful and serious reproductive health problems Millheiser notes that if you already have a vaginal infection and are then exposed to HIV youre more prone to becoming infected Its worth noting that women who have poorly controlled diabetes or are infected with HIV can often experience recurrent yeast infections If youre experiencing many yeast infections during the course of a year you should be evaluated by your doctor to make sure that theres nothing more worrisome going on says Millheiser  is an important part of intercourse Without it the skin of the labia and vagina can become irritated and chafed While vaginal lubrication usually occurs naturally during female arousal some women do not produce enough natural lubricant In this case they should use an artificial lubricant to reduce friction and to enhance pleasure If youre trying to get pregnant certain lubricants can interfere with the sperm and make it difficult to conceive notes Millheiser In this instance she recommends using a pHbalanced product called   If youre not trying to get pregnant waterbased siliconebased and oilbased lubricants are fine depending on what your needs are If you need a little bit of lubricant then waterbased is great If youre experiencing more dryness consider using siliconebased or oilbased says Millhesier If youre using condoms for protection do   use an oilbased lubricant  they can cause the latex in condoms to break down Millheiser also cautions Never put petroleum jelly or baby oil inside of your vagina It causes inflammation and can set you up for infection Your vagina should stay clean and dry  and what you wear can affect that Certain types of fabrics and tightfitting clothing create warm moist conditions in which yeast thrive Wear breathable cotton underwear and avoid thongs If youre prone to yeast infections change out of wet swimsuits and sweaty workout clothes as quickly as possible Dr Millheisers advice If you experience a lot of discharge and dampness during the day take two pairs of underwear with you every day when you go to work or school and change your underwear during the day Itll help you feel more comfortable and will help prevent infection Common sense can go a long way in protecting the health of your vagina After a bowel movement wipe from front to back to avoid bacterial contamination of the vagina and to lower the risk of bladder infection Change sanitary pads and tampons regularly during your period Dr Millheiser notes that its fine to wear panty liners to absorb normal   as long as you change them frequently though she adds that women who wear them all the time may experience some vulvar irritation
