It tells you something about American health care that scores of medical societies have joined a major campaign aimed at telling patients and doctors what not to do Thats not exactly the language the   initiative uses admittedly It has recruited more than  groups representing specialties from dermatology to thoracic surgery to come up with lists delicately called Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question Question sounds better than flee doesnt it And it allows for individual differences in a way that a campaign called Danger Unacceptable Side Effects Ahead or Watch Out Useless Procedures might not Still Choosing Wisely wants to help us select drugs and tests and procedures that are backed by evidence that dont duplicate other treatments that are truly necessary and wont hurt us Since  its lists have included hundreds of drugs tests and practices that fail to meet those standards with more to come Point made We reported the American Geriatrics Societys   The society has just published its second list so I again turned to Dr Sei Lee a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco and a member of the panel that developed both lists  to help explain what else older adults should be dodg   um questioning You can see   Topping this years list is a caution against dementia drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors  Aricept is the most widely used  without following up to see whether theyre really helping Dementia is so feared and the eventual prognosis so grim that doctors and patients want to do something anything to stop its progress But while the drug may produce cognitive improvement that is statistically significant in a clinical trial its not clear that its big enough for a caregiver to even notice or big enough to make a difference in a patients quality of life Dr Lee said Were learning after more experience with these drugs that they benefit a minority of patients On the other side of the equation most patients who take them will experience gastrointestinal problems like nausea cramping and diarrhea that often cause weight loss So the society urges extensive discussion before doctors prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors and suggests no more than a threemonth trial If theres no meaningful improvement by then there wont be later This is not a medication to start and then forget about Dr Lee cautioned Grouped second on the list are several tests weve often written about   for breast cancer   and   Older people who are already frail or coping with several chronic diseases and have life expectancies of less than  years are not likely to benefit from finding such cancers  but they will face the shortterm risks of complications and overtreatment from screening It may not make sense to expose them to these harms Dr Lee said Next to avoid appetite stimulants in cases of weight loss including highcalorie supplements like Boost and Ensure or prescription drugs like megestrol acetate brand name Megace or the antidepressant Remeron The evidence that they actually improve outcomes is very very thin Dr Lee said For the few patients who have trouble swallowing because they have head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer these drugs or supplements may make sense But in general they may add a couple of pounds without improving survival or quality of life because they dont address the underlying reasons for weight loss Sometimes families think patients are dying because theyre losing weight Dr Lee said I tell them theyre losing weight because theyre dying of something else Theres no evidence that adding calories increasing fat but not muscle mass will help them recover And the drugs have side effects the hormonebased Megace increases the risk of blood clots for instance The geriatrics societys  list also warns doctors not to prescribe new medications without reviewing the drugs that older patients are already taking since so many can interact in harmful ways In a busy practice its hard to look at everything someone is on every time you prescribe a new drug Dr Lee acknowledged Older adults can be taking a dozen drugs daily But at the least the panel said doctors should review all medications annually Finally the list concludes by cautioning against the use of restraints  tying down hands or legs using vests or mitts keeping people in beds with rails or in reclining chairs they cant climb out of Federal regulations already largely prohibit restraints in nursing homes but theyre still widely used in hospitals especially in intensive care units where older patients frequently develop delirium But when agitated patients are in restraints they generally get more agitated Dr Lee said And when forced to remain in bed they can lose strength and muscle mass very quickly Instead of restraints we should be thinking about keeping them as active as possible Family members or sitters who can help them walk safely would help along with tested antidelirium strategies You can read   in the current issue of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society Overall Dr Lee said these arent things that should never happen Theyre things that may be appropriate rarely but are being done frequently he said things that are commonplace and should be much much less common
