Sometimes you do everything right and it still goes wrong Michael Pirron runs a technology consulting company in Richmond Va For some time he fretted about his parents about what would happen if like most older Americans they needed expensive care as the years passed They were still youngish and comparatively healthy but his fathers mother had lived to be  So in February  when David Pirron was  and his wife Anne was  Michael helped them buy joint longterm care insurance policies with benefits that rose annually from John Hancock When the time came it would provide up to  to pay for home care adult day care assisted living or a nursing home Im an only child Mr Pirron told me Im not independently wealthy This was the way I could be sure they had care when they needed it The older Pirrons gave him their power of attorney as experts perennially urge They signed the form making their son the third party designee that John Hancock would notify of policy changes or anything that could cause the policies to lapse But to ensure that they remained in force Michael Pirron made arrangements with his parents bank I made sure my dad had autopay so that the premiums got paid every month he said In the years that followed the couple downsized from a house in Washington to a condo in Fredericksburg Va an hour away from Michael They faithfully paid about  in longterm care premiums over a decade Michael estimates and never made a claim But the crisis arrived as it often does By  Mrs Pirron was falling and had developed psychiatric symptoms and her husband had become too confused and forgetful to remain her caregiver Michael Pirron called John Hancock to ask about the care options covered by his parents insurance Their answer was essentially What policy he said The policies had lapsed eight months earlier and it was too late to send in the past due amount and get them  reinstated The insurer had sent the couple warnings that their insurance was about to be terminated but they didnt understand the letters which Michael eventually found stuffed in a drawer He also figured out why the bank stopped paying premiums His father had gone to his branch  without telling him  to stop autopayments on a different insurance policy and had mistakenly turned off payments to John Hancock instead But what about the thirdparty notice the insurer was supposed to send Michael Pirron John Hancock insisted its records showed it had sent the required letter he says he never received one In a June  letter John Hancock officials said the company would not reinstate the policy We believe this action to be consistent with both our business model and regulatory obligations the company wrote It added We sincerely regret any personal distress resulting from our decision There was plenty of that Instead of tapping their insurance benefits to pay for assisted living the Pirrons sold their condo at a loss and moved to a small apartment in Richmond Va where Mrs Pirron receives care from a PACE program through Medicaid Michael Pirron complained to the state Bureau of Insurance which investigated but ultimately took no action insurers arent required to prove they have contacted third parties He had attorneys look into the matter but decided he couldnt undertake the sixfigure cost of a lawsuit So he turned to the Virginia legislature where Delegate Jennifer McClellan has introduced HB which would require insurers to send lapse or termination notices to both policyholders and third parties via certified mail or commercial services like FedEx or UPS That would provide proof that companies notify customers or dont Its too late for my parents but I want to make sure this doesnt happen to anyone in Virginia or anywhere ever again Michael Pirron said The state AARP chapter has lobbied for the bill and the state Alzheimers Association has endorsed it David DeBiasi advocacy director for AARP Virginia thinks the bill has a shot partly because it will make sense to those trying to limit the size of entitlement programs and the escalating cost of Medicaid Had John Hancock spent a few dollars for certified mail taxpayers might not be footing the bills the Pirrons intended to handle themselves Insurance industry lobbyists dont seem to be opposing the measure Mr DeBiasi said But they could if as Michael Pirron hopes this idea takes off nationally   The House subcommittee has voted and the  to  tie means it will not send HB to the full House of Delegates killing it for this legislative session  Virginia Bureau of Insurance officials however have told Michael Pirron that they will consider requiring certified mail notifications for longterm care policy cancellations Ultimately policyholders will pay the cost and the cost is not just the postage said Jesse Slome who heads the American Association for LongTerm Care Insurance He points out that of the roughly  policies sold annually more than  percent lapse the first year and another  percent the second so that companies would need workers and systems to send and track thousands of certified letters When you dont pay your credit card bill you dont get a registered letter Mr Slome said But of course credit card companies dont target people whose age brings increasing risk of dementia Insurance regulation falls mostly to individual states so even if legislatures or insurance commissioners adopt this requirement years will pass before most policyholders have such protection In the meantime cases like this demonstrate anew how vigilant families need to be If your older relative has a longterm care policy photocopy the page listing the company policy number and claims contact information Keep the insurance company updated on new addresses yours if you are the thirdparty designee and your relatives It wouldnt hurt if the policyholder is becoming forgetful to check bank statements or call the company to be sure premiums are paid Now Michael Pirron is worrying about care for his father recently diagnosed with early dementia
