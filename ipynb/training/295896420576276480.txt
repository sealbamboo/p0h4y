 Carolyn Thomas  tracks her daily exercise with sparkly stickers The sparklier the better she says At the end of the week I like to see seven stickers lined up in a row because that means every single day I met my goal of one hour of exercise Thomas of British Columbia Canada was diagnosed with   after a massive heart attack in  Her condition is inoperable chronic and progressive  she will live with it every day for the rest of her life Although she was a longdistance runner for almost two decades before her heart attack it wasnt until after her diagnosis did she begin to track her exercise in this way Now its a daily prescription that has become habit This routine makes Thomas one of the  percent who track their personal health data in some way using pen and paper a website or mobile app a medical device or simply in their heads according to a new report from the Pew Internet and American Life Project Of the  percent almost half say they keep track of health stats in their heads only Almost twothirds of trackers   diet or exercise routines A third track other health indicators such as blood pressure sleep patterns or headaches People living with chronic conditions are significantly more likely to track a health indicator or symptom the Pew Internet survey finds   percent of US adults with one chronic condition track some sort of health indicator and  percent with two or more conditions are trackers while just  percent of adults with no chronic conditions say they track health indicators Out of all US adults  percent have at least one chronic condition most likely    two conditions that can be effectively managed when people track their own data according to the Mayo Clinic among other health organizations Among trackers  percent say its changed their overall approach to maintaining their health Forty percent say its led them to ask a doctor new questions or to get a second opinion A third say it has affected treatment decisions Among people with two or more chronic conditions these numbers are even higher Numerous studies have found that   than a standard diet Migraine patients are able to predict severe migraines and modify their behavior to help prevent future spells when they keep a headache diary according to a study recently published in the journal   Patients with digestive diseases have seen similar results with food diaries The list of examples goes on and on Still not everyone loves to track their data or record it in the same way Thomas loves her stickers  and eschews the evergrowing array of bodymonitoring devices and healthtracking mobile devices  and she says many people she knows do the same Why Theres what Thomas calls the burden of treatment Fundamentally sick people are the least likely to be selfquantifiers she says We just want to be normal We dont want to be obsessing over our health From the moment we wake up every day were already obsessing over our health I want to forget that Im sick Blogger and diabetes patient advocate Kim Vlasnick agrees writing on her blog   Its not enough that we have to live with the disease itself we also have to live with data management as well Too many numbers can have an emotional impact on trackers with or without chronic conditions says Alexandra Carmichael the founder of the health tracking site   Carmichael stopped personal tracking because of its impact on her emotional health Each day my self worth was tied to the data One pound heavier this morning Youre fat Skipped a day of running Youre lazy she wrote on her blog It felt like being back in school Less than  percent on an exam Youre dumb Thomas also says many patients skip tracking apps because they feel available apps arent suited for them or their condition One such patient commented on   saying that after she was diagnosed with a chronic condition she developed an app to track her symptoms because she felt the right technology wasnt already available As both a techsavvy patient and software developer she says she was able to design an app for sick people based on what she wanted for herself Because I was actively sick at the time I knew certain things that a healthy person might completely miss  something as simple as not using sliders on a screen because theyre harder to activate and require more thought than a button she wrote to Thomas Still Ernesto Ramirez is one of the tens of thousands who believe that tracking personal data can have a real benefit Ramirez is the community organizer for   an international meetup group for people who love to track their personal data for what Ramirez calls personal selfknowledge creation The quantified self movement sees selftracking and quantification of behavior not as a way of life but as a process to help you understand Ramirez says He says he regularly tracks his weight steps location via the app Foursquare and passive stuff such as the amount of music he plays from his home computer Ramirez says he can see Thomas point about the divide between techsavvy people who love to crunch numbers about themselves and the experiences of patients living with chronic conditions But he believes the divide is growing smaller As more individuals are involved in creating tools for patients tools and services will be available for a wider number of individuals he says I think were going to start to see more devices better sensors and a lot more physical activity monitors As technology improves and rates of chronic disease continue to grow no doubt the numbers of highly engaged trackers will too But Thomas remains unconvinced about the tech side of tracking I see significant challenges in convincing people like me who are living with a debilitating chronic illness to somehow embrace technology as their digital savior she   How are health tech startups planning to address this particular demographic Or are they even going to bother
