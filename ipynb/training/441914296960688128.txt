An abortion provider has been fined  for a data breach that revealed almost  peoples details to a hacker  The hacker threatened to publish the names of people who had contacted the British Pregnancy Advisory Services website for advice on pregnancy issues  The Information Commissioners Office said the fact BPAS had not realised its site stored details was no excuse BPAS said the fine was out of proportion and plans to appeal The Information Commissioners Office ICO investigation found the charity had failed to realise its website was storing the name address date of birth and telephone number of people who asked for a call back for advice on pregnancy issues  The personal data was not stored securely and a vulnerability in the websites code allowed the hacker to access the system and locate the information in March  The hacker threatened to publish the names of the individuals whose details he had accessed but  was prevented from doing so after the information was recovered by the police following an injunction obtained by BPAS  He was subsequently given a prison term of  months David Smith deputy commissioner and director of data protection at the ICO said Data protection is critical and getting it right requires vigilance  The British Pregnancy Advice Service didnt realise their website was storing this information didnt realise how long it was being retained for and didnt realise the website wasnt being kept sufficiently secure But ignorance is no excuse  It is especially unforgivable when the organisation is handing information as sensitive as that held by the BPAS  Mr Smith added Data controllers must take active steps to ensure that the personal data they are responsible for is kept safe Theres a simple message here treat the personal information you are holding with respect This includes making sure you know just what information you are holding and that its subject to uptodate and effective security measures BPAS chief executive Ann Furedi said We accept that no hacker should have been able to steal our data but are horrified by the scale of the fine which does not reflect the fact that BPAS was a victim of a serious crime by someone opposed to what we do  BPAS is a charity which spends any proceeds on the care of women who need our help and on improving public education and knowledge on contraception fertility and unplanned pregnancy  This fine seems out of proportion when compared with those levelled against other organisations who were not themselves the victims of a crime
