Its just past midnight on a freezing Saturday night in Washington DC In the last hour five ambulances have arrived at the emergency room where I work A sixth pulls up The paramedics wheel out a stretcher carrying a man  strapped to a hard board a precaution in case his spine is fractured Theres blood around his neck brace and a strong smell of urine We found him by his bed a paramedic tells me The patient told the paramedics he slipped Reports back pain and some cuts and bruises one of them adds Medical history None the paramedics could find Same goes for whatever medications the patient might be taking The only thing they know is his name and address Nobody else was at home Two nurses undress the patient to rid him of his soiled clothes They wrap a blood pressure cuff around one arm and start an IV line in the other A tech shaves his chest before attaching sticky electrodes to check the mans heart He swats at us saying that none of this is necessary He slipped in the shower I was only out for a little while he says The paramedics mumble that they found him in the bedroom  not the bathroom The patient tells us his full name and says that the year is  Its  I say as my medical student looks for his records on a nearby computer She shakes her head Hes never been in our hospital He gives us two phone numbers for his son but neither works The patient says his doctor lives in Kansas We examine him and find a inch laceration over his eyebrow a bruise over his right wrist and scrapes on both knees He winces when I touch his back He has good strength in his arms and legs I send him for Xrays and a CT scan of his head and spine Theres no bleeding inside his brain and nothing is broken His laboratory tests come back and show that he has anemia and kidney trouble He wants to go home He pleads with us saying he hates hospitals He promises hell be OK I try his home phone and his sons numbers again The resident calls two local hospitals on the chance theyve seen him before No luck The year is now  the patient declares Everyone sighs We have to admit him Its the last hospital bed weve got and the patients who come after him will have to wait through the night in the ER The next day I get a call from the patients son and daughterinlaw Theyre irate The patient has dementia and frequently falls Thats why the family has arranged for livein help  hours a day The man has had anemia and kidney problems for years His longtime doctor here in town not in Kansas monitors these issues closely The internist taking care of him say that the man never should have been hospitalized My first reaction is defensiveness Where was his family last night What would the mans usual doctor have done in my position We emergency physicians frequently hear complaints from other doctors about how we order too many tests and admit too many patients While   is a problem  and fear of malpractice and   sometimes play a role  its easy to make harsh judgments after the fact When caring for patients we dont know and who could have lifethreatening illnesses emergency physicians have to do what is safest and best with the information at hand sparse as it may be In this case I made the choice to admit the patient He was confused and had several abnormal test results We couldnt be sure hed be safe at home As I listen to his family I also see the other side I can see how unhappy they are that he was stripped poked and kept against his wishes I understand their frustration at our system of sick care Why dont we have unified electronic medical records Why arent there better interventions for coordinating care and keeping people out of hospitals I tell them that Im sorry Knowing what I know now I would have made a different decision I gently suggest that it would be helpful to make sure he carries a document in his wallet with updated phone numbers medical conditions and wishes for his care That day Im back in the ER Its another busy shift and I see him again Well not the same yearold but another elderly gentleman who also fell Again hes confused and we cant reach his family He doesnt want to stay but again we hospitalize him This time too Im filled with doubt and a desire for a better system to care for my patients
