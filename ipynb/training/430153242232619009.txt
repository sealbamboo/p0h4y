A pocket optician made from a modified smartphone is to be used by teachers in Kenya as part of trial to catch pupils eye problems Access to eye care is a major issue in the developing world The same kit used on older people had promising results and led to more than  people receiving treatment  The team behind the project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said treating children could stop them falling behind in school The World Health Organization says  million people are blind or visually impaired but four out of every five cases can be prevented or cured The main problem in children is poor eyesight which means they require glasses But in large parts of the world there is a massive shortage of people able to perform eye tests especially away from major towns and cities Eight teachers in one of the most deprived areas of Kenya Kitale will be trained to use the Portable Eye Examination Kit Peek The smartphone app uses a shrinking letter which appears on screen as a basic vision test and it uses the cameras flashlight to illuminate the back of the eye the retina to check for disease A patients records are stored on the phone and the results can be emailed to doctors The trial will begin in  schools before expanding across neighbouring areas Dr Andrew Bastawrous part of the group which designed Peek at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC Many children underperform at school due to undiagnosed vision problems which if corrected gives them a greater opportunity to realise their potential  Currently clinicians of which there are very few go to schools to screen children This takes them away from the hospital where they are needed most and puts the hospital under increased pressure Children with eye problems will be referred to the Kitale Eye Unit for further evaluation and treatment Dr Hillary Rono an ophthalmologist at Kitale District Hospital said he was extremely excited by the project He commented Ever since the Peek team introduced their impressive adapted smartphone we saw that it could really make a difference to the problem of screening in schools and help increase the detection rates of children with poor vision hopefully helping them realise their educational potential The trial using Peek in adults is still taking place but early results suggest it is effective at picking up vision problems Operation Eyesight Universal will run the project with funding from Seeing is Believing  a collaboration of the International Agency for the Prevention IABP of Blindness and Standard Chartered Peter Ackland the chief executive of the IAPB said Teachers are the gateway to testing children in many lowincome countries simply because there are not enough human resources to have a more efficient way of screening  In peoples younger days regular checks mean that problems with their vision can be treated as early as possible However in the current system many children slip through the net and go through life with an eye condition thats entirely avoidable  Richard Meddings the chairman of Seeing is Believing at Standard Chartered said Developing effective methods for screening children at school is a key challenge to eliminating avoidable blindness for good  If this pilot test increases detection rates it could be the difference between children spending their days seeing clearly having blurred vision or even going blind
