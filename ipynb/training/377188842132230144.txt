A recent string of deaths in the Northeast from a drug known as Molly has authorities looking into whether a bad batch may be to blame Police believe the purified form of the drug known as Ecstasy is what killed four young people in just over a week and sent many more to emergency rooms Incidents involving the drug have stretched from Boston to New York and Washington DC Molly has all the makings of what one official called an absolute disaster It can be as easy to get and as cheap as a sixpack of beer It allegedly offers a euphoric high a burst of energy and sometimes mild hallucinations to those using it The spike in Molly use parallels the resurgence of electronic dance music at raves clubs and festivals like one in Boston over the weekend For me it makes the music more enjoyable  almost lifechanging honestly the experience you get at these concerts says a man named Steve who only wanted to be identified by his first name He says even the four recent fatalities would not deter him from using Molly Well there is the risk he says but Ive never had problems in the past I feel like people that do just dont have really good selfcontrol about it Cause usually it wouldnt be deadly unless you still were doing the wrong dosage of it Boston festival producer Michael Snow helped set up stations at the event warning young people of the risk I still think there are a lot of misconceptions about what it is and what dangers are he says Molly  short for molecule  is billed as a purified form of MDMA the main ingredient in Ecstasy It boosts both serotonin and dopamine making a person feel happy and enhancing the pleasure of touch But Harvard Medical School professor John Halpern says side effects can range from dehydration to even overhydration You can become overhydrated and even die from that its called polydipsia Halpern says Theres risk of having a cardiac abnormality and there are reports of seizures occurring in some individuals And there are aftereffects The crash after using the drug can be so severe that Molly hangovers have been dubbed Suicide Tuesdays But experts say even more dangerous is the fact that users dont really know what they are using I mean I cant stress it enough  this stuff is dangerous and deadly and you are playing Russian roulette says Rusty Payne a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration He says what people think is Molly is often partly  or completely  something else The recent deaths Payne says are part of a much larger problem of designer drugs now being made in labs in China and Europe that can be easily ordered online or bought in the US They will market them with funny little names Molly ScoobyDoo K spice plant food bath salts this is a whole new frontier he says Authorities are still investigating the exact makeup of the drugs involved in the recent fatalities In the meantime theyre warning people not to take any synthetic drugs at all College campuses have also been trying to caution returning students even as the popularity of Molly keeps on surging Mentions of Molly in hit songs by artists like Rhianna glamorizing the drug work against authorities trying to discourage it Adding to the challenge is that Molly is odorless and easy to conceal Its really hard to find drugs that could be kept anywhere  in underwear in your hat or in your hair says Lindsey Allen who was part of a beefed up security staff at the Boston festival She was on the lookout for Molly or anyone using it in trouble Allen says that tends to be easier to spot You could see them flying high she says While this weekends Boston festival ended without any fatalities that shouldnt give anyone a false sense of security As one DEA official put it this is not about one bad batch of Molly he said There is no such thing as a good batch
