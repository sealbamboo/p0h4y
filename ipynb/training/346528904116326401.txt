Call it the Affordable Care Act call it Obamacare call it whatever you want  its coming And soon In less than four months people without health insurance will be able to start signing up for coverage that begins Jan  A lot has been said about the law most of it not that understandable So starting now and continuing occasionally through the summer and fall were going to try to fix that Lets stipulate right now that there are lots of things about the health law   and a matter of   But given that the law has not been repealed after   and that major pieces of the law are about to take effect we thought it would be helpful to try to explain whats coming as dispassionately as we can So well begin with the biggest question of all  whos affected For the answer lets go right to the top  President Obama himself What is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the  to  percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they dont have health insurance Obama told reporters at a   That  to  percent includes more than  million people Some are adults with preexisting medical conditions who have been turned down for coverage Some may be working at jobs at small businesses that cant afford to offer health coverage Or they may have jobs that do offer coverage but they dont work enough hours to qualify All that stuff youve been hearing about statebased insurance  and   Heres how the president explains whats going to happen for those  million Americans What were doing is were setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies Obama said And those who cant afford it were going to provide them with some subsidies Of course its nowhere near that simple There are going to be a lot of details different plans to choose from with different premiums and copayments Some people will be eligible for various subsidies depending on the plan they choose And   if their state decides to expand it There are also big worries that   at least not at first and that people then might have trouble getting treatment if government and insurance company computer systems that need to be linked end up talking different languages Now what about people who already have health insurance President Obama says thats not what this year is really about For the  to  percent of Americans who already have health insurance this thing has already happened he said And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger better more secure than it was before Full stop Thats it By that the president means many of the benefits of the law have already taken effect for those with insurance For example insurance companies cant drop them for bad reasons Obama said like because they made a mistake on their insurance application And noting one of the mostused provisions now in effect kids are able to stay on their parents health insurance until theyre  years old the president said More than  million young adults are taking advantage of that opportunity All this is not to say that nothing will change or that everything will be great for people with employerbased health insurance The law   particularly the   And while most employers who offer insurance now   to offer it in the future some may drop coverage and send workers to the health exchanges instead But for now the focus is on the uninsured and getting them coverage
