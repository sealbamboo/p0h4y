There are too many emergency admissions to hospitals in England according to the government spending watchdog  The National Audit Office says there were m such admissions in the last financial year  a  rise in  years  and many of these patients stayed in hospital for longer than necessary It says it is critical for the NHS to do better in dealing with these issues to cope with rising winter pressures  NHS England says big decisions are needed to develop alternatives The NAO report looks at how well emergency admissions to hospital are managed These are admissions that are not planned and happen at short notice because of the perceived clinical need The report points out that although admissions per head of population are lower in England than in Scotland and Wales the rate of increase over the past decade has been much higher A big factor is the growing proportion of patients attending major AE departments who are admitted Ten years ago it was fewer than one in five Now it is more than one in four  But the NAO estimates that at least a fifth of patients admitted as emergencies could be managed outside hospital  It concludes that going to AE and then being admitted has become the default route for urgent and emergency care  It also highlights growing delays in discharging patients once they are fit to leave hospital It says these problems are a major concern partly because of cost to the NHS but also because of the disruption they bring to hospitals and to patients  The report argues that all parts of the health system have a role in ensuring patients are treated in the most appropriate setting  It says primary community and social care can manage longterm conditions better It suggests ambulance services can take fewer patients to AE and it calls on hospitals to ensure senior doctors are on hand to help with early diagnosis and treatment There is added urgency in these findings as the health service prepares for the increased pressures of winter  The director for acute episodes of care for NHS England Prof Keith Willett said the increase in emergency admissions was a growing concern As the report recommends we must collectively take substantial steps to ensure patients receive the best possible care preferably out of hospital but also when necessary in hospital he said To achieve that it is clear the way we provide health and social care must change so our hospitals GP and community services have the space to do that In a statement the College of Emergency Medicine welcomed the NAO report In particular the recognition that best practice includes consultant supervision of patient care within emergency departments echoes the college campaign to ensure every department has a minimum of  consultants Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said We know demand for AE services is increasing as the population ages with more people needing more healthcare Thats why we are tackling both the short and longterm problems transforming out of hospital care by reversing the disastrous changes to the  GP contract joining up the health and social care system and backing AEs with  million to prepare for this winter Winter is always tough but the NHS has never been more prepared and in the face of unprecedented demand AE performance has never been stronger For Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS was on the brink of a dangerous winter crisis This report is right to warn about the increasing numbers of elderly patients being admitted to Englands AEs Mr Burnham said  We have long warned ministers that severe cuts to council care services have left hospitals unable to discharge patients and AEs full to bursting
