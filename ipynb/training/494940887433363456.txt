A UScontracted medical charter flight left Cartersville Georgia Thursday afternoon to evacuate the Americans a source familiar with the travel plans told CNN At least one of them will be brought to Emory University near the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Georgia hospital officials told CNNs Dr Sanjay Gupta The CDC raised its travel warning for Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone from Level  to Level  on Thursday warning against any nonessential travel to the region Since  the agency has only issued Level  alerts on two occasions during the outbreak of SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome in  and in the aftermath of the  Haiti earthquake   The CDC is sending  additional personnel to the three countries CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said They will be working to speed up laboratory testing trace potentially infected people and strengthen the local health care systems Ebola is believed to have   in Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone and Nigeria between March  and July  according to the World Health Organization Stopping this particular epidemic could take months Its like fighting a forest fire Frieden says  if you leave even one burning ember the epidemic can start again  Its not going to be quick Its not going to be easy But we know what to do Evacuating Brantly and Writebol was ultimately up to the aid organizations they work for Frieden said Moving them could do more harm than the good that might come with better treatment options in a developed country  I can tell you that airplanes are tough environments said Dr Lee Norman chief medical officer at The University of Kansas Hospital Norman was a flight surgeon for  years in the Air Force You want to have the shortest trip possible for the best quality medical care That is as available in Europe as it is in the US Its a matter of how much flight they can handle The American health care system is wellprepared for Ebola patients experts say  I think any major medical center can take care of any Ebola patient said Dr William Schaffner an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Universitys School of Medicine We have isolation rooms we use all the time These isolation rooms are used for patients suspected to have tuberculosis SARS Middle East respiratory syndrome or another infectious disease Schaffner said not much would be different for an Ebola patient though more stringent precautions might be taken to ensure health care workers are following all protocols But all that is minor compared to the adjustments you have to make during influenza season for example he said  The CDC has quarantine stations around the country staffed  And most hospital staffs have been alerted and are on the lookout for   said Dr Eric Legome chief of emergency medicine at Kings County Hospital in New York Symptoms include fever headache diarrhea and vomiting Some patients have trouble breathing Doctors are asking patients with these symptoms if they have traveled recently to the three countries primarily affected by the Ebola outbreak Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia Theyre also asking if patients have been in contact with anyone else who has traveled to the region lately  Legome said hospitals have a low threshold to isolate patients meaning anyone who is even remotely suspected of being infected will immediately be put in an isolated ICU room so health officials can run tests  They would most likely be flying in civilian aircraft and seek care in civilian hospitals urgent care clinics physicians offices and emergency departments said Norman That is exactly why this awareness is important for all caregivers Ebola is not airborne he said It cannot be transmitted via coughs or sneezes If an infected person is exhibiting symptoms he or she can transmit the disease via bodily fluids such as blood breast milk or semen The virus does not die with a patient  so deceased bodies can transmit the disease  There is no specific treatment for Ebola Doctors can only administer what they call supportive therapy which means supporting the patients own immune system as it tries to battle the infection This usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock said Christopher Mores associate director of Louisiana State Universitys Center for Experimental Infectious Diseases This therapy for Ebola patients could also include blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy   Ebola can last two to three weeks Mores said so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus
