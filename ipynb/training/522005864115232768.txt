Passengers arriving at Heathrow airport from Ebolaaffected countries have been screened by health officials The government said a few passengers had their temperatures checked and filled in a health questionnaire at Terminal  on Tuesday Screening will be extended to Heathrows other terminals by the end of the week and Gatwick airport and Eurostar next week The measures are set to cost m over the next six months The UK and the US have both introduced screening measures in response to the threat from Ebola which has killed more than  people in West Africa The first flight subjected to the screening left Liberia for Brussels on Monday night with transfers coming into Heathrow at  BST on Tuesday Highrisk passengers were flagged up to border control and passed on to health workers from Public Health England who then carried out the actual screening The Department of Health estimates that  of all arrivals to the UK from affected countries will come through Heathrow There are no direct flights to the UK from the three worstaffected countries  Liberia Sierra Leone or Guinea Public Health England director Dr Paul Cosford said This is a setup process We will be learning from the experience today and over coming days as to how it is working The principle benefit is about distributing information to people about how to contact the symptoms to look out for and who to contact in the event that they do get symptoms when they are in this country He said the expectation was that everyone who was asked to go through the process would do so He said the information given out via leaflets and protocol about who to call if affected was as important as the screening No system was  certain but it was about reducing the risk as much as possible he added He said the overall risk to the UK remained low and the domestic health system was world class and ready to respond In all cases but two first in Madrid and later in Dallas the patient was infected with Ebola while in West Africa  The Border Force does have legislation to be able to compel people to be screened if they are deemed to be a public health risk Border Force chief of staff Dan OMahoney said he did not anticipate any problems We envisage that most people will be fine with the request to undertake that screening he said If it becomes an issue and we find a number of people are saying they dont want to undergo that screening we will need to look at the words we use and how we are actually referring them on to PHE Mr OMahoney said about  passengers a month flew into Heathrow from the affected countries  of its total traffic One of the first passengers to be screened Sorious Samura  who had been in Liberia filming a documentary about the outbreak was not impressed with the system He said Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didnt go into the screening room they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport I only filled in the questionnaire and went through the screening because I felt a sense of responsibility having seen the effect of Ebola where Ive been At  tonnes RFA Argus is one of the Royal Navys larger support ships Now docked at Falmouth shes being loaded with supplies to help the British military in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus On board theyre storing hospital beds medical equipment and protective clothing in her massive cavernous hangar Above on her large flat deck Argus will carry three Royal Navy Merlin helicopters to fly people and equipment around The ship will act as an offshore base as the troops set up four Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone There is a hospital on board along with  medical staff  But it wont be used to treat anyone whos contracted the virus Should any of the crew or the Royal Marines on board become infected they would be kept in isolation and then taken to one of the clinics on the ground The marines will help offload the supplies when Argus reaches the coast of Sierra Leone after a day voyage They say theyre not worried about being infected by Ebola because theyll have little contact with people on the ground Maj Luke Davis says malaria is as much of a concern Under the screening measures passengers are identified by UK Border Force officers on arrival before nurses and consultants from Public Health England carry out the actual screening They will have their temperatures taken complete a risk questionnaire and have contact details recorded Anyone with suspected Ebola will be taken to hospital Passengers deemed to be at high risk due to contact with Ebola patients but who are displaying no symptoms will be contacted daily by Public Health England Questions asked on the form include did you come into contact with a person knownsuspected to have Ebola and do you have a temperature The World Health Organization WHO said there were estimates of  cases of Ebola now reported in west Africa and  deaths WHO assistant director general Bruce Aylward told a news conference in Geneva that there could be  to  new cases per week by December He said one of the main concerns was the increase in the number of cases in the capital cities of the affected countries A yearold UN medical worker originally from Sudan has died from Ebola at a hospital in Leipzig Germany despite receiving experimental drugs to treat the virus The UK government has pledged m to help contain control treat and defeat Ebola hundreds of NHS staff have volunteered to travel to West Africa and  troops have been deployed to help build treatment centres and provide logistical support UK casualty vessel RFA Argus which has a fullyequipped hospital is expected to set sail for Sierra Leone later this week It will not be used to treat Ebolainfected patients but mainly to ferry kit and people There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola which is transmitted through sweat blood and saliva Symptoms of Ebola include fever headache vomiting diarrhoea bleeding  but these are similar to more common infections like flu and some stomach bugs If you have these symptoms and have had contact with an Ebola patient then   do not go directly to AE or a GP If there has been no contact with Ebola then seek help from  your GP or AE if necessary The chances of developing Ebola in the UK remain low
