Sometimes I really do forget to take care of myself in the process  and practice what I preach After my own pregnancy I struggled to find the right balance to eat healthy make time to exercise and still be a fulltime working mom While juggling my busy life the weight piled on and my energy started to diminish It was time to make a change and I had no clue how to get back on the right track Finally I got the opportunity of a lifetime when I found out my husband and I and were selected for Fit Nation This gave me the chance to ask for help instead of always being the caretaker It was now my time to take a good look in the mirror and get a game plan together to make a change It was time to start living the life I preached and lead by example  I wanted to be healthy I just could not figure out how to make it happen with all my obligations I wanted to share some of the things Ive learned in the last few months to create this new healthier me  The first thing I learned at kickoff weekend came from our trainer April Worry about yourself That just wasnt in my nature I was worried about Eugene my husband Worried about the guilt that I would feel not seeing my daughter as much through all of my training I was already creating a strategy on how I could bring fitness and health into the lives of people that I care about and my patients The main person I needed to finally worry about was myself  I came to the realization that if I dont take care of my health and fitness how could I help others and be the best for my patients and family  As a couple Eugene and I had to work out a new schedule that was conducive for both of our busy lives Since we were the first Fit Nation couple to be selected we had to come together to plan and be strategic so we could make this happen for both of us What I found to be crucial is we had to have an open conversation and discuss the concerns we had and address obstacles in our way of putting our new plan into action   Once we established a schedule we decided to focus on our meals for the week and also make changes in what we were eating and cook more often at home at the same time eating out way less   I still struggle with this but at least I know how to make healthier choices and not to eat late I found that its the planning and preparation and communication it takes to really make a change that sticks for the long run   I didnt realize how much I would enjoy biking and swimming now running I can still do without but I work through that and move forward Exercising has provided a new release for me from work and motherhood I truly feel that I am doing something great for myself and the change so far feels amazing Its now been six weeks since our kickoff weekend Working out has provided me with more energy and a new zest for life I am cooking healthier meals spending more quality time with my daughter and working out more at the gym  I am still working on balancing everything It has become a priority to put health and fitness first  Most importantly I have realized this is a journey and changes are not made overnight  Please have realistic expectations dont be too hard on yourself embrace your challenges and dont give up  My new norm is an aching body the smell of chlorine from swimming on my skin and dreams of kale salad Watch out Malibu Triathlon Ill see you at the finish line
