Several years ago Garrison Phillips a retired actor bought himself a Dell computer He soon recognized that he didnt know what to do with it I needed instruction he told me in an interview conducted  perhaps surprisingly  by email The technology of the Internet cell and iPhones was like a foreign language Mr Phillips then attended one of the first classes offered by   a New York City nonprofit the acronym stands for Older Adults Technology Services that provides free tech training for seniors Despite serious hearing loss from an injury in the Korean War Mr Phillips learned his way around his desktop went on to more advanced OATS classes and now at  uses his computer his third to blog write stories and theater pieces and to communicate with friends and family from England to California Its become the most important activity and creative outlet in my life he wrote Would that more older adults could follow suit A few weeks back I noted that   according to Pew Research studies Among those  and older the proportion drops to about a third In an era when everything from personal health records to nursing home quality ratings is moving online when the best way to stay in touch with grandchildren may involve texting this amounts to slow progress The tech analyst Laurie Orlov of the   has called for a national campaign to bring  percent of seniors online Teaching skills only addresses part of the problem of course the costs of devices and of Internet service also keep older people offline and so do physical limitations or cognitive impairment Still learning the technology is key As Mr Phillips pointed out the Internet was a whole new world for me Everyone exploring a new world needs a guide Though lots of communities offer computer classes for older adults the response has been mostly local and smallscale But since my previous post brought lots of comments from frustrated adult children I thought Id pass along some timetested national and abouttobenational programs Researchers have learned a fair amount about the ways seniors learn and have documented that computer and Internet training works well when it incorporates those findings First thanks to reader D Solomon from San Jose for reminding us about   a player in this game since  Supported in part by tech giants like Adobe Microsoft and IBM as well as local governments and foundations Senior Net has established about  learning centers around the country a laudable accomplishment Look   to see if theres one near you or your parent Still its not enough For instance theres one center in all of New Jersey my state and none in several other states The   developed by the nonprofit Oasis Institute fills in some of those gaps Bolstered by grants from ATT it offers classes in  metro areas  including suburban Pittsburgh where volunteer Harvey Schoenman  and retired after a long tech career teaches his peers at the Community Library of Castle Shannon His students Mr Schoenman finds often suffer from computer anxiety Oh how I remember But theyve heard about Facebook their grandchildren are on it and they want to be a part of it he told me They want to learn how to get junk out of their houses and sell it on eBay They want to be better able to function in todays world Connections curriculum includes more than  courses ranging from basics to digital photography and online jobhunting It keeps classes small and of manageable length two hours with a break in between with lots of repetition and handson practice Workbooks are tailored to seniors  large fonts multiple illustrations That approach seems to pay off After   researchers a the University of Miami found that after completing introductory courses older adults were significantly more comfortable with and knowledgeable about computers and the Internet and more likely to use them In Manhattan OATS just opened a snazzy foot Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea the countrys first tech center specifically for those over  OATS also teaches a range of seniortailored courses in  locations across the city libraries public schools senior centers and senior housing developments Now its thinking big planning to tackle other cities We have a lot of infrastructure that wasnt there before said the executive director Tom Kamber noting that federal stimulus funds had helped build  computer labs around the country Were right on the cusp of creating a powerful national program that will reach hundreds of thousands of seniors a year Make it so When seniors succeed in taming technology it can make an enormous difference in their lives Ask Muriel Beach an yearold OATS alumna In her career as a labor economist she had used electric typewriters so computers were terra incognita Not any more These classes provide a doorway for seniors to the wider world she told me She sent that email to me from her iPad
