Screening women for breast cancer using traditional digital mammography plus a technique that yields a threedimensional picture of the breast improves detection of cancer and reduces the number of women called back unnecessarily for further tests and biopsies a new study has found The addition of tomosynthesis a technique not widely available before  to digital mammography increased the numbers of cancers found in women screened from  to   a  increase The   published Tuesday in JAMA did not follow women for years to discern whether tomosynthesis saved more lives But recent research has suggested that tomography is likely better at detecting the most deadly cancers  small invasive cancers and lobular cancers  than digital mammography alone While tests that increase detection rates often come at the cost of increasing false positives the latest study found that adding the D pictures to routine mammography actually had the opposite effect  of women who got mammograms alone were called back for additional imaging or biopsy but among those being screened with mammography plus tomosynthesis only  had to endure the anxiety expense and risk of being called back for further tests While digital mammography takes a single static picture of the breast tomosynthesis passes a lowdose Xray source in an arc across the breast creating a series of images Computer software then lines the images up to create a threedimensional image of the breast Smaller cancerous lesions are less likely to be obscured behind dense tissue or other structures within the breast and a radiologist can glean a better picture of the size and shape of an abnormality reducing confusion over whether it has malignant potential We now have a better mammogram said the studys lead author Dr Sarah M Friedewald a diagnostic radiologist at Advocate Lutheran Hospital in Libertyville Illinois While several studies have suggested there might be a benefit in adding a third dimension to breast cancer scans Friedewald said that the current research does so with greater clarity This studys robust findings emerged from the collected records of  breast imaging centers across the United States which conducted nearly  breastcancer screenings between  and  Friedewald noted that insurance companies now reimburse unevenly for the more expensive screening that uses both digital mammography and tomosynthesis Were hoping this will shed light on and increase awarenessÂ of the benefits of the enhanced scanning technique Friedewald added so theyll be more consistent In an   accompanying the JAMA study a pair of experts in radiological diagnosis acknowledged that the new study is unlikely to end the recurring debate over the value of breast cancer screening Those inclined to believe that breastcancer screening saves lives will be cheered by the availability of a technique that makes detection better without driving up falsepositive results wrote Dr Etta D Pisano of the Medical University of South Carolina and Martin J Yaffe a researcher at the University of Torontos Ontario Institute for Cancer Research But those who question the value of yearly screens for all women after  or  will cite the current studys absence of followup which might reveal whether better or earlier detection of cancers allowed more women to live and for longer they added
