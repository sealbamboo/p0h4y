Prehistoric humans didnt have toothbrushes They didnt have floss or toothpaste and they certainly didnt have Listerine Yet somehow their mouths were a lot healthier than ours are today Huntergatherers had really good teeth says   director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA But as soon as you get to farming populations you see this massive change Huge amounts of gum disease And cavities start cropping up And thousands of years later were still waging and often losing our war against   Our changing diets are largely to blame In a   published in the latest   Cooper and his research team looked at calcified plaque on ancient teeth from  prehistoric human skeletons What they found was that as our diets changed over time  shifting from meat vegetables and nuts to carbohydrates and sugar  so too did the composition of bacteria in our mouths Not all oral bacteria are bad In fact many of these microbes help us by protecting against more dangerous pathogens However the researchers found that as prehistoric humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming certain types of diseasecausing bacteria that were particularly efficient at using carbohydrates started to win out over other types of friendly bacteria in human mouths The addition of processed flour and sugar during the Industrial Revolution only made matters worse What youve really created is an ecosystem which is very low in diversity and full of opportunistic pathogens that have jumped in to utilize the resources which are now free Cooper says And thats a problem because the dominance of harmful bacteria means that our mouths are basically in a constant state of disease Youre walking around with a permanent immune response which is not a good thing says Cooper It causes problems all over the place In addition to oral disease those   may include diabetes obesity and even heart disease According to Cooper bacteria make up approximately  percent of the cells in our bodies He believes that we focus too much on ourselves and not enough on this socalled   We brush our teeth and we floss and we think that weve got good oral hygiene But were completely failing to deal with the underlying problem he says Ten years from now I think were going to find that the whole microbiome is a key part of what you get monitored for and treated for As for right now Cooper suggests that one way to help return your microbiome to a healthier more balanced state might be to cut out all of those processed carbs and start eating like our ancestors Sounds like hes another fan of the
