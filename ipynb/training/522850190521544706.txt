Ohio health investigators are trying to track down anyone who visited an Akron bridal shop on Saturday afternoon when a nurse infected with the Ebola virus was there with friends. They have set up a hotline for customers who were at Coming Attractions between noon and 3:30 p.m. so that officials can figure out whether they might have been exposed to her and "whether they should be concerned or not," Summit County public health director Margo Erme said Thursday. The owners of the shop voluntarily closed it and could not be reached for comment.. The nurse, Amber Vinson, 29, flew from Dallas, where she cared for Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, to Ohio last weekend so she could plan for her wedding. Authorities say she stayed close to home except for the visit to the East Tallmadge Ave. bridal shop with five friends — all of whom have been located and put under voluntary quarantine. Vinson did not have classic symptoms of Ebola at that time.. Anyone who visited the shop is asked to call (330) 926-3939 to speak with a health investigator.
