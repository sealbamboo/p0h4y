And that was it Douglass call to the local Navy recruiting center lasted less than five minutes  I felt horrible she remembers I thought maybe I could change that I didnt realize how big I actually was  It was on a whalewatching trip to celebrate her nd birthday that Douglass first toyed with the idea of joining the military She noticed her fellow passengers on the boat were really enamored with the Coast Guardsmen patrolling nearby  At the time Douglass was working a parttime job in Portland Oregon She wasnt having any luck getting student loans to go back to school and was having serious issues with her family To deal with it she turned to food eating fast food during the day and binging on candy when she got home at night  Chocolate was her drug of choice Sometimes with a side of ice cream  I was realizing that the people who you thought were going to be there for you werent at all she says I felt trapped The foot yearold weighed  pounds  After the painful phone call Douglass started running every night around her neighborhood A few months later she went to the Navy recruiting center in person As she was about to enter an Army recruiter from the next office over called out to her It was the first time Douglass had ever seen a soldier up close  I just sort of stared she says with a laugh as the recruiter told her about their morning workout program for potential enlistees  She dragged a friend to the first training session They started by running laps then moved on to pushups Douglass left shortly after the warmup  It doesnt sound like much now but at that point oh my God it made me throw up she says The friends went to get milkshakes to make themselves feel better  It was two weeks before Douglass gathered the courage to go back No one from the Army called her Her friend didnt push I just thought if Im really serious I have to give it a shot She worked out with the group every day that week Monday through Thursday It was hard but she realized she could do it  Douglass started waking up at  am every day to take a bus to the groups morning workout They run  to  miles and then she heads to the gym before going to work On Tuesdays and Thursdays she takes the bus back for an afternoon workout of jumping jacks   and pushups  She also overhauled her diet cutting out fast food fried food and soda and limiting her candy intake Every week she tries a new diet to keep it interesting  one week she avoids carbohydrates another week she skips meat  A year and three months later Douglass has lost  pounds She was sworn into the Army on December   I fell in love with their world she   I fell in love with the bonds that I created with these people I fell in love for what they stand for It wasnt always easy There were days when she would call Sgt Cody Baker the Future Soldier Leader and quit I would go months without losing weight It was so frustrating she says I remember  just saying I cant do this Im never going to be small enough  But Baker never gave up on her Neither did Douglass friends and roommates who encouraged her to stay on track  Today Douglass is literally a walking Army billboard Her clothes her room and her accessories are all advertisements for her new family Shes looking forward to basic training and plans to drop another  pounds  Her advice to others who want to lose weight Lie to yourself  You love this feeling You love being tired You love being sore Because in the end you will
