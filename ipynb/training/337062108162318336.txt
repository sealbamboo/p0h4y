An important new study suggests that statins the cholesterollowering medications that are the most prescribed drugs in the world may block some of the fitness benefits of exercise one of the surest ways to improve health  No one is saying that people with high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease should avoid statins which studies show can be lifesaving But the discovery could create something of dilemma for doctors and patients since the people who should benefit the most from exercise  those who are sedentary overweight at risk of heart disease or middleaged  are also the people most likely to be put on statins possibly undoing some of the good of their workouts For the new study which was   researchers from the University of Missouri and other institutions gathered a group of overweight sedentary men and women all of whom had multiple symptoms of metabolic problems including wide waistlines high blood pressure or excess abdominal fat  Most had slightly but not dangerously elevated cholesterol levels  None had exercised regularly in the past year All underwent muscle biopsies and treadmill testing to determine their aerobic fitness  which was generally quite low  and agreed to continue with their normal diet Then they all began a supervised week exercise program during which they visited the university lab five times a week and walked or jogged on a treadmill for  minutes at a moderately vigorous pace about  to  percent of their individual aerobic maximum  Half of the group also began taking a daily milligram dose of simvastatin a particular type of statin sold under the brand name Zocor  At the end of  weeks the participants fitness and muscles were retested Statins as most of us know are medications designed to reduce the bodys cholesterol levels particularly levels of lowdensity lipoprotein or bad cholesterol The drugs routinely are prescribed for those with high cholesterol and other risk factors for heart disease and some physicians believe that they should be used prophylactically by virtually everyone over   Exercise also typically is recommended as a means of fighting heart disease and prolonging life span  And both statins and sweating indisputably are effective In past studies researchers have shown that statins reduce the risk of a heart attack in people at high risk by  to  percent for every millimoleperliter reduction in blood cholesterol levels millimoles measure the actual number of cholesterol molecules in the bloodstream equivalent to about a point drop in LDL levels Meanwhile improving aerobic fitness by even a small percentage through exercise likewise has been found to lessen someones likelihood of dying prematurely by as much as  percent So theoretically it would seem that combining statins and exercise should provide the greatest possible health benefit  But until the current study no experiment scrupulously had explored the interactions of statin drugs and workouts in people And the results as it turns out are worrisome  The unmedicated volunteers improved their aerobic fitness significantly after three months of exercise by more than  percent on average But the volunteers taking the statins gained barely  percent on average in their fitness and some possessed less aerobic capacity at the end of the study than at its start  Why there should be such a discrepancy between the two groups fitness levels wasnt clear on the surface But when the researchers looked microscopically at biopsied muscle tissue they found notable differences in the levels of an enzyme related to the health of mitochondria the tiny energyproducing parts of a cell Mitochondria generally increase in number and potency when someone exercises  But in the volunteers taking statins enzyme levels related to mitochondrial health fell by about  percent over the course of the experiment The same levels increased by  percent in the group not taking the drug  In effect the volunteers taking statins were not getting the same bang from their exercise buck as the other exercisers says John P Thyfault a professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri and senior author of the study   This finding joins a small but accumulating body of other studies indicating that statins can negatively affect exercise response Lab rodents given statins for instance   while in humans marathon runners on statins   than runners not using the drugs  None of which suggests Dr Thyfault says that statins are not worthwhile For people who have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease or who themselves have high cholesterol he says theres no doubt that statins save lives  But for other people the riskbenefit calculation involving statins may be trickier in light of this and other new science  Low aerobic fitness is one of the best predictors of premature death Dr Thyfault says And if statins prevent people from raising their fitness through exercise then that is a concern  A possible remedy he continues could be for people to get in shape and raise their aerobic fitness before starting the drug but thats an issue to discuss with your doctor Theres still a great deal we dont understand about how statins and exercise mix he says
