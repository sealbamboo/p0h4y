 that  to  of all chronic lower back pain comes not from the spine but from the sacroliac or SI joint which bears and transfers weight and movement from your upper body to your legs When the ligaments wear out and the SI joint becomes unstable it can generate a similar kind of sharp back pain  or sciaticalike pain down your leg  as a ruptured disc  Most spine surgeons however arent trained to look at the sacroiliac joint they generally dont learn about it during their residency or fellowships And it doesnt occur to most patients to ask Then Xrays MRIs and CT scans of aching aging backs show narrowing spinal discs without actually showing whether these discs are producing pain  further confusing the diagnosis of the suffering patient As a result many people progress through the usual stages of back pain treatment from physical therapy and chiropractic treatment to injections laser procedures and finally to surgery without ever addressing the true source of the pain  One study found that among    people who had their lumbar vertebrae fused and were still in pain afterward  the   in more than half the cases  When you know to look at the SI joint finding out whether its the source of the pain is usually pretty easy If an injection of the local anesthetic Lidocaine into the joint produces temporary pain relief then thats likely where the problem resides If so all the treatments previously misdirected at the spine  chiropractic physical therapy and medication  can be aimed at the proper target If those treatments dont work the next step is often surgery Up until recently that meant a major open fusion procedure followed by several months of recovery  However a new minimally invasive procedure is now available that uses small titanium implants to stabilize the joint The tiny incisions mean patients recover much more quickly The procedure is being done regularly here at UCLA and at other top spine centers around the country  It worked for Tom  hes living painfree and is back in control of his life And there are millions more Toms out there living with chronic back pain who could benefit from knowing more about where that pain may be really coming from and how it can be dealt with effectively  If you are suffering from lower back pain make sure to ask your doctor to examine your SI joint in addition to the routine examination You may want to seek out a spine surgeon who has experience with sacroiliitis  the Internet is a good place to start but referrals are also valuable  Ask the surgeon directly if heshe has experience operating on patients with SI dysfunction in the past year And dont accept a lumbar fusion surgery performed for back pain alone versus leg pain without having your SI joint checked out by an expert
