 A patch containing oxybutynin (Oxytrol) for controlling overactive bladder may be sold over-the-counter for women 18 and older, the FDA said Friday.. Men will continue to need a prescription for the drug, the agency said. The OTC product will be marketed by Merck as Oxytrol for Women.. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic agent that acts as a bladder muscle relaxant. No agent in this class has been available over-the-counter before, according to the FDA.. The approval comes despite an agency .  the OTC switch in November. Panel members expressed concerns about inappropriate use of the drug without a physician's oversight or diagnosis of overactive bladder.. As one said during the November meeting, "I don't think that we have shown that patients can appropriately self-select.". Approval of the OTC formulation was supported by nine studies in more than 5,000 patients.. "Overall, results from these studies showed that consumers can understand the information on the label, properly select whether the product is right for them, and use the drug appropriately," the FDA said.. Adverse effects seen in these studies included mild skin irritation at the patch site, dry mouth, and constipation.. Merck's studies also found that men were relatively poor at correctly determining whether oxybutynin was the appropriate treatment for their urination problems. A key worry is that incorrect self-diagnosis in men could delay detection of prostate cancer.. Consequently, the company did not seek OTC status for the product in men.. Source:
