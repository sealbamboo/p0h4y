It may be easy to to ask after the fact why no one intervened before a pregnant South Carolina woman drove a minivan carrying her three young children into the Florida surf on Tuesday But mental health experts say the answer is far from simple thanks to a patchwork of state laws regarding involuntary commitment uneven enforcement subjective judgment  and the need to protect the civil rights of everyone even the mentally ill There is no law in this country against being crazy said Laurence Miller a clinical and forensic psychologist in Boca Raton Fla If somebody is delusional and even flagrantly psychotic unless theyre an imminent danger to themselves or others theres nothing anybody can do Ebony Wilkerson  of Cross SC was hospitalized for a mental health evaluation Thursday two days after she nearly submerged herself and her three children ages   and  in the ocean at Daytona Beach Volusia County Sheriffs Office officials told the Associated Press that Wilkerson was being evaluated under Floridas Baker Act a law that allows authorities to involuntarily take people into custody if they seem to be a threat to themselves and others But she didnt meet the standards of that law on Tuesday two hours before she headed to the ocean when police officers stopped Wilkerson after her sister had called to say the woman was talking about demons Officers had determined that Wilkerson was lucid  and they let her go That points to the difficulty of predicting when mentally ill  even delusional  people pose a danger because theres no shared treatment standard across the US said Doris Fuller the executive director of Treatment Advocacy Center a nonprofit agency focused on the issue Laws for involuntary commitment vary widely from state to state and even when there are strong laws some jurisdictions simply dont follow them Fuller said And if there are strong laws and a willingness to enforce them there may be a lack of psychiatric beds for evaluation and treatment Often it takes a crime or a tragedy  or both  to attract necessary resources to the mentally ill Its a terrible terrible thing that people have to get involved in the criminal justice system before they get what they needed all along Fuller said Miller the psychologist cautioned against blaming police for not predicting that Wilkerson would turn dangerous Even a trained mental health professional would have a hard time he said I have no way of knowing with a crystal ball an hour later that the mother is going to drive into the ocean In Wilkersons case she apparently was fleeing apparent domestic abuse after two incidents in South Carolina according to a statement from her sister Jessica Harrell When police stopped Wilkerson she told officers that she was headed to a shelter because she was afraid of her husband according to Ben Johnson the Volusia County Sheriff The desperation of domestic violence paired with the delusions of mental illness likely contributed to Wilkersons decision to turn her black Honda Odyssey off the Daytona Beach dunes and into the sea said Rita Smith executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence It may have felt to her like it was better to take the children with her than leaving them to abuse Smith said In the end passersby dove into the water to rescue Wilkerson and her children who were not seriously harmed On Thursday Wilkersons family released a statement saying she was receiving care for her multiple health issues   They are asking for your prayers as they sort out the issues involved in this matter the statement said It is their hope that their privacy is respected to allow the healing process to begin
