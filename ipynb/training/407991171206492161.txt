I just wanted him to maintain his working abilities said Mr Bruce  Ive had other dogs neutered that have had a lot of weight gain and their bodies go through huge changes and I didnt want that to happen with my dog this time Then Mr Bruces sister a veterinary student told him about Zeuterin a drug that sterilizes male dogs without the removal of the testicles thus preserving some  testosterone production In June Mr Bruce volunteered Cody for the procedure performed by veterinarians as part of a training program at a clinic in Portland The next day Cody was back at work enthusiastically rounding up livestock It was quick painless and super uninvasive Mr Bruce said Hes mellowed out a bit but I havent had the problems I had before The year movement to convince Americans that they should spay or neuter their pets has been nothing short of a triumph  percent of owned dogs and  percent of owned cats are   compared with only about  percent in the s But surgically removing the reproductive organs of every pet is still timeconsuming for veterinarians unpopular among a subset of pet owners and ethically troubling to animal welfare advocates It is also an impractical solution to sterilizing stray animals which constitute the bulk of Americas nuisance animal problem Surgery is definitely a bottleneck for humane animal control said Dr Julie K Levy a veterinarian at the University of Florida who has researched the problem Now a handful of nonsurgical sterilization treatments are emerging  led by Zeuterin which could be commercially available in the United States by the end of this year  that could reduce or even eliminate the need for traditional neutering The truth is we may have maximized what we can do with surgical spayneuter said Joyce Briggs the president of the   a group advocating alternative approaches Nonsurgical sterilants could be a gamechanger for animal welfare across the world The problem she added is persuading enough veterinarians pet owners and pharmaceutical companies to embrace the new technology The remedy nearest to market is Zeuterin a mix of  zinc gluconate and arginine that is injected directly into a dogs testicles killing the sperm and then shutting down the passageway through which it would normally travel The results are permanent and the process takes only a few hours poses little risk compared with surgery and works in  percent of dogs according to research trials I think its an outstanding product said Dr Levy who used the drug nearly a decade ago to sterilize wild dogs in the Galpagos She is eager for Americans to see what Zeuterin can accomplish Theres just a communication issue she added The drug now called Zeuterin has been on the market before and failed Introduced as Neutersol in  the drug which needs to be injected very precisely and delicately was sold to veterinarians without much training or support As a result too many dogs had adverse reactions inflamed testicles mostly and the drug earned a bad reputation By  both it and the company behind it had disappeared This product isnt a product said Joe Tosini the founder and chief executive of Ark Sciences which bought the rights to the drug and renamed it Its really a procedure that has to be taught The company is waiting for the Food and Drug Administration to approve its manufacturing facilities so it can sell the drug in the United States Approval may come as early as this month Mr Tosini a former minister who was an original investor in Neutersol said Ark Sciences had learned from the mistakes of its predecessor To provide Zeuterin veterinarians will have to complete a fivehour course that includes injecting the drug into several dogs The idea that surgical castration causes weight gain or even behavioral changes in dogs is still a matter of debate among veterinarians Nonetheless the procedure remains unpopular among some pet owners who rely on their dogs for hunting sports or protection who fear that castration could affect their pets performance Some owners simply cannot afford the procedure which can cost upward of  depending on the region Ark Sciences plans to make Zeuterin available at clinics for as little as  Other owners particularly those with male dogs make a conscious choice not to sterilize In certain cultures and Latin cultures are among them castration is really viewed as very emasculating and I think people identify with their dogs Dr Levy said Few other companies have shown much enthusiasm for walking the long expensive regulatory path required to get approval for nonsurgical sterilization drugs  a process that takes five to seven years and can cost more than  million The perception some researchers say is that surgical spaying and neutering are now just too deeply ingrained in veterinary practices What I often hear from the big animal health company executives is Well vets just like to spay and neuter dogs and cats so theres no market for thisÂ  said Dr Linda Rhodes the chief scientific officer of Aratana Therapeutics a company that licenses the rights to use drugs developed for humans in animals Although most veterinarians lose money on spaying and neutering they prefer to stick with the technique they know rather than try something they consider experimental said Dr Mark Russak the immediate past president of the American Animal Hospital Association We wonder Whats going to happen in  years Are these dogs going to get   Wed rather let the guy up the street try it first Elsewhere nonsurgical sterilizers are starting to catch on In recent years castrationresistant owners in Australia New Zealand and parts of Europe have been turning to Suprelorin an implant that sterilizes male dogs for six or  months by neutralizing the production of reproductive hormones Though an implant that must regularly be replaced like Suprelorin is not practical for strays a vaccine known as GonaCon and developed by the Department of Agriculture to sterilize deer and wild horses may be a viable alternative Dr Levy said Studies have shown that a single injection of GonaCon will sterilize most cats and dogs for up to four years  about the life span of a stray animal And because it blocks reproductive hormones GonaCon eliminates many of the nuisance behaviors like fighting and spraying associated with strays But GonaCon would need to be approved by the FDA for use in dogs and cats and there is hardly enough money to be made in treating stray animals to justify that cost for a forprofit company Were kind of looking at a charity population Dr Levy said Its like developing drugs to treat disease that only occur in impoverished countries One charitable organization   is offering a  million award to the inventor of the first singleshot nonsurgical sterilant that works in both dogs and cats But no one has been able to claim the prize With a successful Zeuterin debut other companies might choose to invest in similar treatments But for now Ark Sciences aware of the resistance to change is focusing its marketing efforts on early adopters veterinarians like Dr Levy who already know the virtues of nonsurgical sterilants For many of them the switch to a new neutering strategy will be like giving an airplane to people who are used to traveling by covered wagon Mr Tosini said
