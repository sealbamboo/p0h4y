You can hear them celebrating now. Official advisers to the federal government said kids aged 2 to 8 should get the needle-free flu vaccine.. It’s the first time the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended a specific brand of flu vaccine. But ACIP members agreed on studies that show FluMist, which is squirted up the nose, is more effective than a shot in the arm for kids.. ACIP advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can decide whether to take or leave the advice. If CDC approves, it will become official policy — although parents and pediatricians will be free to give any flu vaccine to a child. Kids with egg allergies should get another vaccine formulated without chicken eggs, and all those vaccines are given as shots.. CDC recommends that just about everyone get a flu vaccine every year. Several groups are working on alternatives to flu vaccines that work better without a needle.. - Maggie Fox
