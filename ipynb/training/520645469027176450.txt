The vegan lifestyle and the lifestyle of professional athletes arent often associated with each other But John Salley a former NBA star whos played with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers swears by the strictly animal and animalproductfree diet hes taken up since retiring from the game Here he talks about maintaining his energy and ability the benefits of going vegan and misconceptions Five years ago I was doing a public service announcement for PETA People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals about being vegetarian and all the food there at the photo shoot was vegan I suddenly felt like eating anything from an animal wasnt good for me  I paid attention to what it was doing inside my body I also wanted my body and libido back from when I was  and I got them both I went into raw vegan for a while but I prefer cooked food the way it smells the way it feels going through your system I get it from the same place the cows get it from green leafy vegetables No one asks the cow or the chicken where it gets its protein I eat about  or  calories a day and I cook for myself I also have a line of cooks that work with me  some raw some vegan In the morning I eat organic grits  and I have ginger tea with coconut oil I eat a lot of kale and I drink about half a gallon to a gallon of water a day At night Ill make pizza with almond cheese and different vegetables and seasonings I put turmeric on everything If I had a vegan lifestyle when I was playing I would still be playing Im just rebuilding my body now from all the wear and tear It was important working up on the Hill with the congressmen to convince them that these kids are the people who will be voting soon and if all of them are sick and dying there wont be any votes Theres no reason that America should be No  in obesity we have the greatest country in the world Its about taking care of your health  kids over the age of  do a lot of things from habit and you can teach them about eating healthy and how important their food is It helps keep their weight in the right place it even helps keep pimples off their face Just like you teach them how to salute their flag you should teach them how to shop for food That we are all hippies The biggest misconception is that its like a political statement Its not its just people who are conscious of what goes in their body and what happens in their environment at the same time Also for me its hard to not be an animal advocate
