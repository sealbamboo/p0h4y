The worlds smallest pacemaker has been fitted inside the heart of a UK patient medics have said The Micra Transcatheter Pacing System was fitted for the first time in England at Southampton General Hospital Consultant cardiologist Prof John Morgan said the procedure was a landmark moment He said the device was not much larger than an antibiotic pill and was one tenth the size of traditional models Currently pacemakers which use electrical impulses to regulate the beating of the heart are inserted under the skin and connected to the heart via a lead The lead carries electrical signals to correct slow or irregular heartbeats but they can require replacement due to broken or dislodged wires The new device can be implanted directly in the heart and delivers electrical impulses from an electrode removing the need for a lead  Prof Morgan said In addition to the advantages of the devices size and wireless technology the procedure reduces the risk of infection and extended recovery time associated with traditional more invasive surgical pacemaker implants  This a big step forward in patient treatment and a milestone for cardiac rhythm management in the UK This new technology has several potential advantages   Most important is the absence of a wire or lead which carries the electrical impulse from conventional pacemakers to the heart  These wires can come under immense pressure and can be a source of complications    Standard pacemakers are implanted under the skin in the chest which can be a potential infection risk  By contrast the tiny pacemaker used in these trials is inserted via a catheter from the groin and sits in the heart    At  mm long and weighing g the Micra TM used in Southampton can claim to be the worlds smallest pacemaker   Southampton General is the only UK hospital which is taking part in a global clinical trial of the device   A patient in Austria was the first to have the device implanted in December   A rival system called   is also undergoing trials It is mm long    A  under development by EBR Systems combines a pacemaker implanted under the skin which wirelessly sends ultrasound energy to a receiving electrode  about the size of a grain of rice  implanted in the left ventricle
