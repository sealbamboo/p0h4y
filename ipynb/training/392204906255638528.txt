The Obama administrations hopes ran high that millions would flock to enroll for health insurance on state and federal exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act Those exchanges went online Oct  The administration   that half a million individuals or families would enroll within  days according to The Associated Press But three weeks in the data suggest the actual number of enrollments is lagging far behind that number The promise of signing up for health insurance with pointandclick ease at   and state exchange sites has not come to pass  at least not yet This is a fiasco says health policy analyst   He says the sites are plagued by glitches and problems with data transfer Literally a handful of enrollments are coming through to the largest insurance companies every day he says Just a handful like maybe  or  or  So anecdotally the enrollments are very very very low Laszewski says the inability to get through to a website is not the only issue Insurance companies are getting bad information too Its not uncommon for say John Does enrollment to come through at  in the morning And then at  something comes through that says John Does unenrolled  and then enrolled and unenrolled again he says The federal government is   for  states through healthcaregov which has been plagued by technical problems Health and Human Services hasnt disclosed enrollment figures But the digital marketing company Millward Brown estimates that  people enrolled through the federal site in the first two weeks The  states that opted to run their own online marketplaces appear to be faring better though not by much Among those states the estimate of total enrollees so far is about  Those numbers are complicated by the fact that there is no common definition of what enrolled means In some states youre not considered enrolled until youve paid Laszewski says these small numbers could threaten the economics for insurers Theyre very worried about only sick people showing up for coverage because only sick people are willing to go through the gauntlet he says There are two ways of looking at this One is that the new law is failing to meet expectations But proponents of the law argue its still early and that many of these problems can be overcome Things will improve says   a law professor at Washington and Lee University He points to the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D The federal program launched in  during the Bush administration and had its own technical difficulties Once people were finally signed up there were problems that they would go to the pharmacy and there was no record of them Jost says He expects similar problems here So it will take awhile to get the kinks ironed out he says But the important thing right now is to allow people to get signed up and I think theres an awful lot of people who want to do that In fact there are two states that are declaring their signup efforts a success Carrie Banahan executive director of Kentuckys   says more than  individuals have enrolled Were thrilled with these numbers We had no idea that there would be such a demand and an overwhelming response she says Kentuckys site was so overwhelmed that administrators had to add servers to its system Washington state reports about  enrollees   CEO of Washingtons health exchange says his state was prepared We started early Weve been working on this for nearly   years he says Still even Washingtons system crashed It went down for   hours on the first day It was nerveracking We did a lot of analysis and diagnosis he says We were hoping it would get better the second day It got a little bit better  We took it down the second night and it got better the third day Onizuka says with time anxiety has gone down Im breathing a little easier he says The federal government plans to release its first enrollment figures in midNovember
