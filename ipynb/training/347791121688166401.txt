A week or so after a procedure I found a sticker on my body Not a Disney sticker or a Dora the Explorer sticker put there maybe by a godchild or nephew but a  byinch white rectangle with a steel nipple at the center  What does it say about alienation from the body that I only found this sticker a week after an operation that worked or did not work but that in any case I cannot remember or distinguish from all the other hospital events   I consider this sticker as the women in my cancer support group discuss intimacy over lunch in a restaurant  Beautiful Judy flushes while admitting that she knows she is desirable despite the weight loss caused by radiation But what she wants to feel is her own desire welling up The problem is desire puts her back in touch with her body and her body brings her back to fears about a recurrence Will lovemaking always tether her to dread of mortality    But Sarah worries about her spouses desires Like her he is young and vigorous and he has been patient for more than a year now Except for the port barely visible on her chest her body in remission feels resilient She works out every day Though a selfprofessed prude from Nebraska she has started reading Fifty Shades of Grey Is it working someone asks Well shes only on page something so she remains hopeful that it will heat up  I remain silent as Alison explains that her husband treats her like a china doll Wary after her numerous operations hes protective of her vulnerability Diane on targeted therapy confides that she was not hurt so much as perplexed after sex when her partner found her reconfigured He is she adds by way of explanation a lawyer  Im trying to decode the emotional valence of his remark though Im still brooding on the purposes the nurses must have had in mind when they affixed the sticker to my body Probably there were many others and there was a purpose and it must have served them well Still they forgot to take this one off the middle of my back right between my shoulder blades in a place I could barely reach Patricia pushing back the unruly curls of her blond wig cracks us up with the lesson she draws from a younger man who found unusual ways to dramatize his intense crush on her The juiciness of the infatuation  though nothing happened  leads her to believe that sex in the mind might be the way to go    Ever the academic I mention that Joni Rodgers corroborates this idea in the most explicit description I have found of lovemaking during chemotherapy In her memoir Bald in the Land of Big Hair the author mentions the torrid sex scenes she managed to produce in fiction In real life though sex made her smell and taste on herself and on her partner the poison being pumped into her It grieved me greatly she wisecracks that my love canal was now more like Love Canal But I am thinking of my beloved husband And the sticker that had been on my body for a week though I never knew and my husband never knew it was there He is  years older than I Or thats how I thought of it when we met long ago decided to live together and to cherish each other as we still do every minute every second of this very day today for which I am abundantly grateful Now because cancer and its treatments have accelerated my aging the difference in our years has been erased    That evening my husband tried to comfort me Lets take a looksee Missy he said doing a caricature of the old man he in fact now is to the spoof of the old lady I in fact have become We did that We took a looksee We didnt find anything else
