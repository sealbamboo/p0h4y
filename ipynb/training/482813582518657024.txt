Americans are waiting longer to become parents Whatever the pros and cons of that trend heres some potentially good news for those older moms They may be more likely to live longer Women who had their last child after the age of  had twice the odds of exceptional longevity  defined as living to about   as did women who had their last child before age  according to a study published this week in the journal  Having a kid later in life isnt an effective antiaging strategy so dont put off childbearing to buy yourself some extra golden years Rather We think that a womans ability to have children at a later age is evidence that her reproductive system is aging more slowly and that the rest of her system is also aging more slowly says   a geriatrician at Boston Medical Center Hes an author of the paper and a principal investigator of the   an international effort to figure out the secrets of a long and healthy life That might bring some comfort to older moms who have been told that they wont be able to keep up with their teenagers Other research also has shown that women who   are more likely to make it to  or  years The theory is that certain genetic variations that allow women to bear children later are also related to longevity Variants allowing a woman to have children over a longer period of time would increase the chances she can pass the genes on to children and subsequent generations says Perls Its essentially winning the evolutionary game The age at which a woman has her last child isnt a perfect marker for the age of her reproductive system however simply because women make choices about when to have children A woman might have opted to stop having kids at  but could have kept going until she was  Thats why the next step in this line of research is to look to see if theres an association between the age of menopause  a much better indicator of the length of a womans reproductive ability  and longevity says Perls who is working on that research now None of the women in this study used fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization and Perls says that having children later in life after using those treatments isnt likely to be a marker for a longer life There are also some caveats to keep in mind The study controlled for some factors that influence life span such as education and tobacco use but the authors said future research should include more of those factors And this research cant speak to the health of the offspring of older mothers in general those kids are statistically more likely to have certain
