Obesity is probably a factor in some of the almost  new diagnoses of ovarian cancer that will be handed out this year to American women a new study says The finding adds ovarian cancer the deadliest of the gynecological malignancies to a growing list of diseases linked to carrying far too much weight Research has found obesity to contribute to a persons risk for a wide range of illnesses including cardiovascular disease type  diabetes and cancers of the breast colon pancreas and esophagus In the case of ovarian cancer which affects  in  women in the United States the role of obesity is small about  of US cases of this deadly cancer might be attributable at least in part to a womans obesity   the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund which released a report on ovarian cancer Tuesday If American women maintained a healthy weight  with   lower than   the report calculates that  cases of ovarian cancer might be prevented each year The report also concludes that a womans tall stature puts her at higher risk of ovarian cancer But it notes that tallness itself does not appear to confer that greater risk rather some of the factors that result in tallness may also contribute to tumor establishment and growth the experts suggested Taller people have been found to be at greater risk for a wide range of other cancers as well Ovarian cancer typically progresses with no recognizable symptoms and as a result is often diagnosed in advanced stages when it is harder to treat Ovarian cancer claims the lives of about  women in the United States annually a number that has scarcely budged in  years It is far more common in postmenopausal women  almost  of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are older than  But the new study found that obese premenopausal women have a more elevated risk of ovarian cancer compared with nonobese premenopausal women than do obese postmenopausal women compared with their nonobese peers The cancer specialists who drafted the report cited mounting evidence that obesityinduced disturbances both of the metabolism and of sex hormones probably explain the link between obesity and ovarian cancer High levels of the hunger hormone leptin and of circulating insulin  both more common in the obese  spur an increase in growth factors that promote tumors And accumulated fat can be a powerful producer of estrogen which can fuel some cancer growth
