Imagine youre at home You have cancer You just had another round of chemo and the phone rings My name is Kate Im a health care counselor the gentle voice of the caller says from her cubicle in Cherry Hill NJ This is not a typical telemarketing call She wants to talk with you about your serious illness and eventually if youre ready to think about it what youd like to have happen at the end of your life Kate Schleicher  is a licensed clinical social worker At the start of the call she knows almost as little about you as you know about her Except she has your phone number she knows the name of your insurance carrier the insurance company provided your phone number and she knows that youre pretty sick The main goal with us talking is to make sure that you know whats important to you and that your care aligns with whats important to you Schleicher says so that things go the way you want them to Schleicher is one of  or so counselors working for a company founded in  called   The firm represents roughly a dozen insurance companies nationally that want to when appropriate start discussions with beneficiaries about endoflife care The effort is part of a recent wave of   aimed at fostering these tough conversations Vital Decisions based in New Jersey first reaches out via a letter though patients rarely respond after that the companys counselors essentially coldcall patients to offer counseling on behalf of the beneficiarys insurance plan The phone sessions funded by insurers may span months with each individual session with the patient or family members lasting an hour or so Federal privacy rules   with subcontractors for certain business purposes Vital Decisions handles about  such cases a year When you say that getting better is the most important thing on your mind what does that look like for you Schleicher asks a Rhode Island man in a typical phone call Being able to breathe without an oxygen machine he tells her Schleicher repeats that back then continues Breathing  OK I also hear concern from you that I dont think thats necessarily going to happen Has someone told you that or is that your own feeling The call lasts about  minutes Schleicher asks the man if its OK to follow up in a month or so The hope of this program she says is to build a relationship with the patient over the phone so hell be comfortable discussing his situation and his goals with her and ultimately feel empowered to communicate those goals with others  his family and his doctors  CEO of Vital Decisions believes critical conversations about endoflife care just arent happening often enough Even doctors   he says The accepted norm in terms of the role of the individual whos going through this advanced illness experience is to be passive and be along for the ride not to take charge not to take control and ask for help says Daitz Meanwhile navigating the medical system and figuring out your priorities can become increasingly difficult as your disease progresses he says So when youre faced with a set of choices  none of which represent a really good choice  you become ambivalent To underscore this reality heres a partial transcript of another phone conversation released by Vital Decisions with the patients permission between a patient and Ariana Noto another of the firms counselors I have a malignant brain tumor the man tells Noto Ive been fighting it for over a year now The meds make me dizzy and when Im that dizzy I cant drive Im trapped in the house Im going nuts Thats a lot Im so sorry to hear that she responds Within minutes the man is confiding information he may not have told anyone else His meds make it difficult to function and do simple things like sitting around a table with friends having a beer The two talk about what he understands about the effectiveness of his medicine Hes not sure They go over what he might want to clarify with his doctor You can control how much treatment you want and how you want symptoms to be managed as it does get worse Noto says But I cant talk that way with my son in the room he tells her The man thinks his son would always insist that he keep trying keep fighting Daitz says jumpstarting unbiased honest discussions of endof life care among family members early on could improve the quality of life for patients in the final weeks and months of an advancing illness The topic is sensitive but Daitz says insurers and patients are more open to addressing it now than they used to be And the effort to reimburse doctors when they conduct these conversations  in Congress after an earlier uproar several years ago and   that proponents were trying to authorize death panels Daitz well remembers those earlier unsuccessful attempts to add reimbursement provisions to the Affordable Care Act No one ever accused me of having good timing he says The goal of these conversations Daitz says is to get to what the patient wants That may be the most aggressive care possible or just the easing of symptoms Studies show that when patients are able to have these conversations and understand their various treatment options they often choose to have less aggressive care Daitz says such conversations have another benefit reduced costs By his own rough estimate the companys services have resulted in about  less in health care spending per patient which by extrapolation could translate to about  million less nationally in  Still some people are wary of the companys approach   professor of bioethics at the University of Iowa is concerned that the counseling is solely on the phone  the social worker never actually meets with the patient and family If you dont have enough knowledge about whats actually going on with the patient he says it would actually be irresponsible to pretend to have discussion that depends upon such knowledge Plus endoflife decisions are hard to keep totally neutral he says adding that hed like to see full transparency from insurers and the company to guard against any bias creeping into the sessions  who heads the palliative care division at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center says he thinks that insurers may be wellsituated to address the communication disconnect at least while some doctors and others who deliver care work through their own discomfort and improve their skills He sees companies like Vital Decisions as part of a larger trend    Would I prefer that we live in a health care system where doctors nurses nurse practitioners and social workers who knew the patient were having these conversations Yes he says but adds This is better than what patients have currently been getting
