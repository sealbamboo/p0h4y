Exposure in the first two months of pregnancy to air pollution from traffic sharply increases the risk for birth defects a new study has found Researchers used data from two large studies carried out in eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley in California One has tracked birth defects since  and the other has recorded concentrations of nitrogen dioxide nitrogen oxide carbon monoxide and particulate matter at  locations in the valley since the s The results are   Setting aside defects attributable to other known causes there were  cases of birth defects The researchers adjusted for smoking maternal age and other variables and compared these cases with  healthy control subjects They found that a mother living in areas with the highest levels of carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxide concentrations the top  percent was almost twice as likely to give birth to a child with neural tube defects  severe and often fatal defects of the brain and spinal cord as one living in areas with the lowest concentrations The lead author Amy M Padula a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford acknowledged that in looking at many variables some associations were likely to turn up by chance These results need to be taken in context she said More studies are needed to affirm these associations before we make any clinical recommendations to pregnant women
