CIBOLO Texas  Two months after a yearold Texas girl underwent rare obesity surgery to halt outofcontrol weight gain and ravenous hunger that sent her climbing past  pounds Alexis Shapiro is finding her way to a new normal The redhaired sixthgrader whose story was   has lost  pounds since March  Thats when doctors in Cincinnati took  to reverse the effects of a medical condition triggered by brain surgery that knocked Alexis metabolism haywire and left her body with no way of regulating energy or appetite Her stretchy black pants are baggier now and the purple shirt decorated with a butterfly and turquoise bows is still a size X but it skims over her belly as she sits crosslegged on the family room couch  for the first time in years her mom says She still has a long way to go in the complicated fight against the condition called hypothalamic obesity her doctor and parents cautioned in extended interviews But theres no question that Alexis is getting better Im so happy with the progress shes made said Jenny Shapiro  Alexis mother Shes the giggling happy little girl I remember Alexis herself doesnt say much about her struggles Like any shy preteen she doesnt like to talk to strangers especially about something as personal as her weight But at lunch last week she asked her parents to borrow their cell phones and pulled up two photos  one of her just before the surgery looking heavy and bloated with cheeks so round it was hard to see past them And then she pulled up another photo taken more recently which undeniably showed a thinner happier little girl See Alexis said softly Its a dramatic difference in a short time said Jenny Shapiro who with her husband Ian Shapiro  has spent the past three years fighting  and medical odds to get help for their daughter I was in a desperate situation to save her life Jenny Shapiro said By all accounts theyve succeeded Alexis diabetes has been reversed her blood chemicals are near normal and her dangerously enlarged liver which forced the medical team to   was substantially smaller during a recent scan said Dr Thomas Inge the pediatric obesity expert at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center who has led the girls care Every month that goes by that shes continuing to lose I do a happy dance said Inge who had estimated that Alexis might shed  pounds in the first year after surgery I would say that shes really right on track he added Despite the progress neither Inge nor Alexis parents think shes home free Like half of the young patients who undergo surgery for the benign brain tumors called craniopharyngiomas Alexis pituitary gland and hypothalamus were permanently damaged impairing her bodys ability to regulate itself Even after the gastric sleeve weightloss surgery that reduced the size of her stomach by  percent Alexis could lose weight more slowly now  or even plateau Inge said These kids dont have the same rapid weight loss that we see in kids who are not hypothalamic Inge said This past week in fact the number on the scale stayed the same   pounds  leaving Alexis very disappointed and her mother concerned too I knew when it started that this was going to be a journey Jenny Shapiro said I got really excited thinking this might work Alexis has had to cope with a small leak now nearly healed that let some of the contents of her stomach spill into her abdominal cavity That meant she had to stop eating solid foods and use a feeding tube for several weeks Inge said Even more concerning shes starting to feel constant excessive hunger again a condition known as hyperphagia It was so intense after the brain surgery that Jenny Shapiro had to lock the kitchen cabinets to prevent Alexis from eating a whole jar of peanut butter at a sitting for instance Its nowhere near that bad now and one result of the surgery appears to be better regulation of the link between the gut and the brain centers that control feelings of appetite and satiety Inge said But Jenny Shapiro said shes seeing old habits start to return Shell start asking about dinner at breakfast Jenny Shapiro said When she wasnt doing that it was like freedom Alexis can eat about a  cup of food every three hours On a recent Wednesday her menu included part of a container of yogurt in the morning part of a salad at lunch a plate of fresh watermelon cubes in the afternoon and a small portion of taco salad bowls with the rest of the family for dinner Curbing the hunger and boosting weight loss will require a variety of tools Inge said Further surgery such as the originally planned gastric bypass procedure could be an option So could medication such as the stimulant dextroamphetamine which research shows has been successfully used to induce weight loss and boost energy in other kids with hypothalamic obesity For now Inge is advising Jenny Shapiro to track Alexis food intake carefully and to boost her meals with supplemental protein and fiber Shell go back to Cincinnati in June to check her progress None of this is an easy fix he cautioned and its all far more complicated than weight loss alone We sincerely want to work with her to use every trick in the book Inge said I told her mom Dont feel like were out of angles here Alexis plight has drawn local national and international media attention She received hundreds of cards emails and letters from people who heard her story including those who contributed  to a site to help pay for surgery when the familys health insurer rejected the request The military insurance company TRICARE later reversed the decision and there have been no problems since Jenny Shapiro said The family has used the donated money to help offset lost income  Jenny Shapiro had to quit her doggrooming job  and to pay for medical travel and other expenses They hope to start a foundation for other kids with hypothalamic obesity she said Out in public there are fewer stares and whispers these days partly because Alexis is smaller and perhaps because more people may have heard about her struggles When shes stopped in a grocery store or airport now its most often by someone who wants to offer a hug For Alexis its been nice for her to hear all these encouraging messages and to go through some lifechanging things but to know there are people who are on her side said Jenny Shapiro who balances care of Alexis with her other children Kayley  and Ethan  Alexis is actively engaged in her own progress her mom said She goes to the nearby YMCA most days where she walks on the treadmill and does other exercises Shes working toward finishing a kilometer race sometime this summer  a goal that was Alexis own idea Jenny Shapiro said She has been walking her little tail off she said She just amazes me with her determination
