Federal health officials backtracked Wednesday saying an Illinois man believed to be infected with the mysterious new MERS virus didnt have signs of the disease after all A more sensitive blood test came back negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome in the man who was originally thought to have been infected by the first US MERS case an Indiana health worker who contracted the virus in Saudi Arabia officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said After completing additional and more definitive laboratory tests our experts have now concluded that the Indiana patient did not spread the virus to the Illinois patient Dr David Swerdlow whos leading the CDCs MERS response told reporters The infection would have been the first instance of persontoperson spread of MERS in the US a potentially worrisome development for the virus that surfaced in  and has  and killed  worldwide MERS is believed to have mortality rate of  percent experts say CDC officials originally said the two men who are business associates met twice including one minute facetoface session and shook hands potentially spreading the MERS virus Health officials had said the Illinois man tested negative for active infection and had no symptoms of illness but that blood tests showed he had developed antibodies that were apparent evidence of past infection with MERS said Dr David Swerdlow who is leading the CDCs response to the virus Now however CDC officials say that the bloodwork relies on three separate tests and that while the first two showed evidence of MERS antibodies the third more definitive test which takes longer came back negative MERS is also known as MERS coronavirus or MERSCoV Based on the results of these tests which require careful interpretation CDC has concluded that the Illinois resident was not previously infected with MERSCoV officials said CDC officials appeared to defend the premature release of potentially alarming information While we never want to cause undue concern among those who have had contact with a MERS patient it is our job to move quickly when there is a potential public health threat Swerdlow said in a statement Because there is still much we dont know about this virus we will continue to err on the side of caution when responding to and investigating cases of MERS in this country Swerdlow said the CDC acted quickly in notifying the public and potential contacts of the Illinois man in the interest of transparency and public safety We really cant wait until we have all the tests back he said The third test known as the neutralizing antibody assay not only takes longer but relies on live MERS virus so must be conducted in a highcontainment lab a cumbersome and timeconsuming prospect officials added CDC officials originally had said the Illinois man was not counted as an active case but could have been an example of silent MERS infection in people who dont develop symptoms of the disease Early research suggests that about  percent of the cases show no signs of active infection but have MERS antibodies in their blood The Illinois man has been cooperating with CDC and local health officials wearing a mask and limiting contact with crowds Swerdlow said he couldnt describe the mans reaction when he found out he didnt have MERS Wednesdays announcement came a week after health officials said the   a yearold Florida man had tested negative for the disease and was discharged from the hospital In addition followup testing on all  health workers exposed to the Florida MERS patient showed that they didnt contract the virus health officials said Theyve since returned to work Tests now show that  health care workers who cared for the   plus household contacts didnt catch the virus either The man felt ill after returning from Saudi Arabia on April  and was confirmed to have MERS on May  CDC officials said Along the way he took two international flights and a minute bus ride So far none of his fellow passengers has evidence of the virus Swerdlow said The good news CDC officials said is that the lack of infection in the Indiana man underscores their belief that MERS is not easily spread in community settings and that there is very little danger to the general public Its a little reassuring that this gentleman was not a case Swerdlow said
