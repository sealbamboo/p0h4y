Almost every day it seems theres a new use for D printing In medicine the printers are already making   hearing aid cases and parts of human ears But the materials used in some D printing processes could be toxic to humans particularly if the products get inside the body So researchers have been looking for ways found a way to replace some of the bad stuff with naturally occurring   or vitamin B Riboflavin is found in lots of food including green veggies nuts and fish Our cells arent programmed to reject it which could make it handy for use in D printed medical implants   or   to build custom body parts in the lab The researchers focused on a D printing technique called   which can produce finely detailed microscopic structures The D printer uses lasers to transform a potion of lightsensitive chemicals into a solid structure But some of the chemicals in that potion can be bad for us says biomedical engineer   one of the researchers behind the new technique And if they leach out of the material they can cause problems he says The researchers from the joint   department at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill say that their new material appears to hold up pretty well though they are looking into whether they can improve its durability Narayan tells Shots that while this technology isnt ready for human use it could be before long I dont think anyone  or  years ago thought that youd be making hearing aid shells or  dental devices using D printing he says So far the researchers have tested the material with cells taken from cows They   their findings in the journal   Before testing the material in animals or humans they plan to refine it further Narayan says many D printing techniques originated in the electronics industry where it doesnt matter as much if something is slightly toxic The challenge is figuring out how to adapt the techniques to the medical field
