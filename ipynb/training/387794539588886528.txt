Physical activity  even including walking can substantially reduce a womans risk of developing breast cancer encouraging new science shows in part it seems by changing how her body deals with estrogen   Evidence has been accumulating for some time that exercise reduces the risk of many types of cancer including breast malignancies But the physiological mechanisms involved have not been well characterized nor have scientists known what kinds and amounts of exercise provide the surest protection  Which makes the results of two recently published studies of considerable interest to women and those of the remaining gender who love us  In the newest and largest of these studies   researchers with the Epidemiology Research Program at the American Cancer Society began by turning to a huge trove of data maintained by the cancer society The database includes detailed health and medical information from more than  postmenopausal women age  to  who enrolled in the study in the early s For almost two decades they completed followup questionnaires every two years  The questionnaires asked among other things for detailed descriptions of how the women spent their leisure time and in particular whether and how they exercised About  percent reported never exercising A few said that they exercised vigorously and often typically by running swimming or playing singles tennis  But most walked usually at a pleasant pace of about  miles per hour About half of the group reported that such strolling was their only form of exercise Over the course of the study  of the women enrolled developed breast cancer When the researchers crosstabulated exercise regimens and medical records they found that those women who walked at least seven hours per week usually distributed as an hour a day had  percent less risk of developing breast cancer than those who walked for fewer than three hours per week a significant reduction in risk  Meanwhile those few women who were the most active sweating vigorously for up to  hours each week realized an even greater benefit with  percent less risk of developing breast cancer than those women who exercised the least  These risk reductions held true the researchers determined whether or not the women were overweight and whether or not they were using hormone replacement therapy  We think these results are very encouraging said Alpa V Patel a senior epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and senior author of the study Walking is an easy inexpensive type of exercise Almost everyone can do it And for this population of postmenopausal women it provided a very significant reduction in the risk of breast cancer  Another intriguing study that looked at younger women   helps to elucidate how exercise may reduce breast cancer risk For this experiment scientists from the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota divided several hundred sedentary premenopausal women into two groups One group remained sedentary while the other began a moderate aerobic exercise program that continued five times a week for  weeks  At the start and end of the four months the researchers collected urine and tested it for levels of estrogen and various estrogen metabolites the substances that are formed when estrogen is broken down by the body Past studies have found that a particular ratio of these metabolites in a womans urine indicates a heightened risk of breast cancer during her lifetime  In this study those volunteers who remained sedentary showed no changes in the ratios of their estrogen metabolites after four months  But among the group that began exercising the levels of one of the metabolites fell and another rose shifting the ratio in ways that are believed to indicate less chance of breast cancer The women also lost body fat and gained muscle  This finding although derived from younger women has implications for women of any age As Dr Patel pointed out postmenopausal women produce estrogen although in much smaller doses and primarily from fat cells and not the ovaries  Exercise by altering the ratio of estrogen metabolites and also reducing total body fat may change the internal makeup of a womans body and make it harder for breast cancer to take hold  But of course exercise is not a panacea Some of the women in Dr Patels study who dutifully walked every day developed breast cancer Many who rarely if ever exercised did not  There is still a very great deal that we dont know about how cancer of any kind starts or why it doesnt Dr Patel said  But physical activity and especially walking are so simple and so accessible to most women she continued And statistically they do seem to reduce breast cancer risk So why not
