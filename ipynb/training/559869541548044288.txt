Alcohol is responsible for about  deaths in the US each year according to a new government report on the toll of excessive drinking The study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comes as police investigate an alleged drunk driver who struck and killed two people early Thursday morning at the South by Southwest festival in Austin Texas Another  people were injured after the driver went the wrong way on a oneway street in an apparent attempt to evade an officer who had pulled him over Austin police Chief Art Acevedo said officials planned to charge the driver with two counts of capital murder and multiple counts of aggravated assault The CDC report calculated that fatalities due to drunk drivers and more than  other alcoholrelated causes of death are responsible for wiping out about  million years of potential life each year Americans between  and  were victims in the majority of alcoholrelated deaths so many of them would have lived for many more years if alcohol hadnt killed them either directly or indirectly The research team from the CDC and representatives from health departments in  states used information from the CDCs AlcoholRelated Disease Impact database The database tracks  causes of disease and death that are influenced by alcohol to some degree For instance alcoholic liver disease fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol poisoning are among the diseases considered  attributable to drinking while liver cancer hypertension stroke and accidents may be partially related to alcohol use Even causes of morbidity and mortality that are as little as  attributable to excessive drinking are tracked in the database The researchers from the  states  California Florida Michigan Nebraska New Mexico North Carolina North Dakota South Dakota Utah Virginia and Wisconsin  each examined data from their own state for the years  to  They counted up the cases of disease and death in each of the  categories and multiplied them by the fraction for which alcohol was responsible They also looked up the life expectancy for each person who died based on their age gender and race or ethnicity to tally the number of years of life lost Overall the median death rate due to alcoholrelated causes was about  per  people after adjusting for the age of victims Half the states had a rate higher than that and half had a rate that was lower The lowest alcoholrelated death rate among the  states was in Utah  deaths per  people and the highest was in New Mexico  deaths per  people Senior citizens who were at least  years old had the highest rate of alcoholrelated deaths at about  per  people Meanwhile those under the age of  suffered only  alcoholrelated deaths per  people Men were more than twice as likely as women to die of an alcoholrelated cause by a margin of  per  to  per  The researchers also noted that while the majority of alcoholrelated deaths involved nonLatino whites the highest death rate was seen among Native Americans and Alaska Natives at  deaths per  people The statistics highlight the ongoing public health impact of excessive drinking in the United States the researchers concluded The casualty figures could be reduced by implementing policies that make alcohol more expensive and that reduce the density of liquor stores and other outlets that sell alcohol The researchers also recommended that retailers be held responsible for the damage that ensues after selling alcohol to minors or to people who are already intoxicated The study was published Thursday in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report    and like   on Facebook
