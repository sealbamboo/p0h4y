A preliminary study in the New England Journal of Medicine raises a new worry about electronic cigarettes  exposure to formaldehyde Under certain conditions taking  puffs from an ecigarette would expose a user to about  times as much formaldehyde as he or she would get from smoking a single tobacco cigarette according to the    is the pungent chemical that was used to preserve the frog you dissected in your high school biology class Its used as an industrial disinfectant and as an ingredient in permanentpress fabrics plywood glues and other household products according to the National Cancer Institute It is also formed when the propylene glycol and glycerol in ecigarette liquids and oxygen are heated together The World Health Organizations   says formaldehyde can cause leukemia and   The US Environmental Protection Agency considers the chemical a   In experiments at Portland State University researchers used a tank system type of electronic cigarette to produce nicotine vapor The eliquid vapor was captured in a tube and analyzed using a technique called   Each sample consisted of  puffs of vapor at  to  seconds per puff collected over  minutes When the ecigarette was used on the low voltage setting of  volts the researchers didnt detect any formaldehyde in the vapor However when the device was on the high voltage setting of  volts they measured an average of  micrograms of formaldehyde per sample Based on these results the research team estimated that an ecigarette user who vaped  milliliters of eliquid per day would breathe in at least  milligrams of formaldehyde The actual daily exposure is probably higher they wrote because their experiments failed to capture all of the vapor the ecigarette produced For the sake of comparison a    in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology estimated that a person who smoked a pack of  cigarettes would inhale  milligrams of formaldehyde in the process The researchers calculated that the lifetime cancer risk incurred by inhaling formaldehyde would be  to  times higher for longterm ecigarette users than for longterm tobacco smokers Proponents of electronic cigarettes were quick to criticize the study for testing the devices under conditions that dont reflect actual use If a person were to take second puffs on a high voltage setting they would experience a very harsh and awful taste Bill Godshall an advisor to the Consumer Advocates for Smokefree Alternatives Assn said in a statement distributed by the American Vaping Assn Gregory Conley the groups president added that ecigarette users take shorter puffs as they increase the voltage on their devices These are not settings that reallife vapers actually use he said But study coauthor   a chemistry professor and expert on cigarette smoke dangers at Portland State University said the line between ecigarettes and tobacco cigarettes was growing fuzzier by the day No one should assume ecigarettes are safe he said in a statement For conventional cigarettes once people become addicted it takes numerous years of smoking to result in a high risk of lung cancer and other severe disease it will probably take five to  years to start to see whether ecigarettes are truly as safe as some people believe them to be
