When shopping for a safe car for their teens parents might want to aim for the newest model they can afford a new study suggests Researchers found that that almost half of the teenage drivers killed on the roads in the past few years were driving vehicles that were  or more years old and lacking key safety features found in newer models according to the study published online in the journal Injury Prevention We know that many parents cannot afford a new vehicle said the studys lead author Anne McCartt senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Our message to parents is to get the most safety they can afford McCartt and her coauthor analyzed data from  to  from the US Fatality Analysis Reporting System which included information on  drivers ages  to  and  drivers ages  to  Among the teens who died  percent were in a car  percent in a mini or small car and  percent in a midsize or larger car Most of the teen drivers who were fatally injured   percent  were in vehicles that were at least  years old while  percent were in vehicles  to  years old For comparison fatally injured teens were almost twice as likely as their middleaged counterparts to be driving a car that was  to  years old The most startling statistic Nearly half of the teens who died   percent  were in a vehicle that was at least  years old What the researchers dont know is what percentage of teens drive older vehicles So they cant say that the data prove that older vehicles are increasing the risk of death in teenagers Still theres good reason to suspect that teens would be safer in newer cars says Tony Fabio an assistant professor of epidemiology in the graduate school of public health and director of the Center for Injury Research Community Action at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Fabio is unaffiliated with the new study We know that teens are less likely than adults to be wearing seat belts and that may be partially because they are driving older cars in which the belts may not work as well Fabio said And you have to think about that in the context of an older car that might not have an air bag And while the study doesnt prove that older cars are less safe it does suggest they are Fabio says adding almost any major public health victory started out with a study that just suggested something wasnt safe Ultimately McCartt said though newer model cars tend to have more safety features protecting your teens is not as straight forward as just steering clear of older vehicles We did find older vehicles that met our safety criteria she said Still its a rare older vehicle that has electronic stability control  an important safety feature that helps drivers keep control in extreme maneuvers McCartt said Thats something that is standard on new cars since it was a requirement starting in  she added To help parents figure out which vehicle might be best for their teens the IIHS came up with a list of safe cars which it posted on its website
