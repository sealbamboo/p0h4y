Estrogen the female hormone is a lot more important to men than even many doctors think according to a surprising new study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston found that its actually a lack of estrogen thats most responsible for the accumulation of body fat plaguing men with low testosterone levels raising their risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes Low estrogen is also a big contributor to the sexual dysfunction and low libido usually blamed solely on low testosterone The research could change the way doctors prescribe hormones for men experts suggest Its a blockbuster a mind bender for the general public and many scientists Brad Anawalt an endocrinologist and vice chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington who was not involved with the study told NBC News   Men make about  percent of their estrogen through the conversion of testosterone into an estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase So when testosterone drops so does estrogen Low testosterone itself is linked to declines in lean muscle mass muscle size and strength the study found  That low estrogen weakens male bones as it does in postmenopausal women has long been known But most effects of low T more properly called hypogonadism have been blamed on low testosterone itself helping fuel a more than  percent spike in prescriptions from  to  Despite concerns of possible harmful side effects the percentage of American men over  receiving testosterone approximately tripled to nearly  percent of the population from  to  according to a study published this year in JAMA Internal Medicine    A normal range for testosterone  between  and  nanograms per deciliter of blood  is based on the mean levels found in the general population But the study revealed that a healthy range should really depend upon the individual body tissue or system Its not onesizefitsall  As testosterone drops  beginning about age   the first thing affected is sexual function due to both low testosterone and estrogen Anawalt explained Further drops begin to affect fat metabolism due to low estrogen Finally with very low testosterone muscle mass and strength fall  Currently a man with a measure of  and complaining of lower muscle mass and strength might be given a testosterone prescription Thanks to advertising we think of testosterone like sprinkling on table salt Anawalt said  But now if he has a T level of  this study suggests that his loss of strength is not related to testosterone level hes just age  Anawalt said Conversely a man with a level at  but who has a different problem might need more testosterone endocrinologist Joel Finkelstein who led the study explained  If you come in and I say Oh God fats accumulating on this guy its not enough That fat is accumulating because of a drop in estrogen  Then a doctor may wish to prescribe extra testosterone as a way to boost estrogen Finkelstein said The study used  healthy men between  and  years old All the men were given a drug to stop their production of testosterone and estrogen and divided into two groups Some men in one group were then given a placebo testosterone replacement product while others were given increasing doses of the real thing  The men in the other group were given the same replacement dosages but also a drug to inhibit aromatase so their bodies would make almost no estrogen  Finkelsteins team then tracked the way the subjects bodies reacted over a period of  weeks by using scans surveys and strength tests  The men who received replacement doses of testosterone but whose estrogen production was blocked showed significant increases in three key body fat measures as well as erectile dysfunction and low sexual desire When you lose estrogen its all bad Finkelstein said With estrogen loss you get fat accumulation loss of libido bone loss  Because those effects are related to osteoporosis diabetes cardiovascular disease the billion dollar question is whether older men should be routinely given testosterone replacement to increase both their T levels and estrogen levels as part of preventive medicine Finkelstein said  What do we do about men as they age into their s s s Is it helpful or harmful Both Neither We dont know Finkelstein added The Mass General researchers plan to repeat the study using groups of older men to find out Both Finkelstein and Anawalt cited the Womens Health Initiative a huge study that found unexpected risks with hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women as a cautionary tale  However Anawalt suggested doctors would be hardpressed to prove prescribing testosterone for most older men at a dosage enough to raise it above normal is risky If we cannot prove harm and the potential benefit is sex function perhaps lower fat accumulation a number of doctors and patients are going to glom onto that and say it sounds like a good plan he said Still Anawalt added I predict a number of us would be leery about it   is a frequent contributor to NBC News and a coauthor of
