 Want to eat whatever you want stay thin and never exercise That promise is what researchers from the University of California Irvine say might one day become a reality  in about  years estimates   In a mouse study researchers found that a brain chemical with characteristics similar to an active cannabinoid ingredient in   helped regulate the bodys   When scientists tweaked a protein in the mices brains that turned down levels of the endocannabinoids compound AG hence the marijuana comparison the mices metabolisms skyrocketed The mice were able to eat highfat diets without exercising and while maintaining normal blood pressure with no increased risk of heart disease or   researchers reported in the March issue of the journal   The researchers explained in an university release that the mice were in a hypermetabolic state We discovered that these mice were resistant to obesity because they burned fat calories much more efficiently than normal mice do explained Daniele Piomelli PhD a professor of pharmacology and a researcher on the study in the release We had known that endocannabinoids play a critical role in cell energy regulation but this is the first time we found a target where this occurs Specifically the mice stayed thin because their   which exists in all mammals became hyperactive and was converted into heat much more rapidly Brown fat naturally burns calories only when the body is in a cold environment recent research published in the   found To create a similar fatburning effect in humans scientists would need to create a drug that blocks AG production in the brain which they dont anticipate will happen for years
