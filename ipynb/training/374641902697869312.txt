Turns out molly is a pretty popular lady these days According to the Drug Enforcement Administration molly is the powder or crystal form of MDMA  or  Methylenedioxymethamphetamine a chemical drug most commonly known for its use in the pressed pill Ecstasy Unlike Ecstasy which has a reputation for being   from caffeine to methamphetamine molly  a name shortened from molecule  is thought of as pure MDMA  The   an illegal Schedule  controlled substance considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted use in medical treatment Molly is abundant at music festivals  if you know where to look The third and final day of New Yorks Electric Zoo music festival   after two concertgoers died and at least four others were hospitalized due to what is believed to be MDMArelated causes police said it is unclear whether the drug was used in Ecstasy pills or in its pure form of molly  Last year at Miamis Ultra Music Festival fliers littered the landscape mentioning her name like missing child posters Have you seen molly And when Madonna took to the stage to introduce an artist the pop star asked the audience How many people in this crowd have seen molly A slew of cheers answered though Madonna   shed been referring to a song not to an illegal drug Hiphop artists claim they know her  shes casually mentioned by  Chainz in the Nicki Minaj track Beez In the Trap by Childish Gambino in his song Unnecessary by Kanye West in Mercy by Danny Brown in Die Like a Rockstar Even Miley Cyrus is familiar although the line We like to party dancing with molly was bleeped out in her most recent performance of   on the MTV Video Music Awards It seems the drug is on the minds of many But questions about who  or what  molly really is remain An experience with molly starts with a bitter taste users say which is soon forgotten as the high kicks in It felt like everything was amplified It felt euphoric  almost like a crazy adrenaline rush for a long time said Evan a young professional working in Michigan You feel a lot more loose and comfortable in your environment said recent Georgia high school graduate Jessica whod never used molly until the concert last summer  a friends recommendation convinced her to give molly a try And then usually after a few hours  depending on the dose that is taken  of dancing and moving and talking the trip comes to an end After it was over it wasnt like a depression but it was like Aw man I wish I felt that way again  Jessica said MDMA acts as a stimulant and a psychedelic   After being inhaled eaten or parachuted  folded into a tissue and swallowed  molly ushers in euphoria It floods users brains with neurotransmitters serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine making them feel elated empathic and full of energy  MDMA first found popularity in the form of Ecstasy as the drug of choice among ravers at underground nightclubs in the early s But when questions arose over the purity of Ecstasy  the drug was often mixed with other ingredients    people turned their attention to a purer form Nathan Messer chairman of the board for the nonprofit organization   which promotes health and safety within the nightclub community told CNN in  You knew you were getting the real thing and nothing but the real thing he said Because people knew that molly was trustworthy it became the goto thing Molly is a street name that has been in use for about a decade Messer said Although it originally referred simply to MDMA the title molly is now given to a variety of legal substances with similar chemical structures Messer said MDPV methylone mephedrone and butylone  different substances or drugs  are often sold as molly while users such as Evan have heard countless rumors of mollys makeup including that its created from fertilizer Molly users tend be between the ages of  and  Pax Prentiss cofounder and CEO of Southern Californias Passages rehabilitation centers told CNN last year Exact numbers detailing mollys use are unclear  studies conducted by US health organizations such as the   usually only quantify use of MDMA or Ecstasy not molly specifically But molly appears to be gaining popularity As the owner of a film company that shoots music videos and festivals Evan often sees molly in use at shows And even for someone who doesnt consider himself to be an avid drug user he said he found it easy to get his hands on some molly All I had to do was text a friend Evan said Because MDMA has long been associated with raves the mainstream popularity of electronic dance music also contributed to mollys rising reputation DanceSafes Messer said In  about  kilograms of molly worth at least  were recovered after a   of a largescale drug trafficking operation based in Syracuse New York a college town The bust led to charges against  people  Penn State University Police Chief Tyrone Parham told CNN he and his officers first heard anecdotes about molly in  Parham said its hard to get a real idea of how many students have used molly Officers can catch users of marijuana  the most common drug on Penn States campus according to Parham  in the act because of the drugs conspicuous odor But its difficult to know if a student has misused molly because officers are often called after the drug has already been ingested   if they are even called at all I think its one of those things not just here but across the country thats hard to get an understanding of how prevalent it is he said Some consider the name picked for this white powder a clever marketing strategy Molly carries both the innocent appeal of the girl next door and the implication that the drug is always pure MDMA But because the chemical makeup of molly is often altered taking the drug is dangerous DEA spokesman Rusty Payne told CNN in  Suppliers are making it look like something that is safe and easy to take but in many cases youre playing Russian roulette Payne said And although MDMA tastes smells and affects you differently than other drugs would without having experience with each molly variation theres no easy way to tell if the substance you take is pure Messer said But even as its pure form molly MDMA can be dangerous The DEA sees MDMA supplied from Asia Canada even the Netherlands You have no idea the lab environment these chemicals or substances were produced in Payne said If they knew where things were produced they might think twice Some drug users have said they prefer molly over other illicit drugs because of the limited negative side effects theyve experienced Honestly if I were to pick a drug out of anything else to do I would pick molly Evan said Molly has a lot to do with loud music and seeing lights  getting excited about seeing something thats already cool and making it cooler Because prolonged use eventually begins to diminish users highs the risk of physical addiction is low said Prentiss the Passages rehab CEO MDMA addictions make up less than  of the companys clientele he said  And hospital visits spurred by MDMA use appear to be few and far between Less than  of emergency room visits in  were because of MDMA   which is part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration In fact with its moodenhancing properties MDMA is even being studied as a   But the Drug Abuse Warning Networks study also found that from  to  there was a  increase in the number of emergency room visits involving MDMA taken alone or in combination with pharmaceuticals alcohol or both Theodore Bania a medical toxicologist and emergency medicine physician at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital in New York said although many of the people who take molly dont end up in the emergency room some users experience side effects that land them in the hospital MDMA even in its pure form can produce elevated heart rates and distortion of thought processes causing users not to realize their rising body temperature or fading stamina as they continue to party Combining MDMA with alcohol or other drugs can also be the cause of its more serious side effects  Bania frequently sees patients who have complications from MDMA ranging from dehydration and exhaustion to more severe side effects such as hyperthermia seizures electrolyte abnormalities cardiac episodes and comas MDMA also depletes the body of some of its neurotransmitters which can lead to a decreased mood about a day or two after using the drug Prentiss said he has even seen the drug lead to longterm depression Users who havent had exposure to mollys serious negative side effects sometimes think of it as a safer drug But Hart the Columbia associate professor said claims that any drug is safe are ridiculous A lot has to do with the doses people take Hart said As you increase the dose over an extended period of time you can expect to see some negative effects Thats a general rule the public really needs to understand Hart said he believes accurate education not law enforcement is key to minimizing the risks of illicit drugs such as molly Because so many young people have already tried molly he said experts need to make sure they are being realistic about the dangers of its use What weve done and what we consistently do is we include people that exaggerate the harms Hart said Kids are not listening because theyve already had the experience  They think they should reject everything were saying because were not being accurate and they know it Mollys rise in popularity can in part be attributed to the current culture Tammy Anderson a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware told CNN in  Anderson has studied the use of drugs including MDMA in nightclubs Were at a place here historically that people dont think marijuana is a drug anymore Although marijuana like molly remains on the DEAs list of Schedule  controlled substances its a drug that many citizens think of not only as minor but as one that should be legal And  states have legalized it for medical use There is now greater permissiveness and lax attitudes toward drugs such as marijuana so people move on to other substances such as molly and give themselves permission to use them Anderson said We are moving into a postwar on drugs era Were seeing a softening of drug laws and a softening against drugs especially among young people For now the DEA is more focused on fighting the abuse of prescription medications such as Oxycontin and Valium But as admirers plaster posters at concerts asking Have you seen molly officials can only hope she stays missing
