Chances are youre familiar with the phrase a wellbalanced diet Two to three servings of meat poultry or fish three to five servings of vegetables  you know   When we talk about being wellbalanced today were usually talking about the specific nutrients we put into our body While this might seem like a relatively new development  a product of the past  years of fitness programs and diet regimes  as it turns out this idea goes back much further In the th and th centuries and even into the th century American colonists and Englishmen alike were concerned with maintaining a balanced diet But to them wellbalanced meant something entirely different from what it does now In her book   Trudy Eden writes that people at the time and for almost   thought of themselves as being made up of four humors or four basic qualities  hot cold moist and dry The goal was to keep those four qualities in balance Because the thinking went everything about you was wrapped up in this balance  your health your personality your temperament  everything And what was the easiest way to keep your qualities in balance Food And they were very prescriptive about it as you can see from the above sample of a second course in the month of January prescribed by Mary Smith of Newcastle in her  book   and included in Edens book If people were sad or melancholy they were considered cold So to help balance out their temperament they could eat warming foods Roasted pheasant might serve as a pickmeup whereas a cold soup might whack you more out of balance An angry person also known as hottempered could counter this tendency by sitting still and drinking cooling beverages and foods These would not necessarily be foods with a cool temperature but rather foods possessing large amounts of phlegm or melancholy  foods like fish goat and legumes A sad person however considered to be leaning toward or clearly melancholy could eat warming food and get more exercise  though only a moderate amount lest he lose precious moisture Eden says By maintaining a diet that kept you in balance you could quite literally make yourself a better person At least that was the popular thinking of Europeans This philosophy did have a few obvious drawbacks For one thing it required that you have a large variety of food to choose from While variety may not have been an issue for the wealthy it was   for poor or enslaved people And because they couldnt get a variety of foods they couldnt improve themselves They were stuck It was a selfperpetuating cycle that ensured the powerful stayed in power So while its easy to laugh about a hottempered person desperately seeking phlegmy foods we too like to think that our food says something about who we are and what our place in society is The mere act of eating healthful foods   that we have certain personality traits like selfcontrol Think about that the next time you pass up a Big Mac and fries for a wellbalanced soup and salad
