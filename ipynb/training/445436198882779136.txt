Despite record numbers of patients accident and emergency departments are struggling to recruit and retain staff the College of Emergency Medicine says So why are doctors leaving to find work elsewhere The works better the hours are better the pays better the trainings better works more fun and outside of work its more fun too Dr John Thompson  trained and worked as a consultant in the AE department at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton but now works in emergency medicine in Fremantle Western Australia He has no regrets Since his move in  he lives a threeminute walk from the beach gets leave when he wants it and has a vastly superior working environment Unfortunately for the NHS Dr Thompson is not alone in his decision to head to Australia for work The number of UK medical graduates working in Australian emergency departments has risen  in recent years  from  in  to  in  according to the Australian College of Emergency Medicine Many more AE doctors are joining other parts of the NHS leaving emergency departments facing a serious problem with recruitment and retention Prof Keith Willett NHS Englands director for acute care told Panorama that while there will always be doctors available we may have a situation where emergency medicine doctors are insufficient NHS figures show a million extra people have attended AEs in England since  and the UK College of Emergency Medicine says the shortfall in the number of doctors is having serious consequences Theres a lack of about  to  registrars around the country That equates to three quarters of a million patient consultations per year that cant happen because those doctors dont exist its president Dr Clifford Mann told Panorama For those heading to Australia for work the reasons are clear says Dr Thompson The pressures are less in Australia and the emphasis primarily for my working day is on patient care There are fewer of the targets and demands from managers that make working in the NHS just too hard he says Increasingly he meets doctors who arrive in Australia planning to stay six months but then decide to stay on I would say that more than  now are asking how to get on to the emergency medicine training scheme because they think thats better in Australia he says Within the NHS itself there can also be a feeling that life as an AE doctor is too pressured Dr Alex Muirhead  was an AE consultant at Stockton hospital until last December Now she is a local GP instead I used to love working in AE but it got to the stage where I just didnt enjoy my job and I didnt want to spend another  years working as an AE consultant I dont think you get an awful lot of respect from the rest of the hospital To some extent AE is now seen as everyones dumping ground While she feels some guilt at leaving a sinking ship Dr Muirhead says urgent reform is needed to keep staff The staffing problems could mean that AE departments will cease to work properly the College of Emergency Medicine told Panorama My real fear if we dont do something about recruitment and retention in emergency medicine is that you will turn up in an ambulance to an emergency department and there will be no doctors there to see you says Dr Mann While he does not think things will get that bad Prof Willett agrees that action is needed What we will have to do in the short term is to look at how we use the wider skills that are available in the hospital to look at the extended role of nurses of paramedics of physicians assistants The Department of Health declined to be interviewed
