Malaria researchers have developed what they consider a crucial advance Simple and fast tests that can tell when parasites have become resistant to the frontline drug against malaria Taken together these tests give humans a new tool to counter the malaria parasites ability to outwit every drug thats ever been devised against it The tests will help scientists and health workers with several critical tasks not possible before Tension has mounted recently as pockets of artemisininresistant malaria   in Cambodia Thailand and Myanmar Many experts think its only a matter of time before the problem spreads to Africa where most of malarias devastation is concentrated For almost five years theres been a recognition that artemisinin was losing its punch in Southeast Asia says   of the University of Washington who wasnt involved in the new research The only way to measure that drugresistance was to give the drug and then monitor patients blood every six hours for two or three days Sibley tells Shots Thats very difficult to do Patients hate it It requires people to interpret many malaria slides Its amazingly expensive and laborious Tracking the spread of artemisininresistant malaria across the landscape using the previous method was logistically impossible A group from the US National Institutes of Health the Institut Pasteur in France and the Cambodian National Malaria Center devised two different tests to simplify and accelerate the detection of artemisinin resistance They   their findings Tuesday in   One test quickly determines how a malaria parasite from a specific patient responds to artemisinin It involves taking a blood sample and treating it with artemisinin in a test tube for six hours The tester washes out the drug incubates the treated parasites for another  hours then counts the number that have survived It cant be done in a mud hut but it can be done in a fieldbased setting where one can culture the parasites says study author   of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases You need a reliable electricity source and an incubator The second test is more elaborate Its designed to isolate the malaria parasite at an early stage of its life cycle  the socalled   At this stage malaria parasites are uniquely susceptible to artemisinin So the test can determine how these immature forms are becoming resistant to the drug To do that researchers have to grow various stages of the parasite in test tubes for a couple of weeks They take the most mature stages and use them to infect fresh human red blood cells Within a few hours they have newly hatched ringstage parasites that can be exposed to artemisinin Those ringstage parasites that become resistant can be studied to determine the genetic mechanisms that protect them against the drug These earlystage resistant parasites will also be valuable in testing new antimalaria drugs When you pull out the parasites and test the ring stage only then can you confidently say This is a resistant parasite and that isnt  Fairhurst tells Shots Ive already had a lot of people very interested in obtaining truly resistant ringstage parasites to test different drugs against Its been very difficult to identify genetic markers of malaria drug resistance says Sibley scientific director of a group called   There was no way to isolate the parasites in the lab and say I know these are resistant  she explains Now we can see which molecular patterns relate to resistance Having genetic markers of artemisinin resistance she says will also make it much easier to track the spread of resistant parasites You can stick somebodys finger get some DNA from the parasites and look for resistance markers Sibley says So you could do surveillance in Myanmar where it appears these resistant parasites have been moving Then youd know how big an area we have to worry about Then health workers could start at the outside of the area and work inward she says to treat infected patients and eliminate parasitecarrying mosquitoes Thats the strategy that worked to eliminate smallpox she says The new technology has already paid off in Cambodia Researchers discovered a man who was carrying an artemesinresistant malaria parasite in eastern Cambodia where resistance hadnt been seen before
