A tense moment at a meeting of my support group convinced me that cancer patients have wildly divergent needs for information about their condition This is especially true when the disease is considered chronic rather than curable   Judy had just returned from California where she took the opportunity to get a second opinion about her latestage uterine cancer Elated by the doctors unexpected recommendations Judy repeated them to us He had congratulated her on completing her first round of rigorous treatment and discouraged her from planning the next There will be time enough at recurrence to look into suitable protocols he told her And why subject yourself to so many blood tests and scans when they trigger your anxiety or expose you to radiation   Another member of the support group Alison instantly agreed She had not wanted to be told her last bloodmarker number But Diane  who scrupulously monitored her medical records  looked aghast She hesitated and then blurted out Thats bizarre Tests and scans let you know how youre doing  While a surrealistic image of nude mice flashed before my eyes I realized that the other members of the support group took Dianes dissent as an index of her distress An Avastin trial that had kept her ovarian cancer at bay was no longer effective Her physician had found another drug trial but Diane wondered why he had not mentioned all the other options she had been researching over the past few months   Temperamental in origin the divergent responses of Diane and Judy remind me that cancer patients are as different as all patients Some people read every side effect in the pharmacy printout that comes with their prescription and others simply toss it Some search the web while others shun it  As with genetic testing some want to know and others want not to know For some statistics and prognoses form a protective shell but the weight of that carapace becomes an unbearable burden for others Quite a few feel that knowledge furnishes if not power at least control whereas quite a few contend that allconsuming research allows disease to contaminate every waking moment of consciousness with dread  As for me I have run the gamut of responses so I realize that informational needs change over time for each individual At diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer I went blank as if a tornado had swept me up and out into darkness I simply followed orders and drove directly to the nearest cancer center where a surgeon was assigned Later when that operation led to a series of disasters I felt the need to take my fate into my own hands I tracked down and studied medical articles investigated chemotherapies and enlisted in experimental drug trials   At a cancer research conference last fall however I discovered the depths of my ignorance I expected to be baffled by the scientific words and acronyms that cropped up in the lectures  methylation cytoplasmic VEGF Dicer and Drosha miR delivery etc But it was the talk about nude mice that stumped me I thought that I understood mice I once had a mouse problem  in the stove believe it or not  I knew that mice were used in laboratories and identified with them since I am also a lab animal and all of the survival graphs in the PowerPoint presentations sloped downward steeply Mouse pelt is what I had on my head after chemo If nude mice are hairless why not call them bald or I thought naked Nude means unclothed and endowed with the glamour of Greek and Roman statues We dont usually imagine mice in shirts jackets and slacks or togas so how could they be nude Naked means exposed unmediated  like the naked truth  Arent you glad that I share these profound speculations   My oncologist explained that nude mice bred without a thymus have limited immune systems so they cannot reject tumors as any proper creature would and should and yes they are hairless as I will be soon Do they become weary too I wonder Im glad the vulnerable mice are nude rather than naked it gives them a certain pizzazz   Nude mice convince me of my unknowingness of the impossibility of my gaining sufficient knowledge Since I cannot possibly take charge of my case I should direct my limited energies toward living my life I like to deem my current state wise passiveness but it is probably just dumb incapacity Less is more I now believe   Each person in my support group realizes that we remain defenseless against the information we seek or avoid for we are as susceptible to malignancies as nude mice At the end of our lunch and emboldened by the solace of companionship we seconded Judys decision to refrain from constant surveillance while encouraging Diane to get a second opinion  To know or not to know that is the question  a better question we all agreed than Hamlets But then he was obsessed with mousetraps
