Health officials are saying it Scientists are saying it Heck even many journalists are saying it The risk of Ebola infection remains vanishingly small in this country     Wednesday But what does that mean Are you more likely to be struck by lightning or catch Ebola It all depends on what you do for a living and where you travel For instance three of us from NPR are spending  days in Monrovia Liberia to report on the outbreak Whats our chance of catching the virus So far in the US weve had too little data to calculate a real risk But we can do some backofthenapkin math to give some perspective Up until now two people have caught Ebola in the US Both were nurses in Dallas who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan the Liberian man who was diagnosed with the virus A doctor in New York City   The Doctors Without Borders staff member  who has been identified as Dr Craig Spencer  was treating patients in Guinea when he caught the virus This is the fourth case reported in the US and the second imported case  Ebola is spread through contact with sick peoples fluids So clearly nurses and doctors who treat patients have a higher risk than others But lets pretend for a minute that the probability of getting Ebola in the US is the same across the whole population aka the risk is evenly distributed The US encounter with Ebola is unlikely to stop in Dallas Computational biologists   air traffic will bring more sick people to the States as the epidemic continues in West Africa No one knows exactly how many cases this will be But one team at Northeastern University   theres about a  percent chance well get another imported case by the end of this month Lets say that trend continues and we get  more cases imported over the next year On average each of these sick people will spread the virus to two more people thats what has   in West Africa Then about  people in the US will have caught Ebola By comparison   in the US are struck and killed by lightning each year So the chance of catching Ebola  even with  more imported cases like Duncan  is on par with the odds of getting killed by a lightning bolt  out of every  million people So we can all breathe a sigh of relief But what about us journalists covering the epidemic in Liberia Or people who call Monrovia their home Here we can calculate a risk based on actual data More than  people have caught the virus in Monrovia since the epidemic began Right now Monrovia is   about  Ebola cases each week The city has a population of about  million people So that means  out of every  people gets infected with Ebola each week That puts the risk of getting Ebola each week in Monrovia right about on par with the risk of dying during childbirth in the US   or about two times the risk of dying in a traffic accident each year   Of course the longer you stay in Monrovia the more your risk goes up because you are continually in situations where you might be exposed to the virus For instance a full year in Monrovia raises your chance of getting Ebola to around  percent  assuming the epidemic doesnt grow any faster than it is now I told my husband all these stats to help ease his worry He has been very concerned about my day trip to Liberia His response Thats fine Michaeleen I understand the risk But theres just one number I cant get out of my head the  percent fatality rate
