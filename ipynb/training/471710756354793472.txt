The latest type of bird flu detected in China HN does not pose an imminent global threat say researchers  There have been three reported cases and two deaths since December  UK Medical Research Council scientists analysed the molecular structure of the virus to show it did not share the characteristics of previous pandemics Instead they argued resources should be focused on other flu viruses that are emerging or are already present in South East Asia There are a number of bird flus that are making the jump from animals to humans The phenomenon is most notable in China where there is a large population that culturally lives closely with birds such as live poultry markets  HN emerged in March last year and there were more than a hundred cases in the first month There is also the longstanding threat of HN influenza which kills nearly two in three people infected  The study on the latest bird flu to emerge published by the journal Nature analysed how well the surface of the virus could bind to human tissue  a key measure of how likely it is to spread  It showed the HN virus still had a clear preference for infecting birds rather than humans a trait that it is likely would need to be reversed before it became a serious threat  Dr John McCauley the director of the World Health Organization Influenza Centre at the Medical Research Councils National Institute for Medical Research told the BBC This has been a pretty rare event in one place in China It highlights the need to be aware but I dont think theres an imminent threat  There are higher priorities than HN Other avian influenzas emerging in China or those around for the past  years pose a more significant threat than HN
