The fight over abortion in Texas is being played out in federal court where abortion rights activists are challenging a new state law The measure bans abortions at  weeks adds building requirements for clinics and places more rules on doctors who perform abortions Some clinics have shut down saying they cant comply with the law set to go into effect Oct  Abortion rights activists call the new law a dramatic change that will affect all clinics across the state including a huge Planned Parenthood   in Fort Worth that opened in June Its a  million center with three surgical suites and  square feet of space built specifically to meet the building standards that activists saw coming You know we did not think the laws would come as quickly as they did says Ken Lambrecht president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas He says three nurses are required to be in the clinic when abortions are performed The law also mandates the size of operating rooms the type of ventilation systems and the width of the hallways You could fit at least two gurneys in this hallway and its the size of many hospital corridors he says And its certainly not necessary for the procedure Lambrecht says theres no medical basis for the new law He thinks the law is intended to increase costs and shut down clinics most of which do not meet the new building codes Abortion rights groups are challenging the law At a hearing this week the states attorney argued that Texas has the right to regulate clinics and has an interest in protecting the rights of the unborn If the woman chooses to proceed with the abortion she should have the best care and best environment possible says state Rep Jodie Laubenberg who sponsored the measure She says the law is designed to make abortions safer Why would anyone argue against making it a better place and a better environment she asks If a clinic closes that is their choice Were not forcing anyone to close Laws like the one in Texas   in more than a dozen states As a result clinics have closed in states from Virginia to Ohio and in Texas Another provision threatening to close clinics requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within  miles of a facility But hospitals do not have to grant admitting privileges Some say doctors must live in the local community Others require them to admit a certain number of patients Some dont approve of abortion The doctor in Fort Worth does have privileges but the hospital is too far from the clinic That means the brand new Planned Parenthood center there would also have to stop performing abortions Across the vast Texas plains more than  miles from Fort Worth is the city of Lubbock in the northwest part of the state Its just an hour from the New Mexico border and its home to a much smaller Planned Parenthood clinic The facility recently stopped scheduling appointments Annie Jones recently had an abortion Shes a single mother working and going to school in Lubbock and she has a yearold daughter Molly Jones who is  says she decided to have an abortion because it was best for her family I knew that if I decided to have the second child I would be doing it a disservice she says Id be doing my daughter a disservice because I wouldnt be able to care for them in the way that they deserved At least three Texas clinics have closed since the law passed and Jones is worried that this center could close too I think that the people who are passing the bills  are trying to legislate morality and they see abortion as wrong she says For abortion opponents passing the measure   was a big victory When Republican Gov Rick Perry signed the bill he said it would further   the culture of life in Texas It is our responsibility and duty to give voice to the unborn  the individuals whose survival is at stake   But abortion rights activists say the right to an abortion    years ago Angela Martinez director of the Lubbock clinic says if her facility closes women seeking abortions would have to travel more than  miles We are the only clinic in West Texas who sees patients and performs abortions Martinez says Its frustrating for me Its frustrating for my staff just because  we want to be available Just outside the clinic on a recent crisp morning a few protesters stand holding signs Krysten Haga says she sees the law as a first step not as the end of this debate Id like to see abortion completely banned in the United States Haga says Thats ideally what were looking for  is for abortion to not be an option at all A federal judge is expected to rule soon whether part of the new Texas law will go into effect next week
