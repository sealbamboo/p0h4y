The European Commission has adopted protective measures to try to contain a bird flu outbreak after new cases were reported in the UK and the Netherlands The measures include killing animals in infected areas and banning sales of poultry products from those areas The Dutch government has reported the highly contagious HN strain at a poultry farm there The UK reported a case at a duck farm in East Yorkshire and the Commission said it was probably identical HN can potentially affect humans EU officials say the outbreaks may be linked to bird flu recently found in Germany They say it could have been spread by migratory wild birds heading south for winter but that tests are continuing to confirm any links between the three cases  that the UK and the Netherlands were already applying directives on culling affected poultry prohibiting sales of affected poultry products and live birds and establishing protection zones It said The measures aim at quickly bringing the disease under control and at preventing the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza within the affected member states to other member states and to third countries It was a tense and traumatic day at the farm The idyllic Dutch image was destroyed by the hum of a truck carrying an industrial size gas canister and the appearance of men in orange boiler suits The health and safety teams came to Hekendorp to gas  hens Their primary concern is to contain the outbreak Poultry farmers even those operating outside the km exclusion zone have an additional concern Many are worried about the potential damage to the reputation of Dutch poultry products The industry has been brought to a standstill A nationwide transportation ban will remain in place until at least Tuesday The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of agricultural products in the world It exports more than six billion eggs annually We watched from behind the fire retardant barrier as diggers poured hundreds of dead chickens into trucks Neighbours living around the contaminated farm see the cull as an unpleasant but essential sacrifice The Dutch authorities have already begun destroying  hens at the infected farm in the village of Hekendorp This highly pathogenic variant of avian influenza is very dangerous for bird life the Dutch government  The disease can be transmitted from animals to humans The Dutch economics ministry says humans can only be infected through very close contact with infected birds The authorities have imposed a threeday nationwide ban on the transportation of poultry and eggs Earlier this month a farm in northeastern Germany detected cases of HN which had previously not been reported in Europe The strain has never been detected in humans but an outbreak in South Korea meant millions of farm birds had to be slaughtered to contain it Also on Monday Egyptian health officials said a woman had died from the deadliest strain of the virus HN after coming into contact with infected birds in the south of the country Meanwhile officials in the UK   but insisted the risk to public health was very low A cull of poultry is being carried out at the site and an exclusion zone is in place The Commission said The information available indicates that the H virus in the UK is probably identical to the HN virus found in the Netherlands and in Germany The head of the World Animal Health Organisation Bernard Vallat suggested that bird feed at the farms might have become contaminated by wild migratory birds If feed is not protected and a wild bird comes to eat it its enough to contaminate the feed and then those that eat that feed Mr Vallat said Most forms of bird flu do not infect humans but HN and HN have caused serious infections in people the   The majority of those infected had come into close contact with live or dead poultry There is no evidence to suggest HN and HN can be passed to humans through properly prepared poultry or eggs the WHO says HN has a   in humans and led to  deaths between  and December  according to WHO figures Common symptoms include a high fever and coughing
