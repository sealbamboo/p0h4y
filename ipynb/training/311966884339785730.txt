Picture this Your spouse or child has collapsed and isnt breathing You call  and the paramedics rush in and take charge But you are banished to another room while the medical people try to bring your loved one back to life Its about the most stressful scene imaginable And its what usually happens But now comes the most rigorous   so far on allowing family members to witness CPR  its impact on them on the medical team on the CPR itself The study in this weeks   was done by a French group but a US collaborator thinks it sheds light on the longrunning   here The study involving about  relatives of patients who got CPR contains some surprises Foremost is that watching the resuscitation attempt doesnt have lingering bad effects on relatives who choose to do it  its actually beneficial for them Family members who did not witness CPR were  percent more likely to have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder later They also had more anxiety and depression Moreover the resuscitation teams say they didnt experience more stress when relatives were present because relatives didnt interfere with the process And their presence didnt affect things like the duration of CPR or survival rates None of them sued either  a prominent worry in the US  a professor of emergency medicine at Texas Tech University and the sole American among the studys authors thinks it will raise the level of the conversation in the US on allowing family members to witness CPR Its an issue thats kind of simmered in the background for a long time Borron tells Shots The idea was   back in   although that proposal was about allowing relatives to watch inhospital CPR while the French study involved outofhospital resuscitation usually in patients homes Back in    published   that advocated giving family members the choice to be present  a Canadian pediatrician and bioethicist who wrote that piece recounted a trial of such a policy in a Michigan hospital Of those who watched  percent later said they would want to do it again She wrote Borron strongly agrees When relatives are excluded they can be left with doubts Anytime you close the door on someone and say Just trust me theres going to be some suspicion Borron says Some of the benefit to family witnesses he thinks may come from a sense of closure My gestalt Borron says is that in a lot of situations where patients have cardiac arrest at home family members feel they didnt do something they should have  didnt call quick enough or get them to the hospital quick enough didnt give them their morning meds There are a million things that go through peoples minds Witnessing the CPR attempt he adds gives them a sense that theyve done their part and that nothing more might have been done to save their loved one Borron says he was a little surprised by the studys finding that caregivers stress levels were not increased by having family members witness CPR One reason might be that French medical personnel are less afraid of being sued Its a sea change to open up resuscitations to patients families the Texas specialist says I dont think you can necessarily transfer this French study to the American situation Some additional studies need to be done And in any case Borron thinks there will be pushback from US medical personnel And that will take some time to sort out But some hospitals are moving in that direction For the past year the Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City has been offering patients relatives the option of being present during inhospital CPR attempts It gives them comfort and solace to know that their doctor spent  minutes trying to do everything they could to save their loved one Paul Chan a staff cardiologist there tells Shots
