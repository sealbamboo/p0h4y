Increasing numbers of paramedics are leaving NHS ambulance services according to figures obtained by the BBC Senior staff say remaining paramedic crews are under greater pressure than ever before to meet demand At least  paramedics left their job in  compared with  in the same period two years earlier The Department of Health says it is spending an extra m on the ambulance service in England this year London Ambulance Service saw  paramedics leave in  four times the number in  and the largest increase in the country An internal document produced by London Ambulance Service and seen by   programme suggests morale among paramedics is low   It says threequarters of paramedics surveyed had considered leaving the service in the past  months Anonymous paramedics quoted in the report point to rising workloads as one of their greatest grievances  Alison Blakely a paramedic in London for  years says that while she loves the job when on shift she often doesnt even have time for a break You use hospital facilities for toilets as much as possible and eat and drink as and when you can she says The control room do try and get us rest breaks but due to the demand currently they are rare A London paramedic who wanted to remain anonymous told the BBC that sometimes there were as many as  emergency calls on hold and that the service havent got enough vehicles or staff to cope When I joined the job it was very unusual for someone to leave the service other than through retirement but over the last two or three years its escalated beyond belief he said But this is not just a London problem Association of Ambulance Chief Executives chairman Anthony Marsh says a surge in  calls this year and higher numbers of paramedics leaving some services means the remaining frontline staff are facing pressures that are greater than theyve ever been Traditionally ambulance services receive just over  more  calls each year and we have done for the last  years  some years a little bit more than that some a little bit less  but this year were seeing substantially more  calls says Dr Marsh This growth in emergency calls has outpaced the rise in numbers of qualified ambulance staff which has increased on average by  each year in England over the past decade  In  there were  paramedics employed by the  of the  emergency ambulance trusts in the UK that responded to a request for the data by the BBC This grew to  in   Dr Fiona Moore medical director for London Ambulance Service estimates there is a shortfall nationally of up to  paramedics And she says expectations of what the service is for have also changed Weve seen an increase in calls from the  to yearold group and I think that now reflects the sort of supermarket culture we now have so if you can buy a loaf of bread at  in the morning why cant you access your healthcare when its convenient to you she says The trust in London is taking action to try to reduce staff workloads and improve the service  It has offered more than  paramedics jobs on a recruitment expedition to Australia and New Zealand and has recently increased the number of calls that do not receive an ambulance but are instead referred on to other services But nationally the number of new paramedics recruited in  was lower than the year before and some paramedics are concerned that the number of new recruits coming through degree courses is too low to meet demand  This year the Department of Health has provided m to ambulance trusts to help cope with the extra emergency calls
