Breastmilk banks are a great way to help babies whose mothers arent able to breastfeed Breast milk in case you didnt know does a better job than formula at bolstering a babys immune system especially if the tot is premature or underweight Banks are easy to run in some parts of the world In the US donors place the breast milk in an icefilled cooler and ship it to a central bank The milk is pasteurized to kill germs then mailed to donors on a refrigerated FedEx or UPS truck The  American banks distribute  million ounces of breast milk a year across the country The developing world is another story In South Africa for instance most milk banks are in cities like Cape Town but transporting a bottle to a rural clinic can be troublesome Roads wash out in the rainy season And the clinics dont have the resources to pay for a refrigerated truck And thats the part of the world where breastmilk banks are especially crucial Each year   under the age of  die because they didnt have access to breast milk  close to  out of every  infant deaths most of which occur in developing regions One solution would be to set up banks in remote places Wed love more milk banks at rural hospitals where they can gather milk from their own patients and mothers says Louise Goosen who directs the Milk Matters a banking organization in Cape Town But a commercial device to pasteurize breast milk can cost from  to   out of reach for rural clinics Now theres a simple device called FoneAstra that when combined with a smartphone can pasteurize milk so a bank can be set up almost anywhere The cost is only about  The FoneAstra dock comes equipped with a wire connected to a temperature probe which gets placed in a hot water bath After a nurse collects a milk donation she puts the bottle into the water bath When she starts the phone app FoneAstra will display stepbystep instructions on how to pasteurize breast milk Its trickier than you think Boil too hot and the heat will destroy important proteins Too cold and lifethreatening germs might remain The smartphone app also prints bar code labels for each donation so nurses can trace every donation in case something goes wrong In  the Seattlebased nonprofit organization PATH began testing FoneAstra at two clinics in Durban South Africa The device tripled the volume of milk that could be collected from donors Thats a significant result The consequences of lacking breast milk are more severe in developing countries owing to poor sanitation and a higher abundance of infectious diseases   found that nonbreastfed infants had a tenfold higher risk of dying compared with predominantly breastfed infants in Ghana India and Peru And the number of babies at risk can be high South Africa   premature births per year What we noticed in neonate wards in South Africa is about  percent of babies dont have access to their own mothers milk says Kiersten IsraelBallard of the maternal and child health unit at PATH which partnered with technologist   of the University of Washington to develop FoneAstra Next year in collaboration with the Human Milk Banking Association of South Africa PATH will spread FoneAstra farther away from Durban across five more sites as part of a threeyear initiative sponsored by the provinces health department to promote breastfeeding Unlike a commercial pasteurizer FoneAstra works only with small volumes about  ounces at time enough for the daily needs of most babies One of the huge advantages of the FoneAstra is that a cycle can be completed in  minutes as opposed to the twohour cycle of a commercial pasteurizer says Penny Reimers of HMBASA But general promotion of breastfeeding must happen too or we wont have enough donor milk for these banks to operate FoneAstra can aid that too Moving banks into rural communities can make people aware that breastmilk donation is an option says Noah Perin a health innovations officer at PATH Goosen of Milk Matters recalls   near Cape Town that started a milk bank with FoneAstra Rather to our surprise their milk bank grew and they eventually bought a commercial pasteurizer to match the supply says Goosen Certainly without FoneAstra they wouldnt have started the program in the first place
