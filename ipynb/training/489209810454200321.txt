For decades millions of men with early prostate cancer have been placed on drug therapy to suppress their production of testosterone despite such significant side effects as impotence diabetes and bone loss Now a large new analysis has concluded that socalled androgen deprivation therapy does not extend the lives of these patients There are so many side effects associated with this therapy and really little evidence to support its use said Dr Grace L LuYao a researcher at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the lead author of the report published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine I would say that for the majority of patients with localized prostate cancer this is not a good option Dr LuYao and her colleagues followed tens of thousands of men with early prostate cancer for as long as  years and found that those who received androgen deprivation therapy lived no longer on average than those who did not The study joins a growing body of evidence indicating that for many men with early prostate cancer avoiding testosteronesuppressing drugs altogether may be better than grappling with their potentially devastating toll One expert who was not involved in the new study Dr James M McKiernan acting chairman of urology at NewYorkPresbyterian HospitalColumbia University Medical Center said its findings were eyeopening and even alarming This isnt the first study that suggests that theres no added benefit to this therapy said Dr McKiernan said But there are still a fair number of doctors recommending it and patients receiving it Every year roughly a quarter million new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in the United States More than  percent of these men have an early form of the disease in which the cancer has not spread and is classified as lowrisk Drugs to suppress hormones like testosterone  essentially inducing chemical castration  can shrink prostate cancers or cause them to grow more slowly in men with more advanced or aggressive disease Androgen deprivation can help improve survival in these patients when combined with radiation or other treatments But experts have become increasingly concerned about the widespread use of this treatment in men with earlystage disease particularly older patients whose slowgrowing cancer is unlikely to have serious health consequences In the s use of these drugs rose sharplydramatically in patients of all ages and stages of the disease and especially in older patients Today it is estimated that at least a quarter of all patients over age  are chemically castrated Men are usually put on the drugs for life which substantially raises their risk of fractures hot flashes diabetes and heart disease The new study involved more than  men with prostate cancer who were aged  or older The researchers compared men in areas of the country where the drugs were frequently prescribed withto men in other regions where the drugs were less commonly used Over all they found that the drugs were not associated with greater longterm survival The findings echo those of another large randomized trial carried out in Europe that found that the hormone treatments did not benefit earlystage patients assigned to take them The drugs only improved survival only in men with a more aggressive form of the disease An editorial accompanying the new study written by physicians at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston said it wasis now clear that there is no compelling evidence to justify using the drugs onto men with earlystage prostate cancer The editorial called the practice a prime candidate for inclusion in the nationwide Choosing Wisely campaign an initiative started by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation and other groups to warn doctors and patients about unnecessary medical tests and procedures
