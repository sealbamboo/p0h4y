Spanish health authorities seem as if they have no heart They euthanized Excalibur a dog that could have caught Ebola from his owner the Spanish nurse who was diagnosed with the virus this week But the question of Excaliburs fate is a lot more complicated than just  Awww how could they put down a cute dog For a better understanding we turned to   A specialist in infectious diseases hes a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centers Center for Health Security and hes having a very busy week fielding interview requests to talk about Excalibur while attending the third  for infectious disease experts Adalja told us what is already known about dogs and Ebola very little it turns out and why we need to know a lot more We know about Ebola in humans We know bats We know antelopes We know nonhuman primates Theres not a lot of work done with dogs We know Ebola is transmitted through blood and body fluids and people with Ebola are only infectious when symptomatic But thats based on human data We dont really know what the role of dogs is in Ebola transmission Yet dogs are mammalian species and we know viruses  and Ebola  can infect multiple mammalian species So its reasonable that Spanish health authorities are worried that the dog may have been infected I think the authorities are trying to be proactive and not open up a whole new realm of transmission and thats why the suggestion is that they euthanize the dog We dont have diagnostic tests for dogs We dont know what symptoms dogs might have What if dogs dont experience symptoms And the dog cant tell you Ive got a fever or I have muscle aches and pains So you have to be measuring temperatures  that is if dogs even have same fever response as humans Its very hard to translate what we do for evaluating humans to dogs People are very attached to animals Its hard for them to think about this proposed euthanization Thats very hard to do Is the incubation period the same in a dog as a human Does the virus follow the same type of spread inside a dogs body The way we test for virus in the blood  is it the same for dogs as for humans All our protocols and algorithms work on primates Its unclear to me how to translate that to canines and do it with certainty that would ensure the  dog wasnt infected or poses no risk We know for example that in humans Ebola remains in the semen for three months What if the virus remains in the dogs semen for three months We can tell a human to refrain from sex or practice safe sex but how do you that in a dog Even if a dog doesnt have symptoms it may have a mild case of Ebola that can transmit to other dogs if it has sex with other dogs What about the fact that saliva is a body fluid that can transmit Ebola Dogs do a lot of licking they lick peoples wounds Theres a risk of infection in general I understand a whole bunch of considerations are in play Were really in uncharted water Definitely there is enough unknown that Spanish public health authorities are justified in their concern I dont know what life that dog could have  perhaps as an experimental animal to understand what the disease does I do hope we learn from this experience irrespective of the outcome about what Ebola does in dogs We heard that during the quarantine in West Point Liberia dogs were eating the bodies of the deceased If we have these situations where bodies are lying in the streets of Africa its important to know the viruss role in different animal species help design control strategies and understand the real scope of the disease
