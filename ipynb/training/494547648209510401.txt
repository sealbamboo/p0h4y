How many times will we have to be told Apparently we havent reached the point when well change our habits but here goes again Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables every day can help us live longer That comes from researchers analysis of  studies covering  people published Tuesday in the BMJ Scientists from China and the United States looked at the growing evidence of a connection between produce consumption and heart disease and cancer They wanted to quantify the dose response  or how much we need to eat  in relation with all causes of death heart disease and cancer The average risk of death from all causes was reduced by  for each additional daily serving of fruits or vegetables risk of cardiovascular death was reduce by  for each serving They did not find the risk of cancer to be appreciably associated with produce consumption There was a threshold around five servings of fruit and vegetables a day after which the risk of allcause mortality did not reduce further the scientists wrote This conclusion contradicts a finding published recently in the BMJs Journal of Epidemiology  Community Health in whichÂ researchers led by Oyinlola Oyebode of University College London wrote that people eating   or more portions of   and vegetables daily have the lowest risk of mortality from any cause One of the researchers involved in the more recent study Wei Bao of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development said his groups analysis did not find additional benefits over five portions There could be debate on how much but we should be aware that the average intake across the world is very low far below five Bao said The studies followed participants for up to  years and tallied a total of  deaths   from heart disaese and  from cancer Bao said its possible that there is an optimal dose or particular kinds of produce that would affect cancer death rates Andy Bellatti a registered dietitian noted that half a cup of cooked leafy greens counts as a serving as do about a dozen baby carrots or six asparagus spears But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that only about a quarter of American adults eat vegetables three or more times a day he said In the earlier study the researchers noted that people do not eat enough produce citing difficulty in changing habits lack of motivation lack of time and cost Those scientists used the  Health Surveys for England plus several years of followup on more than  people  and older The study subjects reported eating an average of  servings of produce   of them vegetables The study didnt know how many of those were French fries which tops many lists of vegetable consumption Eating at least   servings was linked to a  lower risk of death from all causes  lower from cancer and  lower from heart disease or stroke in the study period after excluding deaths within the first year of the monitoring the researchers reported The World Health Organization recommended in  that people eat at least five servings of   and vegetables a day to protect against cardiovascular disease and some cancers These studies suggest potential not only for individuals Bao said noting that to promote people to consume more would be of some benefit in terms of policy marymacveanlatimescom Interested in eating healthfully Follow me on Twitter
