Seafood is generally considered a more healthful choice when dining out  but not if youre battering and deepfrying it and serving it up with hush puppies and onion rings And that is precisely why the folks at the Center for Science in the Public Interest a nutrition and health policy watchdog group have named Long John Silvers new Big Catch meal the worst restaurant meal in America The meal which debuted this May sounds harmless enough on the surface judging by the chains marketing materials Its centerpiece is  ounces of  percent premium Haddock caught in the icy waters of the North Atlantic But if you ate an entire Big Catch  complete with the sides of fried onion rings and hush puppies  youd end up netting an unwelcome surprise around  grams of trans fats Thats a lot  over two weeks worth of the   recommended by the American Heart Association Weve actually never made this designation before Jeff Cronin CSPIs director of communications told The Salt No exaggeration No one here has ever seen this much trans fat in a meal And if that werent enough the Big Catch also contains  grams of saturated fat  calories and almost  milligrams of sodium CSPI found At almost all of its locations nationwide Long John Silvers fish is fried in partially hydrogenated oil These oils have fallen out of favor with the food industry because they contain   which have been implicated in heart disease In  KFC switched to transfatfree oil after   over its use of partially hydrogenated oils To find what is swimming around in the Big Catch meal CSPI visited several Long John Silvers locations around Washington DC and commissioned tests from the laboratory Eurofins The results were startling enough for CSPI to to dub the meal heart attack on a hook CSPI also found something off about the weight of the fish too When the researchers brought their Big Catch meals back to CSPI headquarters they found that once its breading was removed a naked filet of fish weighed in at about  to  ounces In other words customers arent getting  to  ounces of pure fish Theyre getting fish plus several ounces of greasy batter says CSPI Executive Director Michael Jacobson In our mind this is the worst Its the Mount Everest of trans fat In a statement Long John Silvers told The Salt that we stand behind our published food data and will review any requests from CSPI that raise questions about our data The Big Catch the company added is a limitedtime special that delivers tremendous value to value hungry consumers Despite the worst meal designation Long John Silvers Big Catch has plenty of fans judging from the companys   which features dozens of photos from customers posing with empty white togo boxes One post boasts of a customer who finished the Big Catch platter in under  min Interestingly in another   on its Facebook page from May Long John Silvers notes that many doctors recommend eating seafood twice a week We recommend getting it with Hushpuppies and fries
