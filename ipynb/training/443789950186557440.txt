Its one of our guiltiest pleasures on the Internet and though some of us may not like to admit it chances are weve done it Some are even addicted Thats right were talking about the endless consumption and distribution of food porn Photos of fatty foods like greaselaced bacon and glistening donuts abound to satisfy our virtual cravings yet their healthier counterparts  fruits and veggies  just havent been getting as much love online But why should the junk food guys have all the fun That was the thinking behind   an interactive website that highlights this unhealthy imbalance in social media The index uses a custom algorithm to track how many times certain food hashtags are used on Twitter and Instagram updating every  minutes Sure the site is part of a marketing campaign from carrot and juice company    whose   is to make healthy foods edgy  but its also pretty interesting nonetheless On the indexs front page youll find a grid of boxes featuring  different food hashtags and pictures   healthy ones and  unhealthy ones  along with the number of times theyve been mentioned Depending on which box you click on youll be shuttled over to a different interactive experience  say a fastpaced game of guacamole or a trippy melon meditation led by a soothing voice The goal is to sway the online conversation to be more about fruits and vegetables and less about junk food in a lighthearted way says Todd Putman Bolthouses chief officer for marketing and innovation He plans to showcase the success of the website at the   summit this week where first lady Michelle Obama will be speaking Were aiming for humor to make guacamole fun to really bring to life the juxtaposition of Brussels sprouts and having fun with them he says Because people dont necessarily do that today and  we think that to the extent that you can have fun with fruits and vegetables it can accelerate the consumption For the record we here at The Salt have always found guacamole fun Bolthouse may be onto something Over half of Americans who use social media agree that seeing photos of fruits and vegetables actually motivates them to eat healthier according to a recent survey that market research company Harris Interactive conducted for Bolthouse At the same time about a third of respondents admitted that those glorified photos of cookies pizza and cake also make them give into their unhealthy cravings What better way than to have a little bit of a laugh around something thats quite serious which is the way the people eat in this country Putman says We all know our eating habits are out of whack out of balance and you can clearly see that mathematically To date the website has collected nearly  million hashtags   percent are for junk food while only  percent are for healthy foods Thats actually a slight improvement from when the site was first launched back in February when the numbers sat at  percent and  percent Among the most popular hashtags   As of this writing its clocked in more than  million mentions On the healthy side the winner is    with only  million uses While junk food may be winning the hashtag war so far the site is getting attention  attracting  unique visitors in under a month Putman hopes that will encourage other marketers to get more playful with selling healthy foods Marketing of healthy fruits and vegetables need to be more creative needs to be more innovative needs to be more relevant  and more emotive versus rational he says
