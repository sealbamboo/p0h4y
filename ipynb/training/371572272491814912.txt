Staying snug within a watertight tent as a storm rages around you is one of the joys of modern camping and modern tents But if the weather suddenly turns nasty on your next camping trip or nights are just colder than you expected dont be tempted to bring your cook stove inside Levels of poisonous carbon monoxide CO from the burning stove can build up fast Thats the warning from several Michigan emergency room doctors who wanted to know if varying the type of stove fuel might make a difference in such situations They also wondered if the more rugged fourseason tents favored by those who like to be ready for anything would raise the concentration of carbon monoxide more than airier threeseason versions Quick answers from their small firstpass test Yes and yes Fourseason tents are built really well to keep out the elements says Dr David Betten a medical toxicologist in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing Mich Unfortunately that same tight construction means theyre not all that well ventilated In several minute burns inside the two types of tents Betten and his colleagues tested the output of a popular backpacking stove as it heated a pan of water In each trial   in the journal   they either burned unleaded gasoline or used white gas the cleanerburning petroleum fuel that is commonly sold with camp stoves and lanterns Burning unleaded gas inside the fourseason tent led to farandaway the most carbon monoxide Burning white gas inside the threeseason shelter produced the least But in just  minutes even the cleaner white gas raised levels of carbon monoxide inside the fourseason tent above the  partspermillion limit that occupational safety groups say workers shouldnt be exposed to for more than  minutes Inside the breezier threeseason tents CO levels stayed under  ppm with both types of fuel But that was just a minute test Betten says If you fired it up for an hour or two  or fell asleep  its tough to say what would happen The concern is   Its true that most of the  or more Americans each year who die from carbon monoxide poisoning and the  additional people hospitalized are poisoned inside their homes   or   A   published in the   just this week even suggests that a large buildup of CO gas from   in one apartment can spill into the next The CDC has a whole bunch of   for protecting you and your family indoors We hear less about CO risks away from home But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that some campers have fallen asleep and   after pulling propane stoves or charcoal grills into their tents to cook or keep warm The headaches dizziness and queasiness that can be   of such poisoning may be discounted as food poisoning or altitude sickness  or go completely unnoticed during sleep  until its too late Keeping a tentflap open isnt always enough Modern tents and stoves come with big warnings regarding carbon monoxide says Betten who once camped for more than five months as he hiked the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine Still he says when the temperature drops at night or the weather turns bad it can be really tempting to bring the stove inside the tent to cook dinner Bettens advice Dont
