The HN strain has killed millions of birds and infected more than  people over the last decade But no one appears to have been atrisk of being infected during the incident since the sample was stored and shipped properly according to the CDC reports The contamination most likely happened due to the failure of a laboratory scientist to adhere to established best practices and the absence of an approved laboratory teamspecific protocol for the work being done the reports concluded Dr Tom Frieden the CDCs director found out about the HN incident nearly six weeks after it happened something   most distressing This delay in reporting the crosscontamination was due to a lack of awareness and understanding about reporting requirements for Select Agents according to the reports Around the same time he heard about the flu incident Frieden was dealing with the possible exposure of up to  of his workers    Michael Farrell who headed the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology Laboratory involved submitted his resignation in July He had been reassigned from his post in June after the anthrax incident was made public The CDC says the potential anthrax exposure happened between June  and  The bioterrorism lab had been preparing anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDCs Atlanta campus and failed to deactivate the samples adequately According to another CDC investigation report the exposure happened because the lab didnt use an approved sterilization technique It didnt have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed and there was a limited knowledge of peerreviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous The lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe Bottom line The scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated Frieden said last month It should have happened and it didnt As a result of these problems the CDC has stopped transferring materials in and out of its highestlevel labs The moratorium will remain in place pending labbylab review of policies and procedures for laboratory safety and security the CDC says  Frieden plans to appoint a CDC director of laboratory safety and establish a working group to review safety protocols The work of safety is never complete Dr Michael Bell interim director of laboratory safety said in a statement We will continue to take all necessary steps to maintain safety and advance CDCs critical laboratory science work so that CDC labs are the most scientifically rigorous and the safest in the world
