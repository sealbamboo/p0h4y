Doctors in the delivery room are increasingly urged to hold off cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn Delayed clamping as its called allows blood to continue flowing from the placenta improving iron stores in the baby But the practice has been slow to catch on in part because doctors have also been advised that for it to be most effective they also must hold the wet screaming infant at the level of the mothers vagina for a crucial minute or longer so that     Doctors have long considered the maneuver awkward and now a new study  has found that it is probably unnecessary Babies who were placed on their mothers stomachs before clamping fared just as well as those who were held lower the researchers found They found no difference whether the baby was at abdomen level or on the chest or the baby was held at the vagina said Dr Tonse Raju the chief of the pregnancy and perinatology branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development who wrote a comment accompanying the study It made no difference in terms of extra blood the baby got  The authors hope their finding will convince doctors reluctant to delay cord clamping to start the practice  A mother would prefer to have the baby on top of her Dr Nstor Vain the lead author and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina And that doesnt change the amount of placental transfusion and facilitates the procedure for the obstetrician  The study assigned  healthy fullterm babies to be placed on their mothers abdomen or chest for two minutes and  babies to be held at the level of the vagina for two minutes All of the newborns were still attached to umbilical cords and weighed before and after the allotted time  The group placed on their mothers abdomens gained  grams of blood while the babies held lower gained  grams  Delayed clamping of the cord remains underused despite mounting evidence that it   and poses no added risk of maternal blood loss A recent analysis did find roughly  percent more babies whose cord clamping was delayed   One reason the practice hasnt been more widely adopted could be simply that holding a bloody squirming newborn is cumbersome said Dr Raju A minute or two in this position he said can feel like an eternity with an exhausted mother looking on  Obstetricians also increasingly recognize the benefits of early skintoskin contact said Dr Jeffrey Ecker the chairman of the committee on obstetric practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Immediate contact helps the baby stay warm promotes maternalinfant bonding and may even improve breastfeeding  The new study suggests no tradeoff is necessary  You can delay cord clamping and do skintoskin contact and its not going to affect the volume of blood that is added to a babys circulation said Dr Ecker who was not involved in the study  Premature babies and newborns who needed resuscitation or were delivered via cesarean section were excluded from the study Research still is needed into blood flow in the umbilical cord in these infants  Diane Farrar an author of   said some cesarean births may be different for two reasons  You cut through the uterus and the uterus doesnt contract as well so the effect on placental transfusion may be different may be less said Dr Farrar a senior research fellow at the Bradford Institute for Health Research in England  Also after a Csection the surgeon will sometimes hold the baby up If the cord is still intact she said  thats a long way up for baby to go and theres a potential for blood to drain from the baby to the placenta if you do that
