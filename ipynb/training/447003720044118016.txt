Its been more than three years since cholera struck Haiti And the epidemic continues today The deadly bacteria have killed more than  people and infected hundreds of thousands Why has the outbreak been so hard to stop even with more than   in foreign aid pledged to Haiti Lack of sanitation says journalist   who has been covering the cholera epidemic since it began Haiti doesnt have sewers Instead the country relies on whats known as the   independent and somewhat secretive laborers who clean the cesspools under peoples latrines Almost all of them are men  and they work in a very interesting way Katz says The job is done by hand They climb into the latrines with a bucket They scoop out the excrement and put it somewhere else The job is incredibly important he says Its basically the only way that people who have underground cesspools  dug under latrines in their backyard  get them clean But even a latrine is a luxury in Haiti Most people in Haiti cant afford even that kind of cesspool Katz says So what most people do especially in the rural areas is that they look for an open field or they look for a canal Most people prefer to go at dawn And when those choices arent available people use an even less sanitary method the socalled flying toilet You take a plastic bag You go in the plastic bag And then you throw it Katz says Thats the way the sanitation tends to get done After the  earthquake foreign aid flooded into Haiti And a major concern was getting clean water and temporary toilets into the country But nothing has been done to solve Haitis water and sanitation problems permanently Katz says There were very very shortterm BandAid type solutions he says For instance the bladders of water provided to the displacement camps and the portapotties being installed in big visible places They werent longterm durable solutions And sanitation problems are what kicked off the cholera outbreak in the first place Evidence suggests the cholera in Haiti came from a United Nations base where Nepalese peacekeeping troops were living The cholera strain in Haiti exactly matches one found at the UN base And the sanitation on the base wasnt sufficient to prevent contamination of the adjacent river Haitian citizens recently   a lawsuit against the UN Theyre seeking compensation for the spread of cholera Before these lawsuits were brought forward UN officials were trying to actively deny they were responsible Katz says Since then the science supporting the connection has been so overwhelming that the UN basically doesnt even take up the issue of whether its responsible And once cholera establishes itself in a region the infectious disease doesnt leave easily Its very hard to get out of the environment Katz says That said there have been many places in the world that have dealt with horrific cholera epidemics over very long periods of time What was the solution Sewers Build underground pipes Katz says As long as people continue to drink water that is infected cholera is going to be a major problem
