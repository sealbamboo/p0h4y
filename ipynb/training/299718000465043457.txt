 Adding a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID to an antihypertensive regimen that includes a diuretic and either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker may increase the risk of acute kidney injury researchers found Compared with patients on the dual antihypertensive regimen alone those who also were taking an NSAID had a  percent greater risk of acute kidney injury according to Samy Suissa PhD of McGill University in Montreal and colleagues The risk was highest within the first  days of using the antihypertensiveNSAID combination the researchers reported online in   Although antihypertensive drugs have cardiovascular benefits vigilance may be warranted when they are used concurrently with NSAIDs they wrote In particular they wrote major attention should be paid early in the course of treatment and a more appropriate use and choice among the available antiinflammatory or analgesic drugs could therefore be applied in clinical practice Antihypertensives and NSAIDs are often coprescribed although little is known about the potential risks when they are used together From a pharmacological perspective these combinations may increase the risk of acute kidney injury as each has the potential to affect kidney function through different mechanisms Suissa and colleagues wrote Use of diuretics can lead to hypovolemia ACE inhibitorsangiotensin receptor blockers cause a hemodynamic reduction in glomerular filtration rate due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation and NSAIDs cause inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis leading to renal afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction To explore the issue the researchers examined data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink which captures information from primary care encounters and the Hospital Episodes Statistics database a national registry of hospital admissions Among  users of antihypertensive drugs identified there were  firsttime hospitalizations for acute kidney injury during a mean followup of  years Each of those cases was matched to up to  controls who did not have a previous history of acute kidney injury Cases and controls were matched by age sex calendar year of cohort entry prevalent user status and duration of followup the analysis included  controls The average age in both the cases and controls was   percent of the patients were male After adjustment for numerous potential confounders using a combination of one antihypertensive and an NSAID double therapy was not associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury compared with using one antihypertensive alone However triple therapy a diuretic either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker and an NSAID was associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury particularly shortly after initiating treatment The risk declined progressively the longer therapy lasted and it was no longer significantly elevated after more than  days of use Although the basis of this is still unclear it might be explained by an early and severe deteriorating effect of NSAIDs in susceptible patients who are heavily dependent on prostacyclins to maintain renal function the researchers speculated Furthermore patients may initially use a greater number of NSAID pills early on than later as some causes of pain may abate over time In an accompanying editorial Dorothea Nitsch MD and Laurie Tomlinson PhD of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that the study cannot reliably exclude an increase in the risk of acute kidney injury with doubledrug  as opposed to tripledrug  therapy But they wrote the implications of the current analysis are nevertheless important clinicians must advise patients who are prescribed diuretics ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers of the risks associated with NSAID use and they must also be vigilant for signs of drugassociated acute kidney injury in all patients Suissa and colleagues acknowledged some limitations of the study including possible misclassification of acute kidney injury status possible residual confounding by indication and disease severity the inability to control for exposure to contrast media injected during cardiovascular examinations and exposure to other nephrotoxins and possible misclassification of exposure because of the availability of NSAIDs over the counter Source
