Scientists have uncovered more than  new gene regions that could help explain why some people are more likely to put on weight than others  The team scoured DNA libraries of more than  people constructing the largestever genetic map of obesity  Looking for consistent patterns they found a link with genes involved in brain processes suggesting obesity could partly have a neurological basis  The results are published in the journal Nature   Researchers from the international Giant consortium Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Trait analysed the genetics behind body mass index a ratio of weight and height  And in a separate Nature paper they looked specifically at how genetics influence where fat is distributed around the body Fat around the abdomen for example can cause more health problems than fat carried around the thighs  Some  newly pinpointed gene regions were linked to body fat distribution  giving further clues about why some people are pearshaped while others put on weight more around the tummy They also identified more than  genetic locations that influence body mass index  tripling the number previously known And some of these regions have links with the nervous system Prof Elizabeth Speliotes of the University of Michigan and one of the lead authors said this surprised her You dont go to your neurologist to discuss your weight  when we think about obesity we dont generally think of the nervous system  But this changes the way we think about obesity  rather than just a metabolic condition perhaps it has a neurological basis too Researchers think some genes contribute to how we control our appetites and others to learning and memory around food  But for some genetic regions their roles in obesity are yet to be fully understood   Prof Speliotes says the sheer diversity of the genetic areas uncovered suggests a predisposition to obesity is not down to a single gene  She told the BBC This makes it less likely that one solution to beat obesity will work for everyone Right now we use gender and age to make general recommendations about healthy living and weight  But this type of genetic information we hope one day help us give more tailored advice  Prof Peter Weissberg medical director at the British Heart Foundation said We know that obesity particularly the fat that accumulates inside the abdomen can lead to diabetes and heart disease but we know little about just how this occurs  These research findings are important not because they will lead to genetic tests to predict people at increased risk becoming obese but because they identify genes involved in biochemical pathways that may cause obesity and may link obesity to diabetes and heart disease  Understanding these pathways should help us devise new ways to prevent obesity and its devastating health consequences
