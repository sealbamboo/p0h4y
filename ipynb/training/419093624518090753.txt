Runners are more likely to stay at a steady weight than those who do other forms of exercise and theyre more efficient at losing pounds when they need to notes Paul T Williams the lead researcher of the study  One simple reason The higher your workout intensity the more postexercise calories you continue to burn Dropping pounds and toning up are hardly the only benefits of this killer cardio workout Youll also reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes boost your mood temper stress and build muscle especially in the lower body and core You dont even need to dedicate a lot of time to reap these rewards do  to  minutes three to four days a week and youll see significant improvement Ready to hit the road Follow the plan that best suits your running level Whichever you go with add in one day of crosstraining think cycling or swimming to rev up calorie burn and help prevent injury Soon enough youll feel as if you were born to run Your stats Youre new to running and generally dont work out consistently The goal By the end of  weeks be able to run for  minutes straight  and build up to a K challenge Your coach Susan Paul is an exercise physiologist and training program director at Orlando Track Shack Fitness Club in Orlando Florida The plan Very flexible it involves a combination of runwalk intervals three days a week Start with three minutes of running and one minute of walking for a total workout of  minutes As you get fitter increase the running by one or two minutes and decrease the walking By Week  you should be running without any walking Your ideal pace One where you can carry on a conversation but still feel like youre doing a brisk walk Find the full plan here  Train smarter   Start off on the right foot Making a small investment in gear now will save you loads of aggravation later  youll feel more comfortable and avoid aches  A good pair of running shoes can help ward off injuries like knee pain says Paul  Get a gait analysis at your local running store its usually free to help determine your ideal shoe type  Stop side stitches Beginners are often plagued by this cramp which strikes like a boxers body blow and happens when an overworked diaphragm begins to spasm To ease the pain slow down and forcefully exhale each time your opposite foot strikes so if the stitch is on your right side breathe out when your left foot comes down It also helps to massage the area with two fingers And dont eat too much before you head out a full stomach can be a culprit  Think tortoise not hare  The biggest mistake most new runners make is they start out way too fast says Paul It takes time for your body to get used to the demands of running You have to condition your muscles ligaments tendons and bones not just your heart and lungs  No matter how tempted you are to push yourself dont Slow and steady wins the calorieburn race Your stats Youre a sometimes runner who does at least three miles without stopping a couple of days a week most weeks The goal Increase your endurance run for an hour straight and tackle a K by the end of  weeks Your coach Jonathan Cane is an exercise physiologist and cofounder of City Coach Multisport in New York The plan Do three different running workouts every week on alternate days In the first run build speed through intervals start with a twominute speed burst at a challenging but sustainable pace followed by three minutes of easier recovery jogging Repeat six times for a total of  minutes  As the weeks pass alternate between building up the speed bursts and balancing out the recovery time For your second weekly workout which focuses on mixing speed and endurance begin with running for a couple of miles and build up to   miles over the course of the plan The third day helps you build endurance Focus on covering the distance not your pace Kick off with a  mile run Over  weeks try to work up to running   miles Find the full plan here    Train smarter   Make three the magic number If youre used to running twice a week says Cane three times is your sweet spot  youll get a big bump in both speed and endurance but its not so much more that youll risk getting injured  And if weight loss is a goal remember that adding just one extra day of running helps you burn an additional  to  calories depending on your pace and size  Its OK to hit the treadmill Some running purists say theres no substitute for the outdoors but all things being equal your heart and lungs dont really know the difference between the road and the treadmill says Cane  So if its late in the day raining or just not a good time to go outside but you really want to keep up your training feel free to hit the on button To compensate for a lack of wind resistance and natural terrain changes keep the treadmill deck set at a  incline  Turn down the music Yes pumping JT through your earbuds can power you up that hill but dont forget to tune in to how your body feels  At this stage you know you can already run for a while says Cane But its important to be aware of cues how heavy you are breathing or if you have a small twinge in your knee and need to slow down It helps keep you from getting injured and makes you more aware of when you can bump up your pace or give a little more effort Your stats You run three to four times a week for at least five miles nonstop The goal Boost your overall performance  speed endurance and distance  over the course of  weeks then challenge yourself with a half marathon Your coach Andrew Kastor is coaching director at Asics LA Marathon and head coach at Mammoth Track Club in Mammoth California The plan In Week  run three to four miles at an easy pace think  on a scale of  to  on your first day four to five miles on Days  and  and five to six on Day  In subsequent weeks keep doing one easypace day and vary halfmilelong to milelong speed intervals The detailed schedule also tells you how to add in racepace workouts so you can hold your speed for longer distances Find the full plan here    Train smarter   Buddy up Face it sometimes you just dont feel like going for a run especially when youve been seriously challenging yourself Having someone by your side is a great way to make the miles more tolerable and maintain your performance  When you train with a group or pack you almost always run a little harder or faster says Kastor  Grab a friend or find a new jogging pal at buddyupcom or the   Choose partners who are a bit better than you you want a challenge but dont want to get burned out or injured  Take the plunge Kastor who works with many elite runners including Olympian Deena Kastor his wife recommends a cold bath right after a hard workout  It helps reduce inflammation by constricting the blood vessels so theres less blood pooling through the muscle tissue and youre not as sore the next day he explains  Massage can speed recovery too Give yourself a fiveminute rubdown using a foam roller roll slowly up and down your legs butt shoulders and back You can also alleviate soreness by gently pressing into the area with your fingers  Write down your goal Youre amping up your workouts  pump up your motivation too Jot your goal time for the half marathon or just  on a sticky note and post it onto your mirror  As Kastor puts it Seeing that number will remind you to make the best choices for your body
