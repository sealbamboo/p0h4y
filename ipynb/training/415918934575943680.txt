A gene variant that seems to increase the risk of diabetes in Latin Americans appears to have been inherited from Neanderthals a study suggests We now know that modern humans interbred with a population of Neanderthals shortly after leaving Africa  years ago This means that Neanderthal genes are now scattered across the genomes of all nonAfricans living today Details of the study appear in the journal Nature The gene variant was detected in a large genomewide association study GWAS of more than  Mexicans and other Latin Americans The GWAS approach looks at many genes in different individuals to see whether they are linked with a particular trait People who carry the higher risk version of the gene are  more likely to have diabetes than those who do not and people who inherited copies from both parents are  more likely to have diabetes The higher risk form of the gene  named SLCA  has been found in up to half of people with recent Native American ancestry including Latin Americans The variant is found in about  of East Asians and is rare in populations from Europe and Africa The elevated frequency of this variant in Latin Americans could account for as much as  of these populations increased prevalence of type  diabetes  the origins of which are complex and poorly understood To date genetic studies have largely used samples from people of European or Asian ancestry which makes it possible to miss culprit genes that are altered at different frequencies in other populations said coauthor Jose Florez associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts  By expanding our search to include samples from Mexico and Latin America weve found one of the strongest genetic risk factors discovered to date which could illuminate new pathways to target with drugs and a deeper understanding of the disease The team that discovered the variant carried out additional analyses in collaboration with Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology  They discovered that the SLCA sequence associated with risk of type  diabetes is found in a newly sequenced Neanderthal genome from Denisova Cave in Siberia  Analyses indicate that the higher risk version of SLCA was introduced into modern humans through interbreeding between early modern humans and Neanderthals It is not unusual to find Neanderthal genes About  of the genomes of presentday nonAfricans were inherited from this distinctive human group which lived across Europe and western Asia from about  years ago until  years ago But scientists are only just beginning to understand the functional implications of this Neanderthal inheritance One of the most exciting aspects of this work is that weve uncovered a new clue about the biology of diabetes said coauthor David Altshuler who is based at the Broad Institute in Massachusetts SLCA is part of a family of genes that code for proteins that transport metabolites  molecules involved in the bodys various chemical reactions  Altering the levels of the SLCA protein can change the amount of a type of fat that has been implicated in the risk of diabetes These findings suggest that SLCA could be involved in the transport of an unknown metabolite that affects fat levels in cells and thereby increases risk of type  diabetes
