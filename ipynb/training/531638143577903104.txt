Nearly  of unders who have weightloss surgery in the UK are classified as superobese according to new figures Surgeons say this is evidence of a clear failure of strategies to prevent weight gain in young people Overall more patients are having weightloss surgery and on average they are getting more obese and more ill by the time of surgery A leading bariatric surgeon said severe obesity threatens to bankrupt the NHS The figures are contained in a report from the   which includes information on more than  weightloss operations in  UK hospitals between  and  The operations were made up of  gastric bypass procedures  gastric band operations and  sleeve gastrectomy operations The aim of bariatric surgery is to improve the overall health of very obese patients for whom dieting and lifestyle changes have not made any difference The report concludes that bariatric surgery is both safe and effective It says there are too many young people reaching levels of severe obesity who need weightloss surgery Between  and   young people under the age of  had bariatric surgery of some kind  of whom were under  Nearly  of these young men and women were already classified as superobese with a BMI of  or more the report says adding It is a reflection on societys failings that these patients had already gained sufficient weight to be broadly comparable to patients who are much older After analysing procedures for all age groups the report found more men were being treated with bariatric surgery  up from  of all weightloss operations in  to  in  At the time of surgery male and female patients were  on average  nearly twice the weight they should be for their height with an average   of   About threequarters of the men and women treated could not climb three flights of stairs without resting and on average patients had more health complications and were more ill at the time of their operation than in previous years But the good news surgeons say is that after surgery more than half of patients  could manage three flights without resting and the amount of time they spent recovering in hospital decreased despite the rise in more complex weightloss operations The figures also show that on average one year after an operation patients had lost nearly  of their excess weight and a majority of those with weightrelated type  diabetes were no longer showing symptoms Mr Richard Welbourn consultant surgeon and chairman of the National Bariatric Surgery Registry said severe and complex obesity was a condition which threatened to bankrupt the NHS He said the data showed there were great benefits to be gained from bariatric surgery In particular the effect on diabetes has important implications for the NHS Bariatric surgery costeffectively improves the health of obese patients In the report Sir Bruce Keogh medical director of the NHS said Obesity and bariatric surgery are rapidly rising up the NHS agenda as a consequence of social and lifestyle choices As in all branches of medicine prevention is better than cure but this report clearly demonstrates that when required bariatric surgery is effective and safe Bariatric surgery also known as weightloss surgery is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat This type of surgery is available on the NHS only to treat people with potentially lifethreatening obesity when other treatments have not worked Around  people a year currently receive the treatment The two most common types of weight loss surgery are
