The idea here is that a virus can be trained to specifically damage a cancer and to leave other tissues in the body unharmed said the lead study author Dr Stephen Russell Its a concept known as virotherapy and its been done before Mayo Clinic scientists say thousands of cancer patients have been treated with viruses but this is the first case of a patient with a cancer that had spread throughout the body going into remission  Erholtz was cancerfree for nine months  I think we succeeded because we pushed the dose higher than others have pushed it Russell said And I think that is critical The amount of virus thats in the bloodstream really is the driver of how much gets into the tumors  In simple terms the measles virus makes cancer cells join together and explode Mayo Clinic researcher Dr Angela Dispenzieri explains Theres also some evidence to suggest she says that the virus is stimulating the patients immune system helping it recognize any recurring cancer cells and mop that up  This treatment is still in the early testing stages though Doctors recently used radiation therapy to treat a small localized tumor in Erholtzs body And the other patients in the trial did not go into remission Tests showed the virus helped shrink one womans tumors but they started growing again soon after The other patients cancers did not respond to the treatment  Researchers also dont know whether this virotherapy will help other patients or whether it can be applied to other types of cancer The measles virus worked with these multiple myeloma patients because they are already immunedeficient meaning their bodies cant fight off the virus before it has a chance to attack the cancer cells  More of the highly concentrated measles virus is being created now to be used in a larger clinical trial Mayo Clinic researchers say Theyve developed a manufacturing process that can produce large amounts of the virus Russell says  We recently have begun to think about the idea of a single shot cure for cancer  and thats our goal with this therapy he said
