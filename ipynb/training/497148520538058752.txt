A man who was hospitalized in New York City with Ebola-like symptoms doesn't have the deadly disease, officials said Wednesday. A blood sample analyzed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested negative for Ebola, said officials at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where the man was admitted on Monday. He had presented with symptoms associated with Ebola including a high fever and gastrointestinal problems and had just returned from an unspecified West African country, where the virus has been spreading.
