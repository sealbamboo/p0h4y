Fish is often called brain food Its an excellent source of lean protein rich in nutrients like omega fatty acids B   and iodine and pregnant women are encouraged to eat it Theres just one ah catch Fish also may have mercury which can harm the developing brain Two advocacy organizations   last week demanding that the agency require canned and packaged fish to carry labels informing consumers of the mercury content and that federal officials force grocery stores and fish markets to display information if they sell fish high in mercury The FDA long ago put out   but the groups say it should be at consumers fingertips when theyre shopping for dinner People shouldnt have to do detective work to get this information said Michael Bender executive director of the   one of the groups Agency officials said they could not comment because of the continuing litigation But will labels on a can of tuna do more harm than good  scaring people away from eating fish altogether Thats the concern of fishing industry representatives who note that consumption of fish and seafood dropped the last time the FDA issued warnings about mercury They argue that the benefits of eating fish are much greater than the possible harmful effects of mercury When environmental activists suggest that consumers not eat a healthy protein like seafood theyre doing more harm than good said Gavin Gibbons a spokesman for the   a nonprofit organization backed by the fishing and seafood industry The benefits outweigh the risks Many health experts are also cautious about the way they word their advice on the matter because they dont want Americans to forgo the benefits of fish and seafood in favor of say bacon cheeseburgers Worries over mercury in seafood stretch back decades confounding consumers who are told that fish and seafood are healthy especially for the developing fetus but hazardous in great amounts New research has helped tease out the benefits and the harms Edward Groth III an independent   consultant who prepared   on the effects of mercury on fetal brain development for the Mercury Policy Project agreed that women of childbearing age shouldnt just quit eating fish If women are eating less fish because theyre confused and theres some evidence thats the case then were not getting the result we want he said The secret is to get women to eat more lowmercury fish The debate has taken on added urgency because of new studies suggesting that mercury may cause subtle adverse effects at levels lower than those now considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency even as they reaffirm the cognitive benefits to children whose mothers ate fish while pregnant  and her colleagues at Harvard looked at the association between mothers fish intake and their infants cognitive scores at six months   that the babies performance on visual recognition memory tests increased a significant four points with each additional weekly serving of fish that the mother ate while pregnant But the researchers also measured mercury levels in the mothers hair and found that infants whose mothers had very high levels of mercury scored lower than the others for a drop of  points for every one part per million increase in mercury The bottom line The babies who scored highest were those whose mothers were among the top fish and seafood consumers eating it at least twice a week but who also had lower mercury levels Dr Okens study included only  pairs of mothers and infants but several other epidemiological studies in recent years have reported similar associations   found that children whose mothers ate fish and seafood during   were at a lower risk for impulsive and hyperactive behaviors but that prenatal exposure to low levels of mercury increased the risk for those behaviors Its a paradox but it highlights an important public health message that eating fish is really important for development but eating fish high in mercury  swordfish king mackerel fresh tuna  does pose a risk to neurodevelopment said Sharon Sagiv lead author of that study now an epidemiologist at the University of California Berkeley Though most studies have examined the effects of prenatal exposure to mercury the brain continues to develop through childhood and one study has suggested middleage adults could also be vulnerable to mercurys effects   adults who ate a highfish diet performed well on cognitive tasks but performance was impaired among those with higher blood mercury levels So whats a healthconscious fish eater to do For starters avoid eating large predatory fish that are high on the food chain The FDA lists   swordfish king mackerel shark and tilefish The Natural Resources Defense Council has   that includes orange roughy marlin and both ahi and bigeye tuna When it comes to canned tuna light tuna usually is the smaller skipjack with significantly less mercury than white albacore still the   no more than  ounces of light tuna a week and no more than six ounces of white tuna for women  even less for children The good news Many fish and shellfish are low in mercury including salmon shrimp and catfish as well as tilapia scallops oysters herring sardines and trout
