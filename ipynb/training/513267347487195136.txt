This week has been tough Maybe the toughest in the long drawnout battle against Ebola in West Africa Cases are   at an exponential rate Families dont have any place to take sick loved ones And researchers now say the epidemic could last for a   years But then at  pm on Friday a little nugget of joy and hope came through my email a   of Mamadee dancing and dancing quite well According to   Mamadee was diagnosed with   at a treatment center in   Liberia where only about a third of people have survived The yearold boy had to stay in isolation for more than two weeks And he lost his sister to   during that time But he never stopped dancing He jumps he ducks he steps to the side first left then right then left  swings his hips and shakes his arms Doctors Without Borders writes He doesnt stop and he doesnt get tired It is difficult to believe but Mamadee is an Ebolaconfirmed patient Even with a health worker standing by in a full protective suit check out the guy on the left at  Mamadee steals the show His spirit shines through Ebola be damned
