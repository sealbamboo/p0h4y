According to . , Mamadee was diagnosed with .  at a treatment center in . , Liberia, where only about a third of people have survived..

"He jumps, he ducks, he steps to the side, first left, then right, then left ... swings his hips and shakes his arms," Doctors Without Borders writes. "He doesn't stop, and he doesn't get tired.
