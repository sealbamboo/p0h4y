WASHINGTONâ€”The Food and Drug Administration is jettisoning its decades-old system to indicate the risks of prescription drugs to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, favoring instead a more-detailed explanation of potential hazards and benefits.. Each year in the U.S., more than six million women get pregnant, and on average, they take three to five prescription drugs during their pregnancy, according to the FDA. Currently they rely on system that uses the letters A, B, C, D and X to identify risks.
