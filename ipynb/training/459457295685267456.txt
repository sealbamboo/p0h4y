Drinking more coffee may decrease your risk of developing Type  diabetes a new study shows Researchers from Harvard University found that people who increased their coffee consumption by at least one cup per day over a period of years were  less likely to get Type  diabetes compared with people whose coffeedrinking habits didnt change On the flip side people who dialed back their coffee habit by at least one cup a day were  more likely to develop Type  diabetes The study was published Thursday in Diabetologia the journal of the European Assn for the Study of Diabetes Previous studies have found a correlation between coffee consumption and a lowered risk of Type  diabetes but this was the first study to look at how changes in coffee consumption affect that risk Coffee is pretty fascinating said Shilpa Bhupathiraju a nutritional epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the paper It seems to be associated with a lower risk for many chronic diseases The findings in this study are based on statistical analysis of three longterm and largescale studies that  tracked the diet lifestyle and medical conditions of more than  medical professionals over the course of  years Previous work has shown that chemical compounds in coffee not the caffeine are likely responsible for the association between coffee drinking and lower risk of Type  diabetes We know that phenolic compounds in coffee improves glucose metabolism in animal models Bhupathiraju said Coffee is also a really good source of magnesium which has been associated with a lower risk of Type  diabetes If that is the case drinking more uncaffeinated coffee should be just as effective as drinking more caffeinated coffee in lowering the risk of Type  diabetes In this study the researchers found that changes in decaffeinated coffee consumption had no statistical effect on risk That may be because not enough participants made a major change in their decaf coffee drinking the authors note But before you run out to refill your Starbucks card keep in mind that increasing the amount of coffee you drink is just one part of keeping Type  diabetes at bay You cant get at causality with these studies Bhupathiraju said You need a healthy body weight a good diet and a healthy lifestyle Coffee consumption in the context of all this is associated with a lower risk However she said that as long as coffee doesnt make you jittery or keep you from sleeping theres no reason you shouldnt drink up
