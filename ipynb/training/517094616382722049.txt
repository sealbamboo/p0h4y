Younger bowel cancer patients should be offered a genetic test to screen for a rare condition linked to a higher risk of further cancers say researchers Genetic screening of tumours would save lives and would be costeffective for the NHS a new study has confirmed Lynch syndrome raises the risk of developing cancer particularly bowel cancer and womb and ovarian cancers   Teenager Stephen Sutton who raised millions of pounds for cancer research had a family history of the syndrome This is a way of improving the health of people with Lynch syndrome who currently dont know they have it said Dr Tristan Snowsill of the   Coresearcher Dr Ian Frayling of Cardiff Universitys   added Now the cost of genetic testing is coming down there is a good argument for younger bowel cancer patients to be screened It will save lives and save money for the NHS Lynch syndrome accounts for around one in  cases of bowel cancer in people aged under  Around a third of people with the disease will go on to develop bowel cancer by the time they are  if no action is taken  Close relatives have a  chance of Lynch syndrome but can be offered riskreducing measures such as regular colonoscopies if they are identified early Screening for the genetic condition in unders would be costeffective for the NHS and prevent new cases in both them and their relatives a review of evidence has found  The test is used in some UK hospitals but has not been rolled out nationally It is offered to all bowel cancer patients in Denmark and to patients under the age of  in Norway and the Netherlands Deborah Alsina chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK said while bowel cancer is relatively rare in people under   people in this age group lose their lives to the cancer each year Its critical that more lives are saved by ensuring people gain access to the screening surveillance they need so that bowel cancer can be ruled out first not last in younger patients The research is published in
