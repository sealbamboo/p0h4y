Theres plenty of evidence that spanking paddling or hitting children doesnt improve their behavior in the long run and actually makes it worse But the science never trumps emotion according to   head of the Yale Parenting Center and author of   After NFL star Adrian Peterson was indicted for child abuse after disciplining his yearold son by hitting him with a switch theres been a lot of conversation about how   affect parents approach to discipline OK what about the science Behavioral psychologists say that people respond very predictably to others words and actions and parents can use that predictability to improve childrens behavior without shouting or hitting We talked with Kazdin by phone about why parents use corporal punishment and what options they have for teaching good behavior Here are highlights of that conversation There are three reasons Kazdin says The brain is hardwired to pick up negative things in the environment this is just how humans and mammals are So parents naturally pay more attention to a childs bad behavior rather than to all the good things they may be doing the rest of the day Second there is increasing evidence that watching or engaging in aggressive behavior excites the reward centers in the brain giving an incentive for aggression And the third context is the Bible Kazdin says Some religions view hitting the child use of the rod not just as all right but obligatory Youre not living up to your responsibility if youre not hitting your child Those things are really critical Its nice for me to say Heres the science but if its contextfree its silly I see parents who abuse their children all the time and almost always they know its not working The children dont change their behavior So the parent thinks You need something stronger than me talking I need to hit you or shake you Unfortunately children adapt to it When youre drowning you cant teach someone how to swim Kazdin says We dont reason with them we dont moralize with them we dont tell them about the science That kind of talking doesnt influence behavior Instead Kazdin has parents practice what theyll say to a child with words carefully chosen to get a specific response The goal is to teach children to respond differently without the problem behavior What happens before a child misbehaves is critical Kazdin says Knowing that gives parents the opportunity to head off bad behavior before it happens We know when a parent comes home from a stressful day at work theyre going to get more noncompliance Kazdin says Nobodys at fault But we know that the tone of voice that a parent uses after a stressful day increases the odds that a child will not be compliant You put choice in there even if its not a real choice Kazdin says  Would you put on your red coat or your green coat and were going out You put please in front If you put please in front of a parental request it changes your tone of voice Parents typically think of consequences as punishment but decades of research in behavioral psychology has shown that promptly praising a child for good behavior is much more effective in improving behavior than punishment Kazdin says Punishment should be brief simple and used sparingly That change wont happen in a day alas But small changes can make a big difference Kazdin says He says he cant give specific advice without knowing more about me and my child but the gist would go something like this Youd say Can we sit down at the piano and play for two or three minutes together Then youd say See if you can do one minute by yourself You might not be able to because its something that teenagers can do But see if you can do it Come back in one minute And at the end ask her to teach you something that she learned Do that for a few days and stretch out the period of time when youre gone Then when you come back you say Are you sure youre not a teenager Did you have a few birthdays when Im not looking Then shell laugh like you are And if you can end the session where she gets to choose something Chopsticks or scales thats critical Make it so its enjoyable And give her one day of the week where she can say Not today Im not practicing today Freedom for a nottoday day The funny thing is its not rocket science Kazdin says But implementation is hard If you were here we would practice it we would sit down at the piano together
