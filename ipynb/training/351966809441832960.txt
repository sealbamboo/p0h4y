Fouryearold Orion Qurbonaliev is lucky to be alive Just last February the little boy was lying comatose in the tuberculosis ward of a hospital in southern Tajikistan The bacteria had spread to his spine and paralyzed the right side of his body He was severely dehydrated and malnourished The staff on the governmentrun ward had run out of options for treating Orion They just left this kid to die says Tina Martin a nurse with   But Martin wouldnt accept that his case was hopeless We said He doesnt have to die Well fight and see what happens Martin pushed for an intense treatment at the hospital with antibiotics to fight the TB bacteria and steroids to reduce the inflammation around his spine Three months later Orion had recovered enough to return home Although   is curable and relatively easy to prevent it continues to be one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world It flourishes among the poorest of the poor Tight living quarters inadequate health care and lack of knowledge all help stoke TB epidemics Left untreated tuberculosis can consume a persons lungs spread throughout the body and eventually be fatal But ventilation and simple infection control measures can significantly cut the transmission of the airborne bacteria Orions family lives in a cluster of mudwalled houses outside the city of   Tajikistan near the Afghan border Cows are tethered in the dusty dirt yard Turkeys chickens and dogs wander through a whirlwind of children When Martin comes to check on Orion hes lying on a small mat on the porch of the main house Orion still cant walk or speak but hes slowly regaining movement in the right side of his body He smiles broadly at Martin when she runs a stethoscope over his chest Hes not malnourished anymore she says Hes still not speaking He has some deficits He needs a lot of rehabilitation but hes actually doing a lot better The fouryearold boy has gained almost  pounds since Martin first met him in February Martin is now worried about the rest of Orions family and wanders which ones may at risk of getting TB Orions older brother Higeron was recently hospitalized with the illness The difficulty with treating tuberculosis is that it takes months of antibiotics sometimes even years to drive the bacteria out of a persons body Orions grandmother has been on and off TB treatment for years and Martin has just confirmed that she still has active infectious TB As Martin examines Orion she tries to stress to the rest of the family that they need to take steps to limit the spread of the TB bacteria in their household Cover a cough with your arm Wash your hands Open a window But Orions grandmother Kholbibi Abdulloeva doesnt want to discuss this Martin is about to run up against another major obstacle to eliminating TB everywhere even    deeply held misunderstandings about how the disease is transmitted The grandmother insists that TB comes from the cold and that Orion got it from swimming in the cold river He likes fish Abdulloeva says of her grandson So he was saying Fish fish and going to the river Thats why he got the TB Martin insists to the Abdulloeva that TB is spread through the air The yearold woman flatly dismisses the nurses explanation No its from cold Abdulloeva says Orions grandfather Mahmadaly Qurbonaliev next suggests that a local clergyman may have put a spell on the boy and thats why he still cannot walk Younger members of Orions vast extended family are more open to the idea that TB is an airborne infection But they are still reluctant to talk about it Its shameful just to have a family member with TB says Orions cousin Dilshod Ghazoev Even if they kill me Im not going to tell anyone that I have TB the yearold cousin says Because Im going to be ashamed of that People are   of the disease and dont want to be around anyone who has it Ghazoev saysIf I have TB Ill have less friends People wont talk to me Tajikistan is the poorest country in Central Asia and it   the highest rate of TB in the region This is not a coincidence The countrys clinics and hospitals are overcrowded and underfunded The winters are bitterly cold and families tend to crowd together in one heated room Nurses like Martin are doing their best to bring clear information to every village but myth and superstition about TB persist Some people even think the coughing and wasting away is a genetic condition Martin says Father has TB daughter has TB granddaughter has TB  you can understand in a way why they believe its genetic Shame may be the most powerful obstacle of all A girl is shunned if shes had tuberculosis She may have difficulties getting married later in life So they try to hide TB Martin says We find that is a big problem
