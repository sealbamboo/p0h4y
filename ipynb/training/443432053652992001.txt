Pregnant women who are obese can cost the NHS over a third more than women of healthy weight a Swansea University study has found The average cost of treating an obese pregnant woman was  compared to  for one who was not overweight said the College of Medicine The researchers analysed body mass index measures from  pregnant women The BMA recommended women thinking about becoming pregnant should try to become fit and healthy in advance To come up with the total cost the researchers adjusted for factors such as age class health and smoking and looked at the womens total usage of NHS services including GP visits medication and any inpatient or outpatient treatment The study only looked at the mothers use of services and not any involving the baby A healthy weight is classed as having a   BMI of  to  The research found costs to the NHS per pregnancy were  higher for overweight women classed as having a BMI of  to  and  higher for those classed as obese a BMI of over  Both overweight and obese women spent on average  more days in hospital and had between  greater usage of all healthcare services The additional costs to the NHS across the UK added up to anywhere between m and m The researchers said if money was invested in preventing obesity in young women prior to pregnancy it would save the NHS money and also give better health outcomes for both the mother and baby They described the statistic that one in  pregnant women was severely obese during pregnancy as one of the biggest challenges presented to maternity services within the UK Lead researcher Kelly Morgan said Our study shows that the extra costs of obesity in pregnancy are significant and our figures are conservative as they exclude areas such as absenteeism from work In addition other evidence shows that maternal obesity is often associated with poorer health in the children which in turn creates extra cost Susanne Darra head of midwifery studies at Swansea University said The study demonstrates how much may be spent on interventions to prevent obesity in pregnancy in order to remain costeffective Dr Mark Temple a member of BMA Cymrus Welsh Committee for Public Health Medicine told BBC Wales I know that the Welsh Medical Committee suggested to the Welsh government that they had to response to the obesogenic environment Im delighted somebodys done the research and Im delighted that its happened locally The results are no surprise Dr Temple said in reference to a call last week from the World Health Organisation to halve the amount of sugar people consume It would be nice if Wales led the way on this He said governments had to think about taking legislative measures to tackle the problem The free market is not a good idea he added He said measures to control things like the location of fast food outlets were important Dr Temple added Whilst we all recognise that obesity is a major problem it is most important that those women who are obese are not made to feel that it is their fault because blaming the victim is something governments have been in a habit of doing
