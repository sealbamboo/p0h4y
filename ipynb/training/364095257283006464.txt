
 Katherine Ford visited her father Dean Piercy a World War II veteran with dementia at a nursing home in Roanoke Va for months before she noticed the dust on his electric toothbrush His teeth she found had not been brushed recently so she began doing it herself after their lunches together But after he complained of a severe unrelenting headache she said she badgered the staff to make an appointment for him with his dentist The dentist found that a tooth had broken in two and he showed Ms Ford the part that had lodged in the roof of her fathers mouth I was livid said Ms Ford  a court reporter Im there every day pointing out hes in pain  and he had dental insurance So theres no reason this wasnt addressed In nursing homes across the country residents like Mr Piercy are plagued by cavities gum disease and cracked teeth in part because their mouths are not kept clean  While residents now require more dental care than in the past nursing home employees are rarely prepared to provide it Aides are swamped with other tasks and when older charges must be helped to the toilet fed or repositioned in bed brushing their teeth often falls to the bottom of the todo list Even when care is available few staff members are trained to cope with the rising numbers of residents with dementia who   routine dental hygiene I always say you can measure quality in a nursing home by looking in peoples mouths because its one of the last things to be taken care of said Dr Judith A Jones chairwoman of the department of general dentistry at Boston University Aides change someones Depends change a catheter or turn somebody every few hours but teeth often dont get brushed twice a day The neglect can lead to terrible pain for the residents Worse  suggest that this problem may be contributing to another   a leading   ofÂ  institutionalized older people The lack of daily oral care in nursing facilities is an epidemic thats almost universally overlooked said Dr Sarah J Dirks a dentist who treats nursing home residents in San Antonio There are no current   but since  at least seven states have evaluated residents using a survey developed by the   One was Kansas where dental hygienists examined  older residents in  longtermcare facilities Nearly  percent of the residents had substantial oral debris on at least twothirds of their teeth according to a   issued by the Kansas Bureau of Oral Health More than onethird had untreated decay The screeners saw plenty of fillings and crowns but concluded that regular dental care has become a thing of the past for many of the residents In Wisconsin nearly  residents from  homes were examined About  percent had teeth broken to the gums with visible roots  percent had substantial oral debris The problem has been graphically documented in state and federal inspections of nursing homes In Texas inspectors noted one resident with memory problems in too much pain to eat her lower gums red swollen and packed with food debris  of five facilities in upstate New York found only  percent of residents received any oral care at all Among those who did average tooth brushing time was  seconds Supplies like toothbrushes were scarce the report said At the Raleigh Court Health and Rehabilitation Center in Roanoke where Mr Piercy was a resident the administrator Mark Tubbs said in a statement that he could not discuss Mr Piercys case because of federal privacy laws and he could not corroborate Ms Fords account All patients receive medically necessary highquality care including oral care and hygiene Mr Tubbs said Just as nursing home workers are expected to help residents bathe or reposition them to avoid bed sores they are supposed to brush the teeth of residents who cannot do it themselves So important is this task that it was federally mandated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  which set new standards for nursing homes They should be getting their care but a lot of people dont acknowledged Dr David Gifford the senior vice president of quality at the   a trade group representing twothirds of nursing homes nationwide Some residents decline help he noted and nursing home employees can do little about it Its a very personal thing to have someone else brush your teeth Dr Gifford said A lot of residents dont want it dont like it and will ask not to have it Many arrive at nursing homes with poor teeth he added after long periods without seeing a dentist Certainly oral care can be a vexing challenge for nursing homes Older Americans are more likely than ever to retain their natural teeth Edentulism total tooth loss in older people declined from  to    Before they came in with dentures said Barbara J Smith the manager of geriatric and specialneeds populations at the American Dental Association Now its a whole different ballgame Dentures are easier for nursing home staff to clean Nearly twothirds of those who stay in a nursing home long term have dementia and many resist oral care clenching their mouth shut or even trying to hit aides The National Institutes of Health is financing research to address such resistance among nursing home residents with dementia Many prescription drugs  including some antidepressants medications for high blood pressure and antiseizure medications    and   the mouth Without daily oral care older people taking such drugs are especially prone to a relatively rapid deterioration said Dr Ira Lamster a dentist and a professor of health policy at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia The consequences are not limited to cavities and gum disease   researchers first linked oral bacteria to the occurrence of hospitalacquired pneumonia in older people a   has shown that oral care  from regular brushing to professional dental care  might reduce the risk Roughly one in  cases of deaths from pneumonia in nursing homes could be prevented by improving oral hygiene according to   published in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society But even when residents and their families know that better oral care is needed paying for it can be a challenge Medicare does not cover routine dental care like cleanings and fillings Most states provide at least some dental services to adults on Medicaid but coverage varies widely and finding a local dentist who accepts Medicaid payments can be difficult More than  states allow dental hygienists to provide some treatment without specific authorization from a dentist according to the   But medical directors at nursing facilities do not necessarily see the value of having a dental hygienist on contract or on staff said Shirley Gutkowski a dental hygienist of  years who educates nursinghome workers in Wisconsin Dr Dirks the Texas dentist said she would be surprised if oral care was even on the radar of the medical directors at nursing homes Indeed her group practice used to contract with  nursing homes but now works only with  that make oral health a priority For change to occur she said every nursing home needs an oral care champion
