As the country awaits two important Supreme Court decisions involving state laws on   a small but consistent body of research suggests that laws that ban gay marriage  or approve it  can affect the mental health of gay lesbian and bisexual Americans When several states passed laws to prohibit samesex marriage for example the mental health of gay residents seemed to suffer while stressrelated disorders dropped in at least one state after gay marriage was legalized Heres the research trail Beginning around  several states banned gay marriage Just before that series of bans the National Institutes of Health happened to conduct a massive   of  Americans The questions elicited detailed information about respondents mental health To validate what people reported about themselves psychiatrists also interviewed samples of the people in the survey and their medical diagnoses closely matched the findings of the survey Soon after the wave of state bans on gay marriage in  and  the NIMH conducted a second round of interviews managing to reach  of the original respondents Thats a high rate compared with most polls and surveys Mark Hatzenbuehler a psychologist at Columbia University who studies the health effects of social policies analyzed the data gathered before and after the bans to determine how the mental health of people who identified themselves as gay lesbian or bisexual had changed in those states Hatzenbuehler and his colleagues Katie McLaughlin Katherine Keyes and Deborah Hasin published their   in  in the  Lesbian gay and bisexual individuals who lived in the states that banned samesex marriage experienced a significant increase in psychiatric disorders   says There was a  percent increase in mood disorders he says a  percent increase in alcoholuse disorders and  I think really strikingly  a  percent increase in generalized anxiety disorders To put those numbers in perspective although Hatzenbuehler did find more than a doubling in the rate of anxiety disorders in states that eventually banned gay marriage in absolute numbers he found that anxiety disorders went from being reported among  percent to  percent of gay lesbian and bisexual people The milliondollar question is whether the laws and the debates around them were responsible for the change in mental health To help answer that question Hatzenbuehler and his colleagues looked at comparable groups and experiences We showed the psychiatric disorders did not increase in lesbian gay and bisexual populations in states that didnt debate and vote on samesex marriages Hatzenbuehler says There were also no increases  or much smaller increases  among heterosexuals living in the states that passed samesex marriage bans Hatzenbuehler has also found in a study conducted in Massachusetts that gay men experienced fewer stressrelated disorders after that state permitted gay marriage In a   tracking the health of  gay men in Massachusetts Hatzenbuehler found that the men visited doctors less often and had lower health treatment costs after Massachusetts legalized samesex marriage When the researchers examined the diagnostic codes doctors were giving the men they saw a decrease in disorders that have been linked to stress such as hypertension depression and adjustment disorders Hatzenbuehler says he thinks stress associated with gaymarriage debates was the X factor He says the quantitative data is backed by what gays lesbians and bisexuals told the surveyors They reported multiple stressors during that period Hatzenbuehler says They reported seeing negative media portrayals antigay graffiti They talked about experiencing a loss of safety and really feeling like these amendments and these policies were really treating them as secondclass citizens Today about threedozen states   gay marriage and about a dozen have passed laws that   it Some states have laws that permit civil unions but ban gay marriage Its unclear how or whether the upcoming Supreme Court decisions involving the constitutionality of   will affect the mental and physical health of gays and lesbians nationally Its likely that many gay lesbian and bisexual people would see an upholding of samesex marriage bans as an example of prejudice But its also possible the debate around the Supreme Court decisions could have different effects on gays than a local debate involving friends and neighbors Hatzenbuehler says his larger point is really that policymakers judicial leaders and ordinary citizens need to remember that social policies are also health policies
