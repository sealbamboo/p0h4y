Taking drugs like aspirin acetaminophen or ibuprofen when you have the flu reduces fever and makes you feel better but it may have unintended consequences A new study using mathematical projections has concluded that the use of antifever drugs during flu epidemics increases disease transmission both by raising the amount of flu virus shed and increasing the interaction that flu sufferers have with uninfected people Fever fights viruses by reducing their ability to reproduce Reducing fever defeats this effect increasing the rate and duration of viral shedding Were not saying to avoid these drugs said the senior author David JD Earn a professor of mathematics at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario But if you take them theres this effect thats not obvious The authors of the study   acknowledge that their numbers are not precise especially since it is difficult to estimate the effect of social interactions But by incorporating various known factors  the quantities of antifever drugs sold the reproduction rate of viruses and others  they calculate that at least  deaths and many more serious illnesses could be avoided annually by not using these drugs at all With antifever medicine and the flu Dr Earn said The real message is straightforward Its better to stay home and keep your child at home so you dont infect others
