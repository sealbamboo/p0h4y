Can you teach empathy Scientists using a new combination of brain scans and oldfashioned biofeedback techniques say they helped people focus and boost their feelings of affection and empathy They hope to finesse their approach into a way to help treat people with mental illnesses such as postpartum depression and say it might even be used to help some people ranging from those with mild autism to outright psychopaths And they say theirs is the first study to map the complex emotions associated with empathy in the brain Other groups have been mapping single brain regions related to emotions but to map complex emotions such as empathy it is important to look at several parts of the brain at the same time said Jorge Moll of the Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Unit at DOr Institute for Research and Education IDOR in Rio de Janeiro Brazil We were interested in emotions that drive us to do altruistic acts to try to correct our mistakes to try to be better people he told NBC News We wanted not only to map these emotions but to allow people to train these emotions The idea isnt completely new In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Philip Dicks  novel and later in Ridley Scotts film Blade Runner societal cohesion depended on the empathy box Molls team writes Although prospects of such a device remain in the realm of science fiction recent advances in neuroscience and computer science have opened a window towards this possibility It took a while to train the computer to recognize the brain patterns associated with general feelings of tenderness They did it by getting people to sit in a functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI brain scanner which measures realtime brain activity and then asking them to think about tender moments You ask them to go back in their lives and identify moments that were very important for them in which they felt feelings of empathy and tenderness said Moll He tried it himself thinking about a time when he hugged his children The feelings were so overwhelming he said that it was hard to distract himself People were also asked to think about times when they felt pride in something they did and to think neutral thoughts also such as remembering a recent trip groceryshopping We wanted to measure very specific brain patterns Moll said The computer program compared the brain activity of the three emotional states to map out patterns specific to tender empathetic thoughts Next  volunteers were asked to try to control these thoughts and feelings For the experiment Molls team devised a ringlike image that would become more focused the more a volunteers brain patterns fit the template of empathetic feelings As a control some of the volunteers were told to focus their feelings using randomly generated images of the rings that they were told represented nothing specific We ask them to try to hold the feeling to feel it as strongly as possible Moll said It worked People who were given feedback on their brain patterns were able to strengthen them Molls team reports in the Public Library of Science  This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tendernessaffection unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior they wrote The approach needs a lot of finetuning Moll stresses But he envisions helping people who are having trouble controlling angry or violent emotions You could see a use for someone with antisocial personality disorder he said You could use it to reduce unwanted feelings It might also help treat people with developmental conditions such as autism some forms of which are marked by an inability to read and understand other peoples emotions And Molls team is also working to study psychopaths although he hasnt tried the fMRIbiofeedback technique on one yet Maybe it wouldnt work with a true psychopath who never felt a droplet of tender feelings he said But not all people have extreme symptoms and it might help some people understand that reading and mirroring others emotions could work in their own selfinterest
