In inner cities and poor rural areas across the country public health advocates have been working hard to turn around    neighborhoods where fresh produce is scarce and greasy fast food abounds In many cases theyre converting dingy cramped corner markets into lighter brighter venues that offer fresh fruits and vegetables In some cases theyre building brand   The presumption is if you build a store people are going to come says   professor in the departments of sociology anthropology and demography at Penn State University To check that notion he and colleagues from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently   residents of one lowincome community in Philadelphia before and after the opening of a glistening new supermarket brimming with fresh produce What theyre finding Matthews says is a bit surprising We dont find any difference at all  We see no effect of the store on fruit and vegetable consumption Now to be fair the time was short The store was only open for six months before residents were surveyed Matthews says most residents knew that the store was there and that it offered healthy food But only  percent said it was their regular go to market And as might be expected those who lived close to the store shopped there most regularly Matthews says the findings   with other work and simply point to the obvious Lots more intervention is needed to change behavior For one thing were all used to routine and many of us will just keep shopping where weve been shopping even if a newer more convenient and bountiful store moves in But more than that he says many people   just arent used to buying or preparing healthy meals  they havent had the opportunity until now  a public health researcher at the University of California Los Angeles agrees that providing access to nutritious food is only the first step The next part of the intervention is to create demand he says so the community wants to come to the store and buy healthy fruits and vegetables and go home and prepare those foods in a healthy way without lots of fat salt or sugar Ortega directs a UCLA   that converts corner stores into hubs of healthy fare in lowincome neighborhoods of East Los Angeles He and colleagues work with community leaders and local high school students to help create that demand for nutritious food Posters and signs promoting fresh fruits and vegetables hang in corner stores such as the   in Boyle Heights and at bus stops There are nutrition education classes in local schools and cooking classes in the stores themselves Weve prepared smoothies healthy snacks fruit salads vegetables green salads and quesadillas loaded with vegetables says Ortega I had a mother who approached me to tell me she had learned a lot from prior cooking demonstrations about healthy eating he says and because of what she learned about nutrition and about reducing saturated fats and sodium and increasing fiber intake in her diet she lost over  pounds And her daughter lost  pounds This is a really important achievement he notes in an area struggling with obesity and all its related health problems including   The jurys still out on whether these conversions of corner stores are actually changing peoples diets and health The evidence is still being collected But the hope of course Ortega says is that creating demand for healthy food as well as improving access will make a difference in what residents eat  and ultimately in their weight and health
