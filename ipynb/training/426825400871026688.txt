Momstobe are often reminded that theyre eating for two Its tempting to take this as an excuse to go for that extra scoop of the ice cream Believe me Ive been there But a solid body of research suggests that expectant mothers should be walking away with the opposite message Pregnancy should be a time to doubledown on healthful eating if you want to avoid setting up your unborn child for a lifetime of wrestling with obesity Now   published this week offers tantalizing clues from mice of one way that a poor maternal diet may be laying the groundwork for obesity by rewiring a part of the brain thats critical to regulating appetite And these changes appear to happen in the third trimester of pregnancy suggest the findings which appear in the journal   First its crucial to stress that were talking about mouse moms here not human ones Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine and the   in Germany used them to find out how maternal diet influenced brain development in offspring So they played around with feeding mouse mothers a highfat diet before and during pregnancy and lactation Pups born to obese mothers had different metabolic profiles than those of pups from mothers who were on a normal diet explains study coauthor   a professor of neurobiology and obstetrics at Yale Specifically he says the pups whose mothers ate a highfat diet while they were in utero had impaired connections in brain neurons that regulate glucose and help control when theyre hungry and full and how fat gets broken down That wasnt entirely unexpected since plenty of studies in animals and humans have established that obese mothers beget obese children What really surprised the researchers says Horvath is that these neural changes also showed up in the offspring of mice who werent obese but were fed the highfat diet only during lactation This period of brain development in mice corresponds to the third trimester of pregnancy in humans This suggests that even normalweight momstobe need to watch their diet if they want to avoid setting the stage for obesity in their kids he says But it also suggests that researchers should look more closely at late pregnancy as a period when it might not be too late to intervene in a moms diet to help break the cycle of obesity This study is another important piece to the puzzle that earlylife influences can have longlasting consequences to the offspring says   a Harvard researcher who studies obesity in children He warns though that we should be careful in how far we extrapolate the findings to humans After all he notes humans and rodents diverged in evolution  million years ago For one thing Ludwig says a highfat diet for rodents isnt the same as one for humans so we cant apply the findings directly to human moms But that said the general principle that nutrition in the womb and during early life is key to longterm health risks like obesity still applies says Ludwig who directs the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Childrens Hospital Its not simply genetics or home environment that explains a familys tendency toward obesity he says Last October Ludwig and his colleagues published a   of more than  mothers and their more than  children To factor out the role of genes and environment the researchers looked only at siblings comparing how much weight a mother gained in different pregnancies and how that related to her childrens weight years later Maternal weight gain he notes is a good proxy for the quality of diet during pregnancy They found that kids born to moms who put on too much weight  which they defined as  pounds or more  during pregnancy had an increased risk of becoming obese even more than  years down the road The takeaway message for expectant mothers he says is that regardless of your genes what you eat during those  weeks of pregnancy really does matter Genes at this point are not modifiable whereas diet and pregnancy weight gain are
