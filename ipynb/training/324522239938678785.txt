Strangers quickly came to the aid of yearold Aaron Hern a California boy severely wounded by shrapnel from a bomb that exploded while he waited to take pictures of his mother finishing her first Boston Marathon I found him there on the sidewalk with a few other people who were injured his father Alan Hern said Wednesday on TODAY I could see the wound in his leg He was scared and obviously in pain And so people came to help us pretty quickly Im not sure who they were The Hern family was waiting for Aarons mother to cross the finish line when the second of two bombs sent metal fragments searing into the boys hip and thigh  Someone attending to Aaron used a belt as a tourniquet to stem the legs bleeding It wasnt bleeding heavily but it didnt look very good like a war wound Hern said Luckily they got him on an ambulance pretty quickly The boy who turns  in just a few weeks is now resting really comfortably in the intensive care unit of Bostons Childrens Hospital Hes been through a lot A couple of times yesterday he opened his eyes He knew we were there His mother and I were with him Hern said He actually tried to talk We figured out that he was worried about the breathing tube He wasnt sure what that was all about We told him that everything was all right David Mooney director of Children Hospitals trauma program said his team was prepared for the sudden rush of patients but they still found the work difficult  We drill for this We drill over and over again and we had assembled a great crew down in the emergency department ready and waiting to receive the kids we thought we would get he said But when the kids arrived it was a tough moment The kids were all pretty badly hurt
