In the past week world leaders have started using a mathematical term when they talk about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa Its spreading and growing   President Obama   Tuesday This is a disease outbreak that is advancing in an   fashion said Dr David Nabarro who is heading the UNs effort against Ebola So what does this mean If nothing changes in the next few weeks we could see at least  cases by the end of  Heres why Right now weve had more than  cases of Ebola and at least  people have died Some scientists like   at Northeastern University in Boston are taking numbers like that and putting them into computer models to see where this epidemic is going For instance in our modeling by midOctober were already between  to  cases he says Five thousand cases of Ebola is bad  to  is unbelievable And thats where the exponential curve comes into play Well an exponential curve is a curve that doubles every certain amount of time Vespignani says And with this outbreak cases are doubling every three to four weeks So if help doesnt arrive in time  and the growth rate stays the same  then  Ebola cases in midOctober could turn into  cases by midNovember and  cases by midDecember And you see that right away you get very scary numbers Vespignani says So every day or week that goes by the epidemic gets harder and harder to control The number of cases rises The number of beds doctors and nurses needed to stop it just keeps going up Quicker and quicker The actual number of cases is likely higher than whats been reported the World Health Organization says so the models are underestimating the situation The window of opportunity is closing in a sense Vespignani says And thats why its very important to understand that this is the moment to act When we first heard about these numbers they sounded a bit alarmist But then a few other modelers   their own models The forecast is consistent Theres exponential growth with somewhere around  cases by midOctober One set of projections comes from   an associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health Hes making   of the Ebola epidemic for the US government When he first saw the results of his models the numbers were so high that he was afraid to make them public I didnt want to scare people Shaman says But were really in uncharted territory here Weve never had a sustained outbreak of Ebola like this certainly nothing of this magnitude Before we all start panicking which I have been working hard not to do myself the world did get some welcome news this week On Tuesday President Obama   plans for the US military to provide  hospital beds in West Africa It will also help set up training facilities for health care workers But will  beds be enough to turn the tide Well I hope so Shaman says I know that doesnt give you a very good answer Heres the thing about the exponential curve Tiny changes in how the virus spreads can make a huge difference in the number of cases If these countries could get even a little bit of help  perhaps slow the spread so that sick people only infect one person instead of two  it dramatically cuts the total cases Shaman is predicting for October For our improved scenario Shaman says we have about  cases instead of  by Oct  Now we do need to remember that these models come with a lot of caveats For starters theyre all based largely on the epidemics growth rate in the past and a whole of slew of assumptions about how the virus spreads And the models dont do a good job of making predictions far out into the future Just like with weather forecasts the further out you go the more uncertain it is But Shaman says theres one thing they are sure of Help needs to come fast Because even if the new US aid starts to slow down the epidemic next week it will take a year or a year and a half to wipe out Ebola from West Africa
