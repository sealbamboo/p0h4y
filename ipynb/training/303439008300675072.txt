It was her own experience with debilitating side effects after cancer treatment that led Dr   to realize that there is a huge gap in care that keeps cancer patients from getting the rehabilitation services that could help them Silver was  in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer Even though she is a physician she was shocked at the toll chemotherapy and radiation took on her body Silver was dealing with extreme fatigue weakness and pain I was really really sick  sicker than I ever imagined says Silver who is an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School I did some exercise testing and I tested out as a woman in my s So I had aged three decades in a matter of months through cancer treatment Silver went to her oncology team for help They told her to go home and heal The conversation should have been Were going send you to cancer rehab to help you get stronger  she says But thats not what happened and after Silver came to realize that her experience was typical she set out to change the system for other patients In  she started a program designed to offer cancer survivors rehabilitation therapy after treatment Its called    for Survivorship Training and Rehab  and is now offered in nearly all US states The program is growing   showing that many of the qualityoflife problems cancer survivors have are physical and can be helped with rehab Physical therapist   is a STARtrained therapist who works with cancer patients in Westborough Mass Ive seen cases where someone has had a lot of pain and theyve done scans and its not a malignancy And maybe they have done exploratory surgery to see what is happening and not really finding much except a lot of scar tissue says Goyette I am able to get a lot of relief and a lot of times patients dont need to have further intervention They dont want to be on the narcotics for the pain management They would rather come here One of Goyettes clients is yearold cancer survivor Deborah Leonard For two years after her treatment for early stage breast cancer Leonard had swelling pain and a large mass in her breast  which was not cancer Clearly I didnt have that before the surgery because the tumor was so small and this was much bigger and it just kept getting bigger says Leonard By nighttime my breast was extremely swollen and very painful At first doctors thought Leonard might have an infection and gave her antibiotics When that didnt work they did another surgery to remove scar tissue But the problem returned Her doctors were suggesting a third surgery when Leonard finally found Goyette After three sessions with Goyette doing what is called lymphatic drainage Leonard felt much better Goyette uses manual pressure to clear Leonards lymphatic system allowing the buildup of fluid causing Leonards pain and swelling to subside I had a inch mass that is now down to half its size says Leonard Im sleeping at night I have energy again More people need to know about this because you dont have to be a martyr and grin and bear it This works The issues are different for every type of cancer Head and neck cancer patients may need swallowing and speech therapy Blood cancer patients may need therapy similar to cardiac rehab to rebuild their strength and stamina Patients treated for colon cancer can get help from physical therapists with back pain and abdominal swelling Most insurers do cover rehab for cancer patients but sometimes patients must battle to get more than the standard nine to  sessions Another barrier to care is that too few oncologists and cancer surgeons refer their patients to rehab The Commission on Cancer the arm of the American College of Surgeons that accredits cancer programs in US hospitals however recently announced   aimed at improving care for survivors of cancer including better access to rehabilitation therapy
