BOSTON  David Baldwin wasnt sure how he had come across the other day in group therapy at the hospital near the coop apartment where he lives with his rescue cat Zoey He struggles with bipolar disorder severe anxiety and depression Like so many patients he secretly wondered what his therapist thought of him But unlike those patients Mr Baldwin  was able to find out swiftly and privately Pulling his black leather swivel chair to his desk he logged onto a hospital website and eagerly perused his therapists session notes The clinical social worker Stephen ONeill wrote that Mr Baldwins selfconsciousness about his disorder kept him isolated Because he longed to connect with others this was particularly selfdefeating Mr ONeill observed But during the session he had also discussed how he had helped out neighbors in his coop This seems greatly appreciated and he noted his clear enjoyment in helping others Mr ONeill wrote This greatly assists his selfesteem A smile animated Mr Baldwins broad amiable features I have a tough time recognizing that Ive made progress he said So its nice to read this as a reminder Mental health patients do not have the ready access to office visit notes that increasingly   But Mr Baldwin is among about  patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who are participating in a novel experiment Within days of a session they can read their therapists notes on their computers or smartphones The hope is that this transparency will improve therapeutic trust and communication Were creating a revolution said   a professor of medicine at Harvard and a proponent of giving patients access to notes by therapists as well as by physicians Some people are aghast The pilot project has raised questions in the mental health community Which patients will benefit and which might be harmed How will the notes alter a therapeutic relationship built on facetoface exchanges What will be the impact on confidentiality and privacy And the project presents difficult choices for those who argue for parity between medical and mental health patients Should patients with schizophrenia for example who may stop taking their medication after reading that they are doing well have the same access to treatment notes as those with irritable bowel syndrome But the lingering underlying question is do patients really want to know what their therapists think   who is the medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness an advocacy group said Ive offered to share my notes with patients and theyll say No Im good But its a good concept that should be researched The practice is so new that it is too early for a comprehensive evaluation The Department of Veterans Affairs which began making medical and mental health records available online last year is only just beginning to study the effect on mental health patients Older studies from psychiatric wards   found that the patients   But as doctors helped interpret their notes patients   and trusting their team Although Beth Israel therapists report that some patients have no interest in reading their notes responses from a few have been positive and powerful Stacey Whiteman  a former executive secretary in Needham with multiple sclerosis faces growing cognitive as well as physical difficulties The disease has shaken her selfimage and relationships her psychological health affects her willingness to manage the disease She finds that her medical and mental health notes complement each other Yes the therapy notes can be hard to read and sometimes I wonder Really I said all of that  she said But theres no question that reading this stuff just charges you back up to moving forward While such a program may be feasible in larger systems like Beth Israel a Harvard hospital some solo practitioners fear it may require too much time and technological sophistication But Peggy Kriss a psychologist in Newton is an early adopter For over a year she has maintained a website with   on which she posts session notes as well as articles videos and meditations Toward the end of each session she and the patient begin the note together defining the key points that have been raised Dr Kriss said that for most of her patients online notes have become the new normal One described them to her as a security blanket between appointments Some write replies An OCD patient told me I was spelling things wrong Dr Kriss said So I said Im just modeling antiperfectionism for you  The Beth Israel project grew out of   a program by Dr Delbanco and his colleagues that made physicians notes accessible to  patients at three institutions A  study showed that patients   in their care More systems are adopting the model At least three million patients now have swift access to office visit notes including observations and recommendations But even those institutions have hesitated to share mental health notes Critics have raised concerns about whether reading notes could prompt anxiety and even rejection of treatment What will happen if the patient posts the notes on Facebook inviting comment Proponents of access point out that such notes which include extensive diagnostic reports are already available to other doctors and to insurers Although patients have long had the right to their records the process to obtain copies can be protracted If a doctor thinks that reading notes would be harmful to the patient or others they can be withheld Mindful of such pitfalls the Beth Israel psychiatrists have offered notes initially to only  percent of patients Clinical social workers are making notes more widely available though some therapists have temporarily opted out Nina Douglass a social worker in the obgyn clinic worries about patients with abusive partners If the abuser insisted on reading the notes the patient could be in danger I can imagine that our work can be deepened and enhanced through people reading their notes Ms Douglass said But one size doesnt fit all Mental health notes have very different readers the therapist who may use them as a memory prompt other doctors treating the patient insurers and now the patient Writing a note with necessary information for all can be daunting Mr ONeill the social work manager is pressing therapists to use straightforward descriptions I used affect dysregulation and a patient said What on earth is that Are you saying Im totally crazy  he said It just means they can get upset So why not use the word upset Some psychiatrists disagree Diagnostic language is used among doctors to describe features of a mental illness said Dr Brian K Clinton an assistant professor at Columbia University Medical Center who   I would be willing to discuss with a patient what I think Its a better way to communicate than a note I wrote for other doctors But Dr Michael W Kahn an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who   said that if the therapist explained the diagnosis some patients might feel relieved knowing their behavior fits a pattern that others also experience Dr Glen O Gabbard a psychiatrist and professor at Baylor College of Medicine said that opening notes to patients might have a chilling effect on doctors A psychiatrist would be less likely to put down anything he is musing about as diagnostic possibilities or write about what he feels the patient is leaving out he said Mr Baldwins longtime friends know about his harrowing battles with mental illness The hospitalizations The manic episodes The depression The anxiety so crippling that two years ago at a Costco parking lot he couldnt get out of the car As he withdrew into his apartment pints of ice cream Zoey and the telephone became his constant companions During the worst sieges of anxiety he would call a few friends three four times a day That is the man they recall he recounted in his freshly tidied apartment Its dcor is hopeful a multicolored rug violet curtains a jaunty limegreen wall And so is Mr Baldwin He is trying to lose weight maybe someday have a new man in his life He clicked open another therapy note Mr Baldwin is continuing to try to push himself to get out more and to be more socially connected even while his emotions tell him to do the opposite Mr ONeill wrote adding that his patient is clearly making good and even courageous efforts on a number of fronts Mr Baldwin who celebrated his birthday recently with a museum lecture movie and dinner flushed with pride Im going to email this to my friends he said
