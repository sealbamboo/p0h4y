Last week in the course of cleaning out my office and downsizing my cookbook library I came across an interesting book called Tonics by Robert A Barnett The book is a collection of recipes not just for liquid tonics but for all sorts of dishes made with foods and herbs thought to improve well being  It was a rare cold day in Los Angeles and I was inspired by the book to make some tonics of my own hot infusions made with ingredients I had on hand in my pantry and produce basket I brewed and tasted and thought of the founders of Celestial Seasonings tea company who in the late s and early s had come up with such household favorites as Red Zinger and Sleepytime Tea doing just what I was doing  I didnt work with herbs I was thinking more along the lines of fruit perfume and spice and I had many ingredients that had been languishing in my pantry that came to mind Take the rose petals and the barberries I had bought at my Iranian market and used in a few savory dishes and the bags of dried fruits that I never seemed to use up I also wanted to use turmeric which is believed to offer many health benefits in some of my teas and I loved the results when I added a small amount to a lemon infusion and to a coconut and ginger tea I wont be starting a tea company with these new drinks but I will be making them through the winter and when hot weather arrives Ill enjoy them iced  A delicious drink made with sour zingy vitamin Crich dried fruit 
  A sweet infusion made with just water and three ingredients 
  You might want to reach for this tea if you feel a sore throat coming on  Simmering dried fruit with some sweet spices results in a great beverage for a snowy day
