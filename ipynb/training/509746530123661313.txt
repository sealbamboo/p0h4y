Sami Yenigun an education producer at NPR has dreamed of reporting overseas This month his dream came true But it wasnt exactly the way hed imagined NPR asked him to travel to Liberia to work with correspondent  covering the Ebola outbreak He spoke to us on Tuesday after a week in the West African nation that has suffered the most from the virus My heart leapt up into my chest That excitement lasted for about three or four seconds then I had a moment where this sinking feeling came in I thought about whether it would be a traumatic experience that I was going into a country where there was a lot of tragedy and some danger I left my house in Washington DC on Sunday at  in the afternoon and made it to Monrovia Tuesday Sept  just after midnight I loved the ocean the lush green foliage everywhere And Liberians are so friendly and welcoming But I also felt a bit like a fish out of water Coming into an area youve never been before everything is very intense youre hyperalert paying attention to everything Plus theres this added level of  I went into this thinking OK Ofeibea has been covering this region for decades I am really just gonna follow her lead And right from the outset it was pouring rain and Ofeibea had work to do and needed me to go run out to the UN to grab some forms to get on a flight so I needed to go out on my own in Monrovia And it all worked very smoothly I remember getting back to the hotel and exhaling It wasnt a hard job but it was just like I can absolutely do this Im comfortable enough I can manage whatever is thrown at me And it helps to have a really good driver Mohamed A Trawallah and a local journalist   working alongside smoothing the way Definitely busy But from what Ive heard its usually way livelier And dont forget  theres a curfew I think Ebola has put the country in the doldrums But it is certainly busy its a bit chaotic traffic is a little crazy  nothing like New Jersey where Im from There are lanes in New Jersey no lanes here The first day we went to the West Point slum and it was tight and cramped It was clear our fixer Siatta ScottJohnson was a bit nervous keeping all the windows up doors locked as we were driving through tiny streets in the pouring rain with people everywhere Then we came up to this truck and saw some activity We were like Get out of the car weve got to check it out It was this Ebola awareness group singing this beautiful song about Ebola being real and the need for Liberia to come together So that colored my first impressions of Monrovia Despite the grim circumstances there are pockets of joy and positivity throughout the city Its weird I havent touched anybody in a week I havent given anybody a handshake a fist bump a highfive much less a hug or a kiss Your body starts craving human contact Ive never gone for such a long period of time without having touched in any way another person Youve got this force field around you Liberians say theyre huge huggers and kissers and Im told they have this really cool handshake  at the end you snap thumbs and third fingers before your remove your hand But all thats on hold for now The new Liberian handshake is this little elbow tap thing People smile and raise and lightly bump their elbows Everyone weve spoken to says this is having a huge impact children arent going to school  all these things that represent normalcy have come to a complete screeching halt That said we visited this town Barkedu in Lofa County in the north this village of  people And almost everybody has lost  members of their family But there was a group of kids laughing and playing soccer people cooking and cleaning girls playing a version of pattycake called   there was singing going on Within this bizarre sad time right now there are flashes of oh yeah this is how life is supposed to be Ive never seen the strength of the human spirit like Ive seen it on this trip For all of the brutality of Ebola Ive seen people being strong and amazing doctors on the front lines health workers cleaning up after sick patients people adopting orphans whove lost their parents people persisting in the face of having lost their entire family Ive seen people coping in ways I cant even really imagine doing myself A lot of what I was reading before I came to Liberia put this picture in my head that I might be walking into some kind of zombie movie Thats a dangerous way to think about it Though this virus is very dangerous it is also very easy to control If you are washing your hands and not touching people and following a few rules you are at a very low risk of contracting the disease Easier said than done sometimes because some practices are deeply embedded in the local culture  like the way you show your love by bathing a dead person before you bury them But that can be deadly Just dont let fear dictate your actions Be smart about what youre doing and be vigilant Ive been washing my hands and sanitizing them and everything else constantly This one thing I cant get out of my head is the fear that I did see from people I went into this clinic Doctors were interviewing patients to see if they had Ebola There was this young teenage boy sitting outside waiting for his consultation He looked so sick and so scared I have not been able to get it out of my head
