The EUs top court is considering a test case which could oblige employers to treat obesity as a disability  Denmark has asked the European Court of Justice to rule on the case of a male childminder who says he was sacked for being too fat  Karsten Kaltoft weighs about kg  stone  pounds He told the BBC that bad habits had made him fat but that his size was no problem at work The courts final ruling will be binding across the EU  It is seen as especially significant because of rising obesity levels in Europe and elsewhere including the US A survey in England in  found that more than half of adults were obese or overweight The Danish courts asked the ECJ judges in Luxembourg   in Mr Kaltofts case In an interview with the BBC World Service Mr Kaltoft denied reports that he was unable to bend low enough to tie childrens shoelaces  Describing his work with children he said I can sit on the floor and play with them I have no problems like that I dont see myself as disabled he said We hope the outcome is that its not OK just to fire a person because theyre fat if theyre doing their job properly When asked if his employer Billund local authority had done anything to help him he said they had paid for him to go to a gym for three months  I tried regular exercise Of course I dont run a marathon but weight training I did that it was OK he said  He worked for Billund authority for  years and was dismissed the authority said because there was a decline in the number of children No further explanation was given as to why he was selected for dismissal Audrey Williams an employment discrimination expert at Eversheds law firm said the judges would have to decide whether obesity itself should trigger preferential rights or should only impact where an individual due to obesity has other recognised medical issues If the judges decide it is a disability then employers could face new obligations she told the BBC Employers might in future have a duty to create reserved car parking spaces for obese staff or adjust the office furniture for them she said  The judges will have to decide whether obesity is covered under the EUs   which outlaws job discrimination on grounds of disability
