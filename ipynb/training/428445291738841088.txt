Scientists have reconstructed the genetic code of a strain of bacteria that caused one of the most deadly pandemics in history nearly  years ago They did it by finding the skeletons of people killed by the plague and extracting DNA from traces of blood inside their teeth This plague struck in the year  under the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian so its usually called the   The emperor actually got sick himself but recovered He was one of the lucky ones Some of the estimates are that up to  million people died says evolutionary biologist   at Northern Arizona University Its thought that the Justinian plague actually led partially to the downfall of the Roman Empire The   swept through Europe northern Africa and parts of Asia Historians say that when it arrived in Constantinople thousands of bodies piled up in mass graves People started wearing name tags so they could be identified if they suddenly collapsed Given the descriptions scientists suspected that it was caused by the bacterium  the same kind of microbe that later caused Europes   in the th century The bacteria get spread by fleas After someone gets infected from a flea bite the microbes travel to the nearest lymph node and start multiplying And so you get this mass swelling in that lymph node which is known as a buboe says Wagner Thats where the term bubonic plague comes from The Justinian plague has been hard to study scientifically But recently archaeologists stumbled upon a clue outside Munich Housing developers were digging up farmland when they uncovered a burial site with graves that dated as far back as the Justinian plague They found some graves that had multiple individuals buried together which is oftentimes indicative of an infectious disease Wagner says And so in this particular case we examined material from two different victims One of those victims was buried together with another adult and a child so its presumed that they all may have died of the plague at the same time Skeletons were all that was left of the pair But inside their teeth was dental pulp that still contained traces of blood  and the blood contained the DNA of plague bacteria By decoding the bacterias DNA Wagner and a team of international scientists could trace the pathogens evolutionary journey They think the strain of bacteria that caused the Justinian plague jumped from rodents into humans and then died out the team   Tuesday in the journal   The later emergence of Black Death seems to have been caused by a separate event The DNA also suggests that like Black Death the original source of the plague was in China says microbiologist   another member of the research team at Northern Arizona University So the ecological reservoir for plague the historical reservoir is in China Keim says And its this emergence this pattern over and over again with people moving commodities rats and fleas around the world that were able to document Overall this ancient strain is not that different from modern ones that still circulate in places like Arizona says Keim The biology of the pathogen no doubt could cause another pandemic if it werent for the changes in human culture and medicine Keim says These days though antibiotics can quickly stop plague outbreaks in their tracks
