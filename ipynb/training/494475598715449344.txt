The WHO says drastic action is needed to contain Ebola warning that previously undetected chains of transmission are boosting the numbers of sick and increasing the chances that the disease spreads from Africa This epidemic is without precedent said Bart Janssens director of operations for Mdecins Sans Frontires also known as Doctors Without Borders Its absolutely not under control and the situation keeps worsening  There are many places where people are infected but we dont know about it The Ebola outbreak has been centered in Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia where authorities have been working to contain the virus  In Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced Wednesday that without exceptions all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education She also declared Friday a nonworking day to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities On the same day the Peace Corps said it was temporarily removing its  volunteers from Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak The announcement comes as two Peace Corps volunteers were isolated after coming in contact with someone who ended up dying of Ebola a spokeswoman for the group said She said these two Americans are not symptomatic and the Peace Corps will work to return them to the United States once they get medical clearance to travel Concerns about Ebola arent confined to those three countries  Last week a Liberian government official who had contracted the virus    a naturalized American citizen who worked in Liberia flew to Nigeria intending to attend a conference After exhibiting symptoms upon arrival July  he was hospitalized and died on July  Hes the first American to die in the outbreak though two other US aid workers in Liberia have contracted Ebola and are being treated  Sawyers was the only known case in Nigeria WHO said And the British government convened an emergency meeting to discuss the threat of Ebola to the UK even though no case has been reported there Officials discussed what measures could be taken if UK nationals in West Africa should become infected Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said It is unknown whether Sawyer was displaying symptoms before he flew from Monrovia Liberias capital to Ghana and then to Togo to switch planes to fly to Lagos His Minnesotabased widow Decontee Sawyer told CNN that he had cared for his ill sister in Liberia though she said he didnt know at the time that his sister had Ebola When he arrived in Nigeria he told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone who had the disease Because it takes between two and  days before Ebola symptoms to show theres little health officials can do to stop an asymptomatic person from flying to another country So serious viruses such as Ebola may be just a plane ride away from reaching the developed world according to  Mindful of this Nigeriabased airline companies   and   suspended operations at the end of July into Monrovia and Freetown the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone respectively ASKY said passengers departing from Conakry Guinea would be screened for signs of the virus Cetron says it is unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick persons bodily fluids Stressing the key role that those working at airports play in keeping Ebola in check the CDC spokesman said Being educated knowing the symptoms recognizing what to do having a response to protocol knowing who to call  those are really really important parts of the global containment strategies to deal with threats like this  Ebola patients are being isolated by health officials in West Africa and those who have come into contact with them are being told to monitor their temperatures  President Sirleaf has   and the few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers The President also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a fiveminute video on Ebola safety The CDC has issued an alert to health workers in the United States to watch out for any patients who may have recently traveled to West Africa and could have contracted the virus MSF describes Ebola as    It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to  of the people who catch it causing terror among infected communities it says The death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly  because of early treatment  There is also no vaccination against it Of Ebolas five subtypes the Zaire strain  the first to be identified  is considered the most deadly The WHO said   suggested that the outbreak there was this strain though that has not been confirmed  The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever which   refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo formerly Zaire where one of the first outbreaks occurred in   Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever weakness muscle pain headaches and a sore throat These symptoms can appear two to  days after infection The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria typhoid fever meningitis or even the plague MSF says some patients may also develop a rash red eyes hiccups chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing The early symptoms progress to vomiting diarrhea impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests There are no specific treatments for Ebola MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers This consists of hydrating the patient maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections it says There have been cases of healthcare workers   and the WHO has issued    Carers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose mouth and eyes MSF says it contained a  outbreak in Uganda by placing a control area around its treatment center An outbreak is considered over once  days  double the incubation period of the disease  have passed without any new cases The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa passing on the virus to other animals Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans  MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism chlorine disinfection heat direct sunlight soaps and detergents can kill it MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick  who had diarrhea vomiting and bleeding  or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient she said
