A number of other hospitals in England are likely to be facing severe problems of staff shortages and patientdemand of the scale that prompted the declaration of a major incident at Colchester hospital last week one of the countrys most senior doctors has warned Dr Clifford Mann president of the College of Emergency Medicine says hospitals are feeling acute pressure over accident and emergency units in part because these are often inadequately funded under the system through which the government finances healthcare A major incident was declared on Thursday at Colchester hospital in Essex in the wake of a Care Quality Commission inspection that found it was struggling with unprecedented demand the   Patients were   routine operations were put off and agency staff drafted in While there are particular worries about the way Colchester hospital has been managed Mann said other hospitals are similarly struggling and the declaration of a major incident is arguably the only way to get these issues addressed I rather suspect there are many hospitals with very similar pressures and I think the major incident is simply the most appropriate term for the hospital to draft in emergency supplies if you like of extra staff Mann told BBC Radio s Today programme What we have to stop doing is having shortterm funding fixes because we dont have the staff out there to be able to recruit highquality staff on a shortterm basis We have to move to a system where we have enough staff all the time on the payroll  permanent staff to provide the quality of care patients rightly expect Mann said the situation at Colchester highlights almost better than any other story Ive heard recently the chronic underfunding that is endemic in emergency care throughout the UK but particularly in England A key element of this he said was the system by which hospitals were paid for providing care which Mann said did not properly reimburse them for emergency services The net effect of that is all hospitals have to do more and more elective work or planned work to crosssubsidise the money theyre spending on emergency care he said Its made even worse by the case that since  for every patient you admit in excess of the numbers you admitted in  instead of being paid the already inadequate tariff you get paid onethird of that tariff So we essentially have a buy one get two free system which is penalising acute hospitals While declaration of a major incident at Colchester was related mainly to pressures on services and staff shortages the Guardian understands concerns were also raised with the CQC about safeguarding issues relating to inappropriate restraint resuscitation and sedation of elderly people some with dementia At the weekend the hospitals interim chief executive Dr Lucy Moore said staff were running a sort of command and control process to try to regain control over the situation with a focus on discharging patients where possible The Today programme spoke to one patient at the hospital Christopher Wass who said he was discharged twice with severe swelling in his leg before he eventually persuaded doctors to do a scan of the limb in which they found a major blood clot Of his treatment by staff he said No one talks to me I just get my medication no one asks how I am
