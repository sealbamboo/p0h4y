Each morning Cali an monthold Rhodesian Ridgeback patiently waits for the K students to pass through the doors of the Calais School in Whippany NJ As they walk by Cali sniffs each one The students about  in all smile at the shorthaired dog but know not to pet or distract her while she is working Cali is a cortisol detection dog trained to detect the stress hormone our adrenal glands secrete when we become anxious or stressed  When we are agitated cortisol levels in our bloodstream rise Its Calis job to let Casey Butler her handler know if a students cortisol levels are high If they are that student spends time talking with Ms Butler and Cali to help defuse the stress The children feel safer with Cali around she explained They tend to open up more Calis signals are so subtle that the students and other teachers waiting nearby rarely notice But Ms Butler  pays close attention to see if Cali points with her nose and stares at a child  Many of the students at Calais are on the autism spectrum some have attention deficit disorder oppositional defiant disorder and other challenges that can trigger anxiety and other difficult emotions  Like most service dogs Cali is extremely quiet and unassuming The students dont like it when a dog jumps on them explained Ms Butler a health teacher who is a certified specialist in natural canine behavior rehabilitation and in animal adaptive therapy Cali was brought to the school last year from a local nonprofit called Merlins Kids that trains service dogs to work with specialneeds children Some schools with a specialneeds population have service dogs that visit and work with the students as a onceinawhile activity said David Leitner executive director of the Calais School We thought having a service dog on staff would benefit our students It was a decision that was presented to the teachers and staff at the school and met without opposition A lot of us know people with service dogs and we have seen how beneficial they are said Diane Manno the principal at Calais And in just a short time we have seen how Cali has helped our students When Cali spots an anxious student and Ms Butler asks the student whether he or she is feeling stressed the typical response is Im OK Ms Butler counters by saying Cali told me otherwise They listen to her because Cali is nonthreatening and they like being around her Ms Butler said 
A ninth grader agreed Cali can help us cope with our problems so that we dont have to get through it by ourselves she said She is loving intuitive and goofy  A few weeks ago in Ms Butlers office Cali started pacing alternately moving toward the door and nudging Ms Butler She led me up one flight of stairs to the opposite end of the building where we found a girl starting to have a meltdown she said  Noticing Cali the student asked if she could pet her Ms Butler told her not yet I first make sure Cali is safe she said Within a few minutes of seeing Cali the student calmed down Only then does she reward students by letting them pet brush and  sometimes  walk Cali  Its their uncanny sense of smell that allows dogs like Cali to detect rising cortisol levels in our sweat or breath and identify a student having trouble even in a faraway classroom said Nicholas Dodman director of the Animal Behavior Clinic at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University Humans have  million smell receptors in their nose At the lowest estimate dogs have  million Scent hounds like beagles and bassets have up to four billion A dogs ability to smell odors is beyond our comprehension We are proud of ourselves when we drive past Burger King and can smell that they are cooking burgers he said Dogs can smell a burger being cooked in the next town That is why dogs are used to detect melanomas diabetes and other types of disease Its all about the sense of smell Cali can also detect when a student is faking Ive had students come into my office saying they dont feel well Ms Butler said Its not uncommon for a student to want to miss a class or a test If Cali doesnt signal when she sniffs them I send them back to the classroom At the end of the school day the students board the buses back home and Cali goes home with Ms Butler In a few weeks a second service dog will join the crew a beagle named Cleo an occupational and speech therapy dog The students will work with Cleo to improve their fine motor skills by opening and closing the buttons and snaps on her harness and will practice their oral and social skills by reading to her  The students are eagerly standing by
