President Obama was thrilled last week when he was able to announce that more than  million people have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act This law is doing what its supposed to do the president   Its working But thats not to say it couldnt work better Among those suggesting ways to help is the consumer group   The groups got a list of   it says could improve outreach and make the overall process easier for people to navigate Perhaps the best thing about this particular list is that none of these recommendations require legislation from the Congress said Ron Pollack the groups executive director These changes can either be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services or state marketplaces Pollacks group proposes for example more funding for   who can provide inperson individual counseling to help people select and sign up for health plans along with more education about the availability of financial support to help offset the cost of monthly premiums Another proposal which has come in   would create a special new enrollment period right around the time people are filing their taxes Rachel Klein who coauthored the report for Families USA says that option would be particularly important for people who are still uninsured at tax time next year There are a number of people who will find they are subject to a penalty because they did not have insurance in  she said on a conference call with reporters Those people will have missed the open enrollment opportunity for coverage in  and thus they will be subject to two penalties In other words they will owe one penalty for   and another because they missed the   so they will remain uninsured for that year too Allowing people to purchase coverage for  at that point could help minimize some of what is sure to be a backlash against the law next spring Others have recommended that going forward the general open enrollment period should be shifted from the autumn to instead coincide more with tax season For one thing thats when people who are uninsured may be likelier to have extra money to put toward health insurance For another says Klein that will also enable tax preparers to play a much more significant role in helping people to understand their coverage options and helping them get signed up Meanwhile others remain concerned that choosing a health plan simply remains much too difficult a task for the average consumer People cant figure it out Is a  deductible and a  outofpocket limit better for me than a  deductible and a  outofpocket limit  says Robert Krughoff He heads   a nonprofit based in Washington DC that publishes ratings of a wide array of services including health care And taking into account coinsurance and copayments and all those things people just cant do it he says PhD economists cant do it Consumers Checkbook has for  years published a   choose from the dozens of health insurance options available to them each year So Krughoff and colleagues decided to see if they could do something similar for the health exchanges The first thing they realized he says is that too many people are choosing plans based on premiums alone They would look at a premium that looks like its going to save them  a year and think Great  he says But after doing more precise estimates it turns out that plan will cost them  more a year than some other plans They really shouldnt do it on premium alone Nor should people choose plans based on deductibles or even metal levels  gold silver or bronze he says Those too provide misleading results Instead Krughoff and his staff built an online tool that lets people estimate all health their costs in a good or a bad year in about five minutes by answering a few questions  about their health status family and income demographics and about any anticipated health spending They can also plug in the names of their doctors So far their program has only been up and running   But Jillian Phillips a healthcare navigator with the   in Chicago said she used the tool this year and likes it a lot It was really helpful because it saved me a lot of time she says versus having to crunch all the numbers and show them what it would add up to be Krughoff says it would be costprohibitive for his group to try to replicate the tool for all  states or even for the  states in the federal exchange But he hopes the federal government might step in to help make sure people dont land in plans that arent necessarily the right fit Too much attention has been focused on delays in getting signed up he says and not enough attention on making sure each family gets into the right plan Having to wait an extra two weeks to get insurance might be catastrophic for some people he says But paying  more for your insurance than you need to  that could be pretty catastrophic too And there hasnt been enough emphasis on that
