We usually think of the flu as an illness that afflicts the elderly But this season the virus seems to be hitting younger people hard This winter at Duke University Medical Center in Durham NC the median age of people hospitalized with influenza was  years Many of the worst cases of flu occurred in young otherwise healthy people Theres nothing thats been personally more dreadful to me as a young guy with a kid at home than to walk into our ICU and see pregnant women or young otherwise healthy people struggling not to die on a ventilator says   an assistant professor of infectious disease at Duke Wolfe and his colleagues found that out of the  flu cases the hospital has seen so far  percent were infected with HN the same strain responsible for the global   in  They reported their findings in a small   in the   The takeaway message Wolfe tells Shots is that even the young and healthy should get flu shots Very young teenagers and collegeage kids tend to think theyre immortal Wolf says And I think theres a general misunderstanding of the role of vaccines Many people dont realize that the vaccine can take up to two weeks to kick in Wolfe says and then when they get sick they assume that the vaccine isnt effective Others avoid it because in some people side effects of the vaccine resemble flu symptoms The flu vaccine in particular is misunderstood Wolfe says because at the end of the day its not a perfect vaccine Even those who have gotten the shot   especially if they contract a strain thats not covered by the annual vaccine But the vaccine protects against several strains and it encourages our bodies to create antibodies that can also protect against viruses that arent the flu according to the National Institutes of Health The Duke researchers found that while a third of those who ended up in the general ward of the hospital with flu symptoms were vaccinated only  of the  who ended up in the intensive care unit had had the shot What that hints at is maybe the vaccine has a protective effect Wolfe says Even if youre going to be one of the people who do get the flu if you get a vaccine its going to be less severe Of course this study was just a first look at flu trends in one hospital We are only halfway through flu season and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wont be putting together a picture of the national trends until this summer But Dr Michael Jhung an infectious diseases officer at the CDC says a lot of what the Duke researchers found sounds similar to national trends hes been observing He says the predominance of the HN strain might be responsible for the uptick in young adults suffering from the flu Since a similar strain was circulating in the s Jhung tells Shots many older people have developed immunity to HN Last year which was a year when we saw   predominate was particularly bad for the elderly he says But theres another possible reason he says Young and middleaged adults are among the lowest vaccinated age groups in the US Last year only   of  to yearolds got flu shots The CDC estimates that this flu season will be a bit better with around  percent getting the vaccine Often young people cant imagine that the flu could cause a severe illness in them Jhung says But he says hes not sure what will push people in this age group to actually get vaccinated Younger adults are also not good at getting other recommended shots A  CDC   found that only  percent of  to yearolds had gotten the   booster shot in the past  years Thats pretty low considering that one quick shot every  years could prevent people from getting this serious infection which is caused by bacteria in the environment that get into the body through cuts or puncture wounds and is fatal  percent of the time I suspect that numbers and surveillance data and national estimates arent going to be very compelling for most people Jhung says It may unfortunately take a personal encounter with influenza to convince people
