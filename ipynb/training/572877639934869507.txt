In fact of the  hospitals rated as a high performers on any one of the lists only  rated highly on any of the other three lists Evan Marks Chief Strategy Officer of Healthgrades wasnt surprised by that fact He says that the different national surveys focus on different measures ranging from safety to patient outcome Its no surprise there is a sense of different answers says Marks Healthgrades focuses on patient outcome measured by mortality and complication rates  We werent surprised that the rating systems are different because we look at different things  we look at what consumers are concerned about Thats the way we approached it says Doris Peter director of the Consumer Reports Health Rating Center  And so their focus is on patient safety which includes looking at how successful a hospital is at avoiding complications and avoiding readmissions  Leapfrog also focuses on safety but they define safety as freedom from harm by looking at patient outcome data US News and World Report includes safety but focuses primarily on high complexity care  A hospital good for one thing isnt always good for another The goal of US News and our reporting is to provide guidance to consumers about the specific needs that they have says Ben Harder Chief of Health Analysis and Managing Editor for US News  World Report  one of the authors of the study says that consumers need to be aware of these variations  A lot of these rating systems are highly variable in what they measure Consumers have to go one layer deeper If theyre having surgery they need to also worry about infection said Pronovost who is also Director of the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine  But Leah Binder president and CEO of the Leapfrog group believes that consumers actually welcome all this information We dont find consumers are confused by having different perspectives Consumers feel there isnt enough information about how doctors and hospitals are doing  She likens it to buying a car where one person may be looking for a safe family car while another is looking for a sporty one It all depends on the buyer Its the same when it comes to hospitals  Pronovost says it is important to clearly understand the methodology that is being used He points out that some systems are a little more clear cut than others While some focus on patient outcome data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services others incorporate factors such as hospital reputation and consumer feedback Understanding how the hospitals are graded goes far in making an informed decision  Pronovost says still look at these reports but remember these are grains of truth you may have to dig down another layer for things that are relevant to you In addition he says I would tend to use the ones that are more transparent Make sure you understand the methodology of the ratings and exactly what factors they are measuring for  And focus on your procedure Places that see more complex diagnoses do better than those that see less  adds Pronovost  Aside from just looking at these ratings Peter at Consumer Reports says talk to your doctor Ask questions if you are going in for a scheduled matter You can ask your surgeon What are your rates of complications Thats where the data will come out If you are going into the hospitalization ask What do they know about their quality of their own surgery Their own hospital Having that discussion is important  And when youre hospitalized Peter says you can still use the ratings If you know they score low on infection you can be vigilant about hand washing Make sure they follow standard procedures
