The first person to identify this rare cause of a persistent eczema-like rash was Errol Levine, a retired radiologist from South Africa now living in Santa Fe, N.M. He focused on the fact that the patient had moved and now had a longer drive to work. He figured that the unusual distribution of the rash could be caused by her wrapping her fingers around the steering wheel of her car. As you will see, that is exactly the logic used by the doctor who made the diagnosis.. I was impressed by how many of you realized that the rash was a reaction to light. That was something that eluded most of the patient’s doctors and the patient herself. And I want to give a  shout-out to Marcela Garcia of Munich, who first figured out why the rash had such a strange distribution on her hands. Outstanding work, all of you!
