Im sure Im not the only parent who has hovered over a newborns crib wondering Is she breathing Tech companies are now offering to help parents manage that anxiety with devices that monitor a babys vital signs and beam them to a smartphone But that might not be such a good idea according to Dr David King a pediatric researcher at the University of Sheffield He first heard baby vital signs monitors being discussed on the radio and I suspected there wasnt much evidence behind it because I knew cardiovascular monitoring wasnt recommended in SIDS King is referring to unhappy experiments in the s and s with using monitors in an attempt to prevent sudden infant death syndrome or   The monitors failed to reduce SIDS deaths in healthy infants and are no longer recommended by the   and other medical groups The problem King says is that theres no research to suggest that the information provided by these new devices provides a reliable indicator of danger or indeed any reliable information about your child Its not a medical device its not registered as a medical device Its just for fun really King told Shots But if you look at the marketing so far I dont think thats the message that comes across He  about his findings in Tuesdays   The   which sells for  monitors a babys breathing body position sleep activity and skin temperature through a sensor that attaches to a special onesie It takes a lot of scrolling through the sites terms of service to find this disclaimer Still promotional language for many of the monitors suggests that tracking a healthy baby like shes in the NICU is somehow a good thing The site for the stillindevelopment   a sensor built into a baby bootie says Call me picky but isnt keeping babies safe what parents were designed for And truth to tell I dont know how I could use data on an infants heart rate and blood oxygen level to keep her safe One of the big problems with SIDS monitors was that they gave many false alarms panicking parents The American Academy of Pediatrics has very specific   including putting babies to sleep on their backs and keeping soft bedding out of the crib Do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS the academy says since there is no evidence that use of such devices decreases the incidence of SIDS The developer of   which is being sold in China is applying for FDA approval to sell its monitor in the United States I can tell you that the big healthcare product distributors in the US that I have approached demand at least a k clearance from the FDA David Bychkov the CEO of Exmobaby told Shots via email That allows marketing of devices that are  already approved by the FDA In the case of Exmobaby that would be an electrocardiogram and temperature sensor The product is helpful for allowing a mom to keep track and record a babys vital signs as it develops in year one Bychkov wrote Mom can also use the system to log emotional changes and correlate those changes with the babys underlying temperature and heart rate data I vividly remember parsing my newborns emotional changes who could ever forget that first smile But much as I love tech gizmos I think Ill take a pass on baby ECGs
