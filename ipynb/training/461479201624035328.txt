Flaws in the way that dietary supplements are monitored and reported are causing potentially lifethreatening delays in how long dangerous products linger on store shelves said Dr Pieter Cohen an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who has   They are also he said setting the stage for similar episodes to occur again Writing   Dr Cohen said that one of the more significant problems in such instances is that many cases of harm are reported to doctors and poison control centers but are either delayed in reaching the FDA or do not make it to the agency at all Weve all been working under the premise that once a dangerous supplement is identified the FDA will swiftly remove it from the market he said But what Ive come to realize over the last several years is that dangerous supplements remain on store shelves sometimes indefinitely or much longer than they should be Many doctors who suspect a supplement has injured a patient neglect to submit a timely report to MedWatch the   that the FDA maintains to help identify clusters of injury linked to harmful products Dr Cohen said He noted that delays occurred in  when local health departments determined that more than  people had suffered selenium poisoning from a brand of multivitamin And it happened in  when the Department of Defense removed a workout supplement from military bases that   It took the FDA an additional  months after the military ban to gather sufficient safety data from MedWatch to alert consumers about DMAAs risks he wrote In all of these cases he added MedWatch reports were irrelevant The FDA has been stepping up efforts to make doctors more aware of the MedWatch system and to encourage them to use it to report promptly any serious reactions to drugs supplements and other products said Daniel Fabricant the director of the division of dietary supplement programs in the agencys Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Even so he said doctors sometimes neglect to include critical information in their reports Often left out are details about the product and its label the results of any blood work or diagnostic tests and whether the patient was using any other drugs or supplements which can make followup difficult Linking a single supplement that might contain dozens of different ingredients to an illness requires a forensic investigation that takes time he said I certainly understand and share Dr Cohens concern Dr Fabricant said But I do think the system has been useful and successful and instrumental in the agency taking action against products that were unsafe Before joining the FDA in  Dr Fabricant was a top executive at an industry trade group the Natural Products Association The FDA   that Dr Fabricant is leaving the agency this month to return to the trade group as its chief executive Dr Cohen said that many doctors simply do not find the FDA or MedWatch very helpful in dealing with patients who have ingested a tainted product So instead they turn to poison control centers which offer medical advice in cases where a patient ingested something toxic Indeed in a   the Government Accountability Office noted that from  to  more than  adverse events related to dietary supplements were reported to poison control centers  but not to the FDA Because data are not routinely shared between the centers and the agency Dr Cohen wrote the FDA did not have access to these reports Critics of the  billion a year supplement industry argue that the FDA is hampered by a federal law that they say was written largely to protect the industry the  Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act The law which gives companies much leeway in how they manufacture and advertise supplements allows them to put products on the market without FDA approval As a result the agency has little power to stop tainted products from landing on store shelves in the first place even though research suggests that adulteration and   But industry representatives like Steve Mister the president and chief executive of the Council for Responsible Nutrition a supplement trade group said the problem is not the law but an overstretched FDA which has not aggressively pursued the industrys bad apples The FDA is grossly underfunded it needs more resources and Congress can do that he said Dr Cohen said that at the very least Congress should require that supplements carry information about side effects on their packaging Right now even when we know that a supplement has side effects theres no requirement that it appear on the label he said Dr Cohen also called for a nationwide surveillance system in which the FDA would working with poison control centers local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The system would include a rapid response team made up of toxicologists and other experts who could investigate reports and contact doctors and patients A pilot program based on this idea was carried out in San Francisco in  and   but it ended after one year because funding ran out Such a system Dr Cohen said would help the kind of patients he has treated as Â a general internist at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts I had patients who would end up hospitalized  sometimes psychiatric hospitalization sometimes kidney failure  because they were taking these weight loss supplements that they hadnt been telling us about he said Since then this has been a real focus of mine What are these lessons Ive learned from my clinical practice telling us about the sale of supplements throughout the United States
