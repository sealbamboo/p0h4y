A brain area that recognizes faces remains functional even in people who have been blind since birth researchers say The   presented at the Society for Neuroscience meeting this week suggests that facial recognition is so important that evolution has hardwired it into the human brain Its all inborn says   a professor of neuroscience at Georgetown University Medical Center The structures are all there because nature has put them there Rauschecker was part of a team that studied the brains of six blind people including Jeannette Gerrard a retired government worker who lives in Washington DC Gerrard has always relied on voices to identify people and says that faces were never that important to her I knew what my face looked like by touch she says and I figured a face was a face So she was intrigued when researchers from Georgetown asked her to take part in an experiment that would eventually allow her to see faces using sound First the scientists had Gerrard learn to use a special headset fitted with a small camera By moving her head Gerrard could make the camera scan across a drawing The device produced sounds And as lines or curves came into the cameras view those sounds would change The concept is a bit like tapping your way along a wall to find a stud behind the plaster With practice Gerrard was able to interpret more complex sound patterns that revealed more complicated shapes Eventually I could identify a face by listening to those sounds Gerrard says To find out how Gerrard was doing this the Georgetown scientists put her in a brain scanner The idea was to watch Gerrards brain while she was using sounds to recognize a simplified drawing of a face says   who was in charge of the experiment Our interest was looking into the brain she says What part of the brain is responsible for this perception The team compared brain scans from the six blind people with the scans from  sighted people who were looking at the face drawings with their own eyes The results were almost identical In both groups the image caused lots of activity in the left   a region of the brain that always lights up when you see a face Rauschecker says In sighted people the fusiform face area is connected to the brains visual system he says But in blind people it appears to be wired to circuits that process sounds So there is substantial reorganization in the brain of the blind Rauschecker says Whats remarkable is that despite this reorganization the brain of a blind person retains the module devoted to facial recognition Rauschecker says That strongly suggests that the ability to recognize faces comes more from nature than from nurture he says
