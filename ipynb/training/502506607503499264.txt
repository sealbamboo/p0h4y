I was watching Diane Sawyer on the evening news wondering how she manages year after year to look so young when suddenly her face disappeared Now you see Now you dont One second Thats all it took A dense black inkblot shaped like a map of England and southern Norway suddenly blocked my view of Diane so that all I could see was her blond hair and shoulders At first I thought it was the television set Changing channels didnt bring her face back nor did rubbing my eyes Its permanent vision loss my ophthalmologist said Your optic nerve and retina buckled  He drew a picture of the inside of my right eye the affected one and explained that my degenerative myopia an inherited condition that is far less common than ordinary nearsightedness but still a leading cause of blindness worldwide had caused my eyeball to elongate excessively It looked like a house whose walls had been stretched so thin that the roof caved  The doctor didnt say much else didnt make any recommendations for physical or occupational therapy didnt tell me to call him if I noticed any changes I left his office shaken What if it happens in my other eye What if In the weeks that followed I began to notice bizarre changes in my right eye Frequent flashing lights like a dying neon tube sometimes flickering color or bright white light so intense I swore I could hear them buzz I observed my peripheral vision diminishing England and Norway morphed into a large bushy oak tree with a short and wide trunk At a park I came upon children playing When I covered my good eye with my hand I could see only a sliver of sky and legs and shoes of children running in and out of the tree  I wrote off the psychedelic changes to the buckling and didnt bother to call my ophthalmologist But I was scared and needed help  Calling around I found little help for the partly sighted until a friend told me to call Ashby Village one of about  villages that have been established throughout the country to help seniors live independently in their own homes Thats how I found Thelma Elkins a yearold former social worker who had just founded a support group for those losing their vision  Thelma and the group have become my lifeline a place where we can share notes about the newest research and talk about the anger and fears that at times overwhelm us At the beginning a few members didnt see the necessity of opening up and talking about feelings They left the group The rest of us understood the importance of staying connected to others of countering the isolation that declining vision brings       Together we grieve the death of the independent life we used to live and voice the anguish of being trapped at home no longer able to drive One member talked about feeling outraged that his doctor didnt have time to talk about a vitamin regimen called AREDS that might slow the progression of macular degeneration Another told of the terror she felt when a hallucination of large tropical flowers popped up in front of her eyes while she was driving a phenomenon called Charles Bonnet syndrome that is caused by the brains efforts to compensate for vision loss We provide comfort when a member recalls his panic after becoming lost in a crowd in a large Greek port and not being able to remember the cruise ships name What we really share is hope As I nonchalantly described the creeping reduction in my peripheral vision to my group a couple of them urged me to call my doctor and get an appointment for the next day I did My ophthalmologists eyebrows lifted as he assessed the changes He suspected wet macular degeneration caused by abnormal blood vessel growth was contributing to my vision problems and he called my retinologists office My first eye injection came next The retinologist adjusted my chair until it was in a horizontal position clamped my eyelid to keep it from blinking and then said Look down and to the left He carefully inserted a hypodermic needle full of medication into my numbed eyeball He said I was lucky because the medication which came on the market in  stops the bleeding and vascularization  I felt  a prick and noticed a tiny floating water bubble the medication and then it burst in my field of vision The world turned purple and I felt slightly faint for a few seconds My doctor reached out his hand to shake mine saying Ill see you again in four weeks  The medication is working its magic and the old oak tree has shrunk back to its original shape of England and Norway I have more peripheral vision Every day when I wake up I check to see that my good eye is still inkblot free and that England and Norway are still the same size I still have a hard time talking to friends about my condition because I am scared I will make them feel uncomfortable and drive them away I read an article written by a blind woman about how people assume that she cant possibly be intelligent They sometimes shout at her assuming that shes also deaf My support group has helped me practice sharing my story with others Recently I accompanied a blind man I had met at the Oakland Lions Center for the Blind to the BART station When my new friend and I got on the train his white cane signifying his blindness prompted four people to offer their seats so fast that I could feel the wind from their movements We took two of those vacated seats I was happy to note the power of the white cane If and when it is time for me to use one I will be ready
