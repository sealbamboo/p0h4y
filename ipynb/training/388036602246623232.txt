The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the turning point in the fight against Alzheimers disease More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimers Parkinsons Huntingtons and other diseases In tests on mice the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented Prof Roger Morris from Kings College London said This finding I suspect will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimers disease   He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimers was not imminent but Im very excited its the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration The world wont change tomorrow but this is a landmark study The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit based at the University of Leicester focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells  When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a buildup of viral proteins Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the viruss spread However many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or misfolded proteins These activate the same defences but with more severe consequences  The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death  This process repeated in neurons throughout the brain can destroy movement or memory or even kill depending on the disease This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases  The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration The study   showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems They died within  weeks  However those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away  Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website They were absolutely fine it was extraordinary Whats really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and thats a first This isnt the compound you would use in people but it means we can do it and its a start She said the compound offered a new pathway that may well give protective drugs and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans Prof Malluccis lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published Side effects are an issue The compound also acted on the pancreas meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight Any human drug would need to act only on the brain However this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point David Allsop professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as very dramatic and highly encouraging but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons Dr Eric Karran the director of research at the charity Alzheimers Research UK said Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with widereaching benefits but this compound is still at an early stage  It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease
