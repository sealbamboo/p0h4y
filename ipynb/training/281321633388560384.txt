Counterfeit drugs are a growing scourge around the world Theyre generating millions of dollars in revenue for organized crime and fueling the rise of drugresistant parasites Antimalarials are among the most popular drugs to fake But these faux pharmaceuticals are particularly dangerous because malaria can kill a person in a matter of days Someone comes with malaria says Stephane Proux a researcher at the   in Thailand setting up a scenario A seller will say  Here you go and take those tablets But theres nothing in there  Its very dangerous potentially fatal for the patient SMRU helps to set up and run malaria clinics across the Thai border in Myanmar also known as Burma Myanmar has the highest level of malaria transmission in Southeast Asia and it has been flooded with   A lengthy civil war in Myanmar fueled both malaria and the counterfeit drug problem Soldiers and villagers were pushed into mosquito breeding grounds The conflict devastated health clinics and it allowed smugglers to move with relative ease in and out of the country In Myanmar malaria drugs and many other medications are sold openly without a prescription in markets and small shops Proux says counterfeiters are playing with peoples lives by selling useless medicines Thats a deadly trade Those people are not only crooks they are criminals definitely criminals he says Sometimes the fake drugs are nothing more than repackaged sugar pills or chalk But at times they contain small amounts of antimalarial drugs That causes another major public health problem When the malaria parasite is exposed to an insufficient dose of a drug resistance can start to develop And that appears to be   now in Southeast Asia with one of the most powerful antimalarials artemisinin Drugmakers put holograms on drug packaging to authenticate the contents In the early days it was quite easy to tell the fake from true because the holograms were really badly done and very rough and you could see straight away that it was fake Proux says He says that started to change around  or  The malaria drugs for sale in eastern Myanmar became almost indistinguishable from the authentic ones The packets even had hologram stickers that were nearly identical to the stickers from the factory They are champion counterfeiters those guys They are really really well crafted holograms Proux says Oxford University epidemiologist   who is based in Laos has   the trade in fake malaria drugs for more than a decade He says shoddy and counterfeit medications have been a major problem for at least  years and theyre responsible for reducing the efficacy of malaria drugs throughout Southeast Asia But the problem isnt limited to that region of the world Economist   from the American Enterprise Institute just wrote the book   about the rise of phony pharmaceuticals around the globe He says fake malaria drugs are a favorite among counterfeiters Its impossible to know the exact scale of the problem of fake antimalarials he says But in some markets its as low as singledigit percentages and in the worst markets half the market is fake For instance he says in Lubumbashi the most southern city in Congo  percent of malaria drugs sampled didnt work Even if theyre worthless against malaria these phony drugs can generate millions of dollars for organized criminals Yet global efforts to attack the counterfeit malaria drug trade remain weak Bate says part of the problem is that malaria mainly affects people in developing nations where pharmaceutical regulation is weak Drug regulatory agencies in malariaendemic countries he says simply arent strong enough to take on the counterfeiters
