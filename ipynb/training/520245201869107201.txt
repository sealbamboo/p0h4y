A team of Harvard scientists said Thursday that they had finally found a way to turn human embryonic stem cells into cells that produce insulin The longsought advance could eventually lead to new ways to help millions of people with diabetes Right now many people with diabetes have to regularly check the level of sugar in their blood and inject themselves with insulin to keep the sugar in their blood in check Its an imperfect treatment This is kind of a lifesupport for diabetics says   a stemcell researcher at Harvard Medical School It doesnt cure the disease and leads to devastating complications of the disease People with poorly controlled diabetes can suffer complications such as blindness amputations and heart attacks Researchers have had some success transplanting insulinproducing cells from cadavers into people with diabetes But its been difficult to procure enough cells to treat large numbers of patients So scientists have been trying to figure out how they could get more cells more easily For Melton who led the work at Harvard this has been a personal quest His son Sam was diagnosed with Type  diabetes when he was  months old and his daughter Emma was diagnosed with the disease when she was  I do what any parent would do which is to say Im not going to put up with this and I want to find a better way  he says And now Melton and his colleagues are reporting in a   being published in this weeks issue of the journal   that they think they have finally found that better way We are reporting the ability to make hundreds of millions of cells  the cell that can read the amount of sugar in the blood which appears following a meal and then squirts out or secretes just the right amount of insulin Melton says The advance came after laboring for more than  years to find a way to turn   into socalled beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin Dozens of scientists spent years analyzing the cells genes and experimenting with different combinations of chemical signals to try to coax the cells into becoming beta cells Finally they came up with a recipe that appears to work Melton says A short way of saying this might be like if you were going to make a very fancy kind of new cake  like a raspberry chocolate cake with vanilla frosting or something Melton says You pretty much know all the components you have to add But its the way you add them and the order and the timing how long you cook it etc The solution to that just took a very long time And when Melton and his colleagues transplanted the cells into mice with diabetes the results were clear  and fast We can cure their diabetes right away  in less than  days he says This finding provides a kind of unprecedented cell source that could be used for cell transplantation therapy in diabetes Other scientists hailed the research as a major step forward Its a huge landmark paper I would say its bigger than the discovery of insulin says   a professor of bioengineering at the University of Illinois The discovery of insulin was important and certainly saved millions of people but it just allowed patients to survive but not really to have a normal life The finding of Doug Melton would really allow to offer them really something what I would call a functional cure You know they really wouldnt feel anymore being diabetic if they got a transplant with those kind of cells Melton and others caution that theres still a lot more work to do For one thing they need to come up with a way to hide the cells from the immune system especially for people with Type  diabetes But theyre working on that and have developed a shell to protect the cells Were thinking about it as sort of like a teabag where the tea stays inside and the water goes in and then the dissolved tea comes out Melton says And so if you think about a teabag analogy we would put our cells inside this teabag But thats not the only problem Some people have moral objections to anything that involves human embryonic stem cell research because it destroys human embryos If like me someone considers the human embryo to be imbued with the same sorts of dignity that the rest of us have then in fact this is morally problematic says   a doctor and bioethicist at the University of Chicago Its the destruction of an individual unique human life for the sole purpose of helping other persons Melton thinks he can also make insulin cells using another kind of stem cell known as an   cell which doesnt destroy any embryos Hes trying to figure out if it works as well and hopes to start testing his insulin cells in people with diabetes within three years
