The Ebola crisis in West Africa has been a very personal outbreak for me says Dr Daniel Bausch The virologist spent quite a few years working on hemorrhagic fevers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Ebola as well as Marburg and Lassa fever He knows the Ebola virus all too well and he knows many of the people whove been deeply involved in fighting the current outbreak including Dr Sheik Umar Khan a virologist in Sierra Leone who   So it has been a challenging year for Bausch an associate professor at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine This spring he spent time in Guinea where the current outbreak started and he was in Sierra Leone for most of June and into July This week he heads to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia to train clinicians heading to West Africa In Washington DC last week for a round of meetings Bausch visited NPRs headquarters and fielded questions from our reporters for  minutes As you can tell he said wryly I talk about this a lot His answers touched on the essence of the virus the search for treatments the dilemmas facing medical caregivers  he once found himself one of two doctors looking after a ward of some  Ebola patients  and the Obama plan which presents its own set of challenges Finding volunteers to go to West Africa will not be easy he notes But without such an effort he stresses the only scenario is the worstcase scenario His comments were simply extraordinary answering many of the burning questions about the disease with a very human touch For those who want to dive in here is his lengthy freewheeling and fascinating conversation The comments were condensed just barely and edited very lightly for clarity Thats a good question and perhaps a controversial one as well First of all on the science side the jury is still out about convalescent plasma or convalescent blood It has at least on the surface an appealing element about it Its lowtech We take your blood check it for a few things that people are used to checking for in that part of the world like hepatitis B and C and HIV and some of the other bloodborne pathogens So far various people have been treated with convalescent blood And some have survived some of them have not Theres really no conclusion that can be drawn from that On the bestcase scenario if you can ensure that blood is safe its probably not going to hurt you very much And youll get what we call the colloid  the proteins  and things that come with a unit of blood probably a reasonable therapy for an Ebola patient Its not going to make a lifeanddeath difference but its probably a good thing The biggest challenge in this whole affair is the personnel to do things If you look at Liberia throughout the civil war the medical school was closed Since the civil war it has graduated something like an average of  medical doctors a year probably half of them Ill speculate are drawn off by the brain drain and working outside the country So I was happy to see the announcement by Obama But its true that when you say were going to train  people a week who are those  people right Incountry its very hard because theres just very few trained health care workers to begin with And then of course theyve been decimated by infections and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone I was in Sierra Leone last month trying to recruit health care workers to work in a ward And they know of course that youre recruiting them because their predecessors died of Ebola So how easy is it to get more health care workers involved And of course the moneys not there No one works for free especially for a dangerous job And so we need to get the money flowing we need to get the right training for those people But its not like theres  workers in Sierra Leone You probably could name all the nurses in the country and it might not get to  And then the internationals its not that easy either First of all its kind of just human nature right whether youre a doctor or a nurse Who wants to go to West Africa and treat people with Ebola Theres  percent that are going to say No I think Im OK at home Fine thanks very much And then the  percent who say I might want to do that their wife or husbands not real excited about that or their jobs not real excited about it Whos going to cover you at the hospital for the next month when youre away But its the right thing to do to try to find these people both nationally and internationally and thats what we have to do Also this is not a sprint its a marathon this outbreak is going to last many more months Im of the very firm conviction that I dont think the resources will be there for the longterm for outside countries to keep involvement Ultimately we need an African solution and we need to transfer that capacity to them Thats not an easy thing but we have to start I dont really know their recruitment process although I get a fair amount of inquiries almost daily from health care workers saying OK Im interested Thats not the process fortunately but I get people Some of them are people that I know and thats worked out And like I got an email from someone today who I used to work with and she said Im on my way to Liberia Or someone hears me on NPR radio and then finds my email and writes me and strangers that say How can I get involved Weve not yet gotten to the point where we understand how that whole thing comes together as some unified response Thats been slow in coming and just difficult to do So you want to volunteer is what youre saying It depends upon what you want to do And different groups have different criteria So MSF Doctors Without Borders for example I think you have to give at least two months  it might have been six weeks I dont remember exactly or you had to have previous experience with viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks which makes sense Its not rocket science  its not that its anything particularly difficult conceptually to do Obviously though you have to do it right or it can be dangerous And then many of the people have never been to subSaharan Africa Its a different place If you like hot showers its maybe not the place for you Theres not one single clearinghouse that I know of So you can contact CDC and you can contact MSF One of the groups that I work with is the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene they would love that Im mentioning them to you And one of the things that were   is all these possible places So you can click and try to get involved I worked there for many years And I had some tense moments when I was in that area a couple of months ago actually in villages where we were trying to do contact tracing People picking up sticks and rocks and things and blocking the road with logs I think theres numerous rumors One is exactly as you said that were bringing in the disease or that the disease doesnt exist at all and this is just an excuse basically to control populations to get more research dollars One of the common rumors is were harvesting organs And you can see a little bit of the idea When you have a disease that has a high case fatality the people go into a treatment center isolation ward most people dont come out alive So people attribute causality to that They say Whatever you do dont go in there because if you go in there youre going to die Those rumors are not unique to Guinea Theyre in all the places and are one of the fundamental problems Because if you look at our approach to this it wholly rests upon collaboration with the community And so we have an outbreak of Ebola we try to find all the people who are sick get them isolated and hope we give them the best treatment we can get all their contacts go find those people But people may not want to be recognized when theyre sick or dont want to be recognized as being a contact from someone with Ebola And be it an actual jungle in a rural area or an urban jungle if they want to disappear theyll disappear and we have no way of finding them But I think we also have to be careful not to be too judgmental Im not an anthropologist or historian but Ive spent a lot of time in subSaharan Africa and the way I look at that is that the colonialera in subSaharan Africa is only about  years old versus for example in Latin America I was laughing one time in Peru where Dr Bausch lives they have these chess sets with the indigenous versus the conquistadors You wouldnt see something like that in subSaharan Africa Its old enough in Latin America that that can pass But its only been  years that the colonial era ended in subSaharan Africa and for centuries before that people who looked like me came and said Oh this or that is going on and its in your best interest that Im here to tell you to do this or that And most often that was probably not the truth And then the colonial era ended and those countries passed over to governments that have largely been very weak and often extremely corrupt And now we show up and say theres this thing thats Ebola Its not really illogical that people would say Im not so sure we should believe these people That idea has come up and people say well is this virus different Is this virus in West Africa more communicable than other Ebola viruses And there was a paper that came out a couple weeks ago that looked at the mutations that have happened in this virus And there are some mutations although that in itself is not a drastic thing you would expect some mutations Its an RNA virus where mutations are the norm And its not drastically different from what we can see in the sequences from other Ebola viruses So I dont really think that this infection rate for health workers is so much of a biological phenomenon Kenema in Sierra Leone has been really the most severe spot right where weve had lots of health care worker infections When I was in Kenema for three or four weeks I think there were probably  or  health care workers who became infected Every day someone was getting sick with a fever And youre trying to turn this around and recruit people and train people and encourage people and say OK you can go and you can do this safely And every day somebody else has a fever and then theyre gone right A lot of focus has been placed on the PPE  the personal protective equipment  you know the masks and gloves and gowns and things like that But its overly simplistic to say those dont work or the virus is different If you go into that situation in Kenema once a few health care workers get sick you get into this really negative cycle So youre working in a ward somebody gets sick dies The next day not many people come to work And then it gets into a negative cycle where the ward gets even more unsafe Because a safe ward its not only about masks and gowns and gloves its about having the right proportion of health care workers to the patients its about having sanitation workers You go into a ward its not unusual to see that someone has fallen out of bed or in delirium has crawled out of bed They can be on the floor soiled with stool or vomitus or blood And what should happen is that a team of three or four or five different people all with the sanitation officer who has some bleach to spray comes over carefully decontaminates that area carefully gets this patient back into a bed But when I was in Kenema last month myself and one other doctor sponsored by WHO we got gowned up to go in and do our rounds And unbeknownst to us the nurses had gone on strike We go in theres about  patients with Ebola in the ward and he and I are the two health care workers that are there The analogy Ive been using its like saying well youve trained somebody to be a pilot So theres the plane go fly the plane without thinking What about mechanics What about the other people who have to guide the plane down the runway You dont have all the very important supporting personnel that you need for Ebola and so its been a tragic situation And there was a day when I was in Kenema last month where I thought we just need to close this hospital its just not ethical to keep doing this with health care workers getting infected But what do you do You have  people who have Ebola What do you do with them Do you say Go back to your home If you send them all home thats infecting five more people in each household So you try to get things as safe as you can in the hospital and soldier on What weve been doing now is ratcheting down the idea of what care really means not because we want to but because we have to Many not all but many of the places right now if you get sick with Ebola its not at all the care that we want to give where a doctor examines you and says OK you need some IV fluids and things like that We just dont have the capacity Right now its to give people a bed hopefully some food and some water and some analgesics  some Tylenol  for pain and some oral rehydration solution and to get them out of circulation so they dont infect more people And is that the way we want it to be Of course not I felt bad no matter what I did in that situation because each patient I would sort of assess And sometimes I would give in to the doctor side of me saying well this person needs an IV let me try to quickly start an IV on this person and hang some fluids And then afterward I think that was stupid right not because I think that that in itself was dangerous I was telling somebody earlier Im not a person who actually likes risk per se I dont go skydiving or bungee cord jumping or stuff like that Im relatively mildmannered in my interests So its not that I couldnt do that with one patient but you just realize the futility of it Lets say OK I put an IV in this person and I got a liter of fluid into him but they need  liters a day for the next five days and even if I wanted to Id have to stay in the ward  hours a day to do that and that just wouldnt be physically possible So something that has no benefit isnt worth any risk right And so if I did it I would think that was probably not a wise thing to do and if I didnt do it you know if youre a doctor it feels bad right So it wasnt a pleasant situation Higher but I dont know what number These patients are losing an inordinate amount of fluids through vomiting through diarrhea through high fevers where you lose fluids and sometimes through bleeding And so the ability to give them back those fluids it would make a difference But I dont think we should be nave Ebola is a very bad disease Before Id ever seen a case of Ebola Id seen some cases of other viral hemorrhagic fever like Lassa and so when I went to my first Ebola outbreak I was like Oh yeah this is going to be kind of like that But its not like that Its a very bad disease Ebola happens fast people suffer a lot and it has a high case fatality And so I think we could bring the case fatality rate down with modern medicine and fluids and all not even talking about experimental drugs like Zmapp but just with early treatment But I dont think we should be nave Its not going to be something where we get it down to a few percentage points its still going to be a very serious disease I remember this one patient not in this outbreak but an outbreak in Uganda a few years ago And we did have control of that ward and we were doing a little bit closer to kind of what we would think of as typical medical rounds examining each patient and able to gear our care to their needs each day to some degree And this guy came in he was a military guy and his wife had just died of confirmed Ebola and he came in right away saying I have a fever A young healthy guy I thought OK like heres a guy I know hes going to have the disease I got him right at the beginning and I have time now because the outbreak is somewhat controlled and Im really going to just really pay close attention to this guy and his fluid balance and see if we can get him through I dont claim to be the worlds best doctor but I dont think Im the worlds worst either But he still died So I think we could definitely get the death rate down I think that supportive care would make a big difference but it wouldnt obviate the need to have some medicines if we can get a good medicine and assure that its safe and effective Why does one person die and another person survive We dont really know the answer Genetic predisposition is one thing Or the route of inoculation  whether you rub the virus into your eye or you eat it Are you exposed to a thousand virions versus  virions Whether you have other comorbidities like malaria Lots of different things might affect survival So we dont really know And one of the factors is the care that they get So I dont know What would we get the death rate down to Would we take the normal case fatality for Ebola Zaire virus from the  percent range down to  percent That seems a little bit ambitious to me but wed definitely knock it down a bit No I dont think airborne transmission is going on From all the data we have from other outbreaks and as best as we can surmise from this outbreak people who get Ebola had direct contact with other people who had Ebola Direct contact means contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick with Ebola and relatively close in time to when that fluid was shed So this is not a particularly hardy virus in the environment and this is not something thats getting into the water supply or sitting on the streets or on the grass for days and days and still viable And so if you look who gets this virus again we know who the groups are One group is the people who are health care workers taking care of patients And theres so much virus now that the patient may not be in an Ebola ward One of the doctors that just died in Sierra Leone a few days ago she wasnt working in a ward with Ebola she was working in the public hospital Connaught Hospital in Freetown And the guy who was medevaced back here to Nebraska was an obstetrician who was delivering babies and seeing people but he wasnt working in an Ebola ward Unfortunately the disease has spread around that you dont know who has Ebola And so someone comes and theyre a pregnant woman with a fever and maybe has a spontaneous abortion The clinicians dont think about Ebola So its really direct contact either a health care worker a family member taking care of someone whos sick or someone attending a funeral and having direct contact with the corpse or bodily fluids shed from that corpse And at funerals in Africa people touch and hug the corpse Theres some places where people wash the corpse and collect the water and then bathe in the water But its not an easily transmitted disease its something that has to have that direct contact Airborne transmission you know thats come up in the last few days especially with   Lets put it this way I cant think of any example of mutations that have fundamentally changed the biology of a virus so its transmitted through a different mechanism than would be its norm and so there are mutations that would make something a little bit more transmissible or less transmissible but not necessarily changing its complete mode of transmission So I dont think that theres airborne transmission of this virus not in terms of the true aerosolized virus sense Theres airborne transmission if Im sick and I cough and there are small droplets that might land on your mucus membranes because youre within range thats a different sort of thing and thats what the protections and the PPE are designed to prevent In terms of true airborne transmission I dont think there is true aerosol transmission and Im not worried about mutations conferring it So is there the potential What often happens is people come with scenarios that are say like this So youre in a taxi and they say well what if the person who was in the taxi before me was a sick person who was bleeding or had vomiting and then the taxi driver dropped them off at the hospital And the passenger had contaminated the seats with vomitus or stool And then I get into the taxi and I put my hand on the seat and then I touch my eye Could I get Ebola like that Yes you could get Ebola like that Is that really what our major concern is Those things are probably very rare We dont really have lots of sound data of what period people start shedding virus and from what tissues And so that would be incredibly valuable data What we do have is the epidemiological data and when we put that together from past outbreaks it really appears that most infections occur from very sick people late in the course of their illness One thing that happens and its very clear from both human as well as nonhuman primate data that in Ebola the sicker you are the higher your viremia  the level of virus in your blood Conversely if youre not very sick you have a very low level of virus in your blood youre not particularly infectious And when you think about it the virus its not jumping off the wall it has to get from one person to another And so if I have Ebola right now which I dont by the way  I havent been in West Africa for over a month but if I had Ebola right now even if I said OK I have a fever and a headache but I still feel well enough to have this conversation your risk of getting Ebola from being around me and probably even shaking my hand is extremely low to nil because I just dont have very much virus Its clearly not transmitted from casual contacts Going and shaking hands with a person whos not sick does not transmit Ebola And then someone will ask Well what if they had a sick family member at home and they didnt wash their hands So you can always come up with something where you say Yeah that could do that And the example I use is OK theres a plane thats flying overhead and could that plane crash now into this building and kill us It could but its probably not the most likely thing we need to worry about So we know how this is spread This is spread from direct contact with sick people and thats where we need to focus And is there somebody somewhere who had indirect contact through one of those things from being in the wrong taxi or kind of the wrong situation It probably happens and we dont know it but it doesnt happen very often and its not where we need to focus our public health approach I think its possible to be a   caregiver But since we have health care workers who have a good amount of training and have been trained to use the PPE and to take care of a patient with Ebola and they still get sick then how could we expect people who are not health care workers to do this safely So I dont think that we can I dont think that we can say Oh yeah sure if we just give PPE to all the people in the houses and where theres a sick person that theyll be fine thats not a realistic expectation But right now its not an eitheror We have no capacity to put enough beds with trained health care workers across Liberia and Sierra Leone in any real shortterm sort of framework of the coming few weeks Now theres no other choice People are going to be sick at home theres no place to go theres not enough beds in Ebola treatment units across the region right now And so since theyre going to be sick at home and since we have no place to tell them to go is it better for their family to have some gloves and some bleach and some gowns I think its better Will it mean that there will be no transmission in the household No I dont think it will But could it mean that instead of five people getting infected three people got infected It might And so I think thats worth a try The viruses can only replicate in living tissue they commandeer certain proteins and functions of a living cell for their replication So once any organism dies there can be no more replication of a virus Bacterium is different right If you leave the food out bacteria will grow But a virus cant do that And so in this virus Ebola virus its not kind of an Andromeda straintype thing where we cant kill the virus we can kill the virus pretty easily through bleach and Lysol and alcohol and a host of different things And so once it gets out in the environment its not particularly hardy You cant give an exact number of hours or days because theres not been a lot of research we need more research and it also depends upon the conditions Viruses dont like heat and light and that will inactivate what they call a lipid membrane of this virus And so if that virus is out in an area where theres a lot of heat and light then its going to be inactivated relatively soon If that virus is in a place where its dark and cool itll last longer If you put it in a test tube and you put the test tube on the table in a cool dark place itll probably last for I dont know weeks maybe But if a drop of blood on this table that dries and is out in the light and heat were probably talking hours to days of this virus surviving You cant put a test tube of Ebola virus into the reservoir the drinking water and that sort of thing or spread it around just in the environment and in the ground Somebody wrote me last week and said Do you know where the burial grounds are for patients with Ebola because we want to try to clean all those areas up because the decaying corpses are going to leak into the water supply And I wrote back and tried to diplomatically say this is a waste of time because in a decaying corpse the pH changes and other things happen thats not going to be a very conducive environment for spread Again there can be no replication so once an organism dies thats the highest level of virus that can be there Then its going to fall off relatively rapidly And we dont really need to concern ourselves about virus leaking into the water supply and into the groundwater and things thats not our problem Guinea is certainly not under control but its under more control than Liberia and Sierra Leone So in Guinea I think you could still have hope that you can recognize the transmission chain and if you can feel like you have all the contacts then contact tracing if you have the personnel and capacity to trace them its still a viable response Liberia of course is the place where we have lots of virus sprinkled around almost the whole country And the eastern part of Sierra Leone is like that We fear that the rest of Sierra Leone is going in that direction I hope not but the fear is that Sierra Leone is a few weeks away from that sort of logarithmic growth weve seen in Liberia So one person infects four and those infect another four and then those infect another four And so at a certain point it goes up and then when it takes off it really goes up If you have a situation where theres thousands of cases of Ebola that represent thousands of different contacts that are spread over a whole country and youve really lost sight now of what those transmission chains are it really does no particular good now If we know that Im the only person in the room who has Ebola and youre my only contact that makes sense to do contact tracing But now if we say that theres five or six of us in the room who have Ebola and a whole bunch of different contacts really whats the sense now of kind of tracing those people Or if we take a larger scale of this whole building that theres  or  people that have a whole bunch of chains of transmission then at a certain point we just have to say everyone in that buildings at risk right And so we take a different approach So I dont think contact tracing is an approach that we can right now think of doing in Liberia And you know in some areas of Sierra Leone it probably still makes sense and other areas not The idea is we persist with the Ebola treatment units where a suspected case goes in isolation and ideally would get IV therapy and medical care Were not there yet to do that on any sort of scale Quite frankly we just dont have the possibility right now of reacting as we wish we could As we hopefully build capacity and units and beds in Ebola treatment units then what we would want is the people who are positive would get transferred to get a better level of care Thats going to take time If we had the US making a major intervention in Liberia the UK making a major intervention in Sierra Leone and France making a major intervention in Guinea that would give us something to work with to start with So Id like to see that Am I optimistic or pessimistic We dont have many choices right now And what do you do Are we going to say Well I guess just wash your hands of it I wouldnt feel comfortable as a public health worker saying that were just going to give up I do agree that the risk to the United States in terms of sustained transmission or large outbreak here is extremely small so thats not our No  concern But the other countries in West Africa are certainly vulnerable The instability economically and politically thats happening and will happen in the three most afflicted countries and could happen in other places So there are many reasons to keep on with the fight no matter what We have to keep doing our best I view it in a couple different ways When I went to Guinea near the beginning of the outbreak at that time we didnt have cases yet in Sierra Leone and there had been some cases in Liberia But when I came home from Guinea I think it was in early May if you look at the epidemic curve there was basically this period where we thought we may have had control of things And I remember having conversations with people at WHO and the team that I was working with and talking about well should we recruit new people to replace me and maybe its just going to be a waste because if theyre coming theyre going to do clinical care and theres no patients We thought that maybe things were over at that time And during that period in Guinea for me it was kind of if you will a typical Ebola outbreak What I mean by that is that you go into one of these outbreaks and theres the usual players on the field And so Guinea was sort of a normal Ebola outbreak And then things turned out to not be under control When I went back to Sierra Leone a month or six weeks later and went to the same meeting at Sierra Leone my first reaction was Where is everybody We just really had very few people around the table And I think that was the period where we had outstripped the resources where people had sent their experts spent their money for the first two three months in Guinea and Liberia and were used to kind of having this very intensive approach getting people in there and then three months we usually declare victory But we outstripped everybodys resources MSF and everybody else And then WHO had that meeting to sound the alarm bell to say this is a big deal and people need to get into this And I think that some did and some didnt and theres no denying that collectively were all late How can we say anything different We have this major public health humanitarian disaster unfolding in West Africa so how hypocritical it would be for me to say Yeah we did everything right If we did everything right it wouldnt be happening I dont like to point fingers Theres things that should have been different on a lot of different levels Its all been too slow Sometimes its been slow because people didnt take it as seriously as they should have Sometimes its slow just because its damn hard to do this not in terms of it being rocketscience complicated but you just think OK Obama says were going to get these people into Liberia and do this And where do you get the  people a week How do you go to a country that is so limited in its resources and its infrastructure and say that you want to set up an isolation center in some remote corner that needs it but OK its  hours by bad road and theres no materials And oh by the way theres no electricity and no running water and stuff It doesnt just happen because you make an announcement It takes just an incredible effort to set all this stuff up and it takes time Every day I get up and feel frustrated because Im feeling I want to have some solution A few months ago people would say Whats the solution And most times I would think probably arrogantly that I have the solution its just a matter of getting people to do it And now its harder I havent given up hope but theres no doubt that its an uphill battle And one of the things that I think still drives me about it all is we still have to try Even though this is going to be a tough road were going to still try our best And so we still do that now One of the things that really drives me is this idea of the experimental therapies and vaccines And working in this field for a good while now its frustrating to always say  and it always comes up you know you go to whatever country and the people say What about medicines And you say Oh well theres some good medicines and vaccines but we only know that they work in animals and it hasnt really gone past that And its been awhile that were saying that So I feel like one thing that definitely has to happen for the future is that we have to come out of this outbreak with some tools This is our opportunity its in the spotlight there are people willing to bend the rules more than they normally would in terms of the regulatory things we need to do We dont want to bend them too much  we want to make sure that were not hurting people But we can all appreciate that if you had Ebola youd be willing to bend the rules yourself a little bit right And we can envision that for the future in Ebola we get one confirmed case of Ebola in Kenema district Sierra Leone in two weeks everybody in Kenema district Sierra Leone is vaccinated against Ebola The people who were unlucky enough to be infected early maybe have a bad disease But we dont have this big thing Thats where I think we have to get we have to have something that we come out of this thats good and this is our opportunity to get that So thats what Im kind of focusing on a lot Hiccups have been associated with Ebola but they were really something you saw in terminal cases at least from my experience I dont know how many cases of Ebola Ive seen maybe hundreds   something like that But I had never seen hiccups early on and I write some textbook chapters about this and I always write that hiccups are a late sign Then people told me Oh were seeing this in people and I just thought they were wrong But when I went to West Africa the last couple of times I saw some people early on who had hiccups Next time I write that chapter Im going to have to change it So I think its real
