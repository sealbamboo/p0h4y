The chilling dilemma of   who dont have family or close friends to make medical decisions on their behalf if they cant speak for themselves generated a bunch of ideas the last time we discussed it One reader Elizabeth from Los Angeles commented that as an only child who had no children she wished she could hire someone to take on this daunting but crucial responsibility I would much rather pay a professional whom I get to know and who knows me to make the decisions she wrote That way it is an objective decisionmaker based on the priorities I have discussed with himher before my incapacitation Elizabeth it turns out other people have been thinking the same way A few years back Elena Berman a retired administrator at the University of Arizona was trying to put her own paperwork in order and wondering about her health care proxy Shes single and has no children and her only sibling lives halfway across the country When I tried to think whom I might ask to fill this position no relative came to mind she told me in an interview Two friends agreed to be her decisionmakers but they are about her own age Thats great if I die in five years or so said Dr Berman who is  But after that its up for grabs With people living longer and families having fewer children she pointed out I see this as a growing population She started chewing over this problem with a couple of geriatricians and an elder attorney in Tucson One physician a medical librarian dug up a  study reporting that  percent of people in intensive care units have no designated decisionmaker and no identifiable family who could fill that role Last year Dr Berman and her coauthors published an article in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society proposing   These people would largely be drawn from retired social workers or nurses people in the helping professions Dr Berman said They might also be clergy or perhaps paralegals They would need to navigate the health care system she added They could work comfortably and easily within that world The coauthors envisioned health fiduciaries undergoing up to a years training those already knowledgeable about medical matters and endoflife decisions would probably need far less followed by certification in individual states Health fiduciaries would need good communication skills so they could guide people as they prepared advance directives They would meet with physicians as needed to understand a clients prognosis and options Because they would understand what their clients want and dont want they could serve as their advocates when they couldnt express their own choices Fiduciaries would probably work out of elder law firms or geriatric care management practices Dr Berman figures because clients might retain them so many years in advance that theyd want that kind of continuity How much would a health fiduciary cost In ballpark figures the authors assumed theyd charge  an hour much less than an attorney or even most geriatric care managers They might spend  hours initially to understand and document a clients wishes and to later consult with health care providers the authors theorized  plus additional discussions every few years to see if the clients thinking or health status has changed Over all they figured the tab might come to about  over several decades With inflation or in cases of dementia it might run considerably higher Still compared to Terri Schiavo the cost is negligible said Dr Berman invoking the case of the comatose young Florida woman whose court case has probably led to more advance directives than any other event Among the many details to be worked out is who would pay the fiduciaries Perhaps Dr Berman suggested Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers  which would benefit substantially if health fiduciaries prevented unwanted and unnecessary treatments  would finance an independent organization to pay their fees and regulate their practices Some clients would be able to pay privately and might welcome the chance to do so In fact Dr Berman sees fiduciaries as a desirable option even for people who have relatives Maybe they dont want to burden family members Maybe they are estranged from them Maybe they worry that in a crisis   which is not a baseless fear Maybe it seems too difficult to contemplate the whole subject After all despite constant haranguing  well encouragement  and despite campaigns like   and   intended to help people discuss their preferences and create advance directives most people still dont Hired help might be an improvement Theyd be able to have these conversations that families dont have Dr Berman said of health fiduciaries She is hoping an area agency on aging will step up to run a pilot program A knowledgeable compassionate person who understands the system and what these choices involve and can answer your questions  that will be attractive to many people she said
