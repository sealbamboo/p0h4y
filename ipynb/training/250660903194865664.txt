Tell people youre doing a story about the life spans of Korean eunuchs the typical reaction is a giggle or a cringe But if you can overcome your visceral response to the topic a study scientists in Korea did is quite interesting both for what they found and the way they found it Several scientists have shown that there is a link between longevity and reproduction the greater the fertility the shorter the life span This has been fairly well established in nonhuman animal species but proving its the case for humans has been tricky Kyungjin Min of   in Inchon Korea took a unique approach to the problem He and his colleagues plowed through historical records from the Korean court dating back to  Eunuchs did a variety of jobs for the king and they were rewarded well for the work Among the perks They were the only males outside the royal family who were allowed to stay in the palace overnight Maintaining genealogy records was important because these records provided proof of belonging to the YangBan Noble class Min writes in the online   accompanying   in the journal  But determining an individuals age at death was complicated Dates were kept using the   meaning they reset every  years The lifespan of the eunuchs could be deduced only when the record contained the Kings name and the ruling year Min writes For example YoonMuk Lee was born in the seventeenth year of King YoungJos reign AD  and died in the sixteenth year of King SoonJos reign AD  Their painstaking research yielded  eunuchs whose age could be reliably determined For comparison Min and his colleagues also looked the life spans of male members of royal families who were capable of having children The average lifespan of eunuchs was    years which was  years longer than the lifespan of noncastrated men of similar socioeconomic status Min writes Whats more  of the  lived to be  or older The current incidence of centenarians is one per  in Japan and per  in the United States Min writes  a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York studies hormone changes with aging She says the Korean results are consistent with a   she published last year showing that male and female centenarians had fewer children than people who died younger But she and her colleague Nil Barzilai point out that it would probably be a mistake to assume that decreasing male sex hormones would automatically lead to a longer life The eunuchs were castrated at early age they pointed out in an email to Shots It may have influenced puberty maturity and a variety of other hormones Thus this study does not mean that if you take an elderly person and decrease their sex hormone they may live longer In any event its not clear how many men would choose such an extreme strategy to squeeze out a few more years of existence even if it was proved to work
