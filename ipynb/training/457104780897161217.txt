More than two months ago a nasty   triggered fever headache and painfully swollen glands among a handful of students at Ohio State University Now the outbreak has ballooned to  cases at last count and has spilled into the surrounding community in Columbus Ohio Columbus officials are calling it the citys biggest outbreak since the development of the mumps vaccine in the s WOSU reporter Steve Brown tells Shots It even pushed them to open a new clinic So far most of those infected are students or workers at Ohio State Brown says And heres whats surprising Many of those who got sick had previously been immunized against mumps via one of the top weapons against childhood diseases the MMR vaccine Thats a twodose shot most of us got when we were kids to protect against three diseases  measles mumps and rubella Interestingly a young woman in New York caught the   in  even though she too had been vaccinated scientists reported last week Measles Mary as   magazine   her also spread the virus to four others Whats going on here Is one of our best shields against infectious illness faltering To answer those questions we talked with a vaccine specialist   at Vanderbilt University in Nashville The conversation has been edited for length and clarity Measles is a terrific vaccine If you get two doses its predicted to protect  percent of people for life That case in New York was so unusual that its come to everyones attention On rare occasions the virus trumps an individuals protection The mumps vaccine on the other hand is not so good The protection rate varies from study to study But its usually in the mids Both vaccines for mumps and measles are tamed versions of the viruses The viruses arent killed but what we call attenuated live viruses If you dont attenuate the mumps virus enough you get better protection but more complications with the vaccine So were walking a fine line To avoid   the mumps vaccine doesnt protect as well as the measles We wish we had a better mumps vaccine Yes In the US we have done a stupendous job of comprehensively vaccinating children We have the best vaccination record in the world  Im proud to stay sitting up with a big smile on my face But every developed country hasnt gotten with the program So we have mumps cases imported into the US from Europe and the UK Well hello  if the   everyone there would be less importation and fewer outbreaks in the US With the situation in Ohio what well probably find is that the vaccine protected about  percent of the people So you can see that some people who were vaccinated can acquire the illness  if theyre exposed With measles and rubella protection rates of the vaccine are up in the mid s What drives these outbreaks in the US are children that have been withheld from vaccines So its failure to vaccinate not vaccine failure  as with mumps Correct Vaccines have two functions Protect the person vaccinated and provide protection to the entire community If you want to eliminate the infection entirely from a community a very high proportion of people have to be immunized If children are left unvaccinated measles will find them and make them sick Its one of the most contagious diseases we have Mumps is not quite as communicable But with only about  percent of a population protected by the vaccine outbreaks can smolder along and infect just enough people to keep going To protect yourself the No  priority is to make sure everyone is vaccinated If you know of someone who has the mumps  We recommend everyone gets two doses of the MMR vaccine Then if there is a mumps outbreak in your community like in Ohio health workers will figure out which population is at risk and give them a third dose
