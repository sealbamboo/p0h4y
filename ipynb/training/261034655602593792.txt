On furlough from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center this summer yearold Nick Staback lounges on his parents back porch in Scranton Pa taking potshots at sparrows with a replica sniper rifle The long plastic gun fires pellets that mostly just scare the birds away Its been a tough year for Staback since his last foot patrol in Afghanistan We were just channeling down a beaten trail of course you just dont know whats on it he says We had the mine sweepers out front and everything like that The area was littered with homemade bombs and everyone knew it I was kind of looking where I was going to step make sure I was going to step in my buddys footprint kind of thing he says But I guess it was just the wrong time the wrong place The bomb threw Staback high in the air he landed on his back in a state of shock Thats when I looked and saw probably a good couple inches of my femur on my right side sticking out I couldnt tell that my left leg was completely gone but I did see that it was all mangled up and shredded he says Stabacks right forearm had a chop of flesh missing as well A swarm of Afghan hornets stirred by the blast began stinging his buddies as they struggled to control the bleeding and carry Staback to a medevac helicopter Thousands of miles away in Scranton Stabacks mother Maria had just arrived at the state liquor store where she worked as a manager The gentleman on the phone said Are you sitting down  she says And he said I need you to go somewhere  in a lunchroom a break room somewhere  and sit down  The call was from Kandahar where her son was in critical condition I couldnt talk I couldnt breathe she recalls Then he started going on and telling me everything that happened Then I had to call my district manager I said Nicholas was injured they blew my baby up The next year would transform both their lives as Maria took a leave of absence to move into an apartment with her son at Walter Reed She quickly found her niche there Maria says Nick and her husband started calling her the Gestapo because of her relentless oversight of Nicks therapy and medicine She was a tough coach as he learned to walk on two prosthetic legs People think Im horrible she says For some reason his knee gave out and he spun around and fell to the ground and these two other Army guys they come running over  Are you OK  and Im standing there and Im laughing And I said Oh yeah hes fine Let him go Dont help him I told them He can get up on his own He said Oh yeah Im OK Both of us were laughing like idiots She calls Nick her comic relief Hes not above making jokes about his prosthetic legs  like screaming when his buddies pretend to kick him in the shins or complaining about twisting an ankle He discovered exactly how many cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon fit in the hollow of his hightech legs and then passed them around the local bar in Scranton for everyone to take a swig Nick says he doesnt mind falling You get up he says You dont fall you dont learn anything The Stabacks have four purple hearts hanging in the house  Nicks brother Ryan did two tours to Iraq and one to Afghanistan Uncles served in World War II and Korea Nick still wants some sort of job that involves carrying a rifle He says hes not going to let anyone tell him what he cant do But like many yearolds hes not sure what exactly what he wants If it comes to it where they just cant allow me to do it whatever he says Just play the cards youre dealt Ill go on to the next thing Nick says he does get down sometimes but tries to shrug it off and just get on with his life As for his mother shes been relentlessly upbeat since he got back from Afghanistan  at least when shes around him I can never tell if shes having a rough day or not She always had a smile on her face when she saw me Nick says Maria says the hard part for her is wrapping up her time at Walter Reed and going back to work at the end of this month Nick is moving into an apartment with a friend near the hospital in Bethesda Md Hes going to miss me she says and Nick admits that he will Hes a strong boy Were a strong family Maria says Its already normal This is the new normal so Im used to it already
