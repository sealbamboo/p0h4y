 A new study suggests   might encourage better shuteye People who met national exercise guidelines reported better sleep and less daytime fatigue than those who didnt The research doesnt confirm that exercise directly leads to improved rest and its possible there may be another explanation for the apparent connection between exercise and sleep Still the findings are mostly consistent with previous research said Matthew P Buman an assistant professor of exercise and wellness at Arizona State University whos familiar with the study But if you think a daily walk or jog will clear up your sleep problems that might be a bit too optimistic In general the relationship between physical activity and sleep is moderate Buman said More than onethird of US adults have   at night or staying alert during the day according to background information in the study Inadequate sleep has been linked to depression cardiovascular disease and other health problems The new study led by researchers at Oregon State University looked at statistics from a US health survey conducted from  to  The researchers focused on more than  men and women  aged  to   who measured their activity levels and answered questions about sleep All wore accelerometers devices that measure physical activity for a week The researchers adjusted their statistics so they wouldnt be thrown off by unusually high or low numbers of people of certain ages weight health condition   or other factors The researchers then determined how many participants met or exceeded national exercise guidelines by getting at least  minutes a week of moderate exercise or  minutes a week of vigorous exercise or a combination of both Those who met the guidelines were  percent less likely to report often feeling sleepy during the day compared to those who got less exercise They were also  percent less likely to report sometimes having leg cramps and  percent less likely to report having trouble concentrating while tired The study appears in the December issue of the journal   Buman called the finding intriguing even if it doesnt prove that exercise improves sleep If that is the case however the causes are unclear Some researchers think physical activity improves sleep by helping reduce levels of stress anxiety and depression he said Others have suggested an energy conservation hypothesis essentially saying that when you burn more calories through exercise your body more efficiently uses the sleep period to   Others have suggested that exercise can modestly reduce body weight which in turn helps people to sleep better Another theory suggests that exercise helps the body deal better with the cooling down of its temperature during sleep he said So should you avoid exercising before bed as conventional wisdom suggests The new research doesnt look at the timing of exercise but the study authors do note that most previous studies havent shown that latenight exercise disrupts sleep quality Study coauthor Brad Cardinal a professor of exercise science at Oregon State said in a statement that the study is unusual because it directly measured how much exercise people got instead of relying on their memories which can be faulty
