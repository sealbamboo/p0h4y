If we are what we eat then many of us must be tripping all over the place due to a lack of balance Thats because the average American eats about three servings of fruits and vegetables per day  a stark contrast to the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and the US Department of Agricultures USDA new guidelines stating that we should be eating  to  servings of natures best depending on the number of calories you need So if we want to grow to be strong like Popeye why cant we just down some supplements instead of devouring a pile of spinach Kristine Wallerius Cuthrell MPH RD a research nutritionist and senior project coordinator for Hawaii Foods at the Center on the Family at University of Hawaii at Manoa says that in the past five to  years many large research studies have found that   dont provide the benefits that foods do The  Dietary Guidelines for Americans created jointly between HHS and USDA and reviewed every five years say that foods are the best sources of nutrients because they contain naturally occurring ingredients like carotenoids and flavonoids In addition to the substances we are aware of there are many present in fruits and vegetables that have yet to be discovered Food and the nutrients they contain arent consumed singly but with each other As such they may act in synergistic ways to promote health Cuthrell says For instance eating ironrich plants like spinach with an ironabsorbing enhancer like the vitamin C in orange juice is great for people who dont get enough iron typically young women Eating fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of cardiovascular diseases stroke   and even some forms of cancer The Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Followup Study examined nearly  people over the course of  years Part of the study revealed that the more fruits and vegetables people ate daily the less chance they would develop cardiovascular diseases The relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer prevention has been more difficult to prove However recent studies show that some types of produce are associated with lower rates of some types of cancer For example the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research suggest that mouth stomach and colorectal cancers are less likely with high intakes of nonstarchy foods like leafy greens broccoli and cabbage Though studies have been mixed lycopene a carotenoid that gives tomatoes their red color may help stave off   Theyre low in fat and calories and loaded with fiber and water which create a feeling of fullness This is particularly helpful for dieters who want more filling calories Plus that fiber helps keep you regular When adding fruits and vegetables to your   remember that variety is the spice of life Its important to eat produce of various colors because each fruit or vegetable offers a different nutrient  think of it as nutritional crosstraining Trying new foods can be exciting and be sure to sample every color in the produce rainbow The right number of servings of fruits and vegetables for you all depends on your daily caloric intake needs A good way to find out how many servings you should be eating is by using the CDCs   Or make things even simpler by eating a fruit or vegetable at every meal and snack Dont let season accessibility or cost affect your fruit and vegetablefriendly diet If finding fresh produce is difficult choose frozen canned lowsodium or dried varieties Also  percent juice counts toward your servings though it doesnt offer the full   of whole fruit The power of prevention may lie in a salad bowl or a plate of fruit When we take advantage of produce our bodies return the favor by reducing our risk of developing various illnesses
