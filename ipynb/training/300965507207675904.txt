  Research has shown that exercise may   but according to a new study published in the journal   race may play a role in how much that risk is reduced Researchers from the Durham NC Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that while exercise reduced prostate cancer risk in white men it did not have the same effect in black men Weve known for a long time that African Americans are associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer and for prostate cancer death says Lionel L Baez MD study author and investigator with the   Theres a growing body of evidence in recent literature which points to exercise as having a beneficial relationship in that exercise may be associated with reduced risk Whether the relationship between exercise and cancer risk is affected by race had not been discussed Over the course of four years researchers looked at  black men and  white men undergoing prostate biopsies and asked them to rate their exercise levels every week White men who rated themselves as either moderately or highly active were  percent less likely to show signs of prostate cancer in their biopsies than those who did not exercise or who were only mildly active However the same risk reduction did not hold for black men who exercised at any level Dr Baez thinks the reason exercise worked to reduce prostate cancer risk for the white men but not the black men probably comes down to genes We hypothesize that there are racespecific genetic differences and that may play a role in the relationship between exercise and cancer risk he says But Timothy Gilligan MD a medical oncologist with the   says he is skeptical of the findings Its not clear yet if the findings are really true or not Its provocative says Dr Gilligan Blacks and whites are not genetically distinguishable Race distinctions are more a social construct than a biological construct Baez thinks more work needs to be done to better understand the results but that if they hold true in a larger study it could lead to better   for everyone The underlying mechanisms that explain why there is a racespecific disparity should be uncovered he says so it can be turned into an effective way to reduce cancer risk for men across all backgrounds Gilligan isnt confident the results would pan out in a larger study When you look at the science of being a human being the color of your skin is not a very important factor he says What genes you carry doesnt correlate to the color of your skin Were all not that different
