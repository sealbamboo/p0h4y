The study published in the June edition of the found that people in  spent about a fourth of their disposable income on food Today food takes up about a tenth of our disposable income Food is also easier to prepare and easier to purchase than it was in  That means Americans arent just eating more highcalorie food they are eating more of a variety of foods Consequently Americans have consumed on average about    since the s   Lead study authors   and   hope it will lay to rest some myths about obesity  If you look at the data over time you actually see a slight increase in exercise And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation Its not Southern hospitality that is driving this trend nor is it income or education Really nothing protects us from this challenge of obesity  On average Americans have been getting fatter since at least the s maybe even longer  While the data isnt perfect experts looking at health records for men between the ages of  and  see a steady increase in  since  Obesity isnt only a problem for people who want to wear bikinis to the beach  Excess body fat can  for heart disease cancer diabetes stroke and chronic illnesses   What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives said    director of nutrition and physical activity for the     Doyle suggests a   where it is easy for people to engage in physical activity  meaning sidewalks and bike lanes and safer streets Also helpful would be changing social norms so that families will expect healthier school meals and calorie counts are readily available on restaurant menus  No one thing is the solution to this problem we are having Doyle said This latest study points out a few positives Americans are exercising more Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show an uptick in the number of people who say they get  minutes of moderate exercise five or more days a week or  minutes of vigorous activity on three or more days about  in  compared to  in    The availability of   has also increased over the last  years with a  increase in fresh fruit and a  increase in fresh vegetables per capita from  to  But the number of people who actually eat fruits and vegetables has stayed flat   That may be one area where public policy could help   Agriculture policy has a huge impact on what people eat said study coauthor An Ruopeng Maybe instead of promoting commodity food like corn and soy we could instead incentivize small farms to grow more fruits and vegetables   We dont want food to become really expensive again that is not the answer said Sturm The markets were successful in solving a really old problem of food scarcity  Now we have a new problem in the works with obesity so we may need the market forces now to nudge in a different direction Sturm believes a policy South Africa has tried may help In some  supermarkets in the African country healthy foods were subsidized and available at a  discount The price did nudge people in the right direction to eat healthier   A tax on sugary foods and sodas in Mexico was also introduced last year but experts are still waiting to see what impact that policy will have on eating habits Here in the United States some members of Congress have introduced similar taxes but havent been able to get them passed  It will take more than public policy to end the obesity epidemic the study authors say  There is no silver bullet Sturm said True change would have to come from the ground up   Smoking for instance used to be common indoors but policy and social attitude has made that less socially acceptable   When people come over to visit you offer them a coke or freshly baked cookies Sturm said That is the social norm But maybe in the future we will look at that behavior like we do about public smoking
