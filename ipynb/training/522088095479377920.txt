Just having a feminine voice means youre probably not as capable at your job At least studies suggest thats what many people in the United States   Theres a gender bias in how Americans perceive feminine voices as insecure   and   This can be a problem  especially for women jockeying for power in maledominated fields like law Monica Hanna a tough litigator in New York City is about  feet tall and has a high voice She has always had misgivings about how she sounds but things came to a head a few years ago when one of the partners at her firm assessed a presentation she gave by telling her Your voice is very high And then he didnt say anything else says Hanna He didnt have any other comment to make about my presentation at all Many people would have been humiliated  or furious But Hanna doesnt have that type of personality Shes actionoriented So when her high voice came up   in an evaluation about a year ago she decided to try to change this thing about herself that most of us think of as unchangeable I came back to my desk Hanna says and I Googled problems with a very high voice and how to change a high voice  First she looked into surgery to lower her pitch The likelihood of getting the change she wanted from something that extreme wasnt great she learned but theres more to sounding feminine than pitch alone Speech patterns and intonation it turns out play a huge part too Men often speak in more of monotone with a percussive staccato rhythm explains   a voice coach at the University of Michigan who works with actors singers and sometimes other professionals like Hanna Feminine speech patterns  more musical with more pitch variation  reflect the different way women connect with other people she says Women tend to be more collaborative communicators than men Masson says We say we more than we say I Even voice patterns that women are criticized for  like   going up in pitch at the end of every sentence like youre asking a question  demonstrate a collaborative style of conversation According to Masson uptalk asks the listener Are you still with me Are you paying attention here Its a way to check in and keep the listener engaged But the pattern can come across as a request for permission to speak  evidence of insecurity Hanna wanted and needed to command attention in the courtroom To learn how she decided to work with a speechlanguage pathologist   Block is one of very few voice therapists who specialize in working with transgender people  Some of Blocks clients are transitioning to life as men others are starting to live as women But all of them share a common goal  theyre trying to change deeply ingrained vocal patterns Block helps each client find a voice that matches his or her physical appearance and personality To work with Hanna Block borrowed some of the same techniques she uses to work with transgender men to help them have more presence and sound more assertive Hanna learned to open her throat creating more oral resonance to adopt what she now calls her big voice Block says she also taught Monica to use fewer words and be more direct Instead of asking Got a minute when she wants to talk to a colleague she now declares One minute She carefully enunciates Hello instead of chirping Hi like she used to After months of practice the difference between Hannas big voice and her small one is subtle But she says she is perceived differently now at work She likes feeling more confident she says And also having the voice to carry that message across and say No no this is something you actually   to hear  When Christie Block works with transgender women on the other hand the feminine speech patterns that Hanna worked so hard to undo are carefully taught one by one First the women learn to hit a target pitch  G third octave They hum at that pitch then count at that pitch and then try saying actual sentences with rising and falling intonation all hovering around that pitch Then they learn to stretch out their vowels to slow down  discarding the quicker more monotone staccato speech many men use The mechanics alone can take months to learn The whole process usually takes years Tina White a director of information management at Pfizer worked with Christie Block a few years ago It is a very intensive introspective process to go through says White On TV we like to talk about transwomen dressing up changing their bodies and everyones all titillated by all those sexual parts I think if you talk to transwomen voice is psychologically far more important to their sense of acceptance than everything else that everyone else obsesses with Thats because no matter how feminine you look physically if a malesounding voice comes out of your mouth people will probably raise their eyebrows  or worse Transgender women are more likely than other LGBT people to be victims of violent hate crime Theyre most vulnerable when they stand out so finding a voice that matches their physical presentation and helps them blend in can be   When being able to use a restroom not being laughed at at work not getting beat up on the train on the way home are dependent on your voice you are terrified says White Violence from the outside world isnt the only danger Transgender women experience   and   than the general population White sees this in her own community Ive known one woman in particular who has been hospitalized three times for trying to commit suicide and voice is not a small part of that White did voice work for about nine months before she finally felt confident enough to try out her new voice at the office But then came a new fear that she wouldnt be taken as seriously as a woman I think that I used to enjoy white male privilege she says And so I could be kind of sloppy Just standing in front of a room and talking back then was usually enough to feel listened to Now White explains I find that I have to think a little bit more and be a little bit more prepared and precise So there can be some tradeoffs to finding a voice that really expresses who you are  tradeoffs that both Tina White and Monica Hanna are willing to put up with Hanna says that initially some people close to her didnt approve of the changes she was making in her voice some called the changes antifeminist But for Hanna the goal was not to work against her identity as a woman but to find a way to make her voice less distracting I want to be taken more seriously she says from the first words out of my mouth to the last Im never going to be a baritone powerhouse Theres something to be said about doing something to improve yourself in a way that adds to your craft and adds to your credibility White meanwhile can now give voice to the internal  and very feminine  monologue that she spent her life censoring certain she would be ridiculed Im finally happy White says because this voice lets me express the feelings that I have inside that I was always keeping bottled up Thats the goal of all this hard work for women like White and Hanna to find their voices so the world can stop focusing on how they sound and pay attention to what theyre saying
