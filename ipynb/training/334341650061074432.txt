Amy Chua launched the phrase Tiger Mother into our cultural lexicon in  to describe a harsh demanding style of parenting Chua identified as being especially common among parents of Chinese ancestry The term clearly stuck A few recent works focusing on the Tiger parenting idea caught our attention and were the focus of a segment on Tuesdays Tell Me More You can hear the full segment above The first is a study in the March  Asian American Journal of Psychology called   Jeff Yang gave   in his Tao Jones column this week In an interview on Tuesday with Tell Me More host Michel Martin Kim went into more detail about her interest in the phenomenon The study also suggests that Tiger parenting isnt the most common approach among ChineseAmerican parents A new book by Kim Wong Keltner called   offers a look at the phenomenon from the perspective of the children   Michel Martin discussed the book and the study with Keltner cookbook author Anupy Singla and columnist Jeff Yang When youre raised in an Asian household and youre expected to get straight As youre expected to do everything perfectly and theres no room for mistakes said Keltner I think the parents might feel that they are spurring you on but what happens is you just feel spurned And you learn to detach from them and thats probably not what they wanted in the first place My father was the disciplinarian said Singla herself a mother of two He was the one who pushed me to get straight As If I ever got a B it was just this level of shame in our home But at the same time I also believe they were a product of where they came from in India I came to this country when I was  They didnt have the luxury of communicating with me at that time because they were fighting to get food on the table  Raising my children here I have the luxury of being able to communicate more Im kind of this labgrown hybrid of tiger and panda said Yang I look back and the common thread is that parents do want ultimately whats best what they think is whats best for their kids Its just that from the perspective of many immigrants they feel strongly it should be first and foremost academic achievement and secondarily the soft and fuzzy stuff My parents did set those high expectations but they were also very conscientious about telling us that they loved us The one thing they used more than anything else perhaps was guilt and shame Of course the study reminds us parenting styles arent necessarily fixed theyre likely to change over time Parents may use different strategies in different scenarios and with different kids as any younger sibling might attest Beyond the main debate about the effectiveness of tiger parenting another finding in the study drew our interest If youve read the study or picked up Kim Wong Keltners book share your thoughts with us in the comments
