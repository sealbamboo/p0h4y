When it comes to weight control exercise doesnt matter Nonexercise is what counts That may sound like heresy but in fact its a theory based on years of highly respected research  and the science behind a little hightech gizmo called the Gruve Solution The Gruve is one of a gaggle of gadgets called personal activity monitors that you can carry in your pocket hang on a keychain wear like a watch In this case you get your Gruve on  as its maker Gruve Technologies likes to say  by attaching it to your waistband The primary function of these monitors is to count the calories you burn and to challenge you praise you play games with you keep stats on you do everything their makers can think of to get you to burn more energy Most of them encourage you to exercise Not the Gruve The Gruve is a NEAT monitor And no thats not a value judgment It just means the device is especially designed to keep tabs on your nonexercise activity thermogenesis scientistspeak for the calories you burn when youre doing just about anything you dont think of as exercise  shopping gardening picking up after the dog Other devices arent sensitive enough to register such smallpotatoes stuff very accurately says Dr Robert Gauthier chief executive of Gruve Technologies Or theyre too sensitive Gauthier says he once tried out another monitor and it showed I walked  steps while sitting in a plane between Minneapolis and Denver The Gruve encourages you to burn more calories in its own way It issues a semistern warning whenever youve been vegging out too long It doesnt give you an electric shock Levine says just a little buzz The buzz is a headsup that you need to start not exercising a little more vigorously Writing email on the computer burns some calories mowing the lawn burns more Levines personal approach is an office treadmill at his workstation on which he strolls all day long at  mph instead of lolling around on a chair Theres more to the Gruve than just the weensy wearable widget It comes with a USB cable to connect it to your computer Apple or PC where you can store your daily caloriesburned data track your sevenday average and maybe get inspired to best your best day ever When you first start using the Gruve you establish a baseline activity level After that you can set goals for outdoing yourself And you can psych yourself up all day long just by pressing the halo bar on your Gruve which changes colors from red to orange to yellow to blue to green as you draw closer and closer to success The Gruve has been tested in a number of office settings and all had good results Gauthier says  employees lost weight and increased their activity and their moods perked up A similar caveat comes from Levine himself The Gruve is exceedingly accurate but its only as good as the user If you leave it on your dresser it wont do you any good The Gruve  including a oneyear subscription to Gruve Online  goes for  at   Other packages with shorter or longer subscriptions are also available
