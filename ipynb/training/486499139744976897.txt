Top of the morning to you. Another steamy day is unfolding here at the Pharmalot campus, where the shortest of short people will soon be ushered out the door to enjoy summertime fun.  As for the rest of us, well, we can only dream. But our to-do list will keep us busy, including meetings with some interesting folks. Hopefully, you can relate. Either way, it is time to get cracking. As always, here are a few tidbits to get you going. Have a grand day and keep us in mind if you hear anything interesting…. Speaking of interesting, AbbVie has increased its offer for Shire; the FDA granted priority review to Purdue Pharma for its tamper-resistant painkiller; scientists have identified a set of 10 proteins in the blood that can predict the onset of Alzheimer’s, and Novartis has introduced new guidelines for clinical trials of its products by outside researchers, almost a year after the company said employees in Japan interfered in studies and hid side effects.
