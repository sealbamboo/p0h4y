Expanded coverage for young adults under the Affordable Care Act substantially raised inpatient hospital visits related to mental health finds   conducted by researchers at Indiana and Purdue universities That looks like good news Better access to care for a population with   that too often endangers them and people nearby But it might not be the best result said Kosali Simon an economist at Indiana University and one of the authors Greater hospital use by the newly insured might be caused by inadequate outpatient resources to treat mental health patients earlier and less expensively she said The health law let people under age  stay on their parents group insurance plans starting in late    shows the provision raised coverage for young adults The latest findings are described in a paper by Yaa Akosa Antwi Asako S Moriya and Simon published on the National Bureau of Economic Research website The researchers who based their work on a big national sample from community hospitals found the law also increased young peoples hospital use Total inpatient visits for those aged  to  increased  percent compared with people aged  to  who couldnt be on their parents plans Mental health admissions increased much more  by  percent Thats a little puzzling When Massachusetts broadened medical coverage with its  statebased health reform law there were   in mental health hospitalizations for young adults there But psychiatrists psychologists and other mental health providers are more available in Massachusetts than elsewhere Simon said Perhaps community caregivers largely met the needs of newly insured Bay Staters saving them from crisis visits to the emergency room In the national study a large portion of psychiatric admissions came through emergency departments Neither the Massachusetts study nor the national study looked at the volume of outpatient mental health care But even if they had they wouldnt have produced a final answer on the effectiveness of expanded coverage That will take more research Increasing insurance and treatments arent necessarily the same as helping patients We eventually judge all these insurance expansions based on the final outcomes that we care about said Simon How did this affect the wellbeing of young adults Is there a measurable improvement of health status Does it appear that there is better mental health as a result of this increase
