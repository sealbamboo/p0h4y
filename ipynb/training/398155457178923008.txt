Treating low testosterone may be all the rage these days among men of a certain age. But men bothered by a midlife dip in energy and sex drive may want to think twice about bumping up their "low T" with a testosterone supplement, a new study says.. "Our findings raise some uncertainty regarding the potential safety of testosterone use in men," concluded the authors, a group of physicians and epidemiologists in Colorado and Texas. While patients taking testosterone should not abandon the medication willy-nilly, they added, "it is important to inform patients that long-term risks are unknown and there is a possibility that testosterone therapy might be harmful.". Some 2.9% of all U.S. men over 40 are currently taking prescription testosterone to treat such common symptoms as flagging energy and libido and weight gain. Driven by a surge in direct-to-consumer advertising, yearly prescriptions for these "low T" medications increased fivefold between 2000 and 2011. Today, it's a market worth $1.6 billion annually.. In the latest JAMA study, the 14% of men who initiated testosterone therapy after undergoing angiography were generally younger and slightly healthier than the 86% who did not take testosterone. But when all the men were followed for an average of three years, those who took testosterone were almost 30% more likely than those who did not to have an ischemic stroke, a heart attack or to have died of any cause.. In the three-year period they were followed, 25.7% of the men taking testosterone supplementation had suffered a stroke, a heart attack or death. Among the men who did not take testosterone, 19.9% suffered one of those outcomes. Notably, among men who took testosterone, those who had come into the study with clear, unobstructed coronary arteries were just as likely to suffer one of those outcomes as were those with established coronary artery disease.
