The Food and Drug Administration frequently recalls dietary supplements that are found to contain banned substances But a new study suggests that many of these products return to store shelves months later with the same dangerous ingredients The findings suggest that health authorities may be fighting an uphill battle against a small number of supplement companies that repeatedly sell contaminated products The   published in JAMA  the Journal of the American Medical Association found that out of more than two dozen supplements that were pulled from shelves after they were found to contain anabolic steroids or powerful prescription drugs roughly twothirds were back on the market a year later with the same illicit ingredients Most of the supplements were marketed for weight loss exercise and sexual enhancement and they were sold across the country at convenience stores in health food shops and over the Internet They were found to contain steroids and prescription drugs like Viagra and Prozac an antidepressant The study also found that several of the weightloss products contained Sibutramine an amphetaminelike drug that was removed from the market in the United States Asia and Europe after a clinical trial showed it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes Since  about half of all FDA drug recalls have involved dietary supplements found to be contaminated with banned pharmaceutical ingredients Supplement industry trade groups say that these products are usually manufactured and sold by a few bad actors who represent the fringe of the roughly  billion a year supplement industry  Under a federal law enacted two decades ago  the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act or Dshea  dietary supplements can be sold and marketed with little regulatory oversight Companies do not need FDA approval to sell supplements to consumers and they do not have to provide proof that their products contain the ingredients listed on their labels Unlike prescription drugs dietary supplements are considered safe until proven otherwise and generally they are pulled from shelves only after complaints of serious injury In recent years   that herbal supplements such as echinacea Ginkgo biloba and St Johns wort are frequently mislabeled or diluted with cheap fillers like powdered rice Last year a   found that the number of liverrelated injuries linked to bodybuilding and weightloss supplements was on the rise Jennifer Dooren a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said that supplement companies are legally responsible for marketing a safe product that is not adulterated But because companies do not need approval to sell their products she said the agency cannot identify tainted supplements before they reach consumers And even supplements that are identified as contaminated can be difficult to pursue The supply chain for these products is extremely fragmented she said One product manufactured by an unknown company overseas may be sold by dozens of different distributors in the United States The individuals and businesses selling these products generally are difficult to locate operate out of residential homes and distribute via the Internet small stores and mail Between January  and the end of  the FDA recalled at least  dietary supplements Many of these products returned to the market a short time later In the new study Dr Pieter A Cohen an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and his colleagues purchased  of these products on average about one year after they had been recalled Although many of the previously recalled products returned to the market with slight changes to their labels or brand names Dr Cohen and his colleagues limited their study only to those products that returned to shelves or websites with identical packaging We excluded anything that wasnt exactly the same as it was when the FDA recalled it he said But a sizable percentage of these products that are recalled about  or  percent are still available The study found that twothirds of the  supplements analyzed contained at least one unlisted anabolic steroid prescription drug or banned substance A majority contained the same drug or illicit ingredient that led to them being recalled by the agency And in some cases the products contained not only the previously identified substance but additional drugs as well Twenty of the supplements that were analyzed were manufactured in the United States Out of this group  contained banned ingredients suggesting that the problem is not limited to unscrupulous companies overseas Dr Cohen said This is the problem with supplements They can be introduced without any vetting at all by the FDA he said These products are recalled and then the companies keep selling the pills without making one iota of change to the product Were talking about very blatant flouting of the FDAs requests The authors of the study called for changes to the federal law to better protect consumers from such products More aggressive enforcement of the law changes to the law to increase the FDAs enforcement powers or both will be required if sales of these products are to be prevented in the future they wrote in the medical journal In a statement Steve Mister the president and chief executive of the Council for Responsible Nutrition an industry trade group said that responsible manufacturers and marketers of dietary supplements applaud the agencys recalls We have zero tolerance for this problem and welcome not only recalls he said but also criminal enforcement against companies that put consumers at risk But he said that the new research grossly misrepresents the extent of the problem and understates the success of the FDA recalls when the law is properly enforced  We urge the FDA to continue using its recall authority to eradicate adulterated products and like the responsible industry put consumer safety first he said Dr Cohen who   identifying dangerous or illicit ingredients in dietary supplements said that consumers should be particularly wary of products containing a mixture of herbs or ingredients  what he called herbal cocktails Many of these products may be unadulterated he said but consumers usually cannot be sure and often these are the sort of products that are most likely to be spiked with dangerous ingredients If you want to buy herbal supplements buy individual ingredients he said Buy echinacea or black cohosh separately But dont buy a mixture and dont buy a supplement thats sold to cause weight loss or improve your workouts These are exactly the types of supplements that these drugs have appeared in
