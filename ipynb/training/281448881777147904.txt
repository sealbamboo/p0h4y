About  percent of adults take aspirin regularly either to ease pain or to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke But taking aspirin might increase the risk of   a leading cause of blindness in old age according to a study of nearly  people in Wisconsin Nobody wants to go blind So does this mean its time to give up on aspirin Not at all say ophthalmologists It doesnt prove that taking aspirin causes macular degeneration says   clinical correspondent for the American Academy of Ophthalmology We have no idea if theyre related and we have no idea if theres a cause and effect says Bhavsar whos also director of clinical research for the Retina Center of Minnesota Hes talking about   in the latest   the     that found an increased risk of the more serious wet form of agerelated macular degeneration or AMD in older people who took lowdose aspirin regularly  years before they were diagnosed with the eye disease That comes from the   which checked on the vision of people age  and up from  to  That kind of longterm study can be valuable for figuring out associations between habits and disease In this case about  percent of people whod regularly used aspirin  years before a retina exam had signs of latestage AMD compared with  percent of those who hadnt taken aspirin But a study like this one cant tell if a particular habit like taking aspirin causes a disease To find that out it would take a randomized clinical trial which gives people a specific treatment and measures its effects There have been hundreds of   showing that taking lowdose aspirin reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke in people who have heart disease Thats why Bhavsar and his fellow ophthalmologists arent about to tell patients to stop with the aspirin To change recommendations based on a populationbased study would be very difficult to do he tells Shots Its hard for the public to realize the difference in the differences in clinical trials But its really important to hone in on that Wet macular degeneration is generally more severe than another version known as dry macular degeneration But the wet variety is also less common affecting about  percent of people over age  Both affect the macula an area in the eyes retina thats used to see fine detail Aspirin reduces inflammation and increases the risk of bleeding but its unclear how those effects could be related to eye damage In the study the people taking aspirin  years earlier were twice as likely to get macular degeneration but because wet macular degeneration is relatively uncommon the overall risk is pretty low Still eye doctors keep looking into the possible links Another big observational   the European Eye Study reported earlier this year that people aged  and older who took aspirin daily also were more likely to have wet macular degeneration Bhavsar does have advice for people worried about macular degeneration Stop smoking and avoid exposure to smoke Tobacco smoke is known to speed progression of agerelated macular degeneration If theres any single one behavior we could change and impact hundreds of thousands of people worldwide it would be smoking
