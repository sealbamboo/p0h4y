Controversial experiments on bird flu could resume within weeks because leading influenza researchers around the world have finally called a halt to an unusual moratorium that has lasted more than a year The voluntary pause in the research started back in January  Scientists had genetically altered the bird flu virus HN changing it in ways that allowed it to spread through the coughs and sneezes of ferrets  the lab standin for people But the   caused a public outcry Critics charged that if the manmade viruses ever got out of the lab they could be contagious in humans and start a deadly pandemic Virologist   of Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands whose lab did some of these experiments says weighing the risks and benefits of this research isnt easy But its clear that all of the  people who announced the moratorium in January  have now signed to restart the work he says That means that  of the worlds leading experts in influenza research seem to think that the benefits outweigh the risks A   announcing the end to the moratorium is being published jointly in the journals   and   The experiments were part of an effort to understand how the HN bird flu virus might mutate and start spreading in humans HN circulates in poultry in parts of Asia and the Middle East It rarely makes people sick but over half of those known to have gotten sick from the virus have died Understanding the mutations that might make the virus contagious in people is essential for efforts to prepare for a potential pandemic that could emerge naturally in the future the researchers say in their letter ending the moratorium They add that researchers who have approval from their governments and institutions to conduct this research safely under appropriate biosafety and biosecurity conditions have a publichealth responsibility to resume this important work The risk exists in nature already and not doing the research is really putting us in danger says   of the University of WisconsinMadison who also did some of the original experiments The US government is still finalizing its guidelines for what kinds of HN transmission experiments could be done with federal money in the future and under what lab conditions so scientists like Kawaoka who get this kind of government funding cant yet restart their studies Fouchier also receives US funding for his lab in the Netherlands but he says he has money from other sources that he can use to resume his experiments there and will do so probably in the next few weeks Its going to take some time to restart but it certainly will not take months for us to restart says Fouchier Not every one welcomed the news I dont think they should resume I think the moratorium should go on Because I think a number of questions remain unanswered says   director of the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Should we start to feel anxious if we hear that  new labs are doing this work in the world two years from now Or  labs doing this work five years from now asks Inglesby He worries about the risk that a genetically modified flu virus might escape the lab and infect millions Would that be a problem for the flu virus community I dont think weve established those guidelines yet he says Inglesby also questioned whether these experiments are really necessary for activities like making new vaccines and keeping watch for an emerging pandemic There could be a time in the future where there is a highly compelling rationale to proceed which justifies the risks I just personally have not seen that yet he says Fouchier says however that given all the public discussion and debate over the last year the aims of the voluntary moratorium have been met Although the US government is still considering what to do about this issue researchers around the world did not want to wait he says in part because officials have been unclear about how much longer their decisionmaking process will take It might take another one two three years says Fouchier So how long do you want us to wait
