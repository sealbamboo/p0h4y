inding out you have cancer is never good news but in the hierarchy of malignant disease lung cancer is one of the hardest to diagnose one of the trickiest to treat and one that tends to have a poor prognosis At the same time though the outlook for patients with lung cancer is improving with the advent of new drugs Whats more interventions in some areas of the country have shown that a few relatively easy and cheap measures can improve the rates of earlier diagnosis As with all cancers early diagnosis is key to successful treatment These sentiments were expressed at a recent Guardian roundtable sponsored by the pharmaceutical company BristolMyers Squibb that looked into how outcomes for lungcancer victims could be improved The challenge now doctors and stakeholders attending the discussion agreed was to encourage people with any suspicious symptoms to visit their GP and to ensure that GPs referred them for more tests This is a curable cancer if its caught early enough stressed Riyaz Shah consultant medical oncologist at Kent Oncology Centre  Among the barriers to early diagnosis the roundtable heard was the fact that the symptoms of lung cancer were often vague and unspecific Tom NewsomDavis consultant medical oncologist at Chelsea and Westminster hospital said even where patients had thoracic symptoms they sometimes didnt think they were dangerous Other patients said they had been unable to get to see their usual GP or that they couldnt get an appointment The unfortunate fact at the present time said consultant chest physician Dr Mat Callister of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust was that   But there were indications that things didnt have to be this way  In some other European countries Sweden especially survival rates were considerably better than in the UK the oneyear survival rate in Sweden is  compared with just  in the UK A major difference in Sweden said Dr Mick Peake clinical lead at Public   England was that people were able to bypass primary caregivers and selfrefer to chest consultants Worries that GPs are missing chances to diagnose lung cancer were voiced around the table  and this was ahead of   later in the British Medical Journal which found patients who died had visited their GP an average of five times in the months before diagnosis Callister said his early intervention strategy in Leeds focused on consultants like him going out into the community to encourage GPs to refer patients The strategy had worked across a threeyear period there had been a twothirds increase in the number of GPordered chest Xrays  Detailed results of the initiative have not yet been published but he said they were likely to show an increase in survival rates and a drop in the proportion of patients whose lung cancer is not diagnosed until they present at an emergency clinic such as AE currently that figure nationally is at a shocking four in  of all cases As well as encouraging GPs to refer more patients for chest Xrays patients in Leeds were given the right to refer themselves for one That had a big effect on GPs behaviour its basically saying to them we dont mind how many people you refer for chest Xrays and to prove it well even allow patients to refer themselves What GPs needed was permission to refer a lot more patients for Xrays and thats what we saw happening said Callister One major problem with lung cancer is that symptoms tend to be very nonspecific Making this clear to GPs had been another important part of the initiatives strategy Callister said The fact is that chest Xrays are cheap and the radiation is a very low dose The message we wanted to get across is if theres even a lowlevel suspicion send them for a chest Xray The obvious next question for the roundtable was would it be a good idea to introduce screening for lung cancer In general participants thought the idea had merit although there were worries about the practicalities The evidence that screening is effective is overwhelming said Peake  Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said patients were constantly asking why no screening programme was yet in operation especially those who know they are at high risk  Sara Hiom director of early diagnosis at   Research UK said a screening programme would have benefits beyond the actual identifying of patients as with the breast screening programme it would focus attention on the disease and bring it out into the open It could bring more recognition and understanding she said But screening should only be done on the back of a clear evidence base said NewsomDavis For a variety of statistical and other reasons demonstrating clearly that a screening programme saves lives is very difficult he said One example was that people in higher socioeconomic groups tended to take up screening opportunities but lung cancer is more prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups  Shah explained that screening was likely to identify a large number of people who had nodules on their lungs that were benign There was also a problem about how to treat early cancers detected through screening surgery is the preferred method for treating early cancers but said Shah the lungs were a lot less accessible to surgeons than say the breast  And also many patients found to have lung cancer might not be good candidates  because of their age or overall health profile  to withstand surgery But the health service had learned a great deal from the existing screening programmes said Hiom The more we can screen people at highest risk the better we can target those who will most benefit she said One of the saddest aspects of lung cancer the roundtable heard was that many patients who were diagnosed with it felt not only hopeless but guilty about having brought it on themselves by smoking Woods said  This perception  that lung cancer patients have only got themselves to blame  was widespread and unfair the roundtable was told Many other cancers have lifestyle elements but only lung cancer tends to be seen as selfinflicted  Lorraine Dallas of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation said some cancers brought moral support and others didnt One patient I heard about told her friends she had breast cancer rather than lung cancer because breast cancer was so much more acceptable and less judged she said Sally Moore of the Royal Marsden   foundation trust said she had researched the way lung cancer was portrayed in the media and associations with death around it were very strong The messages needed to be disentangled she said Rosie Loftus of Macmillan Cancer Support said the nihilism associated with lung cancer was more of a feature among patients and the public than professionals Philippa Jones of the UK Oncology Nursing Society said people needed to be encouraged to find the positives including improving outcomes and better diagnosis What we need is a Kylie moment said NewsomDavis referring to how breast cancer became a mainstream issue after the singer was diagnosed with the disease Shah said there were many good news stories and they needed to be highlighted There are some amazing drugs out there and more treatments coming through I can show you scans that are jawdropping we really are making a difference to many patients he said senior health correspondent the Guardian adviser UK Oncology Nursing
