Mute Schimpf doesnt want to eat American chicken Thats because most US poultry is chilled in antimicrobial baths that can include chlorine to keep salmonella and other bacteria in check In Europe chlorine treatment was banned in the s out of fear that it could cause cancer In Europe there is definitely a disgust about chlorinated chicken says Schimpf a food activist with Friends of the Earth Europe an environmental group The chlorine vs no chlorine debate has come up a lot recently in the context of a massive transAtlantic trade agreement This week negotiators from Europe and the US are meeting in Washington for a seventh round of talks aimed at creating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP The agreement would create the worlds biggest freetrade zone and touch everything from banking to agriculture But theres a lot of opposition to TTIP in Europe where some fear it would degrade their food standards And activists have found the perfect symbol for their fight in chlorinated American chicken On the German equivalent of   called the   American poultry has become a running joke In one   a reporter is in the White House kitchen eating a chicken nugget You cant be mad at someone who makes such a tasty chlorinated chicken he quips Mmm it has a slight aroma of kiddie pool But the chlorine isnt really a public health concern says   a professor of poultry processing at the University of Georgia Most of these concerns about chemical use and those kinds of things are blown up in the media to become a problem that really doesnt exist he says American processors use about a cap full of chlorine per gallon or  parts per million in a water tank that chills the chicken carcasses That chlorine he explains is used to disinfect the poultry He says it gets washed off and poses no health threat to consumers But the EU takes a different approach  it operates on the precautionary principle a kind of abundance of caution when it comes to any substance that enters your body In Europe their efforts to control foodborne illness is all in the live bird For example the grandparent stock the breeder stock that makes the egg of the chicken we eat eventually  all of those flocks of chicken are tested regularly for salmonella Russell says If any of these chickens test positive farmers have to get rid of the entire flock With this method Europeans have reduced salmonella in their chicken to just  percent Russell says but the process took  years Europeans have pushed for some of the toughest foodsafety standards in the world They want to eat fresh chicken thats airchilled rather than dumped in chlorinated water tanks says   who manages the European Association of Poultry Processors and Poultry Trade The main principle of the European food policy is a farmtofork approach and you may say that is fundamentally different from whats happening outside Europe in many places Vermeeren says That strict food policy makes poultry production more expensive A  by Wageningen University in the Netherlands found it takes about a dollar in Europe to produce a pound of chicken compared with less than  cents in America Over  countries accept the US processing method says   the president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council Its cheaper he says and Europe doesnt want US competition If the truth were to be known thats the real reason they dont want us there and chlorine is a convenient excuse he says For activists like Mute Schimpf who are trying to sway the public to reject a big treaty thats full of legal jargon and complicated regulations the chicken argument works Very often the chlorinated chicken is used as a symbol of what European citizens and consumers dont want to have as an outcome from the trade talks she says Besides changes in chicken production activists are also fighting the possibility of hormonetreated beef and genetically engineered crops entering the European market if TTIP succeeds Though the talks between the US and the EU are held in secret any agreement needs approval from the European parliament which is elected by a public that worries a lot about its food supply
