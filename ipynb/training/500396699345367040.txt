When public health officials warn that its likely to take many months to bring the Ebola outbreak in West Africa under control its not because theyre facing a single huge challenge If there was just one solid large chunk we could slice out we would says WHO spokeswoman Nyka Alexander at the agencys regional coordination center in Conakry Guinea But its so many little things that add up to the outbreak In its attempt to bring the Ebola outbreak under control The World Health Organization has announced a   Money is already flowing in but it turns out that its much more challenging to respond to the slow burn of an epidemic than to a natural disaster  where sending in rescue teams or delivering water are obvious first steps Nonetheless there are some obvious needs in West Africa  for example providing a constant supply of protective clothing for the doctors and nurses who risk their lives in makeshift hospitals WHO is also flying in medical supplies and helping coordinate the logistics of getting food to areas that have been placed into forced isolation Neighboring countries are being targeted as well WHO is helping  nations gear up for a possible spread of the epidemic with offers of training as well as  sets of protective gear for each country Alexander says More than half the money that WHO hopes to collect from the international community is supposed to flow to the governments of Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea to bolster their teetering health care systems Additional funds will go to international organizations that provide expertise and supplies Another daunting task it to get the right people  and enough of them  to cope with the outbreak And its not just doctors and nurses A lot of this response is going to have to be local says Dr Trish Perl chief epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine You may not be able to walk in and just say OK who in this village has Ebola That may not be something thats culturally acceptable Advisers can train local people how to do that critical job  in fact some of those trainers are from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Experts from the US Europe and other nations in Africa can set up the critical systems needed to track the epidemic  identifying where the active cases are Many cases of the disease arent being tracked at all A lot of these cases are probably getting logged with paper and pencil if theyre getting logged at all Perl says We dont really know the magnitude of the epidemic because they dont have a welldefined surveillance system in place A surveillance system may seem like bean counting while a disease is raging but Perl says its actually essential for tracking the disease identifying flareups and ultimately bringing it under control by isolating infected people ideally that system should stay in place after the current outbreak is snuffed out  because Ebola and other diseases arent going away Whatever WHO does in a country needs to leave something very substantial behind so its not just a matter of doing the same thing time and time again says  until recently the US representative on the WHO Executive Board Even in an emergency its important to repair badly broken health care systems like those in West Africa Of course thats more easily said than done About a decade ago some West African nations received international assistance to prepare for a possible outbreak of avian flu When avian influenza ended when the threat went away these systems atrophied says Dr Fred Hartman whos with a nonprofit called   Resourcescarce countries have many demands on their resources Malaria can flare up or cholera or something else So it takes a sustained response not just onetime aid projects to strengthen these health care systems  which had been crippled by civil wars and are only gradually being rebuilt
