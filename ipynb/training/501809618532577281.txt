As a young doctor working at a teaching hospital Sandeep Jauhar was having trouble making ends meet So like other academic physicians he took a job moonlighting at a private practice the offices of a cardiologist He noticed that the offices were quick to order expensive tests for their patients  even when they seemed unnecessary It was made very clear from the beginning that seeing patients alone was not financially rewarding for the business he says Spending  minutes with a patient might be reimbursed   but sending the patient for a nuclear stress test was much more profitable Jauhar tells  s Terry Gross A nuclear stress test at the time when I started working was reimbursed roughly  to  Jauhar was supervising the tests that had been ordered by a physician  and some physician assistants So even though I wasnt ordering the tests I was in the office while these tests were being performed  and I felt really dirty about it Jauhar says Jauhars new memoir   is about how doctors are growing increasingly discontent with their profession And theyre facing more pressures As the number of patients theyre expected to see increases so does the amount of paperwork While some doctors who perform a lot of procedures may be paid too much he writes many doctors such as primary care physicians arent paid enough And he adds the growing discontent has serious consequences for patients Jauhar creator and director of the Heart Failure Program at Long Island Jewish Medical Center talks about not only unnecessary testing but also uncoordinated care by multiple specialists American medicine is the best in the world when it comes to providing hightech care he says If you have an esoteric disease you want to be in the United States God forbid you have Ebola our academic medical centers are second to none But if you have runofthemill chronic diseases like congestive heart failure or diabetes the system is not designed to find you the best possible care And thats what has to change One of the issues with medicine today is that its just become so complicated More and more people are surviving with chronic illnesses so you have folks in every patient panel who have multiple chronic diseases And they come to the doctor and they have a whole host of issues that have to be dealt with And that doesnt even mention preventative care which has become a huge time problem for a lot of primary care physicians Theres no denying that reimbursements for office visits and for procedures have been drastically cut in the last two or three decades And that was really an attempt to control health costs And it seemed to make sense but it resulted in doctors basically running on a treadmill seeing patients every eight to  minutes So the lack of time to spend with any one patient is a big factor Theres no question that theres a lot of unnecessary testing in American medicine today and the reasons for it are manyfold Part of it is  a lack of time You have a patient come into your office and you have eight minutes with them and they have lower back pain and you dont want to miss something because one of the major causes of dissatisfaction among doctors today is malpractice liability theres that fear A lot of doctors are practicing defensive medicine There have been various estimates that defensive medicine costs up to  billion a year out of the roughly  trillion we spend on health care so its a huge huge waste  It takes time to evaluate the patient get a good history examine the patient and its just so much easier to order a test especially when the financial incentives of the system are to reward for more and more testing Today if you go to a hospital its rare that you wont have multiple specialists on your case And Im a specialist in cardiology and when Im called to see someone with a nonspecific symptom like shortness of breath which could be a whole host of diagnoses Im apt to view the problem through my own expertise And thats true of rheumatologists and hematologists and so on One patient who came in with shortness of breath  his primary care physician called  specialists onto the case  He underwent  procedures in the hospital and when he was sent home he had followup visits with seven different specialists  We actually never figured it out This is so common  When you have a symptom like shortness of breath that has multiple inputs from different organ systems probably the best doctor to diagnose that and treat that is a good general family physician But when you call in these various specialists they are apt to view the problem through their own organ expertise And they make recommendations based on their own expertise and these recommendations are frequently not coordinated and so you get a whole host of recommendations and suggestions for care But no one is really talking and trying to coordinate this care so it makes it very difficult for the physician who is trying to manage the whole patient and treat the whole patient and getting these multiple inputs to know what to do Ive seen patients have their last days prolonged in misery because of the actions of their wellmeaning family members who dont want to let go and sometimes even by physicians and  unfortunately at least in one case  by me I had a very dear patient of mine who had severe congestive heart failure and had a very leaky heart valve and she became one of my favorite patients  She was in her late s and one day I was told she was in the intensive care unit and it turns out she had gone to the emergency room with shortness of breath  She had gone into kidney failure because of the poor blood flow to her kidneys And I took the attending physician aside and said So are we going to provide dialysis And he said No And I said Why not And he said Because I dont think its appropriate its futile Shes at the end of her life I couldnt see that because she had been so vibrant despite all the medical problems In the end I argued for being aggressive and he wouldnt budge and so I actually went to the chairman of the department and I transferred the patient to my care in the cardiac unit  And there I went through a lot of  very aggressive interventions to try to save her It wasnt because of financial incentives  Im on salary  it was because I just didnt want to lose her  About eight or nine days later she died Theres no question that I deceived myself  that I thought somehow I could keep death at bay and that my judgment was clouded by my love for this patient and not wanting to let her go  Now Im much more circumspect about how I handle these cases And in recent years Ive created much more of a relationship with the palliative care team and the hospice team in my hospital And I think its been much better for my terminally ill patients
