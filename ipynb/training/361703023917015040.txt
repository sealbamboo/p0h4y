Summer is both a blessing and curse for millions of people afflicted with a common chronic skin condition called   The dry red and usually intolerably itchy patches often recede when the air is warm and damp and skin is exposed more often to sunlight Yet for many of the  million Americans with eczema shedding the clothes may be embarrassing and in the case of children may result in teasing and exclusion Even for those who are comfortable in a bathing suit swimming in a pool can be problematic if sensitivity to chlorine worsens the condition In industrialized countries eczema has become two or three times more common in recent decades Only part of this rise can be attributed to better diagnosis Now between  and  percent of children and  percent to  percent of adults have eczema which nearly always begins in the first five years of life Fortunately in more than twothirds of children with eczema the condition resolves on its own before   The medical name for eczema is   which reflects the immunological nature of the condition It is more common among children living in cities than those in rural areas According to the socalled hygiene hypothesis exposure to infectious agents early in life offers protection against allergic diseases The more hygienic a childs environment the greater the risk Eczema is not contagious but more than one member of a family may be afflicted The condition seems to have a genetic component In identical    percent will both have eczema but it occurs in both fraternal twins only  percent of the time My sons who are identical twins had eczema as young children and one still has it in his s Another indication is the fact that people with   a   are three times more likely to have eczema relatives of celiac patients are twice as likely to have eczema Eczema is often called the itch you cant scratch though a wiser description would be the itch you shouldnt scratch Scratching can make the lesions worse and expose the skin to infection Scratching the spot when its itchy brings relief only as long as you scratch it said my son Lorin After scratching the itch generally stays the same or worsens Its better not to scratch though sometimes the itch is so intense that scratching feels compulsory Although there is no known cure for eczema flareups can nearly always be minimized and sometimes prevented and recent research has identified factors involved in its development that may lead to new treatments to control it more effectively Normal skin provides a remarkably effective physical and chemical barrier to substances in the environment It also prevents substances that should remain in the body from escaping As Dr Thomas Bieber a dermatologist at the University of Bonn in Germany explained in The New England Journal of Medicine the hallmark of eczema is   and environmental allergens like those from pollen dust mites and food to enter The result is dry itchy inflamed patches that are sometimes misdiagnosed as   Eczematous skin also lacks normal amounts of a natural antimicrobial agent called cathelicidin leaving it susceptible to infections that can be hard to control More than  percent of people with eczema have colonies of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus growing on their skin and contributing to the skins allergic sensitivity and inflammation Dr Bieber reported Scratching the lesions enhances the ability of these bacteria to further disrupt the skins barrier function While it has long been known that the skins outermost layer functions poorly in people with eczema researchers at the University of Rochester have identified another reason eczematous skin is susceptible to invasion by allergens Dr Anna De Benedetto and coauthors showed that a protective protein called   but not in those with normal skin or other skin conditions When claudin is reduced the tight junctions between skin cells become leaky and permeable to environmental allergens and infectious agents If future studies confirm these findings developing treatments that strengthen this barrier should improve control of eczema Current treatment focuses on reducing inflammation loss of moisture and colonization by bacteria Doctors typically recommend a prescription   used topically in tiny amounts coupled with an overthecounter moisturizer applied generously right after showering to hold water in the skin Only mild nondrying bath soaps should be used Overly expensive and exotic skin products are not necessary according to Dr Lisa A Beck a dermatologist at the University of Rochester But finding the most helpful products may require trial and error For example my son tried several steroids before finding that mometasone furoate the generic version of Elocon is most effective for him He has also used coal tarbased shampoo like Neutrogena TGel for occasional eczema on his scalp In selecting a moisturizer often called an emollient choose a product that contains no scent which itself can be a skin irritant An acquaintance who suffered for years with widespread eczema finally found relief last year when her doctor suggested she try taking a nonsedating   like loratadine   fexofenadine Allegra or cetirizine Zyrtec Sweat can trigger an outbreak so it is best to shower as soon as possible after a sweatinducing activity Stress can provoke flareups in some people with eczema so measures to reduce stress may be helpful Food   show up as eczema in some patients Eliminating one potential culprit at a time like dairy products eggs or nuts may reveal an eczemainducer Some people develop a form of eczema that results from skin contact with an irritant not unlike a reaction to   Contact eczema is often an occupational disease stemming from exposure to detergents for example or various cleaning agents or wet cement The condition may show up only after the skin is exposed to sunlight People with eczema on their hands are usually advised to wear cottonlined waterproof gloves when washing dishes or working with irritating substances
