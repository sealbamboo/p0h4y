Acid reflux is such a common problem youd think it would be simple to spot and treat 
                   
                  But sometimes acid reflux symptoms are less than obvious or easy to mistake for something else 
                   
                  If left untreated heartburn can lead to Barretts esophagus which is a precursor to cancer says Timothy Pfanner MD assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas AM Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station 
                   
                  Here are some symptomsboth common and unusualthat could mean you have acid reflux Chest pain which occurs because stomach acid is splashing into the esophagus is a classic acid reflux symptom But the pain can last longer and be more intense than expected Many people mistake heartburn for a heart attack You can never ignore chest pain especially if it gets worse when you exercise or exert yourself Check out   
                   
                  If youre having chest pain check with your doctor to make sure youre not having a heart attack says Walter J Coyle MD gastroenterologist with Scripps Clinic Torrey Pines in La Jolla Calif The acid that is supposed to stay in your stomach is more likely to escape into your esophagus when you lie down or bend over causing heartburn 
                   
                  If youre sitting up straight gravity helps keep food in the stomach says Dr Coyle If you lose the gravity youre more prone to reflux 
                   
                  Thats why people with chronic heartburn raise the head of their bed and why they shouldnt eat big meals right before bedtime Pain that sets in right after a mealespecially a big mealoften means the stomach is overloaded and its contents have nowhere to go but up But you may be able to prevent this without taking medication 
                   
                  I would stress not eating big fatty meals and watching your intake of alcohol and tobacco says Dr Coyle who is a spokesman for the American College of Gastroenterology 
                   
                  And its another reason not to recline after dining Sometimes acid escaping from your stomach can make its way into the back of your throat leaving an icky bitter taste in your mouth In really extreme cases this can cause choking 
                   
                  If that happensespecially at nightyou should see a doctor Im very aggressive with therapy if patients wake up choking says Dr Coyle adding that he usually recommends   like proton pump inhibitors H blockers and antacids Dr Coyle is on the Speakers Bureau for Takeda Pharmaceuticals which markets proton pump inhibitors You might think youre in the early stages of a cold when your voice starts cracking but hoarseness can be another heartburn symptom 
                   
                  If stomach acid is seeping into your esophagus it can irritate your vocal cords says Dr Pfanner who is also a gastroenterologist at Scott  White in Temple Texas Pay attention to when your voice sounds more husky than usual If its after youve eaten you may have reflux A sore throat is another classic cold or flu symptom that might actually be caused by digestive problems 
                   
                  If your throat tends to ache only after meals you may have heartburn Unlike with a cold or the flu however this type of sore throat can also be chronic If you dont develop other symptoms such as sniffling or sneezing consider acid reflux Many respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and wheezing can also be due to heartburn likely because stomach acid is getting into your lungs 
                   
                  If you suspect heartburn is at the root of your breathing difficultiespossibly because it occurs immediately after eatingyou may want to talk to your doctor about getting a pH test The test is an outpatient procedure that measures the amount of acid in your esophagus over a hour period and can help determine if you have acid reflux The coughing and wheezing from heartburn can get so bad they could become triggers for asthma 
                   
                  It is not clear however if frequent heartburn actually causes people to develop asthma Although many people who have heartburn also have asthma and vice versa the reasons for this overlap arent clear 
                   
                  Experts think stomach acid can trigger nerves in the chest to constrict your breathing tubes in order to keep acid from entering Again a simple pH test to look for acid in your esophagus may help you get to the bottom of the problem Nausea is associated with so many things that it can be hard to attribute it to reflux But says Dr Coyle in some people the only manifestation they have of reflux is nausea If you have nausea and cant figure out why one of the things to think about is reflux 
                   
                  And if the nausea tends to come on right after meals thats even more of an indication that it might be acid reflux If so a regular antacid treatment such as an overthecounter acidcountering medicine could cut down on your discomfort If your mouth all of a sudden starts producing extra saliva it could be water brash which is highly suggestive of acid reflux Dr Coyle says 
                   
                  It involves the same nerves and reflex as when you vomit It is your body trying to wash out an irritant in your esophagus he says Over time the continuous cycle of damage and healing after acid reflux causes scarring Dr Pfanner says This in turn causes swelling in the loweresophagus tissue resulting in a narrowing of the esophagus and difficulty swallowing
