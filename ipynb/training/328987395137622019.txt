The New York City Council has taken up a proposal to raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases to  from  the strictest such limits in any major American city Smoking declined significantly among the citys teenagers from  to  then remained level through  and Christine C Quinn the City Council speaker has cited clear data showing that  percent of smokers begin before age  We have an ability to intervene on that and make a difference Ms Quinn said last week at a news conference last week But the scientific picture is a bit murkier than it might seem While most tobacco researchers agree that age restrictions will do no harm and may well help reduce the incidence of smoking among teenagers firm scientific proof for their effectiveness is hard to come by In  the minimum age for buying tobacco in Britain was raised to  from  The new limit had some beneficial effect according to two studies cited by Ms Quinn and Dr Thomas A Farley the citys health commissioner In the first published in October  in the journal Thorax a survey of  students ages  to  found that the law   But the data did not include  and yearolds presumably the teenagers most affected by the change The authors acknowledged that the sample size did not permit us to examine whether the legislation reduced the volume of cigarettes smoked The second British study published in the November  issue of Addiction also depended on selfreports and found that smoking   after implementation of the  law But smoking decreased in all age groups the authors noted suggesting that raising the minimum purchase age could not have been the only factor at work One study published in  in Tobacco Control was a twoyear prospective analysis of a random sample of  teenagers in Massachusetts the researchers linked selfreported teenage smoking to a statewide database of smoking laws and enforcement practices The study found that varying laws and levels of enforcement   although the authors acknowledged that other antismoking initiatives during the period could have hidden the effect Amanda Amos a professor of health promotion at the University of Edinburgh who has published widely on teenage smoking agreed that the data on whether age laws work is not completely convincing When you look at the evidence about whether it actually decreases smoking thats not so clear Dr Amos said There is some evidence that you can tighten up on sales but then young people find other sources Dr Farley is more optimistic I would characterize the evidence as quite positive he said The two that are the strongest are the study in England where they showed a big decline and the data from Needham which shows a remarkable decline over six years which was not matched here or anywhere else Needham a town in Massachusetts raised the minimum sale age to  in  According to a health survey conducted in  high schools in the region  percent of Needham students were smokers in  down from  percent in  What might account for the varied results in these studies A lot of the studies have found that the direct impact depends on enforcement Dr Amos said The more you put into enforcement the better it works The new law does not change the penalties to retailers for selling to underage customers nor does it criminalize smoking or the possession of cigarettes by people under  All studies have their weaknesses Dr Farley said You cant do randomized controlled trials of a law The closest you get is where you track over time the thing you expect to change and compare it to the places where you didnt change the law The data is pretty solid and it makes all the sense in the world
