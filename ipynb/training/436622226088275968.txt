Women with lowrisk pregnancies should be allowed to spend more time in labor to reduce the risk of having an unnecessary Csection the nations obstetricians say The new guidelines on reducing cesarean deliveries are aimed at firsttime mothers according to the American College of Obstetricians and the Society for MaternalFetal Medicine which released the  Wednesday online and in   About onethird of all births in the US are done by Csection and most of those are in firsttime mothers Theres been a  percent increase in these deliveries since the s but childbirth hasnt become markedly safer for babies or mothers That discrepancy has led many to conclude that the operation is being overused A Csection is major surgery The procedure can increase complications for the mother and raise the risk during future pregnancies Women giving birth for the first time should be allowed to push for at least three hours the guidelines say And if epidural anesthesia is used they can push even longer Techniques such as forceps are also recommended to help with vaginal delivery Early labor should also be given more time the doctors say with the start of active labor redefined to cervical dilation of  centimeters rather than  For many women and their doctors those are big changes So we talked with   the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and lead author of the guidelines to find out why The highlights from the conversation have been edited for length and clarity The tool itself does what it does it tells you what the babys heart rate is But theres a problem on the interpretation side of things trying to determine what the changes of the fetal heart rate really mean We really dont understand the tool all that well The incidence of a child being injured in the womb is pretty low probably about  percent in a normal pregnancy In  women youre going to have  problems If you miss one thats really bad thats an injured baby thats an upset family It really impacts the doctors and the nurses and of course its costly to the hospital We dont want to miss things But if were trading off hundreds of Csections to prevent one injury the question is what that tradeoff should be At some point that number is too high The harm on the moms is too high and on future pregnancies too This has been questioned for as long as a couple of decades But over the past five years a number of papers have been published showing that labor indeed takes longer than we thought on average But more importantly it takes longer for some of the extremes Theres a much wider range than we thought Everyone likes to think of the bellshaped curve and you start thinking this is going on longer than average But its not actually a normal distribution theres a long tail to the right  a lot of women have a labor thats much longer than average In early labor when theyre not changing their cervix much we think that this can go only for many more hours than we previously thought In the active phase of labor we dont think that should last for days but it can take more than the three to four hours that we thought Yes The single most common question Im asked on the labor floor is Whens the baby Doc I commonly respond not with a time but with a date If its early in the morning  or  in the morning Ill say Yeah I think the baby is coming today That usually elicits a laugh But I give myself a hour leeway I dont want them to be too worried to think that its dangerous that this has gone on too long My practice really changed when I came to San Francisco in  I was initially horrified by how long the physicians and the midwives allowed women to labor I came from an environment where we had benchmarks and we followed them Then we started looking at the second phase of labor just when youre pushing We found lo and behold that women who pushed longer than three hours longer than four hours even five hours the babies didnt have worse outcomes than the babies delivered in the second hour And they did better than babies delivered in the first hour You know before  there was essentially no quantitative data on the length of labor Then Emanuel Friedman said we should study this He studied  women and of those he said here are the  women who have idealized labors We then managed  million a women a year for the next  years based on  women Its not that the wrong approach was taken its that we started science and then didnt continue to do the science How is science done A lot of it is driven by economic demand Theres no money in being patient in labor I dont think theyre going to come up with a special stopwatch Because of that nobody has really pushed to look at this again I think in some communities there has been a progression toward this practice in the past   years But in other communities it could be a dramatic change It varies a lot around the country
