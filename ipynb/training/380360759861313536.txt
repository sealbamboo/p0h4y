A study on guns violence and mental health long scheduled to be published this week finds that gun ownership is a bigger factor than mental illness when it comes to firearms deaths But the data suggest that both play roles Earlier research has found that places with high rates of gun ownership have more firearms deaths but critics of those findings say that it could be that people living in dangerous places are apt to buy firearms to   And the question of mental illness has surfaced again and again with shootings in Aurora Colo Newtown Conn and now the Washington Navy Yard where  people were killed Monday by a man who appears to   In this study doctors in New York looked at data on gun ownership crime rate firearmsrelated deaths and depression from  developed countries including the United States Japan Great Britain and South Africa The United States had the highest rate of civilian gun ownership at almost  guns per  people The next two countries on the list were Switzerland and Finland with about  guns per  people Japan the Netherlands and the United Kingdom had the lowest gun numbers ranging from less than one gun per  in Japan to six in the UK The countries with more civilian guns also had the highest rates of firearms deaths with the United States leading the list at  deaths per  based on an international mortality database Gun ownership was strongly associated with firearms deaths The only outlier was South Africa which had  guns per  people but a firearms death rate almost as high as in the US Mental illness also correlated with firearms deaths but the connection was much weaker than for gun ownership The association pretty much disappeared depending on how the researchers crunched the numbers There was no overall association between gun ownership or mental illness and the overall crime rate in the  countries The researchers say this questions the premise that people arm themselves to protect themselves from crime This study like   finds a correlation but no direct cause The findings cant prove that gun ownership or mental illness are causing the deaths You could say that if there is a lot of crime in a society people will feel insecure so they buy guns and theres a vicious cycle said   director of the cardiovascular outcomes group at the New York University Langone Medical Center and lead author of the study We just dont see that We found a direct and strong correlation between gun owners and firearms deaths The   was published online in the   What you may ask is an interventional cardiologist doing studying firearms deaths We do a lot of outcomes research Bangalore tells Shots The work takes a broader look at the risks and benefits of medical treatments than does a clinical trial We wanted to look at gun violence from an outcomes perspective
