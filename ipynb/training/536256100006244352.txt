t has been just over a year since Professor Don Berwick produced his   offering a distinct shift in emphasis from the focus of the   Most notably it stated that rules standards regulations and enforcement have a place in the pursuit of quality but they pale in potential compared to the power of pervasive and constant learning The review team was specifically asked how the   can make zero harm a reality They came back and said sorry this is just not possible my paraphrasing but instead filled the report with the broader ambition of a continual reduction of harm So what impact has the Berwick report had on the NHS In conjunction with Monitor and the Trust Development Authority the Health Foundation sent a survey to every NHS provider in England We received anonymised responses from  organisations a  response rate including acute mental health community and ambulance services The headline results are set out in   Twothirds of respondents told us that the report had a high or very high impact on their safety improvement agenda We heard many examples of action they directly attribute to the report from the ward where it improved incident reporting and helped spread learning to the board where it informed strategies policies and governance structures Respondents told us that action was already under way before the report in areas such as monitoring safety and embracing transparency but that it gave an added endorsement and the motivation to do more Crucially more than nine out of  respondents thought they were making progress towards the continual reduction of harm It seems from this research that the NHS has responded well to being praised for its efforts rather than being criticised for its failings But while there is cause for optimism it is this concept of failure that suggests the NHS hasnt yet taken up the most critical recommendation from the report to abandon blame as a tool For instance we have just seen the Heart of England NHS foundation trust criticised for a clear failure in leadership following   This led to the resignation of its chief executive Dr Mark Newbold Mike Farrar former chief executive of the NHS Confederation came to speak to   Foundation staff recently and pointed out that we have seen responsibility for safe care increasingly externalised to regulators and national bodies If this is the case have we created a system where oversight bodies will inevitably apportion blame as part of their legal duty to take remedial action In our survey we asked what role national bodies should play in improving safety Respondents told us they want practical and moral support  practical support in the form of sharing learning evidence and best practice on what works and providing tools and resources and moral support in terms of greater acknowledgement of where improvements have been made and recognising that lasting change takes time Is it time to rethink the role of national bodies in supporting improvement Rather than focus on the quality of care should they focus on creating conditions that allow improvement to flourish at the frontline After all our survey showed that where providers are making the least progress is in supporting and training staff to improve care processes The manufacturing sector is a good example of an industry that has pursued quality by moving away from external assurance and towards empowering frontline staff to act when things go wrong Inspections and audits play their part but largely to help the operators deliver the best quality possible not to take responsibility for it Similarly our   illustrates how it is the primary responsibility of operators in other safetycritical industries such as nuclear power and commercial aviation to make the case for the safety of its services products and infrastructure Whatever the future holds this survey has given us cause for optimism about how organisations at a local level are pursuing safer care and cause for thought at a national level as to how we can best support further progress
