I began to walk to counter the adverse side effects of cancer treatment  and to stay alive Some days I could hardly get out of bed  But if I was able to summon the energy to get up and walk I found I had less physical pain and far less fear and anxiety  For more than six years I have battled stage  gallbladder cancer and even wrote about the fact that I have   My oncology team at Stanford Cancer Center used every available weapon to fight the beast that is cancer For  months beginning in May  my body was subjected to hundreds of thousands of milligrams of old line but reliable chemotherapy while the latest high intensity radiation was used effectively against an inoperable liver tumor By August a thoracic oncology surgical team removed a large portion of my right lung I walked every day after surgery and my lungs got stronger and my spirit too The walks were a time to meditate and gratefully focus on the joy and blessings of the day to feel the exuberance of life Early this year a followup scan showed no evidence of recurrent disease It was almost six years since diagnosis and technically I was cancerfree A few weeks later on Feb  I started walking the old historic California mission trail that stretches  miles from San Diego to Sonoma north of San Francisco It was a bit absurd since I had never walked more than seven miles in my life and lung surgery less than six months before left me short of breath just walking up stairs For  days I walked an average of andahalf miles a day I arrived at each of the  old Spanish missions physically exhausted and emotionally emptied but spiritually exhilarated The Franciscan friars and parish priests at each mission greeted me a nonCatholic as they did travelers more than  years ago with a blessing offers of rest food and when available lodging  The old mission trail of the late s and early s known as the El Camino Real was originally a footpath and wagon road Over the past two hundred years it has given way to concrete amid urban sprawl state highways railroads fenced fields and even military bases No current maps exist and it can be quite inhospitable to walking Two years ago Ron Briery a yearold retired high school music teacher walked the entire  mile trail in less than two months When he returned home to Oregon he sat at his kitchen table and pieced together a Hikers Guide to Californias  Spanish Mission Along El Camino Real I was very fortunate to walk the first  miles from Mission San Diego de Alcala to Mission Santa Barbara with Ron and his wife Sandy Sandy Briery was my inspiration that first  miles I would not have made it without her She had recently celebrated her st birthday and had hip replacement surgery just  months before the walk Sandy convinced me that if she could do it I could to  From the first day I felt a sense of heightened wellbeing each mile a soulful connection to a more natural rhythm a primal rhythm Nature is overwhelmingly beautiful and peaceful That peace became my peace It took us  days to reach Santa Barbara walking as many as  miles a day  After Ron and Sandy left the trail at Mission Santa Barbara sometimes other friends and family joined me and sometimes I walked alone At night I slept in a small borrowed Ford camper van driven ahead to the end of each days walk by a friend or my husband No one was more surprised than me upon reaching the last mission Mission San Francisco de Solano almost two months and  miles after setting off from San Diego  One of the greatest thrills of the walk was arriving in the mission courtyard and being greeted by Sally Canfield Coupe my roommate in Room  at Stanford Hospital where we recovered together after lung cancer surgery barely eight months before She had walked in her heart with me every mile Why did I decide to walk these  miles For me it was a way to heal my body from lung surgery and to gain courage and strength for what lies ahead But it was more than that much more It was a way to move beyond illness and a life defined by cancer   With cancer we lose control almost immediately We become hostage to disease It quickly takes over our life overwhelming not only our bodies but also our emotions and eventually our spirit For almost six years I have tippytoed around cancer fearful of arousing it fearful of its rage Each time cancer lashes out it not only wrecks havoc with my body it terrifies my soul  I walked to rid myself of the terror of cancer and to overcome the fear of it coming back It took hundreds of miles walking to just begin to rid my heart of six years of fear That fear may never completely fade but actively engaging life  whatever that may involve  reminds me of the joy each day can bring
