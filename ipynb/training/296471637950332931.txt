When it comes to weight loss some people will do almost anything Case in point fad diets such as the Master Cleanse Master Cleanse is a liquidsonly lowcalorie diet designed for very rapid weight loss Master Cleanse and others like it raise many questions on safety and results But are all cleanse diets bad It depends on the type of cleanse diet  and whom you ask After hearing that Beyonce used the Master Cleanse to lose weight for her role in the movie   Sharon Wren of East Moline Ill decided to try it herself I could stand to lose a couple of pounds and my system is probably horribly polluted from all the Diet Mountain Dew I drink so I mixed up a glass she recalls One sip was enough for me  it was the most hideous stuff Ive ever had Consisting of two quarts of water onehalf teaspoon of cayenne pepper  tablespoons of lemon juice and  tablespoons of maple syrup per day for anywhere from  to  days the Master Cleanse is an example of the wrong type of cleanse diet Despite its  or so calories the Master Cleanse does not provide the body with the nutrition it needs It is lacking in protein sodium and most vitamins Diets like this are a real danger and I would never recommend them says Susan B Roberts PhD professor of nutrition and psychiatry at Tufts University in Boston Weight loss almost certainly occurs but from all the wrong places Ideally reduction in weight from a diet happens by losing fat but with the Master Cleanse most of what disappears is muscle and water Cleanses may lead to weight loss but usually the weight returns once normal eating resumes similar to what happens with dieting says Stacey Rosenfeld PhD a staff psychologist at Columbia University Medical Center and in private practice in New York City These types of diets may cause emotional issues as well A cleanse may set someone up for disordered eating People who go on cleanses will likely find themselves inordinately hungry leading to feelings of deprivation This may backfire in the form of overeating once theyve finished the cleanse Fortunately not all cleanse diets are as extreme as the Master Cleanse The Elimination Diet for example focuses on cutting out certain foods from your diet such as dairy egg products most red meats peanuts foods with gluten citrus fruits corn and corncontaining products all processed foods and caffeine while encouraging five small meals a day that include protein unlimited vegetables and one to two servings each of glutenfree grain and fruit On this diet I have seen people lose significant amounts of body fat and gain muscle by eating healthier sources of   and reducing inflammation people who are inflamed or eating lots of allergenic foods will tend to carry a lot of extra water weight says Jessica Forbes MS a certified clinical nutritionist at Rheumatology Care LLC a rheumatology medical practice in Davenport Iowa This diet may be more difficult for people because it requires a strict lifestyle change but I like that it is purely foodbased and does not require supplements Another type of cleanse diet the three to day juice and soup fast consists of a fruit smoothie  romaine lettuce leaves  stalks of celery  cup of water and  cups of a fruit of your choice blended and drunk through the morning and into the early afternoon The rest of the days nutrition comes from any combination of cooked vegetables no oil or salt blended up into  to  cups of soup Juice fasting is an effective method of ridding your body of impurities says Peggy Hall a certified nutritional therapist author and wellness coach in Southern California Youll cleanse your digestive system and circulatory system and also give your liver kidneys pancreas and digestive system a rest Ultimately the safety  and success  of a cleanse diet depends on the diet itself No reputable doctor or nutritionist would support   If the cleanse is a starvationtype diet used as a crash diet then not only would it not be safe but the person may end up losing muscle mass in the process which over time can lead to increased body fat gain says Forbes However if the cleanse is used as an entry point into a   and lifestyle and provides adequate calories protein and nutrients then generally it would be a safe way to lose weight Ultimately the key to true   is finding a system that is both healthy and sustainable over a long period of time As for Wren its highly unlikely shell be trying the Master Cleanse again any time soon If its true that Beyonce drank the Master Cleanse to lose weight she says she should have gotten an Oscar too
