Heres one solution to the National Football Leagues concussion problem Stop playing at sea level Researchers have found that concussion rates are about  lower in games played at higher altitudes The finding was based on an analysis of all  concussions reported during the first  weeks of regularseason NFL games in  and  Week  data were not available since only playoffbound teams release them For every  times a player suited up there were  concussions But that figure varied with elevation The concussion rate at the  stadiums situated less than  feet above sea level was  per  At the nine stadiums higher than that it was  per  The nine stadiums  in ascending order  are in Indianapolis Pittsburgh Charlotte NC Orchard Park NY Kansas City Mo Minneapolis Atlanta Glendale Ariz and Denver The   led by researchers from Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center in a lowaltitude city appears in the current issue of the Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy Researchers used  feet as the dividing line between high and lowaltitude stadiums based on a  study of high school football players That study which looked at more than  concussions found nearly the same correlation between altitude and head injuries At  feet above sea level only Denvers stadium  Sports Authority Field at Mile High  is normally considered a highaltitude destination But even at far lower elevations atmospheric levels of oxygen are significantly lower than at sea level That increases blood flow to the brain and pressure inside the skull The increased pressure may protect against concussions caused by a phenomenon known as brain slosh When the head is subjected to sudden accelerations and decelerations the brain skull blood and spinal fluid move at different rates because their densities vary Higher pressure according to this hypothesis essentially creates a tighterfitting brain that is less prone to damage Headramming sheep and woodpeckers naturally have such protection allowing them to withstand collisions much more forceful than those that cause concussions in people The researchers were unable to control for the use of supplemental oxygen by players off the field which could change intracranial pressure They suggested that could explain why Denver where the use of supplemental oxygen is most common did not have the lowest concussion rate An earlier version of this post stated that the study authors were from the University of Cincinnati Their primary affiliation is with Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center Twitter
