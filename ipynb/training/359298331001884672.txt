To pediatricians guns are a health issue Firearms remain a   for young people The doctors say the evidence shows that homes are safer for kids and adults for that matter when guns arent around Pediatricians say doctors should ask their patients  or their parents in the case of very young children  if there is a gun in the house That seemingly simple question has proved controversial though pediatricians say it shouldnt be We ask patients about all kinds of things   president of the American Academy of Pediatrics tells Shots Doctors ask about the setting on the water heater turn it down to prevent burns and whether family cyclists wear bike helmets he says When it comes to guns McInerny says We know its important to ask Pediatricians arent looking to take peoples guns away he says and the information will stay confidential Were not going to tell anyone he says Instead the question could lead to a teachable moment If you have a gun at least keep it safe he says He says guns should be stored unloaded and locked up Ammunition should be stored separately and locked up too Pediatricians arent the only ones asking A Colorado doctor for instance   earlier this year about how an elderly patients suicide using a gun made him more likely to ask patients about firearms For years the leading professional group for internists   that its doctors talk about guns and safety with patients Still guns are unique The right to bear them is constitutionally protected and some people consider their ownership to be a private matter that should be offlimits even in a doctors office In Florida a law to restrict doctors from asking about guns   Doctors asserted their constitutionally protected right to free speech and challenged the law in court A   has blocked it so far but the state of Florida has appealed Arguments in the case   in Miami We wondered how Americans view the issue and what their experience has been So we asked in a nationwide telephone poll conducted with our partner Truven Health Analytics What did we find out Well about a third of respondents said there is at least one gun at home Not many had been asked about guns by their doctors though  only  percent Overall a third of respondents believe that providers of health care should ask patients about the presence of guns at home Now what about banning a doctors question to a patient about that kind of conversation That question turned out to be divisive About  percent of people either support or strongly support a ban On the other hand  percent oppose or strongly oppose blocking a doctor from asking about guns Its stunning to me that people would feel that strongly that physicians should be prohibited from asking about a gun  and across all ages says   chief medical officer at Truven Gun violence is a safety issue as much as seat belts are a safety issue For that reason he says doctors have a responsibility to know whats going on in the homes of patients We asked   head of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research for his take on the results He notes that very few people in the poll had direct experience with this sort of conversation with a doctor Asking people hypothetical questions you sort of have to take the responses with a grain of salt he says If a doctor actually speaks to them and explains why its relevant to their health and safety  and did so in a respectful thoughtful way  I suspect a number of people who said no would be perfectly fine with it People are free to disregard the advice of doctors and often do But Webster says parents may store guns more safely even if they arent willing to remove firearms from the home when counseled about the risks to kids after talking with a doctor The poll conducted during the first half of April gathered responses from  people across the country The margin of error was plus or minus  percentage points You can find the questions and full results   Past polls can be found
