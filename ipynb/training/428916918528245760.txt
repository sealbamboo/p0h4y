Theres new evidence that widely prescribed testosterone drugs  touted for men with flagging libidos and general listlessness  might increase the risk of heart attacks A   of more than  men found a doubling of heart attack risk among testosterone users older than  compared with men who didnt take the drug The research was inspired by a   published in  that hinted at an elevated risk among frail older men who were on testosterone replacement therapy The earlier study was halted ahead of schedule because of a higher rate of heart attacks strokes and other cardiovascular problems Whats new says William Finkle lead author of a study   Wednesday by   is that in men younger than  with known heart disease we also found a twofold increase in risk of nonfatal heart attack shortly after initiation of testosterone therapy Nonusers had a risk of heart attack of  per  men followed for  year while testosterone users older than  and those under  with known heart disease had an absolute risk of  per  patient years These numbers were adjusted to account for other health issues including high blood pressure diabetes and smoking As men age their production of testosterone falls For some testosterone drops so low that it becomes a medical problem But millions of US men use testosterone drugs as lifestyle drugs resorting to replacements to reverse a natural decline In a sign of the drugs popularity sales of AbbVies   the leading testosterone replacement surpassed Viagras in  In one frequently aired   a youthfullooking something man owns up to having low T which his doctor discovered after he complained of sagging energy and irritability After taking Androgel hes back in the swing of things the ad suggests riding around in a convertible with a youngerlooking woman With such inducements and common symptoms some specialists worry that many men are being prescribed testosterone drugs even if they have normal levels of the male sex hormone The drugs cost around  to  a month but companies are offering to cover patients insurance copayments or are giving away the first months supply In addition to the new study and the one in  a   last November found a higher rate of heart attacks strokes and deaths among  men taking testosterone therapy compared with  who didnt get the hormone treatment Finkle whos with a California firm called Consolidated Research tells Shots that the risk of heart attack should be added to the discussion between patients and physicians before anyone starts testosterone treatment He also says the Food and Drug Administration should require a warning on the labels of testosterone drugs such as Androgel and   We have a  study that was canceled because of unexpected cardiovascular risk he tells Shots I think that was sufficient to justify a warning Why withhold that from the patient Dr Sidney Wolfe of the   tells Shots that his consumer advocacy organization plans to petition the FDA asking for a strong warning on the instructions for testosterone drugs The group also intends to ask the FDA to hold off on a longacting injectable form of testosterone called   The agency is expected to make a decision on the drug in February But at least one advocate of testosterone therapy says the evidence of risks is overblown and poorly founded It feels almost like its open season on testosterone Boston urologist   tells Shots None of the studies is very impressive Morgentaler author of   published by Harvard Health Books says authors of the latest study have made the classic mistake of confusing treatment for a condition with the condition Theres a rich literature spanning more than  years that shows low testosterone itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular events He also criticizes the new study for not following patients long enough and notes that the rate of heart attacks among testosterone users was low Its high time for a study of testosterone therapy involving a large number of men who are followed for years Morgentaler says similar to the   on postmenopausal estrogen supplements There is potential for testosterone to be important for general health and longevity Morgentaler says Theres strong evidence it increases muscle strength and decreases fat  things we would associate with improved health But large lengthy studies cost hundreds of millions of dollars And in the case of estrogen replacement that sort of research ultimately discredited the longheld belief that taking hormone supplements lowers the risk of heart attacks
