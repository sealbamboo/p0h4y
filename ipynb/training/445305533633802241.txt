When it comes to media parents all want to know How much is too much for my child Dr Dimitri Christakis a pediatrician professor and father of two has spent a lot of time thinking about the effects of media on young children Christakis tells NPRs Arun Rath that not all TV is bad Some childrens programs are educational and engaging he says But if a TV show is overstimulating it can lead to developmental problems The medium can be too fast its surreally paced he says and that can overstimulate and ultimately damage young brains Some of the evidence for this overstimulation effect comes from studying mice Its funny theres only so much you can do with live infants Christakis says So weve developed a mouse model of overstimulation Using a kind of mouse TV in the lab researchers have found that mice that watch a lot of television early in their development have problems later in life They are hyperactive and take lots of risks that normal mice dont  for instance sitting unprotected in an open field which is a big mistake for a small animal with lots of natural predators The question of how much screen time is good for kids has only gotten more complicated with the arrival of interactive devices like smartphones and tablets Christakis says We have to take a step back and remind ourselves that iPads are only  years old And most of us cant even conceive of a world that existed before iPads they feel like theyve been here forever Because tablet technology is so new pediatric researchers dont have a lot of data on how touchscreen devices affect children Unfortunately the pace of research is much much slower than the pace of technological advances Christakis says But pediatricians are looking closely at interactive medias effect on children Relying on admittedly limited evidence and a strong theoretical framework Christakis is comfortable making a recommendation to parents Judicious use of these touchscreen technologies is fine and may even be beneficial he says One thing children of all ages never say or never even think when they interact with passive media is I did it he says Because of course you dont do anything when you watch a screen But you  do things when you interact with a touchscreen device This kind of interactive play is essential to learning and vital for brain development he says Of course all screen time interactive or not comes at the expense of some other activity whether its playing with other children or spending time with a parent With tablet technology screen time doesnt necessarily mean time spent alone Why not integrate the devices into family time Theres no reason whatsoever that a caregiver cant use an app with their child he says Its a great opportunity for what we call joint attention  the interactions between a child and a caregiver the backandforth which is critical not just to language development but brain development Sound familiar It should This says Christakis isnt much different from sitting down and reading a book with your child
