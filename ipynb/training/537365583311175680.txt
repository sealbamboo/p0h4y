Just  percent of Americans with HIV have it under control a new report finds even though most of them know they are infected Its a frightening problem because drugs can control the AIDS virus keep people healthy and greatly reduce the odds theyll infect someone else But people with untreated HIV will get sicker and can die  and are much more likely to spread the virus When you have an infection you treat it Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Tom Frieden told reporters People with HIV who achieve viral suppression arent just healthier  theyre also less likely to infect others Frieden added Todays study shows too many people with HIV arent getting the care they need The study doesnt look at why people are not getting treatment but navigating the red tape of the US healthcare system may be one major factor CDC says providers need to work harder to make sure people not only get diagnosed but treated for HIV The numbers come from CDCs latest look at HIV in the US In  it found  million Americans had HIV and  percent of them knew it But only  percent were seeing a doctor or other provider about it  even though HIV has no cure and its a lifelong infection that requires a lifetime of medical attention Just  percent had a prescription for the drugs that can keep the virus under control and only  percent actually had the virus controlled That means  Americans have uncontrolled HIV in their bodies Even more startling only  percent of people ages  to  who were infected were taking an effective dose of HIV drugs Getting HIV treatment should be a nobrainer There are more than two dozen HIV drugs many available as combinations in a single pill CDC guidelines say everybody who has HIV should be getting drugs and long waiting lists for programs to help pay for the drugs are a thing of the past Weve got such great treatment of HIV now that people living with HIV can have an almost normal lifespan Frieden said The human immodeficiency virus or HIV is usually transmitted sexually but also in blood via shared needles or from mother to child at birth It attacks the immune system so if it isnt treated people can develop infections or cancer and die The drug cocktails keep the virus from replicating and circulating in the blood so patients stay healthy and dont infect others Treatment is crucial It is one of our most important strategies for stopping new HIV infections said Dr Jonathan Mermin who heads CDCs AIDS branch CDC officials said they were alarmed by the findings and say its clear people with HIV need help getting and staying in care Some people may not know where to go or they may have trouble accessing care Frieden said Taking treatment for an infection that may have no symptoms and that you need to take for life is not easy he added That is why it is so important that services for people living with HIV be easy to access Taking HIV drugs  who are at high risk of infection There was some good news in the report The great majority of people with HIV   percent  have been tested and know they have it The epidemic was spreading out of control before testing became so common The annual rate of diagnosis with HIV  in the US between  and  And there arent any clear disparities when it comes to going without treatment  blacks whites gays men and women were   to be skipping care I think its clear that accessing HIV care can be difficult particularly for people who lack health insurance or who have difficulty navigating what can sometimes be a complex health care system Mermin said Doctors and clinics treating patients may need help holding on to them Mermin added Its not enough to diagnose patients You have to take accountability and responsibility for every patient he said
