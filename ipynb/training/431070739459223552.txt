Its an astonishing tale and if true would represent one of the greatest survivalatsea stories of all time But is the story told by Mexican fisherman Jose Salvador Alvarenga true Alvarenga says he and a young helper left the Mexican state of Chiapas to fish in September or December  the story varies   about  months ago Several days ago his small battered boat washed up on a reef in the Marshall Islands with Alvarenga looking worse for wear but not in such bad shape considering the ordeal He claims to have survived on turtles a few birds fish sharks rainwater and his own urine and maybe he did But experts contacted by NBC News have their doubts If everything lined up perfectly I suppose it could happen said Jonathan Wright an expert on sailing and water safety But its a longshot added Wright who is Vanderstar Chair at the United States Naval Academy but was not speaking for the academy The current record for survival at sea appears to be Poon Lim a sailor whose ship was sunk about  miles off the coast of Brazil by a German submarine during World War II According to Ruthanne Lum McCunn whose book Sole Survivor The True Account of  Days Adrift tells Lims tale he lived off rainwater collected in a large piece of canvas fish he caught with makeshift hooks and rope and a bird At one point McCunn told NBC News Lim did briefly drink his own urine during a long period without rain But  days is a lot shorter than roughly  And Lim had some advantages For example the raft came equipped with a storage tank for water Alvarengas boat apparently did not and unlike Lim drinking urine seems to have been a major part of his survival strategy While drinking urine may help extend life very briefly the US Army Field Manual says DO NOT drink urine fish juices blood sea water This is because your kidneys have already concentrated wastes into urine Putting that concentrate back into your body will only force the kidneys to concentrate waste products again and again Youll die As for drinking turtle blood to survive thirst Richard Rosenblatt professor emeritus of ichthyology at San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography said thered have to be an awful lot of blood in that turtle Rosenblatt a veteran of many long research sea voyages is also skeptical of Alvarengas explanation for what he ate I cant see him catching sea turtles Rosenblatt told NBCNewscom There arent that many of them running around far out to sea and though they do cross oceans on migration they mostly live in coastal waters As the sailors who took part in Thor Heyerdahls famous  voyage aboard KonTiki discovered fish can be hard to find in the deep oceans too I dont know how he would catch sharks Rosenblatt said Most species are coastal except the pelagic whitetip You do see them and I have been on ships where weve been stationary and threw out a chunk of bait and a hook and weve caught them but you need a hook and a good sized steel leader or their teeth would cut it Of course one possibility left unsaid by reports concerns the young man who left Mexico with Alvarenga Partway through the ordeal Alvarenga has said the young man died and was buried at sea But Alvarenga wouldnt be the first person trapped in an extreme survival situation to turn to cannibalism The fishermans survival for roughly  months adrift isnt plausible Rosenblatt said But of course just because its not plausible doesnt mean it didnt happen Wright believes the only way to really know is by a close examination of growths on the boats hull If the growths match a month journey then maybe it really was a miracle
