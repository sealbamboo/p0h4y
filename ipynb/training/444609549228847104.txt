New research has found that a protein indicating the breakdown of white matter in the brain can be detected following a hard blow to the head raising hopes that a blood test could soon detect a concussion predict how long symptoms will linger and guide decisions about an athletes return to play In their bid to find a blood biomarker for concussion researchers went to a sport with plenty of blood and plenty of concussions hockey For the first half of the  hockey season they gathered blood samples and tracked blows to the head among the  professional hockey players of the Swedish Hockey League Between September   and Jan    suffered a concussion and  of those had blood samples taken    and  hours after their injury Elevated levels of the protein known as totaltau or Ttau have long been seen as a marker for brain injury and are present in a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease The latest study published in the journal JAMA Neurology finds that Ttau levels spiked in the blood in the hour after a hockey player suffered a traumatic brain injury and then again about  hours later And while they declined slightly in between and after  hours blood samples of players with concussions showed elevated levels of Ttau six days after their injuries compared with blood samples taken in the preseason The higher a players Ttau level was in the first hour after injury the longer it took for his concussion symptoms to fade away researchers found While researchers suspected Ttau might be key to diagnosing concussions detecting elevated Ttau levels  is more easily said than done With varying degrees of accuracy it can be done by drawing cerebrospinal fluid from the brains fluidfilled ventricles or from spinal fluid Jabbing a plunger into the brain or the spine is riskier and more expensive than drawing blood and testing it but no existing blood assays were capable of detecting elevated Ttau levels Then in  two of the studys coauthors from Quanterix Corp in Massachusetts pilottested a highly sensitive new   They found it capable of detecting heightened Ttau levels in the blood of patients who had hypoxic injuries to the brain after a heart attack The same assay was used to compare players blood levels of Ttau from the preseason to those immediately after a blow to the head The same researchers found two other potential biomarkers of little use in distinguishing those who sustained concussion from those who did not In an editorial accompanying the Swedish hockey study a pair of brain scientists cautioned that Ttau is a sign of only one kind of injury that takes place in concussion the twisting and stretching of axons the fibers that carry electrical signals between cells and among different regions in the brain If a blood test is to capture all concussions wrote Joshua Gatson and Dr Ramon DiazArrastia it may also need to look for markers that reveal injury to the brains blood vessels its specialized immune system and its diverse helper cells Gatson is a professor of surgery at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and DiazArrastia is a professor of neurology and regenerative medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda Md The lead authors of the hockey study are at University of Gothenburg in Sweden and Sahlgrenska University Hospital
