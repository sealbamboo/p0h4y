Salad producers havent succeeded in banishing   and other dangerous microbes from fresh greens though theyve tried hard As weve reported before its a major challenge to both   and the   But one scientist thinks hes making progress  with a spinach spa that zaps bad bugs with ultrasound Ultrasound is nothing more than sound moving at a frequency too high for humans to hear Its commonly used for medical tests including those adorably   of babies in the womb Turn up the intensity though and ultrasound can pack enough power to destroy bacteria Ultrasound is increasingly used in food production and has been used successfully to decontaminate other fresh foods including   But using ultrasound on greens has had only mixed success Leafy greens are difficult says   an associate professor of food engineering at the University of Illinois who built the spinach spa Zap a spinach leaf too hard and it develops watery spots and rots Zap it too little and the germs live We need to be very careful We dont want to damage this produce Yet a spinach leaf delicate though it is can block ultrasound waves from reaching bacteria behind it Feng tried to overcome these problems by submerging the spinach in a big trough of water much like the tanks used to wash fresh greens for commercial production He added Jacuzzilike jets to move the water so all the spinach gets exposed to about the same amount of sound waves  And he used transducers that were as deep and long as the tank to generate sound waves throughout As the sound waves move through water they make areas with high and low pressure That creates tiny cavities that pop like bubbles That cavitation process can dislodge and destroy bacteria  or it can destroy the spinach So Feng had to tweak his machine to cause just enough cavitation but not too much Then he combined ultrasound and a timetested industry technique  washing fresh greens in a solution of chlorine and water That resulted in a tenfold reduction in   compared to a chlorine wash alone The   were reported in the journal   Feng is confident he could invent a machine that would work on a commercial scale but it would cost more than the chlorineonly treatment many processors use now and so far no ones expressed interested in funding commercial development of his spinach spa We have finished the first step Feng told The Salt He next hopes to rerig his system to disinfect microgreens next
