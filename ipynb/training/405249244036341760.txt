The Food and Drug Administration says it is reviewing whether the maker of the most widely used emergency contraceptive pill needs to change its label in light of new evidence that it doesnt work to prevent pregnancy in overweight or obese women The word comes as   that makers of a similar product in Europe have relabeled their morning after pill to reflect the latest scientific findings that the hormone levonorgestrel starts losing its effectiveness in women weighing as little as  pounds and loses it completely in women who weigh more than about  pounds The realization that the pill doesnt actually work to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex in overweight or obese women came as sort of an accidental finding of a   It was comparing the effectiveness of several different kinds of emergency contraceptives Levonorgestrel is also the active ingredient in Plan B the drug approved to be sold   without a prescription and without age restrictions after a decadelong battle Diana Blithe a contraceptive researcher at the   and one of the authors of the study said the findings came as something of a surprise to the researchers It wasnt obvious Blithe says until you had enough numbers of women in a population when you have a substantial number of women who are obese to really do that analysis  such as in the United States where nearly   are technically considered overweight or obese But Linda Prine medical director of the   and a practicing family doctor in New York City says the findings dont come as a surprise to her plussize patients I have had many patients say to me Yeah I got pregnant using that So theyve had the experience already of it not working she says Still Prine says she was shocked when she saw the data at a medical meeting earlier this autumn And she worries that not enough women know about it I dont know that the word is really out there enough yet and that really concerns me because this can cost women  a pop to take this medication and then it doesnt work and then theyre pregnant Prine says Researcher Blithe says its not clear why the drug stops working in heavier women She says it might have to do with metabolism or with the volume of the medication in the bloodstream And would a higher dose of the drug work No one knows Theres a possibility but it has to be tested she says But Blithe says one thing is clear Now that the effect is known the makers of all of the products containing levonorgestrel  not just Plan B but all its generic copies  should be required to tell women about it I think it is incumbent upon American manufacturers to put that information on the label now that theyre aware of it she says Teva Pharmaceuticals   that makes Plan B said it would not comment on its discussions with the FDA But in Europe   the makers of a similar product Norlevo have already changed their products label Still Linda Prine says that for overthecounter products a label change might not be enough because many women dont read fine print I would like to see a big sign in the drugstore myself that says Warning This medication does not work if weight is over this or BMI is over that  Prine says So what should heavier women do instead if they need an emergency contraceptive On that Blithe and Prine agree There are other options Im telling patients that depending on their weight I would prefer and I recommend that they either use a different medication for emergency contraception called ulipristal acetate or Ella or that they use a copper IUD which is the best method of all of them because it works all the time she says The study found that   also stops working for obese women over a certain weight although at much higher weights than Plan B Meanwhile the FDA said in a statement that it is currently reviewing the available and related scientific information on this issue and will determine what if any labeling changes to approved emergency contraceptives are warranted
