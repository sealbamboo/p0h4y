Your friends dont want to hear about your excellent adventures While you may have gotten great pleasure from an epic event  sipping a rare wine in Burgundy watching a Himalayan sunrise  that pleasure is all your own A recent study in   says that despite the thrills people receive from an extraordinary experience few anticipate its potential social cost exclusion by friends who would really rather not hear about it Harvard researchers found that when people socialize those who had the same experience no matter how mundane enjoyed chatting about it together Those same people might well exclude the person who thought others couldnt wait to hear all about his or her most unusual one Its a timely question given how much people are sharing and bragging about their experiences through social media said Cassie Mogilner an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who looks at the   from ordinary and extraordinary events This suggests that people may be rolling their eyes at all those posts about amazing vacations Reasonable people may disagree about what distinguishes an ordinary experience from an extraordinary one Gus Cooney a Harvard graduate student in psychology and the studys lead author defined an extraordinary experience as one that isÂ both enjoyable and unique Before beginning the study the researchers asked  participants to rate the quality of short movies From that data the researchers picked a highrated film  one that left viewers feeling great  to serve as the proxy for an extraordinary experience They picked a lowrated film one that left viewers feeling not very good as an ordinary experience To measure the social consequence of an extraordinary experience the researchers then asked  new subjects to watch one of the movies The researchers held  sessions with four participants each One person was shown the superior fourstar video the extraordinary experience The other three each watching alone saw the lackluster twostar video an ordinary experience The group convened afterward to chat  As it turned out the people who had seen the best film didnt enjoy the postfilm socializing Our subjects thought they would be the star of the interaction and they were surprised they were left out of it said a coauthor Daniel T Gilbert a Harvard social psychologist who writes about happiness They didnt understand why everyone else wanted to commiserate about the bad movie rather than hear about their great one In questionnaires filled out later the participants who had watched the superior video felt considerably worse than those who had seen the ordinary one In followup studies people incorrectly predicted that seeing the better video would improve their social interactions not make them worse In the papers discussion the authors note that pleasure comes loosely speaking from both nonsocial or individual experiences and social or shared experiences Nonsocial pleasures are especially sensational when they are unique or unusual  like a joy ride around town in a Lamborghini But the pleasure of a social encounter is built on commonality People are more likely to enjoy talking about an ordinary experience they have all had rather than hearing about the fabulous one they didnt So sharing the details of your singular experience in a social setting can indeed backfire leading to feelings of being excluded Were so attracted by extraordinary things that we dont think about their cost  that they make you different from anyone else Mr Cooney said George Loewenstein a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University also looked at other potentially negative reactions when people hold forth about grand achievements starring themselves In his recent paper    Dr  Loewenstein and his coauthors note that people often misjudge that moment when their confident selfpromotion is instead construed by listeners as distasteful bragging Our study gave me pause about whether you should just keep your mouth shut Dr Loewenstein said Do the findings mean you should decline an invitation to dine privately with Ben Affleck and instead go out with friends to see his film Gone Girl Not necessarily Dr Gilbert suggested that contact with celebrities even though it counts as rare and extraordinary might be its own kind of crowdpleasing experience Certain experiences can make you the star of the party and make people want to know you more he speculated But when friends come over for dinner he added You might want to think twice before you haul out your photo album of that recent trip to Paris
