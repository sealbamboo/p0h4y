 an advocacy group that has worked to improve care for the dying and bereaved since  will close its doors at the end of this month The foundation has lost too much funding to continue its founding president and chief executive Naomi Naierman told me in an interview As a parting gift however Ms Naierman  a hospice executive for more than  years  has passed along some consumer advice Even as Americans make greater use of hospice care families often dont grasp that in most places they have a choice of programs And when the time comes to decide many are in the middle of a health care crisis that makes researching the options difficult Ms Naierman and her colleagues have come up with some key questions to ask when youre selecting a hospice   appears on the foundations website The conversation below has been edited and condensed for space  In your decades with hospice what are some of the changes youve seen positive or negative  The growth of hospice is a positive trend Its not only available in most communities but in most urban areas you have lots of options On the negative side it started out with volunteers who really wanted to focus on care for the dying and has moved toward a big business in some cases owned by very large corporations For a long time we could assume that every hospice provided highquality care There came a time when that assumption was no longer safe  So families have to shop around for the best hospice care  You have to become a very savvy consumer about what is likely to be the most important health care decision you make in your life As a foundation weve been advocating publicly available data We are looking toward a hospice compare tool published by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services The Affordable Care Act requires public reporting on hospice care And fortunately theres been a tradition of hospices conducting evaluations by primary caregivers who are intimately familiar with the care of the patient But that data is not yet available to the public  Similar to   When will that happen  Its coming but all too slowly My guess is it will be two to four years  In the meantime how can families interview hospices about which services they provide  You might find theyll come to your home to do an assessment of whether someone is eligible Thats a time to ask questions Or you can call on the phone How receptive a hospice is to these questions is the first signal of their quality  You advise asking how long a hospice has been in operation  Hospices in some communities come and go You want to be sure youre not signing up with one thats been around a few months or even a year More established hospices are more stable and more people can tell you about them The physician youre working with may have heard about their reputations  What else  Response times Thats part of hospices standardized surveys They ask family members after death whether the staff was available on weekends and on evenings Its one of many measures that arent available to the public yet but its a fair question to ask What can you tell me about your staffs response time should I need your services on the weekend or on evenings How long will I have to wait in an urgent situation  Arent all hospices that provide benefits through Medicare required to provide the same services  Theres a set of services thats standard but how much what the intensity is  that varies a lot Consumers need to know that Continuous care for instance There comes a time when youre actively dying in your last hours of life and that calls for continuous care  You want to ask whether its their practice to keep a nurse or another clinician in the home when a patient is actively dying Does the family get support Do they see the patient through death You would hope that in the last hours of life a hospice would maintain its presence especially if youre in your own home But as the Washington Post just reported  and it was very disturbing    In some states a large percentage dont which basically means that when youre actively dying they dont stick around Another important question Do you have an inpatient facility in case my symptoms become complicated Most hospices dont have their own facilities but they can rent or manage a unit in a hospital or beds dispersed throughout a hospital or in a nursing home The point is to have the capacity to manage your symptoms when theyre not manageable at home  Respite care is a required service right To give families a break if caregiving for the patient becomes exhausting  Yes but its not specific so its also a good question to ask What kind of respite care do you offer under what circumstances Would it be a nurse or aide who comes or a volunteer Do you provide it once a week or twice For how long  It will be difficult for patients or families to undertake this research if theyve waited until a few days before death It sounds like another argument for enrolling in hospice early But then  Â  if they dont show measurable decline  You have to assess your risk If youre a cancer patient the issue of being discharged probably wont come up But if you have Alzheimers or ALS theyre terminal diseases but they can take years You probably have to be prepared to go through reviews So you have to be realistic about how long hospice will take care of you Youll be aware of it You wont be surprised
