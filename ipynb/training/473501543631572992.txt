A nursing home owner failed to properly report allegations of potential abuse against two elderly residents healthcare regulators have found   Staff are alleged to have verbally abused two people who live in the home in Carrickfergus County Antrim  An investigation into what happened at Cherry Tree Nursing Home is under way The home was the subject last year of a BBC investigation after a whistleblower accused the authorities of ignoring her concerns about falling standards Dr Dean Harron who owns the home failed to comply with health regulations in two different areas     Last month the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority RQIA found Dr Harron guilty of failing to comply with safeguarding legislation  Following an inspection last September the regulators found that the owner had failed to ensure all staff had been properly trained in the safeguarding of vulnerable adults  It also found there had been inappropriate behaviour between staff  It was while those allegations were being investigated that the regulators became aware of claims that two elderly residents had been verbally abused  The home had been placed on notice or alert since last September However further inspections were also carried out in February and May  While the allegations of abuse against the residents had been investigated by the homes manager the safeguarding team at the Northern Health Trust were not notified  This was a breach of legislation as well as regional and local protocols  In November  Dr Harron was advised by the RQIA that management within the home needed strong support from him in order to turn things around   It was advised that training for staff in all areas was compulsory  Last year a whistleblower told the BBC that the authorities had failed to listen to her warnings about falling standards at the home  The whistleblowers allegations stretch back many years The former care worker told the BBC that basics such as feeding toileting and cleaning were often ignored due to staff being inappropriately trained  A full report triggered by the whistleblowers account is due to be published by the RQIA later this month  Health campaign group Patients First has called on the RQIA to impose the strongest sanction possible on the nursing home owner  The group told the BBC that Dr Harron had been given too many chances to improve conditions at the home  We call on the RQIA and the health minister to take urgent action without delay said spokesman Aidan Hanna  The RQIA said the owner must ensure that staff registered with Northern Ireland Social Care Council were aware of their responsibility to report any suspected abuse to the relevant person  The owner has until  July to comply with the current requirements   The homes manager Jennifer Tracey said We are deeply disappointed that despite the last  months with Cherry Tree demonstrating continuous improvement and compliance with the RQIA standards and meeting all requirements with regard to the quality and level of care for our patients and residents that just last week we were informed that a manager had failed to properly report a concern about two instances involving one care assistant when a vulnerable patient was being assisted during a meal and when another was spoken to sharply Our patients and residents should and can expect the very best from our staff and we take extremely seriously any shortcomings that are implied or identified  We have in place robust reporting procedures which should have been used in this instance and were not  On being notified by RQIA about this failure we carried out a full briefing of all staff to ensure a complete awareness of our policies and the requirements to be compliant at all times
