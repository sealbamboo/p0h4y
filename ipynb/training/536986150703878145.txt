When you donate to a food drive do you ponder the nutritional labels of the can in your hand Or do you grab a packet of ramen or a bag of marshmallows from the dark corners of your pantry and hope it hasnt expired Healthfulness isnt typically a wellintended food donors top concern says hunger advocate Ruthi Solari The ramen and marshmallows along with a container of Crisco and a few other items were basically the entire contents of a food box delivered to one of her volunteers grandmothers who received food aid Solari says What would she even make with this she notes Solaris nonprofit   works with food banks and pantries schools and individuals on food drives that focus on nourishing nutritionally dense nonperishables And it offers materials available for free download on its website that groups and individuals can use to host their own healthful food drives People think if its nonperishable it must be unhealthy says Solari Instead of reaching in the back of the pantry for whats expired or undesired were asking people to really think about health That means donating items like lentils canned tuna or canned salmon peanut butter without added oils or sugars brown rice quinoa or kidney beans With these sorts of pantry staples she says you can have amazingly healthy food as the basis of any meal Though many people may not realize it eating this way  with a focus on whole unprocessed or minimally processed foods  can also be a lot cheaper when you look at the cost per serving Solari notes A   on Superfoods website shows how swapping in raisins for fruit snacks or rolled oats for instant oatmeal will get you a much better and healthier bang for your buck Giving food pantry clients this type of price information is key to helping them make better nutritional choices when theyre shopping too says Jennifer Gilmore executive director of   a hungerrelief organization that serves some  people in San Diego County Calif She says  percent of families who frequent food banks make their food purchases based on dollars instead of anything having to do with nutrition  visited a food pantry in  according to a national survey conducted by Feeding America These are the elderly single parents theyre   notes Solari Theyre people just like us our neighbors who hard times have forced to choose between paying for utilities and food Many of these people are also struggling with dietrelated diseases like diabetes So in recent years hungerrelief groups have been putting an increasing emphasis on healthful eating says Gilmore who worked with Solari to revamp her organizations nutritional policies That involved changing not only the types of foods that pantries solicited from donors Gilmore says but also educating volunteers and staffers about healthier cooking so they can pass that knowledge on to the people they serve Its one thing to distribute brown rice and quinoa and bok choy says Gilmore Its a whole other thing to get families to taste it and cook it and eat it at home Her group now hands out recipes with food boxes The goal says Solari is to make healthful eating approachable and really debunking the idea that its an elitist thing Its not enough to fill empty stomachs she says The opposite of being hungry isnt being full  its being healthy
