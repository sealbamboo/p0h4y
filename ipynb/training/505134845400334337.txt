ZURICH—The World Health Organization warned Thursday that the number of people affected by the Ebola virus could rise to 20,000 within the next nine months and a projected half a billion dollars would be needed to fund efforts aimed at stopping the spread of the disease.. In a document released Thursday, the U.N. health body said the outbreak of the disease "continues to accelerate." More than 40% of reported cases have occurred within the last three weeks, the report said.
