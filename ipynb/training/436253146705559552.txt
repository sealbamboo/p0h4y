You would think that a vaccine that could prevent cancer would be an easy sell but thats hasnt proven to be true so far with the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer Just  percent of girls and less than  percent of boys in the US have gotten all three recommended doses of the vaccine to protect against the   which causes cervical and other cancers Compare that to the tiny African nation of   where more than  percent of sixthgrade girls were vaccinated in  or   where  percent of  and yearold girls have gotten all three vaccines This is a vaccine that protects against cancer what could be better than that asks Shannon Stokley an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention She and other public health officials are trying to figure out the best ways to persuade American teenagers and preteens to get the HPV vaccine The argument for it is simple HPV is the   sexually transmitted infection Most HPV viruses are harmless But a few types can cause cervical anal and penile cancer as well as   We dont know who is going to develop cancer or who will clear infection Stokley says which is why its so critical to protect adolescents with the vaccine long before theyre ever exposed to the virus The federal government   that the first of three HPV vaccine doses be given to children when they turn  or  A second dose is given about one month later with a third and final dose within six months HPV vaccine has been recommended for routine vaccination for girls since  and for boys since  A recent   found HPV prevalence was reduced by  percent among teenage girls between the ages of  and  who were vaccinated suggesting the vaccine is highly protective But as many as two thirds of  and yearold girls dont get the HPV vaccine when they are at the doctor getting other vaccines About one quarter of parents say they dont plan on getting their daughters vaccinated in the next year according to a   published in July  by the CDC The most common reasons parents gave were thinking that the vaccine wasnt necessary  percent the doctor didnt recommend it  percent and safety concerns  percent Studies to date have shown no significant safety problems Then there are logistical issues In countries like Australia and Rwanda with high rates of coverage children are vaccinated at school In the US parents have to take children to a doctor or clinic three times to get all three shots Younger kids routinely go to a doctor for well child visits but teenagers typically dont see a doctor regularly And Stokley says doctors may feel uncomfortable talking about a vaccine that protects against sexually transmitted disease with teens or with parents of kids as young as  The fact that onefifth of parents think the vaccine isnt necessary shows that doctors have to be more vigilant in recommending the HPV vaccine says   He is chief of the Communicable Disease Epidemiology  Immunization Section at the Seattle  King County Department of Public Health Our research showed that parents did not have a lot of knowledge about how widespread HPV was how readily it was transmitted how easy it is to acquire and also about the severity of illness it can cause he says People often mistakenly think the vaccine is targeted at teens who are sexually active which Duchin says is simply not true Once you become sexually active you can acquire HPV infection quite readily The entire strategy is based on protecting kids before they get infected just like it is with all our other vaccine preventable diseases Earlier in February the   said that more need to be done to get the public educated about HPV and cancer The panel also called for more efforts by health care providers to recommend and give vaccines and to make sure the vaccines are available where teenagers get their health care Convenience is key Duchin says And that may include offering the HPV vaccine in schoolbased health clinics or at pharmacies similar to the flu vaccine
