Electronic cigarettes are popping up in more and more stores around the country and consumers are "vaping" in bars and restaurants with gusto. Sales of the devices are expected to reach nearly $2 billion this year. Until now, the top tobacco companies have been out of the game, but both Altria, which owns Phillip Morris, and R.J. Reynolds are now launching their own brands. Back in 2009, the FDA warned that e-cigarettes could pose health risks. This month, the agency is expected to release a set of proposed regulations on the devices.
