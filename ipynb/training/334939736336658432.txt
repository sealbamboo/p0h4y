The news that US scientists   seems almost certain to rekindle a political fight that has raged on and off since the announcement of the creation of   The issue of legislation on human cloning is about to get hot again says Hank Greely director of the   at Stanford Law School But its a fight that has over the past decade and a half produced a lot of heat and light and not a lot of policy In fact for all the arguing about the issue thats happened in Washington over the years human cloning is still technically legal at least in much of the country There are already  countries in the world that have laws on their books banning human reproductive cloning and this prohibition is also in a number of international agreements says Marcy Darnovsky executive director of the   which is devoted to the responsible use of new genetic and reproductive technologies But in the US we have not managed to put such a law on the books at the federal level At least  states ban cloning either for reproductive purposes or research or in come cases both according to the  But Congress has mostly fought issues of both   and   to a draw What we saw the last time cloning was in the headlines was that the discussion really got mired in the abortion controversy Darnovsky said The House passed bills banning all forms of cloning in  and  the Senate failed to act in both cases All the other issues got completely swamped she said And I really hope that doesnt happen this time But both the issues of cloning  for research and reproduction  and embryonic stem cell research have been mired in the abortion controversy from the start About the only law that has been able to pass is language that gets added to the funding bill for the Department of Health and Human Services every year since the mids  the socalled   named for its original House sponsors Reps Jay Dickey RArk and Roger Wicker RMiss It bars the use of federal funds for research that could destroy or harm a human embryo The Clinton administration decided that federal funding of embryonic stem cell research using cell lines derived from embryos destroyed with private funds  President Bush put that policy into force but   available to researchers I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines where the lifeanddeath decision has already been made he said in a televised address to the nation Meanwhile over the years Congress   to expand federal funding of embryonic stem cell research under specific ethical guidelines as well as legislation to ban cloning intended to make a baby None however was able to pass both the House and Senate and get the presidents signature When he came into office in  President   while maintaining guidelines such as not paying women for their eggs The majority of Americans from across the political spectrum and from all backgrounds and beliefs have come to a consensus that we should pursue this research he said But Congress remains deadlocked over the bioethical issues  which is not to say that there is no federal regulation Jonathan Moreno a bioethicist at the   points out that the   has from the start said it would closely regulate anything it deemed to be human cloning whether reproductive or therapeutic Once you start talking about putting many of the products of these cells into people then you get into an area where the FDA is very interested he said Meanwhile Darnovsky of the Center on Genetics and Society says she hopes this new development might break the legislative logjam This development if it turns out to be replicable will mean that there will be cloned human embryos in labs around the country she said And we really need to make sure that no unscrupulous person would ever try to use those to produce a cloned human being Congress however has been unable to pass much of anything this year Its unclear yet if this will rise to the level of mustpass
