The government has announced an independent review of cigarette packaging in England amid calls for action to discourage young smokers David Cameron appeared to distance himself from uniform packaging in July saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective  But Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said it was now time to examine the emerging evidence on a policy shift  Labour said immediate action was needed not another review In a Commons statement Ms Ellison said standardised tobacco packaging would be brought in after the review if we are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to proceed including public health benefit The review led by paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler is set to focus on a pilot scheme in Australia which became the first country to legislate for standardised packaging in   For Labour shadow public health minister Luciana Berger demanded to know why the government was delaying the introduction of plain packaging still further having already held a consultation on the issue in  Opposition leader Ed Miliband added The government should have introduced plain packaging earlier this year  we want them to act swiftly we want them to act now We dont need another review Every major public health expert agrees this would help the battle against cancer against young people taking up smoking The government has never officially ruled out changes to cigarette packaging laws but BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that private briefings from Downing Street had previously suggested the idea was dead He said ministers were likely to have been defeated on Lords amendments to the Children and Families Bill which enjoyed crossparty support and would have given the government the power to regulate cigarette packaging  Ms Ellison confirmed that the government would table its own amendment to the legislation giving ministers the power to introduce regulations quickly when Sir Cyrils review is complete in March   if they decide to proceed with the policy  She rejected suggestions the rethink had been prompted by fears of defeat in the Lords saying Its a year this weekend since the legislation was introduced in Australia Its the right time to ask people to look at this This is fundamentally about childrens health Two thirds of people start smoking when theyre children and its one of the most important public health issues we face in this country A study conducted in Australia found that smokers using standardised plain brown packets were  more likely to consider quitting Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government had an open mind on the review and personally he hoped it would show that plain packaging was effective But UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall accused Mr Cameron of scandalously auctioning off the freedom and liberty of the British people for his own political ends cheered on by the Labour Party   Cigarette firm British American Tobacco BAT which owns brands including Benson  Hedges and Dunhill said the Australian experiment had failed to achieve its public health objectives The evidence shows that the introduction of plain packaging of tobacco products has coincided with an increase in illicit trade leading to increased profits for criminals selling blackmarket tobacco it argued    Labour has sought to link Conservative election chief Lynton Crosbys work as a consultant for the tobacco industry to delays in the policy a claim which was rejected by David Cameron at the time the issue was put on hold in July The ban on images on packaging came into force in Australia on  January after a longrunning legal battle between the former Labor government and the tobacco industry Manufacturers claimed the law was unconstitutional and infringed on their intellectual property rights by banning the use of brands and trademarks But they said they would comply after the legality of the measure was upheld by the countrys highest court  Cancer Research UK said a move to plain packaging would save thousands of lives Stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation it added  More than  doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals have signed an open letter saying they also welcome the move  Cigarette packs are now the key marketing tool employed by the tobacco industry to attract and retain customers they wrote  There is no time to lose and Parliament must act now to protect children from the marketing tactics of the tobacco industry The Scottish government has said it is still committed to introducing standardised packaging while New Zealand is also considering the move
