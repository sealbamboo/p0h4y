If you are aiming to lose weight by revving up your exercise routine it may be wise to think of your workouts not as exercise but as playtime An unconventional new study suggests that peoples attitudes toward physical activity can influence what they eat afterward and ultimately whether they drop pounds For some time scientists have been puzzled  and exercisers frustrated  by the general ineffectiveness of exercise as a weightloss strategy According to multiple studies and anecdotes most people who start exercising do not lose as much weight as would be expected given their increased energy expenditure Some people add pounds despite burning hundreds of calories during workouts  Past studies of this phenomenon have found that exercise can increase the bodys production of appetite hormones making some people feel ravenous after even a light workout and prone to consume more calories than they expended But that finding while intriguing doesnt fully explain the wide variability in peoples postexercise eating habits  So for the new study   French and American researchers turned to psychology and the possible effect that calling exercise by any other name might have on peoples subsequent diets  In that pursuit the researchers first recruited  healthy adult women the majority of them overweight The women were given maps detailing the same onemile outdoor course and told that they would spend the next halfhour walking there with lunch to follow  Half of the women were told that their walk was meant to be exercise and they were encouraged to view it as such monitoring their exertion throughout The other women were told that their minute outing would be a walk purely for pleasure they would be listening to music through headphones and rating the sound quality but mostly the researchers wanted them to enjoy themselves When the women returned from walking the researchers asked each to estimate her mileage mood and calorie expenditure  Those women whod been formally exercising reported feeling more fatigued and grumpy than the other women although the two groups estimates of mileage and calories burned were almost identical More telling when the women sat down to a pasta lunch with water or sugary soda to drink and applesauce or chocolate pudding for dessert the women in the exercise group loaded up on the soda and pudding consuming significantly more calories from these sweets than the women whod thought that they were walking for pleasure  A followup experiment by the researchers published as part of the same study reinforces and broadens those findings For it the researchers directed a new set of volunteers some of them men to walk the same onemile loop Once again half were told to consider this session as exercise The others were told that they would be sightseeing and should have fun The two groups covered the same average distance But afterward allowed to fill a plastic bag at will with MMs as a thankyou the volunteers from the exercise group poured in twice as much candy as the other walkers  Finally to examine whether realworld exercisers behave similarly to those in the contrived experiments the researchers visited the finish line of a marathon relay race where  entrants aged  to  had just completed laps of five to  kilometers They asked the runners whether they had enjoyed their race experience and offered them the choice of a gooey chocolate bar or healthier cereal bar in consideration of their time and help In general those runners who said that their race had been difficult or unsatisfying  picked the chocolate those who said that they had fun gravitated toward the healthier choice  In aggregate these three experiments underscore that how we frame physical activity affects how we eat afterward said Carolina OC Werle an associate professor of marketing at the Grenoble School of Management in France who led the study The same exertion spun as fun instead of exercise prompts less gorging on highcalorie foods she said  Just how physiologically our feelings about physical activity influence our food intake is not yet known she said and likely to be bogglingly complex involving hormones genetics and the neurological circuitry of appetite and reward processing But in the simplest terms Dr Werle said this new data shows that most of us require recompense of some kind for working out That reward can take the form of subjective enjoyment If exercise is fun no additional gratification is needed If not theres chocolate pudding  The good news is that our attitudes toward exercise are malleable We can frame our workouts in different ways Dr Werle said by focusing on whatever we consider fun about it such as listening to our favorite music or chatting with a friend during a group walk  The more fun we have she concluded the less well feel the need to compensate for the effort with food
