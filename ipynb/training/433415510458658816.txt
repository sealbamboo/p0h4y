Neurosurgeons across the country are refreshing their medical school skills after learning that a second group of patients in six months has been exposed to a rare and fatal brain disorder through insufficiently sterilized surgical equipment Preventing crosscontamination from CreutzfeldtJakob disease a terrifying and incurable infection is part of basic training for brain doctors who should know that they either need to take extra steps to clean their tools  or use disposable options We expect that all boardcertified neurosurgeons would be quite familiar with this said Dr William T Couldwell president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons Its actually part of our curriculum So he said its very unusual to hear this week that   in WinstonSalem NC have been warned that they may have been exposed to CJD through surgery in January And its even more surprising that the case follows reports last fall that  patients in three New England states learned that they too could be at risk for the disease that can take years to show up before ultimately killing its victims Its extremely rare Couldwell said The likelihood of passing this along even with routine sterilization is pretty low In both incidents hospital officials said the initial neurosurgery patients turned out to have sporadic CJD which occurs spontaneously Its not related to the variant form of CJD that causes a human form of mad cow disease and is associated with eating infected beef All forms of CJD are caused by misfolded prions proteins that transform from healthy to infected cells and spark a chain reaction of disease experts say CJD is very rare causing about one death per million people each year worldwide and about  each year in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In North Carolina hospital officials said the patient had neurological symptoms that meant there was reason to suspect CJD and to use enhanced sterilization procedures The extra precautions should have been taken but were not said Caryn Klebba a spokeswoman for Novant Health Lab tests subsequently confirmed that the patient did have CJD In the New England case doctors at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester NH didnt realize that the initial patient was at risk for CJD until symptoms appeared weeks later So far none of the patients warned about CJD last fall has shown any symptoms or other problems state health officials said But Couldwell who is chairman of the neurosurgery department at the University of Utah said many hospitals including his own have turned to disposable surgical tools when dealing with suspected or confirmed CJD just to be safe I think it takes away all question said Couldwell Many hospitals are taking on the more stringent and expensive method of using disposables to take away the risk Trouble is it can be quite costly to toss trays of disposable drills scissors forceps and needle drivers valued at thousands of dollars Couldwell said Infectious disease experts including the CDC say that either enhanced sterilization or using disposable tools can prevent transmission of CJD Part of the problem is that CJD is so rare that some doctors including neurosurgeons dont think of it early enough said Florence Kranitz president of the CJD Foundation an advocacy group I think its just a simple precaution said Kranitz who lost her husband to the disease If it is CJD theyre supposed to wash down the surgical theater theyre supposed to take precautions with everything in that room
