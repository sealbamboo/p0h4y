Its a common rookie mistake but plenty of dietandexercise veterans make it too With an act of will you muster yourself to the gym or the track and you gut your way through an arduous workout When you sit down to dinner or go to the break room later that day you say to yourself By God Ive earned this sugary soda yummy snack second helping dessert second glass of wine I worked hard today A week or so later youre standing on the scale wondering what happened Answer You forgot to have fun A new study delves into one of the great mysteries of diet exercise and weight loss why when youve started a grueling exercise regimen in a bid to shape up its common to gain not lose weight Sure theres the old reassurance that muscles weigh more than fat But when the weight gain comes before any evidence that weve changed our body composition significantly I think we all know were kidding ourselves Framing  or the way we think about  the experience of exercise matters a trio of researchers at Cornell Universitys food psychology lab found More specifically they found it influences not only what we choose to eat after the experience but how much of it When we think of the physical activity we engage in as fun or at least incidental to fun we make better food choices When we frame physical activity as exercise were more likely to choose rewarding foods and to eat more of them the study found The study published Thursday in the journal   was ingeniously simple College administrative staff members were told to wear comfortable shoes and were promised a free lunch after they completed their task Half the subjects were handed a map told that the purpose of the study was to exercise and sent on a minute onemile course with occasional stops to assess their level of fatigue The other half were given the same walking map but handed an MP player and told that the purpose of the study was to assess the clarity of the music at six different stopping points along the way Afterward researchers offered their  subjects a lunch of pasta and meat sauce green beans and a choice of either a sugary soft drink or water and applesauce or chocolate pudding Researchers distracted their subjects not only so they wouldnt discuss their walking experiences with one another but so those running the experiment could measure how much subjects served themselves and record what choices they made A second experiment used the same walking course but set one group on what was described as a sightseeing walk while the other went on what it was told was an exercise course Afterward researchers offered the  subjects the chance to help themselves to MMs and surreptitiously weighed the bags that subjects poured for themselves before sending them on their way Compared with the walkers distracted by pleasant music the exercisers were more likely to choose sugary soda over water Though the exercisers were no more nor less likely to pick the chocolate pudding they served themselves more of it on average than did the subjects who thought they had taken an enjoyable walk Interestingly the two groups consumed roughly the same number of calories worth of pasta sauce and green beans That said the researchers suggests that the workhorse subjects were rewarding themselves by choosing and eating more of the foods and beverages that are tasty treats than they were simply boosting their calorie intake Compared with subjects who ambled along taking in the campus attractions those who perceived their walk as exercise served themselves larger portions of MMs upon completion of the walk Finally the researchers took advantage of a real footrace and asked  runners who had run between five and  kilometers to fill out a brief survey that assessed how much fun they had had Then they offered the runner a choice of a chocolate bar or a cereal bar Sure enough irrespective of runners hunger levels their body mass index or the distance they had run those who indicated they had had more fun running the race were more likely to take a cereal bar The chocolate bars were more often the choice of those who viewed the race more as a test or a workout than a pleasant challenge The upshot is simple said Brian Wansink director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab If you think of your physical activity as fun youre less likely to feel the need to reward yourself than if you see your workout as an exhausting chore That may involve a few mind games he noted but the reward is that you wont negate the benefits of your workout with poor food choices Do whatever you can to make your workout funÂ  Play music watch a video or simply be grateful that youre working out instead of working in the office said Wansink Anything that brings a smile is likely to get you to eat less
