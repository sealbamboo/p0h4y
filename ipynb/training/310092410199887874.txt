Many people who get anorexia recover after therapy and counseling But in about  to  percent of cases the disease becomes a chronic condition that gets tougher and tougher to treat Right now doctors have few options for helping these patients mostly women whose disease can be crippling or fatal Anorexia is probably the most lethal of all psychiatric disorders says   a psychiatrist who heads the eating disorders program at Johns Hopkins For chronic adult patients who have failed inpatient attempts there isnt a clear effective intervention Thats why a very small exploratory study   in   Thursday is drawing attention Neurosurgeons from the University of Toronto tried a technique called   to see if it might help patients with severe anorexia Guarda who wasnt involved in the study is quick to point out that doctors used the technique on only six patients and just three of them gained much weight afterward The results didnt meet the statistical tests for significance The technique is definitely not ready for prime time Guarda tells Shots But since we dont have anything that works well for these individuals  that have a high risk of mortality  it warrants cautious optimism and further study In deep brain stimulation doctors implant tiny electrodes next to a region of the brain thought to be dysfunctional A device similar to a heart pacemaker then sends waves of electricity through a wire to the electrodes No one is completely sure about how deep brain stimulation works but the thinking goes that the electrical pulses boost the activity of some neural circuits and quiet others The Food and Drug Administration has approved this kind of treatment for Parkinsons disease and its being tested for some psychiatric disorders In the latest study neurosurgeons in Toronto implanted the electrodes in the brains of six women with chronic anorexia Five of them had been struggling with the disease for over a decade All of them had experienced serious health problems from it including heart attacks in some cases Three of the women saw improvements in their anorexia nine months after the surgery but only two of them started to reach a normal weight Kim Rollins from Kitchener Ontario was one of those successes She had been fighting anorexia for over  years After going in and out of multiple treatment programs the yearold says she was growing desperate My symptoms were so severe I would wake up in the middle of night and run up and down the stairs for hours or go for a fivehour run she tells Shots I became very isolated I didnt want to be around anyone because they kept me from exercising When she heard about the deep brain stimulation experiment she was skeptical and scared It was brain surgery But I had had a heart attack at  and two strokes  she says My mom was in the midst of planning my funeral If I didnt take this chance I knew my path would probably lead to death Fourteen months after the surgery Rollins says shes in recovery Shes been maintaining a healthy weight and shes less depressed I think its lowered my level of anxiety a lot she says Im in a better mood I feel better about myself and its really helped my body image Rollins admits that the deep brain stimulation wasnt a magic bullet Shes had to continue her anorexia treatment to get where she is I still see a psychiatrist regularly and a dietitian It the deep brain stimulation enables me to do the work that I need to do a lot easy Neurosurgeon   who led the study says thats theoretically how the treatment should work Anxiety and depression can prevent people with chronic anorexia from responding to behavioral therapies Lipsman tells Shots If you are able to reduce anxiety patients can then take advantage of therapy Its how we could get a foot in the door for treatment But Lipsman admits that the technique is risky and it still needs to be tested in a larger study to figure out how well it works for anorexia Its also likely to be expensive if it ever makes it to general practice Deep brain stimulation can cause serious side effects Lipsman says like seizures and more milder ones like pain and nausea This is a brain surgery  theres no sugarcoating that he says The primary objective of this study was to establish that this a safe procedure for these patients who have been quite ill before the surgery Thats all we can say right now
