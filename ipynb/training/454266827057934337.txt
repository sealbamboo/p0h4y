Five nights a week Amanda H and her husband drove to her parents upscale continuing care retirement community in suburban Boston She could feel her anxiety build as they rode the elevator upstairs For two hours they ferried dinner from the dining room transferred it to china set the table Amanda handfed her father whose neurological disorder  makes it difficult for him to maneuver a fork Its unsightly and embarrassing for him she said so her parents ate in their independent living apartment Then Amandas husband helped ready her father for the night He cannot stand unassisted so his soninlaw helped him undress brush his teeth urinate and transfer unsteadily into bed  a laborious process said Amanda whose asked that her last name be withheld so as preserve her parents privacy This was not how shed envisioned this phase of her life Her own daughter is grown and at  she said  I felt ready to turn a corner  She had contemplated volunteering as a tutor for Englishlanguage learners Instead along with the evening routine Amanda drives her father  to medical appointments at least weekly She delivers groceries so the private aide who helps in the morning can prepare breakfast Amanda pays her parents bills prepares their taxes She spent months cleaning out the house where theyd lived for  years unearthing things from every cupboard and drawer She and her husband also endure her fathers relentless lowlevel criticism The food isnt hot enough The items placed on his night table are an inch too far away Youre asked to help and then youre found fault with she said Its so chronic built into our every interaction Our whole lives hes never said Good job  Her two brothers live several hours away  not coincidentally she thinks  so she bears the brunt of her parents care and their discontent Her mother  is declining as well Other adult children Amanda knows have to sacrifice far more Many cant afford any paid help Her parents maddeningly have plenty of money yet resist any suggestion that might improve the situation Could the agency that sends aides two nights a week send them more often Yes at  pm But her parents want them at  pm So no Could a different agency provide aides at  pm No her parents like the helpers they have The whole purpose of a continuing care retirement community is to provide more help as residents need it What about moving from independent to assisted living Thats horrifying to them Amanda said largely because theyd have to give up the second bedroom fitted out as her fathers office Even though he spends very little time there now thats his identity she said Amanda would like to discuss the conundrum with the facilitys social worker but her parents already fear being compelled to move By alerting anyone to their condition wed bring unwanted attention Amanda said I feel like I would be snitching The Tyrannical Parent my phrase not hers wants and demands help but only on his own terms Other people must compromise he wont The losses that can accompany aging make him ever more dictatorial about the few things he can still control His weary children may recognize the dynamic but its hard to live with nonetheless Amanda feeling trapped drives home after dinner and drinks more wine than she used to And she has cracked two teeth  the result her dentist says of clenching her jaw This is a job for Super Social Worker Barbara Moscowitz senior geriatric social worker at Massachusetts General Hospital Ms Moscowitz sees this situation frequently with longcriticized children They come to caregiving with the hope conscious or unconscious that they can resolve this If I provide good enough care maybe Ill be told Im loved Ill be told thank you she said  At the same time the parents may be holding on to their patterns even more tenaciously  Ms Moscowitz added So you see the family getting stuck Getting unstuck isnt simple She recommends enlisting an objective third party a professional who can assess the parents situation A  nurse or social worker for the retirement community might serve or a geriatric care manager who works directly for the family so administrators wouldnt know she was on the case Were she the mediator Ms Moscowitz said Wed write a plan This is what they need this is what they have this is what we can do The outsider may be able to recruit allies to break the logjam Who might the mother and father listen to Ms Moscowitz asked A clergyman Their primary care doctor The parents own siblings Sometimes the children who got away can help Ms Moscowitz often arranges conference calls with all the siblings to establish whats needed and to solicit support for the one most under the gun like Amanda They may give the daughter permission not to continue in this way Ms Moscowitz said For the parent she added theres often an unconscious fear If my daughter knows someone else will feed me dinner she wont see me Ill be forgotten A caregiver manipulated by Tyrannosaurus parens can assure her parents that she will still visit and help that she wont withdraw But she can decline to provide nightly services for people who have other resources As it happened not long after Amanda first emailed me she got a call from the retirement community whoseÂ  staff had noticed that her parents no longer used the dining room The social worker had met with them and without apparent resistance arranged an hours care from private aides each evening So Amandas husband will regain his evenings the aide will take over bedtime prep But an hour is not enough time to provide all the help needed so Amanda will still go feed her father  now seven nights a week Its not the end of the world she told me I should be able to handle that
