Being poor is stressful Thats no big surprise In   by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health  in  people making less than  a year said theyd experienced a great deal of stress in the previous month And of those very stressedout people  percent said that money problems were to blame Scientists have long recognized that poverty can   Now theyre also beginning to understand that the stress of too little income actually changes the way people think Take Lauren Boria a single mom from the Bronx in her early s Borias an upbeat redhead supporting herself and her yearold daughter Fallon Theyre barely scraping by on the paychecks from Borias waitressing job So Boria finds herself constantly doing a mental tally I have like I think  in my checking account right now she says And I have a  check that Im going to deposit Then I have to write a  money order So whats that leave me with I think twenty bucks Money seems to rule Borias brain Princeton psychologist   says thats normal for someone whos not making ends meet Shafir   He told me that it doesnt matter what kind of scarcity youre dealing with When humans dont have enough of something that fact dominates our consciousness When youre very lonely or when youre hungry or when youre poor a large portion of the day is spent entertaining thoughts related to the source of your scarcity If youre lonely you spend a big part of the day worrying about how to make social connections which is actually distracting you from other things And if youre poor you worry about money Constantly Putting this constant mental attention on money can be a good thing  in part In making daytoday financial decisions Shafir says the poor are just better than the rich They use their dollar better than the rich Theyre more efficient Theyre more effective They pay greater attention So when Boria pays attention to these issues she can do extremely well But the same attention that helps Boria survive daytoday hurts her in the long run Shafir says thats because constantly solving money problems takes up a huge amount of Borias cognitive capacity  a limited resource When so many moments of the day require your full attention theres very little of it left to worry about things that are not right in front of your eyes  and then you start doing things you wish you hadnt done You dont quite remember to do things in time You dont anticipate things that are going to happen tomorrow Shafir calls this problem   When youre bandwidth poor youre thinking about how to pay for food and make rent today  and its almost impossible to think about the future Shafir says that the poor are often judged for being myopic  for not saving money for the future or not making better decisions But what looks like shortsightedness from the outside is actually bandwidth poverty trapping people like Boria in the moment to such a degree that they literally cant think about the future Boria struggles with bandwidth poverty in lots of small ways every day But theres one big decision that haunts her going on welfare after she lost her job about a year ago Made in the throes of bandwidth poverty she now calls that the worst decision of her life Once Boria enrolled she started getting a check for  twice a month But what she didnt anticipate was that those checks would come with a whole new list of responsibilities The big requirement was that Boria had to show up for whats called a work preparedness program Monday through Friday from  am to  pm for three months Its like a job but you get no money for it she told me You have to go there ready for an interview every day But Boria says there never were any actual job interviews In fact Dr Shafir told me that programs like work preparedness are intentionally complicated and demanding to make sure that only the most driven and needy people will jump through the hoops to keep their benefits The idea behind that is that people who just want an easy check get weeded out The actual effect on people like Boria is what Shafir calls a cognitive tax  taxing their limited bandwidth and adding even more stress The minute they make you show up every day at the right hour dressed well with a form Shafir says theyre just imposing more cognitive tax on you and increasing the chance that you wont succeed The expense of commuting to the program and the time it took up eventually took its toll on Boria and she dropped out But her time on cash assistance left a big footprint in her life Just a few months ago she learned shed been accused of concealing funds  a crime she could do jail time for The charge is that Boria hadnt reported some unemployment benefits shed gotten while she was on cash assistance The funds in question are a little over  Thinking back on it now Boria feels like if shed just had the mental space and time to research all the options and what theyd lead to she would never have signed up for welfare in the first place So what can the millions of people like Boria do to alleviate bandwidth poverty Shafir says that for a start policymakers can ease the cognitive burden of people who are financially strapped by simplifying the complicated forms and extensive bureaucratic requirements that make it hard to access public assistance This is the opposite of a cognitive tax  what Shafir calls a cognitive gift And Boria has gotten pretty good at giving herself cognitive gifts  a few moments of quiet out on the dock at her job waitressing at a private yacht club in the Bronx or a cheeseburger and a milkshake when shes feeling extra stressed Dr Shafir says these kinds of mental breaks are more important than they might seem When youre struggling poor  a lot of the day is not so much fun And people fail to appreciate the fact that when I buy myself a big ice cream or a small gift  something he says many people criticize the poor for doing  Im giving myself a nice minute after a complicated week which is a good thing to do For Boria the ultimate cognitive gift is a day away from appointments and obligations playing at the beach with her daughter Fallon Having children is the ultimate collection of wonderful satisfying minutes and warmth and love in your life Shafir says So that can be an enormous boost It doesnt make her juggling easier In fact theres every reason to believe her juggling has gotten much more complicated But it does give you some meaning which is what were all here for in some sense
