About a year and a half ago Dr Leslie Kernisan  a geriatrician in San Francisco decided she couldnt stand her medical practice any longer  Every day she felt she was shortchanging her older patients What I had in the way of time and resources to meet patients needs was so inadequate that it felt almost grotesque she told me recently At the time Dr Kernisan was working at a community clinic filled with caring committed professionals   They werent the problem  What was wrong she felt was a dysfunctional system of health care for seniors  and at the center of that was Medicare the governments insurance program for seniors So Dr Kernisan did something highly unusual for a geriatrician  She decided to withdraw from Medicare and create    Today she spends as much time as her patients want reviewing their medical problems their prognosis how their care is being coordinated and what caregivers can do to help When people call for help she calls them back within two hours  Emails are answered in one business day a request for a house call generates an appointment in no more than two days   The price for all of this   an hour which patients pay out of their own pockets for anything and everything she does  Though Medicare doesnt pay for her services it does pay for medical tests and services provided to these patients by other physicians  Those fees are unaffordable for all but relatively welloff older adults however While people didnt complain Dr Kernisan said she felt terrible about leaving patients who had relied on her and guilty toward colleagues who shouldered responsibilities she was giving up   Still shed come to a breaking point and it seemed impossible to go on as things were  It was so stressful that I felt my own health and wellbeing were suffering   Dr Kernisan said   Dr Kernisan   in a Hastings Center blog post and spent several hours talking with me about her decision to leave Medicare Hers is an extreme example of the malaise afflicting geriatricians Earlier this year my colleague Paula Span wrote about   The number of geriatricians estimated at  last year has fallen from a peak of  in  and is far short of the estimated    Maintaining practice in geriatrics is very difficult unless you have some other form of support like an academic position or a medical directorship at a nursing home said Dr Peter Hollmann chairman of the public policy committee of the American Geriatrics Society   Its one of the only fields in medicine where additional years of training yields less compensation not more At doctors offices and at the clinic where Dr Kernisan worked Medicare paid only for facetoface visits not phone calls or consultations with family members reimbursements didnt even begin to cover the effort required for thorough medical evaluations of medically complex patients  The only way to stay afloat financially she found was to pack in patients backtoback in  to minute slots   People would come in with a long list of concerns that they wanted to address and youre thinking How many of these can I follow up on Dr Kernisan said  And you ended up having to pick just two or three  If youre conscientious its distressing to feel you cant do most of what you should be doing Stressed and unable to sleep at night the young doctor felt pulled between her professional passion for helping older patients and their families and her personal life with the abundant demands of two small children One day her yearold asked Mommy why are you always mad and always saying no   At that point Dr Kernisan said she was forced to recognize she was always cranky at home and miserable going to work  It was time for a change  In May  she left the clinic where shed worked part time as a medical director and in October she opened her own practice That move coincides with a growing debate within her profession  Given the small numbers of geriatricians in the United States should they even try to provide basic medical care Or should they become consultants called in on complex cases that require special expertise in the health concerns of older adults A lot of geriatricians feel they might use their time more effectively working in teams with primary care physicians said Dr Gregg Warshaw a professor of family medicine and geriatrics at the University of Cincinnati   Today Dr Kernisan describes herself as a coach and a consultant  Instead of delivering routine medical  care she conducts comprehensive specialized geriatric assessments evaluates care ordered by other doctors and comes up with plans to fill gaps in care that other medical professionals havent addressed  I focus on things like pain physical decline falls incontinence frailty the management of medical complexity  things that tend to be missed by primary care doctors who lack the time or expertise or both she said    Sometimes its not easy  Though Dr Kernisan tries to work closely with a patients primary care doctor some havent welcomed her input  Its a delicate issue she said  The vast majority of the time it has been a family or a geriatric care manager who calls me up not a primary care doctor saying I need help with this older person Dr Hollmann said I think it is a reasonable option for some number of geriatricians to have this kind of practice but hopefully it wont be too many because we want Medicare patients to have access to care Although theres a lot of noise about physicians unhappiness with Medicare and some evidence of doctors restricting the number of Medicare members theyll treat only  physicians nationwide opted out of the government health program last year according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services But those numbers arent necessarily reliable  When the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services was asked to evaluate how many physicians were opting out of Medicare it found that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the agencys contracts were     If you know of other geriatricians whove exited Medicare and set up new models of practice for older adults tell us more in the comments section
