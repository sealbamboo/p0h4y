A comprehensive new look at how mothers fill their hours suggests its time to revise the old saw A man may work from sun to sun But a womans work is never done The new saw should be  theres something to see Make your own bed Im watching TV Compared to mothers with kids between ages  and  at home in  contemporary moms spend on average  fewer hours per week in physical activity  including housework meal preparation childÂ  care laundry and exercise But those same women are logging seven more hours per week in sedentary activity such as watching TV surfing the Web or driving Moms of children under  have shed about  hours of physical activity time weekly but have increased their weekly log of sedentary time by six hours on average The new research published Monday in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings looked at data collected in the American Heritage Time Use Study which has detailed the time Americans engaged in paid and unpaid work from  to  The researchers led by University of South Carolina public health professor Edward Archer looked only at how mothers allocated their time outside of hours spent in paid work The dramatic reallocation of mothers time has consequences for the women themselves The resulting reduction in energy burned up in physical activity averages  calories more per week for women with older children at home and  calories per week for those with preschoolers And because mothers patterns of activity consumption and weight gain profoundly influence those of their kids from gestation onward this year shift from exertion to inertia has likely played an outsized role in the nations epidemic of overweight and obesity the authors say A mothers physical activity and sedentary behaviors affect the environments to which her progeny are exposed such as the intrauterine milieu and family social setting said Archer As a result he added the change in mothers habits in their weight status and in their propensity to diseases is likely being transmitted across generations With each passing generation mothers have become increasingly physically inactive sedentary and obese thereby potentially predisposing children to an increased risk of inactivity adiposity and chronic noncommunicable diseases Given that physical activity is an absolute prerequisite for health and wellness it is not surprising that inactivity is now a leading cause of death and disease in developed nations Archer said Archer and his coauthors gauged the energy expenditure of mothers by mining the timeuse sheets for detailed breakouts of hours spent daily in distinct activities They assigned different metabolic equivalents  and thus calorie expenditure  to doing laundry and cleaning up after dinner for instance than they did to leisuretime physical activity In  mothers with older children at home spent on average  hours in activity time  a mix of exercise for pleasure and active unpaid work such as child care and housework  and  hours in sedentary activities By  activity time accounted for an average of  hours per week for these women and sedentary time had expanded to  hours per week Mothers with children under  at home went from  hours of activity time per week in  to an average of  hours in  But their sedentary time went from an average of  hours per week to  hours Most of those changes came in the s s and s with the allocation of time to sedentary and physical activity having largely stabilized since the s Calling physical activity an absolute prerequisite for health and wellness Archer noted that its no surprise that inactivity has become a leading cause of death and disease in developed nations The expansion of time spent on the couch may be the greatest public health crisis facing the world today Archer and his coauthors wrote
