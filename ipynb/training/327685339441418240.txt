Polio isnt going easily into the dustbin of history The world needs to push it in throw down the lid and then keep an eye out to make sure it doesnt escape Thats the gist of a new plan released Thursday by the World Health Organization and other foundations at a   in Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates Its a sixyear  billion program and its goal is to wipe out polio for good The plan calls for attacking the   of polio in the last endemic countries  Afghanistan Pakistan and Nigeria  with mass immunization campaigns It would boost polio surveillance globally and set up systems to respond rapidly in case outbreaks do occur At the same time the new   lays out a strategy to switch to an injectable vaccine instead of the ubiquitous oral vaccine The latter is cheap and easy but it contains a live virus which in very rare instances can cause polio The road map also looks at how to contain existing samples of the virus in laboratories and how to secure stockpiles of the vaccine in case polio somehow comes back Global health leaders who have been going after polio for decades believe theyre finally on the verge of crushing it In  there were  polio cases reported worldwide Last year that number dropped down to  This year so far there have been fewer than  This trajectory is good news says   at Emory University who has been working on polio eradication for years But the job isnt finished he says The last cases are the hardest Orenstein tells Shots Obviously if they were easy we would have gotten rid of those reservoirs a long time ago Orenstein says the period in between what appears to be the last human case and the end of polio is a precarious one He points out that the world has appeared close to eradicating polio before In  Tajikistan which had been free of polio for many years had an introduction of polio from India and had  cases he says a massive outbreak Less than six months ago Egyptian health officials found live polio virus circulating in the Cairo sewage system despite the fact that Egypt hasnt recorded a single case of polioinduced paralysis since  I think the information from Cairo points out that as long as we have reservoir countries polio can travel Orenstein says Health workers traced the virus in Cairo back to Pakistan Theres no evidence that polio has been reestablished in Egypt but its clear that Egypt got exposed because of someone from Pakistan coming there he says All the more reason we need to focus on the reservoir countries as we continue to maintain surveillance everywhere else to make sure it isnt being transmitted in other countries India launched a   to eliminate polio in the late s and seems to have succeeded There hasnt been a single case recorded in India in more than two years But theres a constant fear there that polio could get reimported and come roaring back says   who heads up Rotary Internationals efforts to eliminate polio from India We in India have been guilty of exporting polio virus to almost every part of the world Kapur tells Shots And by the same channels by which it went the virus could well come back into India Kapur and others involved in the polio endgame say one of the biggest challenges now and in the coming years is keeping people focused on the final goal until its clear that polio is really truly gone
