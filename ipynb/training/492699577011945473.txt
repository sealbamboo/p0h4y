Earlier this month Representative Nita M Lowey Democrat of New York introduced what shes calling the Social Security Caregiver Credit Act intended to increase retirement income for middleclass citizens who must reduce their work hours or leave the work force because of caregiving duties Its hard to feel optimistic about its passage in this political environment Im braced even here for a chorus of How can we possibly afford   But you cant really argue with the problem it tries to address The toll that family caregiving can take isnt only emotional and physical its also financial but not always in obvious ways The groceries you pick up on the way to see your mother the utility bills you quietly pay for your aunt  youre aware of those If you cut back your hours turn down promotions or leave your job as some caregivers feel forced to youre keenly conscious of your lost income But I wonder how many people consider the ways that their own retirements years down the road may suffer The pressures of caring for a disabled or dependent family member can reduce Social Security income for the rest of the caregivers life And not by peanuts A MetLife study in  based on data from the national Health and Retirement Study estimated that men who reduced work hours to provide care for parents   If they stopped working they gave up more than   The damage from cutting back on work was worse for women they lost more than  in Social Security benefits Leaving the work force to care for a parent cost them more than  in addition to the lost wages and sometimes pension contributions themselves Economists have worried for years about older women They spend fewer years in the work force at lower wages and save less for retirement Since our country relies on the family for the great bulk of elder care  and for most handson tasks that still means women  how can we help caregivers avoid an impoverished old age We should ensure that caregivers wont have to be torn by the impossible choice of taking care of a family member or earning less for themselves and their family Ms Lowey told me via email Her bill   would tackle this issue for people who earn no more than the average national wage which changes annually It came to  in  The law would work this way If you provide at least  hours a month of unpaid care for a dependent relative you get a credit added to the earnings on which the Social Security Administration bases your future retirement benefits The value varies on a sliding scale said Chris Bigelow the representatives legislative director Someone not working at all would get  recorded as his or her earnings that year someone working parttime at an annual  salary gets an additional  credited Caregivers could qualify for the credit for  months and wouldnt have to use them consecutively You could take care of your mother for a year get a credit return to work then later get credit if you cared for your father Or your child The bill defines a dependent relative in two ways A child under age   your own child or grandchild niece or nephew or your spouses or domestic partners  qualifies So does an older child or grandchild niece or nephew parent aunt or uncle spouse or partner who is chronically dependent and needs assistance with the activities of daily living The money would come from Social Security Trust Fund This modest increase in benefits to caregivers would not substantially change the funds solvency Ms Lowey said She has enlisted  cosponsors all Democrats and a variety of other supporters unions womens organizations groups representing veterans retirees and people with disabilities Still its hard to picture her steering this bill which is not her first attempt to help secure retirement for caregivers through the current House of Representatives But she has said that shell keep pushing Well keep watching
