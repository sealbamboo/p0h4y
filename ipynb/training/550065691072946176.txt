Health experts have some bad news for high school football players There is no particular type or brand of helmet or mouth guard that will keep you relatively safe from a concussion The companies that make helmets and mouth guards often claim that their own products can reduce players risk of a sportsrelated concussion or lessen the impact of a concussion that does occur These manufacturers cite laboratory research that purports to show one brand is safer than others and a group of researchers wanted to see if they could verify such claims according to a summary of a presentation they made Monday at a national meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics The research team from the University of WisconsinMadison and the Medical College of Wisconsin tracked  high school football players from  schools during the  season Participating players completed a preseason questionnaire about their injury history and demographic information Then as the season progressed athletic trainers from the schools kept tabs on the incidence and severity of any concussions that occurred At the start of the study  of the players  or   told the researchers that they had experienced a sportsrelated concussion in the previous  months During the  football season an additional  concussions were sustained by  players   of the student athletes in the study When the researchers compared the rates of concussions for each type of helmet they found essentially no difference by brand or by year made The rate of concussions for players wearing Riddell helmets the most popular brand in the study was  while the rate for players wearing Schutt helmets was  and the rate for players wearing Xenith helmets was  There was no statistically significant differenceÂ  in those figures the team reported Nor was there any difference in the severity of concussions as measured by the number of days players had to sit out  on average for those wearing Riddell and Xenith helmets and  for players wearing Schutt helmets In addition the concussion rate for helmets made in  or  was  which was statistically indistinguishable from the  rate for helmets made in  and  or the  rate for helmets that were even older than that There was a surprising safety difference when it came to mouth guards The data showed that the  of players who wore specialized mouth guards that were custom fitted by dental professionals or specifically marketed to reduce the risk of sportsrelated concussions were actually  more likely to experience a concussion than the  of players who used generic mouth guards during the  football season The researchers noted that their findings were contrary to manufacturer claims that specific equipment could protect football players from concussions which occur approximately  times per year among high school players in the US Caution is advised when recommending specific preventive equipment based on manufacturer claims of reduced risk they wrote in the   Study leader   an assistant professor in the Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health said the report should make players think twice about the assertions made by equipment companies Despite what manufacturers might claim newer and more expensive equipment may not reduce concussion risk she said in a statement So is it worth the significant extra cost to families and schools She also expressed doubt that any type of equipment could make football perfectly safe for players Properly fitted helmets can reduce the risk of skull fractures and scalp lacerations she said but because the brain is floating freely inside the skull I think most experts doubt whether it is possible to ever develop a helmet design that can prevent concussion and like on Facebook
