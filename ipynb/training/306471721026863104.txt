Dealing Coke to customers called heavy users Selling to teens in an attempt to hook them for life Scientifically tweaking ratios of salt sugar and fat to optimize consumer bliss In his new book   Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Michael Moss goes inside the world of processed and packaged foods Moss begins his tale back in  when a vice president at Kraft addressed a meeting of top executives of Americas biggest food companies His topic the growing public health concerns over the   and the role packaged and processed foods were playing in it Michael Mudd stated his case pleading with his colleagues to pay attention to the health crisis and consider what companies could do to hold themselves accountable According to Moss the first response came from the CEO of General Mills He got up and made some very forceful points from his perspective Moss tells   Dave Davies and his points included this We at General Mills have been responsible not only to consumers but to shareholders We offer products that are lowfat lowsugar have whole grains in them to people who are concerned about eating those products Bottom line being though that we need to ensure that our products taste good because our accountability is also to our shareholders And theres no way we could start downformulating the usage of salt sugar fat if the end result is going to be something that people do not want to eat In   Moss details how those three ingredients became key to the success of processed and packaged foods  and how they are fueling the nationwide obesity epidemic Employing scientists to dissect elements of the palate and tweak ratios of salt sugar and fat to optimize taste the processed food industry Moss says has   on their products the same way the cigarette industry hooked smokers on nicotine Since that meeting in  when executives declined to craft an industrywide standard for more healthful products some companies like Kraft have tackled the issue unilaterally altering recipes to cut down on salt sugar and fat Moss research however indicates that government regulation may be necessary to implement industrywide standards in the interest of public health I was surprised to hear from the former CEO of Philip Morris who is no friend of government no friend of government regulation says Moss to tell me that Look Michael in the case of the processed food industry what youre looking at is a total inability on their part to collectively decide to do the right thing by consumers on the health profile of their products In this case I can see how you might need government regulation if for nothing else than to give the companies cover from the pressure of Wall Street  What they came up with was some science that they had generated that they said showed that kids who ate Frosted MiniWheats for breakfast would be as much as or almost  percent more alert in the classroom which the company translated into better grades for kids  You could almost see parents trying to do the math Well you know Johnny got a C on that test and if we bumped it up by  percent hey hes in an Aminus category That campaign went on for a while until the FTC jumped in and said Hey wait a minute were looking at your study and it doesnt really show anything near that kind of gain and not only that but they werent even looking at other breakfasts to compare to the Frosted MiniWheats Within Coke they referred to their best customers not as you might think  consumers or loyal fans or something like that They became known as heavy users And Coke had a formula  that basically said  percent of the people will use  percent of the product And as Coke saw it it was worth their while more to focus on those  percent using  percent of the product than to try to generate more consumption by the other  percent So the heavy users of soda became those people who were drinking as many as  cans of soda a year sometimes even more The clientele were kids  teenagers  who were going out on their own for the first time with a little bit of change into an environment where they could make the decision about what to buy and for  or  they could go in there and choose a soda or a snack and decide between brands And this was critical to Coke as it is to other companies because those decisions early on especially in the teen years will develop brand loyalties So a child that chooses Pepsi at age  or  is likely to maintain that brand loyalty through the rest of their life As Philip Morris came under pressure for nicotine and cigarettes it eventually started looking at the food divisions in light of the emerging obesity crisis And there were moments in these internal documents where Philip Morris officials were saying to the food division You guys are going to face a problem with salt sugar fat in terms of obesity of the same magnitude if not more than what were facing with nicotine right now And youve got to start thinking about this issue and how youre going to deal with that  They made for me special versions of some of their most iconic products  without any salt in it to show me why they were having trouble cutting back And I have to say it was a godawful experience  starting with CheezIts which normally I could eat all day long The CheezIts without salt stuck to the roof of my mouth and I could barely swallow Then we moved onto frozen waffles which tasted like straw The real moment came in tasting a cereal  I think it was Corn Flakes  which tasted hugely awfully metallic It was almost like a filling had come out of my mouth and it was sloshing around
