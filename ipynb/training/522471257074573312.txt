between Google and the Institute for Systems Biology will make data related to the molecular basis for cancer available for researchers all over the world to peruse and analyze The massive amounts of genetic data forming the   will be migrated to Google Cloud Platform and supercomputing power will be allocated to the project so that anyone in the field can use this powerful resource With Google handling storage and credentials on the new Cancer Genomics Cloud access will be easier to manage and opportunities for using the data will multiply Cancer researchers will be able to analyze and explore entire cohorts of rich genomic data without needing access to a large local compute cluster said CGC prime investigator Ilya Shmulevich The CGC will also facilitate collaborative research by allowing scientists to work on common data sets and projects in a cloud environment The project is funded through a  million grant from the National Cancer Institute
