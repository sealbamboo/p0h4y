Getting rejected activates the same pathways in your brain that get activated when you feel physical pain   participants who received Tylenol acetaminophen and were then asked to recall a painful rejection reported less emotional pain than subjects who received a sugar pill Rejection is so painful that it can even affect your thinking For example being asked to recall a painful rejection was   tests of shortterm memory and tests of decisionmaking    Rejection is assumed to have developed as an early warning mechanism to alert us when we were in danger of being kicked out of our tribe which in our caveman past would have been a death sentence That is also why rejection makes us feel so detached and alone it destabilizes our need to feel that we belong Reflecting on how you felt after a painful experience often leads to the kind of understanding and insight that reduces emotional distress and allows you to move on But when you brood over something youre simply replaying the same thoughts memories or worries over and over gaining no new insights and making yourself more upset and angry Ruminating in such ways can be addictive in that stewing over such memories or thoughts makes them more distressing which in turn makes the urge to brood over them even more compelling These ruminative cycles not only increase your emotional distress in the moment but over time the stress hormones that are released into your bloodstream can put you at increased risk for cardiovascular disease Yes Failure is damaging to your selfesteem because it distorts your perceptions your goals seem out of reach and your capacities seem unequal to the task To prevent your selfesteem from taking a big hit you have to overcome the feelings of helplessness that follow a significant failure Blaming your lack of ability lamenting your bad luck or assuming it was not meant to be will make you feel unnecessarily powerless If you insist on casting blame focus on aspects of the task that were in your control such as your planning and execution Then consider the many ways you can improve your planning become better informed and better prepared invest greater effort and resources along the way and strengthen your willpower which can be done with certain exercises Then try again Guilt is usually a useful emotion as it warns you when your actions or inactions might cause harm to another person thus giving you an opportunity to rethink things or to atone for your wrongdoing  As such guilt is a great relationship protector But when your guilt is excessive or lingering it can do more damage than good it can impair your ability to focus and concentrate or even to enjoy life When people feel guilty after having apologized for their actions its usually because their apology was not strong enough to elicit true forgiveness from the person they harmed People often leave out the most important ingredient required to make an apology effective expressing clear empathy for what the other person felt and went through Once you convey that you truly get how the other person felt and demonstrate a clear understanding of how your actions or inactions affected them they will be much more likely to convey authentic forgiveness and your guilty feelings should ease soon thereafter Positive affirmations such as I am worthy of true love or I will be a great success at work are often ineffective for people with low selfesteem They can even make them feel worse  When statements fall outside the boundaries of peoples established beliefs they reject them If someone feels unlovable affirmations about how worthy of love they are will be rejected by their unconscious minds and only remind them of how unlovable they truly feel People with low selfesteem should use selfaffirmations instead Selfaffirmations are statements that reinforce those qualities and attributes that you believe you already possess such as I would be a loyal caring and supportive partner or Im responsible and motivated and I have a great work ethic Making a list of your best qualities and writing a brief essay about why a specific quality is important and how youve expressed it in the past is a much more effective daily habit for people whose selfesteem is low
