Isata Kallon a nurse at Kenema Hospital in eastern Sierra Leone remembers the day yearold Ibrahim showed up at the Ebola treatment center He was with his mother and two older brothers ages  and  They all had Ebola Ibrahim was especially sick vomiting constantly The chance of survival was very low for him says Kallon whos in her s She sits at a picnic table outside the Ebola ward her hair pulled back with a hairband and her blue nursing scrubs tinged with sweat around the neck She spent much of the next week caring for the family along with dozens of other patients in the makeshift Ebola ward  a large white tent near a sloping hill outside the hospital Each time she entered the unit she would find Ibrahim in a different place I mostly found him lying on the beds of other patients she said She wasnt sure if he was lonely or confused but she had trouble keeping him in his own bed So every time I had to take him give him a bath and dress him up and put him back on his own mattress she said Meanwhile Ibrahims mothers health began to worsen She began vomiting heavily and had severe diarrhea Then roughly seven days after the family had first arrived she passed away Ibrahim and his brothers were still alive in their beds just a few feet away After their mothers body was incinerated the boys began to recover Ibrahim in particular rebounded strongly Two weeks later they were declared Ebolafree and were discharged from the Ebola ward They were temporarily moved to another building within the hospital where a group of roughly  Ebola survivors are living as they wait to go home The boys father who did not contract the disease lives in a town called Port Loko  miles away He knows they are alive but has not been able to make the trip to bring them home in part because public transportation across the country has been shut down or severely limited due to the Ebola outbreak So in the meantime the boys are being fed and looked after by other survivors  including parents who have lost children  and the nurses including Kallon Perhaps because his mother is no longer around yearold Ibrahim has developed a strong attachment to Kallon He comes to the nursing station frequently She often has to send him back because shes busy To Kallons surprise Ibrahim made a very bold statement one day He said he wants me to be his wife Kallon says laughing Her response I accepted she says smiling Now Kallon says young Ibrahim waves to her whenever he sees her When Im passing he calls to me and he goes like this she says blowing a kiss into the air The director of the hospital says Ibrahim and his brothers will soon be transported home free of charge because their father has been unable to retrieve them Kallon says shes happy the boys will be reunited with their father But she admits that she and the other nurses will miss having them around They lighten the mood in a workplace that often feels bleak Ibrahim in particular is a ray of light Kallon says Im going to miss his presence because hes my husband now
