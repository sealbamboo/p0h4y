Just a few months after Harvard University announced a new tougher policy against campus sexual assault a group of Harvard law professors is blasting the rules as unfair Harvard announced its new policy this summer after the school came under federal investigation for being too soft on sexual assault The group of   Harvard has overreacted with rules that are overwhelmingly stacked against the accused and starkly onesided The Harvard policy goes so far that its pretty shocking says Harvard Law professor Janet Halley She says Harvards process at its core is biased because it is run by a single Title IX compliance office thats under pressure to show the government results Its the charging agent like the prosecutor its the investigator  theyre the judge and theyre the people who hear the appeal from all those decisions she says So theyre not neutral Theyre there to increase the number of persons held responsible Halley is also troubled that the policy she says gives alleged victims many more rights and protections than the accused She says it is also too broad in what it considers sexual misconduct The school she argues relies too much on what a victim says is a violation and too little on what a reasonable person might say as federal law requires When you drop the reasonable person requirement then youre saying No its just if the person wakes up the next morning and says the contact was unwelcome well entertain a complaint about that And that squanders the moral authority of sexual harassment law Halley says Harvard officials declined to comment but in a statement defended their process as neutral fair and objective The university says a committee of faculty staff and students is reviewing the policy but it acknowledges that not everyone will agree with its new approach While some feel Harvards new policy goes too far others believe it doesnt go far enough MaryRose Mazzola a student activist says shes troubled by the professors suggestion that the policy is slanted in favor of victims Thats not the feedback that weve heard at all from students she says And thats not a problem that weve seen in the policy A bigger problem is that the policy does not include a stricter definition of consent Mazzola says All accused students would be better protected if Harvard had an affirmative consent policy for sexual activity in which only an explicit yes means consent instead of the old no means no We think that nomeansno approach leaves it open for ambiguity and we want there to be more clarity in the policy specifically saying the yes means yes  she says Harvard is being watched closely by other schools I think we owe these professors a sincere thanks for finally drawing a line in the sand says Anne Neal president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni Neal says most schools are afraid to push back against what she calls the government shakedown that is forcing campuses to enact policies that she says go too far It has effectively put a gun to the heads of our colleges and universities to disregard constitutional rights she says I think these professors are properly saying that we cannot allow our institutions to be taken down an Orwellian path where the Constitution takes a back seat to other considerations John Banzhaf a law professor at George Washington University agrees saying the Harvard protest against its sexual assault policy could mean the pendulum will soon begin swinging back This cant last Banzhaf says I think there already is growing a public backlash against it and like any pendulum once you go past the bottom and you start going in the other direction it does begin to slow down And I think its beginning to slow down What might make the difference is the rapidly growing number of students who say they were unfairly convicted in campus tribunals and are suing universities for millions in damages he says
