Researchers have developed the first breath test for TB in the laboratory It provides rapid information on drug resistance that takes up to six weeks using standard methods US scientists report in the journal   The bacteria emit a unique gas signature within  minutes of exposure to an inhaled antibiotic in rabbits TB infects m people each year worldwide and kills m second only to HIV Early diagnosis and treatment are a priority in the global fight against TB according to the World Health Organization The new research used an inhaled form of isoniazid  an antibiotic commonly used to treat the disease  which is activated by a TB enzyme The test exploits the fact that this enzyme is unique to TB said Dr Graham Timmins Associate Professor at the University of New Mexico US who led the research We realised that we could actually look at the conversion of isoniazid to its active form by monitoring one of the labelled gases thats given off during its activation he explained The researchers gave a special molecularlylabelled form of isoniazid to laboratory rabbits In the presence of TB labelled nitrogen gas was released from the lungs and detected by a machine called a mass spectrometer A positive result indicates that TB bugs are present and suggests they are susceptible to isoniazid TB is very difficult to treat requiring at least six months of treatment with multiple drugs  Failure to complete treatment has contributed to the rise of multidrugresistant TB MDRTB accounting for  of cases in some countries For many years diagnosis of TB relied on a lengthy wait for the bacteria to grow in a culture of the patients sputum  If you do it by culture it can take a month to six weeks before you get a result said Dr Timmins  In the last few years a new DNA detection technique called GeneXpert has been endorsed by the World Health Organization  From a sample of sputum it can detect whether a sample contains TB and whether it is is resistant to one of the key drugs rifampicin in about three hours But for full drug resistance information the patient has to wait longer  Optimally treating somebody the best you can at the time of that single encounter so someone can go home with the right set of tablets would be really really useful said Dr Timmins The new breath test samples the whole lung for what is hoped will be greater sensitivity in a wider range of patients with results available almost instantly Its a clever idea said Dr Ruth McNerney senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  The test could add a bit more certainty to the diagnosis of MDRTB and its worth pursuing definitely she said At present the breath test only detects isoniazid sensitivity It will therefore need to be used in combination with other tests   This is just the start of the program we want to instigate said Dr Timmins  The next step will be to show that the tests work in humans in a clinical setting Lots of good ideas fail when you put them into the clinic conceded Dr Timmins
