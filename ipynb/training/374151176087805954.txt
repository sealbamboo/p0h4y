Measles was declared eliminated in the US more than a decade ago But in recent years the highly infectious disease has cropped up in communities with low vaccination rates most recently in North Texas There  people  the majority of whom have not been immunized  have gotten the disease which began at a vaccineskeptical megachurch The outbreak began when a man who contracted the virus on a recent trip to Indonesia visited the Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark about an hour and a half northwest of Dallas Earlier this week crowds flooded in for regular services Rose Mwangi had her Bible in hand and said shes not worried because I know Jesus is a healer so I know hes covered us with the bloodTheres no place for fear Eagle Mountain is led by pastor Terri Copeland Pearsons the daughter of televangelist Kenneth Copeland Church leaders wouldnt grant interviews but Pearsons released a statement after the outbreak saying she isnt antivaccine But Pearsons added that she still has some reservations about vaccines The concerns we have had are primarily with very young children who have family history of autism and with bundling too many immunizations at one time she said Pearsons set up vaccination clinics on church property but at the same time when she preaches to her congregates the message is for them to put their faith in God So Im going to tell you what the facts are and the facts are the facts but then we know the truth That always overcomes facts she has said The church has a vast ministry with international reach Founder Kenneth Copeland has spoken against vaccines in the past In a  broadcast Copeland expressed shock at the number of vaccines recommended for his grandchild You dont take the word of the guy thats trying to give the shot about whats good and what isnt he said Most of the Eagle Mountain parishioners  and all of the children  who came down with measles had never been vaccinated Dr Jason Terk an infectious disease specialist in North Texas says such communities can spread a disease quickly This is a good example unfortunately of how birds of a feather flock together Terk says If you have individuals who are vaccinehesitant or vaccinehostile they congregate together and that creates its own unique situation where a population of individuals is susceptible to getting the very disease that they decided they dont want to protect themselves from Measles is spread by sneezing coughing and close personal contact Its one of the most contagious diseases The vaccine is extremely effective Before it was introduced in the s nearly everyone got the red rash Today most doctors have never even seen a case of the measles But in the last few years there have been pockets of those who choose not to vaccinate their children When that decisions been made its been made on bad information says Dr Paul Offit one of the countrys leading vaccine researchers at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Typically its the fear that the combination measlesmumpsrubella or MMR vaccine may have in some way contributed to the epidemic of autism  which has clearly been shown not to be true in study after study Offit says He says those who choose to skip vaccines cause serious ripple effects There are hundreds of thousands of people in the United States who cant get vaccinated because theyre undergoing medical treatment or are too young for example They depend on those around them to be vaccinated and I think when you make a choice not to vaccinate yourself or your children it is a selfish illfounded choice that only can possibly hurt you or those who come in contact with you Already this year the US has had more than twice as many reports of measles than in all of  when there were only  cases  and none in Texas according to the Texas Department of State Health Services
