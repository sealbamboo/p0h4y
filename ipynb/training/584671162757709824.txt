Researchers have finally answered one of the most compelling questions in the field of medicine What is a normal size for a penis The answer according to anatomically precise measurements of up to  men from around the world is  inches  centimeters in the resting state and  inches  centimeters when erect These average lengths are just two of the findings   in BJU International the official journal of the British Assn of Urological Surgeons and a handful of other medical societies But before we move on to more of their results lets pause for another question Why should anyone spend any amount of time trying to figure this out The research team  from Kings College London Kings College NHS Foundation Trust and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust  offered several reasons A scientifically validated answer may help doctors reassure men with conditions like  or   who suffer considerable distress due to the size of their organ It could also help manufacturers design better condoms with lower failure rates So the group conducted an exhaustive search for published studies with reliable assessments of penile length and girth To qualify studies had to include  or more male volunteers who were at least  years old Wouldbe participants were excluded if they suffered from erectile dysfunction or had any physical abnormalities including implants Only studies with careful measurements taken by health professionals were included in the analysis The researchers wound up with  studies that evaluated thousands of men They assumed that if they plotted all the measurements the distribution of penis sizes would fall along a   Then they used that to come up with charts that displayed length and girth by percentile It takes  inches from the root of the penis to the tip of the glans to hit the   percentile for flaccid length That means  of men measure between  and  inches and  are in the  to inch range Furthermore with an average length of  inches for an erect penis  of men measure between  and  inches and  are in the  and inch range The average circumference or girth of a resting penis is  inches  cm for an erect penis its  inches  cm Their investigation presented an opportunity for the researchers to test the validity of the folklore surrounding penis size They found no convincing support in the data for the idea that penis size is correlated with the length of ones index finger or the ratio of the length of the second and fourth fingers Nor was there any good evidence that foot size was a predictor of penis size Age body mass index and testicular volume were also unrelated However the data did show that height offered some predictive value for estimating penis length The correlation was weak but statistically significant according to the study The overwhelming majority of men included in the analysis were Caucasian or Middle Eastern and only a few hundred were of African or Asian descent That made it impossible to draw any conclusions about any differences in penile size across different races the researchers wrote Despite the large number of men included in the study the researchers said their results might be biased if wellendowed men were more inclined to be measured They also acknowledged that the findings  though intended to provide reassurance to most people  could prompt up to half of all men to feel defective or abnormal upon learning that their measurements are below average If so a    from the journal Psychology of Men  Masculinity might make some of them feel better After surveying more than  people researchers from UCLA and CSULA found that while  of men wished they had a larger penis  of women thought their partners organs were just fine
