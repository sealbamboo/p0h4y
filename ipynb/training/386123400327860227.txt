Because of that confusion surrounds breast cancer screening In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month I decided to tackle some of the most common questions  The answer is twofold  It is easier to see a cancer in mammograms of older women and older women are more likely to have cancer   When the radiologist reads a mammogram or Xray of the breast cancer appears white Young breasts have more dense tissue compared to older breasts a dense breast appears white on mammogram So in younger women the radiologist is looking for white on a white background   The aging of the breast slowly turns its Xray appearance from white to black In the breast of a  or yearold woman the radiologist is looking for white on a black background For women in their s the background can range from whitish to grayish depending on the density of the individuals breasts A mass seen on a mammogram done on an older woman is also more likely to be cancer than one found in a younger woman One in every  women will develop breast cancer in their s compared to one in  women in their s So a mass found in a younger woman may not have an effect on saving her life In fact it could do the opposite if unnecessary treatment is performed  Mammography screening is not very effective in women between the ages of  and  and only moderately effective in women aged  to    It is estimated through mathematical modeling that regular screening of a woman between ages  and  will decrease her risk of breast cancer death by about   In comparison clinical trials show that screening reduces risk of death by  to  in women aged  to  It is estimated that  women will have to undergo an annual mammogram in order to save one life  A substantial number of these women by some estimates more than half will have an abnormal screen during that decade These abnormal screens require additional testing and inconvenience This of course also causes a lot of fear and worry Most of those abnormalities will turn out to be clinically insignificant One harmful effect of screening women aged  to  is that some women have such a bad experience with callbacks for reevaluation that they stop getting screened and even refuse screening when they are in their s and s when mammography is a more useful test Some organizations recommend screening every other year versus every year There are data to suggest that everytwoyear screening saves almost as many lives about  to  as everyyear screening but the number of false positives is halved  While most American organizations recommend annual highquality screening beginning at age  a few recommend routine mammography start at age   Even these organizations say that women who are very concerned about breast cancer and want to start earlier can do so The choice is yours But as you make that choice know the limitations of mammographic screening   It is a fact that highquality breast screening will find some abnormalities that after extensive evaluation turn out not to be cancer Highquality evaluation will miss some cancers This is especially true in younger women and can be true even in older women with denser breasts A small number of women will develop breast cancer before the age of  No organization recommends mammography for averagerisk women under     Women without a family history and with average risk should receive a clinical breast examination with their regular gynecologic examination They should also be aware of their bodies and get medical assistance if they detect a change in their breast  Those who have a family history of early breast cancers should consult a physician with expertise in breast cancer Some of these women will be candidates for screening using magnetic resonance imaging
