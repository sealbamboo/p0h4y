In order to slow the spread of HIV certain people who do not have the virus but are at risk should take medicine to   becoming infected Thats the recommendation of the   and just recently the   The preventive treatment is known as PrEP for preexposure prophylaxis Eric McCulley made the decision to start PrEP Hes  gay and HIVnegative Outside an Atlanta coffee shop he pulls out a plastic baggy with a few blue pills Theyre a decent size actually he says Some people might call them a horse pill The pill is called   a combination of two drugs used to treat HIV Despite McCulleys negative HIV status hes taken the pill daily for the past few months After hearing about the treatment and doing extensive research on his own McCulley made an appointment with his primary care doctor earlier this year He was very supportive about it He encouraged me to do it he says He gave me a lot of stuff to read gave me a lot of stuff to think about and told me I was a good candidate for it So off we went So far McCulley says the only change the drug has made in his life is in his attitude I have what I was looking for I have peace of mind I feel like Ive taken responsibility for my health he says But some PrEP users worry that not everybody in the medical community is up to speed Although Truvada has been on the market for a decade   have prescribing guidelines been available Dylan West is a yearold Atlanta resident and works in international aid He is also gay and recently found out firsthand that not every doctor is as familiar with PrEP as McCulleys is Some gastrointestinal problems recently landed West in the emergency department Hed started PrEP after beginning a relationship with someone whos HIVpositive One of the doctors in the emergency room noticed that West listed Truvada as a medication he regularly takes She immediately without asking any questions just said Well we should probably test for gonorrhea syphilis HIVAIDS  the list  he says West thinks that physician made a rash assumption about his sexual practices because he was on Truvada West knew stigma was something he might face Some people within the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender communities have gone as far as to label those on PrEP as Truvada whores The assumption being youre on Truvada so you probably run around having sex with whoever you can he explains  says shes heard that before Shes the principal investigator of the   and has long worked in HIV research She has encountered reluctance from some to prescribe PrEP because of lack of knowledge about it This is an interesting thing to me she says because doctors who say I dont want to prescribe PrEP to somebody who might be at risk for HIV because they might not use condoms  you know its an approach we wouldnt take in other areas of medicine Thompson says no doctor would refuse to prescribe cholesterollowering statins to patients because theyre overweight Somehow the conversation around PrEP is different So I think its a very interesting moralistic attitude that soon will be outdated But I do think that this is a barrier for some patients Thompson says They feel stigmatized And honestly health care providers need to step up their game and do better than that A CDC spokeswoman said via email that lack of awareness and knowledge among health care providers is one of the primary challenges to PrEPs success But both Thompson and CDC officials hope the new treatment guidelines will help overcome any barriers
