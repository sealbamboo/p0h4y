A small trial set out to explore the effect of dietary flavanols on the dentate gyrus a structure in that brains hippocampal region that plays a critical role in certain kinds of memory The dentate gyrus becomes notably less active and less effective with normal aging A test drink that concentrated about  milligrams of flavanols was produced by the Mars company maker of a wide range of chocolate candies Nineteen subjects between the ages of  and  drank the test drink daily for three months while  drank a beverage containing only  milligrams of the cocoaderived flavanols Upon recruitment and at three months both groups had their brains scanned and performed a memory test assessing a distinctive form of memory for novel shapes and patternsan assessment that tests the dentate gyrus The research was led by Adam M Brickman of Columbia University Medical Centers   for Research on Alzheimers Disease and the Aging Brain and builds on research by Dr Scott A Small at the Taub Institute It was published this week in   After three months the group that got the supercharged flavanol drink showed greatly improved performance on the test of memory while the lowflavanol group showed no such improvement Researchers separate scans of youthful subjects aged  to  had shown two things that better blood flow to the dentate gyrus is linked to better performance on the test of memory for novel patterns and that along with memory performance blood flow to that region ebbs with age In the older experimental subjects the scans showed that compared with those who drank the lowflavanol drink those who got the highoctane flavanol beverage had notably improved blood flow in the dentate gyrus after three months The researchers emphasized that consuming chocolate in an effort to take in epicatechins would not be recommended the processing of cocoa beans in the confectionery process typically strips most chocolate candy of those phytonutrients And getting  milligrams of epicatechin from any flavanolrich food would be impractical The study was designed also to test whether aerobic exercise either alone or in combination with flavanols improved memory performance and blood flow to the dentate gyrus in these older subjects While researchers had earlier found strong evidence that aerobic exercise improves cognitive performance in younger subjects the current study found no such effect in the toyearold subjects Epicatechin is a flavanol found plentifully in tea wine and some fruits and vegetables as well as in cocoa beans The flavanols in cocoa beans are routinely destroyed by the high heat used in processing cocoa beans to make chocolate But   a research and development company owned by Mars Inc has developed a process by which the cocoa beans flavanols are captured and retained The research was funded in part by Mars which has an interest in exploring the health effects cocoabased catechins The National Institutes of Health and two foundations that support brain research also underwrote the research The precise formulation used in this study has also been shown to improve cardiovascular health Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston recently launched a large study underwritten by NIH to see whether flavanols can help prevent heart attacks and strokes in older men and women
