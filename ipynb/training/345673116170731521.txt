The newlywed had been grappling with excruciatingly painful periods for as long as she could remember when her doctor told her one way she could end the agony was a hysterectomy Michelle Zarick then  didnt question it when the doctor wanted to use the latest hightech option that medicine had to offer a hysterectomy done with the help of a robot She mentioned that doing the roboticassisted hysterectomy would shorten my recovery time at home says Zarick who had been diagnosed with fibroids noncancerous tumors that grow in the uterine walls  So Zarick agreed  and initially everything seemed fine But in the weeks after the  procedure she suffered a horrifying complication that is still impacting her life Across the country nearly  roboticassisted surgeries were performed last year according to Intuitive Surgical the company that makes the robots Use of the machine for performing hysterectomies is on the rise increasing from  in  to  percent in  according to a study published in   Besides gynecological surgeries the da Vinci can deftly perform procedures like heart surgeries colorectal surgery plus treatments for prostate kidney lung throat and bladder cancers among others  The majority of the hundreds of thousands of robotic surgeries performed in the US each year are done safely However as use of the machine increases so are reports of injuries The US Food and Drug administration has received more than  reports since  of burns cuts and infections  including  deaths  after robotic surgery  The robotic surgery works like this The patient is on the operating table while the doctor sits a few feet away at a console where he or she can manipulate the robotic arms while watching the procedure through a D viewfinder Many surgeons say the robot called the da Vinci makes it easier to see and navigate to hardtoreach places plus the robotassisted surgery makes small incisions and causes minimal bleeding leaving minimal scars and speeding postsurgery recovery time But critics of the da Vinci worry that the hightech futuristic factor is driving the decision to use the robots despite the fact that  has shown that for a hysterectomy roboticassisted surgery doesnt lower complication rates for patients when compared to other surgical procedures and can cost about  more The first few days after Zaricks surgery she felt OK she told Rock Centers Dr Nancy Snyderman chief medical editor of NBC News But five weeks after her hysterectomy in February  the unimaginable happened Theres no delicate way to put this Her intestines fell out of her vagina I felt like I had to have a bowel movement and  as I was bearing down  I felt something kind of pop inside me says Zarick who looked down and saw her intestines where they were absolutely not supposed to be I knew that the situation that I was in at that moment was dire  When a hysterectomy is done after the uterus and cervix are removed surgeons suture the vagina at the top where the cervix used to be In Zaricks case that seal reopened and her intestines spilled out Its rare both in cases of robotic and nonrobotic surgery But published reports of this happening after robotic surgery are increasing Researchers   how often it happens  At the hospital surgeons were able to repair the damage though Zarick was left with a large abdominal scar  and lasting damage to her physical relationship with her husband of less than a year Ryan she told Rock Center Afterwards I felt like a monster I mean just the way that the scars and my abdomen looked she said Zarick has filed a lawsuit against Intuitive her case is one of more than a dozen filed in the last two years The FDA is looking into the issue to determine whether the growing number of injuries reported is simply because more robotic surgeries are being done or if theyre being caused by the machine itself or by the surgeons who critics argue may be given inadequate training  Catherine Mohr the director of medical research at Intuitive described the training process to Rock Center The company requires surgeons to take online training to learn da Vincispecific terms  like remote center  that wouldnt be found in traditional operating rooms Surgeons must also practice the robotic surgery at Intuitive in Sunnyvale Calif initially on an inanimate object learning how to move the arms around and generally familiarizing themselves with the machine After that they practice on a cadaver or an animal making the robotic arms move through surgical steps like dissection and sewing  So theyre taught all the steps  everything that when put together makes up a surgery like a hysterectomy But in Intuitives training environment a surgeon would not do a practice hysterectomy something that worries critics of the da Vinci who fear doctors arent thoroughly trained on the device before using it with actual patients  What youre not taught is how to actually do that hysterectomy because that is something that is part of the surgical training Mohr told Rock Center She later adds If you know how to do all of those surgical subtasks putting them in the correct order on a hysterectomy is something that you would know how to do as a surgeon After the practice surgery on the cadaver or animal Intuitive gives the surgeon a certificate of training completion The hospital then has to make the decision of whether they are going to grant them operating privileges and what additional supervision observed cases or other things that they need to do before theyre allowed to operate solo Mohr told Rock Center  In other words Should surgeons do three supervised surgeries with the da Vinci before going it alone Or  or  Its up to the credentialing committee at the hospital Mohr says something some critics of the da Vinci take issue with  So the real question is  is it still safe In the hands of a good surgeon yes Dr Marty Makary a surgeon at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore told Rock Center In the hands of someone who may not have the advanced skill sets it could be a real danger  Additionally Makary points out that while the da Vinci certainly brings a certain wow factor it hasnt been proven to be any better at reducing complications for patients than existing surgical techniques Weve got great stateoftheart minimally invasive techniques that have worked for years sometimes decades that are now being replaced with more expensive robotic technology without a benefit to the patients Makary said  For example surgeons can remove the uterus through the vagina a procedure that may sound off putting but is actually minimally invasive and speeds up the patients recovery time Zarick told Rock Center her doctor briefly discussed this option with her but were much more excitable about the da Vinci And according to the JAMA study the robotic surgery did not reduce complication rates for hysterectomy patients when compared to existing techniques  that report found that robotic surgery did not reduce complications for hysterectomy cases But it did add about  to the cost of each surgery In a statement issued to Rock Center Dr Myriam J Curet chief medical advisor Intuitive Surgical said Over the past decade more than  million da Vinci surgeries have been performed in major clinical centers around the world A study of nearly  patients from the nationwide inpatient sample Trinh QD et al European Urology  demonstrated that patients undergoing a da Vinci prostatectomy are less likely to receive a blood transfusion to experience complications both intraoperative and postoperative and to experience a prolonged hospital stay A  metaanalysis published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology found that compared with traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy roboticassisted laparoscopic hysterectomy was associated with shorter length of stay and fewer postoperative complications and conversions to laparotomy open incision As with any surgery da Vinci Surgery is not without risk Curet continued in the statement The da Vinci Surgical System is an advanced tool and should not be a substitute for the training experience and surgical judgment of the surgeon with respect to how a particular surgery should be performed In March the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists   on robotic surgery for hysterectomies cautioning surgeons of the importance of separating the marketing hype from the reality when considering the best surgical approach for hysterectomies As Makary told Rock Center The robot is a technical tourdeforce but I think patients need to know that for some procedures theres no benefit Annual sales of the da Vinci have increased  percent in the last decade as CNBC has reported and a robot can cost a hospital as much as  million  meaning pressure builds for doctors to use them for as many surgeries as possible in order for the hospital to make up for that cost It can take quite a long time especially if youre a smaller hospital that doesnt do as many procedures says journalist Herb Greenberg whos extensively reported on the da Vinci for CNBC Again thats whats remarkable when we look at the story This was sold originally to major medical centers major clinics and now its filtering down to community hospitals  In Zaricks case Intuitive has denied all allegations that her complications were caused by the da Vinci Mohr declined to comment on Zaricks lawsuit  For years Zarick says shes carried the weight of her story and the impact its had on her physical relationship with her husband Ryan Somehow her horrific injury and all that followed felt like something she brought on herself by choosing a new type of procedure she says even though she knows thats not a rational thought But with her husbands support  and therapy  shes beginning to realize all of this was not her fault  Im starting to see that now Im starting to see it Im starting to believe it Zarick says Im starting to understand and Im grateful  that Ive always had his support He never let me down
