Good health is priceless but autism spectrum disorders can be very expensive A new study estimates that the lifetime cost of being diagnosed with autism in the United States is somewhere between  million and  million Either of those totals is enough to give most people sticker shock The figure at the low end of the range is for people on the autism spectrum who dont have intellectual disabilities The higher tally is for people who do according to   published Monday by the journal JAMA Pediatrics To put it into perspective  million is more than enough to   without any scholarships grants or other discounts or to   via Virgin Galactic For  million you could buy   in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills When it comes to autism expenses what that money buys depends on the age of the person with the diagnosis For children it pays for specialeducation services the researchers found These include   for children under the age of  that can put them on a trajectory for a more successful life Another big chunk of money represents the lost productivity of parents who care for children with autism For adults the biggest costs were tied to living expenses especially in facilities that require lots of staff That was followed by medical expenses and the lost productivity of people on the autism spectrum The study authors relied on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate that there are  Americans with some form of autism Assuming that  of them have an intellectual disability the total cost of autism in the US is on the order of  billion per year If the proportion of people with an intellectual disability is more like  the total annual cost jumps to  billion Thats more than the US Treasury paid in   in the entire fiscal year that ended on Sept   The study also tallied the expenses for people with autism in Britain Even though both countries have different approaches to healthcare provision the total costs were remarkably similar the researchers wrote These are huge sums of money and its time for people to start thinking in a different way according to a pair of experts from the AJ Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University in Philadelphia Instead of focusing on the costs of helping needy people the outlays should be seen as investments in building stronger communities they wrote in   that accompanied the study Adopting an investment perspective also means taking a long view on life course outcomes they wrote We need a   for autism spectrum disorders especially to track risks and outcomes into middle and later adulthood
