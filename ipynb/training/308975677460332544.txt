When it comes to the state of the nations health the US seems to get one poor grade after another Despite spending more on health care weve been slipping behind other highincome countries for life expectancy and healthy living But when you drill down into the data and look at some specific diseases there are areas where the US isnt doing too badly at all scientists from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation   Monday The US tops the list at treating brain cancers and ranks third for colorectal cancer when compared to  other highincome countries Were also doing better than average for strokes falls stomach cancer and   Start with the simplest metric of health  death rates  and the US does rather poorly compared to Western Europe Canada New Zealand and Australia says   director of IHME and a professor at the University of Washington But weve made a lot of progress in some of the cancers because of the aggressive treatments we do here he tells Shots For many other diseases though the US still has a lot of catching up to do When compared with European countries that spend quite a bit on health care the US fares worse than average for domestic violence drug abuse and selfharm And Greece is the only place in Western Europe with more deaths from road crashes than the US We rank nearly at the bottom for stopping some heart and lung diseases diabetes and kidney problems This cluster of illnesses Murray says is largely the consequence of Americans biggest risk factors poor diet smoking and high blood pressure Last December Murray and his team compiled a mammoth   of  causes of deaths worldwide and  risk factors for various illnesses in  Their latest report   Monday takes a look country by country To help make sense of all these numbers theyve built some nifty tools for   You can compare disease prevalence and risk factors for each country and region You can even zero in on dietary choices such as average salt intake and   for each country When you put all components of diet together the US is worse than all countries in Europe Murray says But the UK comes close to us High blood pressure is still a major problem here he says but its not dramatically worse than in many parts of Europe including those countries that we associate with the   Take a place like Spain Its burden of high blood pressure is about equal to that in the US for women Murray says Thats probably because of their high consumption of processed meat Europe also shares the USs biggest cause of disability back pain In fact lower back pain was the leading cause of disability globally in  with depression coming in second Anxiety ranks in the top  everywhere in the world except Eastern Europe and East Asia while Alzheimers disease and dementia have surged across highincome countries in the past decade The medical profession hasnt been very successful at coming up with solutions and treatments for mental disorders and musculoskeletal disorders Murray says We havent had any major breakthroughs for these like we have for cardiovascular disease This IHME work was sponsored by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation which also supports NPR Other interesting patterns emerge when you look at regional levels Murray says For instance theres a homicide belt that runs from Guatemala down to Brazil in which murder is the dominant cause of death for men and a suicide belt cuts through Southeast Asia to China which primarily involves woman Theres always all these twists and turns to public health Murray says Thats why its so important to have the risks and causes of deaths at the country level
