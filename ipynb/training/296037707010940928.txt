 A new stemcell technology that transforms patient skin cells into heart cells allowed scientists to mimic a rare   paving the way for the development of possible new treatments according to a new paper published in   The rare condition called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasiacardiomyopathy or ARVDC is a genetic heart defect that disrupts normal heartbeat rhythm and timing Deterioration of the heart muscle can then bring on heart failure and according to researchers at the   is a leading cause of   Patients usually show no symptoms until their twenties making ARVDC particularly challenging to diagnose and treat But usingÂ  technology developed by  Nobel Medicine Prize winner Shinya Yamanaka MD researchers took skin samples from adults with ARVDC and developed ARVDClike heart cells in a laboratory Researchers at SanfordBurnham Medical Research Institute and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore collected skin samples from adult ARVDC patients They added molecules to reverse the development of these adult skin cells to their embryotic stage manipulating them to produce an unlimited supply of heart muscle cells In these young patientspecific heart muscle cells researchers overactivated a protein called PPARg which triggered the heart muscle cells to behave like sick heart cells similar to those in patients with ARVDC Its tough to demonstrate that a diseaseinadish model is clinically relevant for an adultonset disease But we made a key finding here  we can recapitulate the defects in this disease only when we induce adultlike metabolism This is an important breakthrough considering that ARVDC symptoms usually dont arise until young adulthood Yet the stem cells were working with are embryonic in nature said HueiSheng Vincent Chen MD PhD associate professor at SanfordBurnham and senior author of the study in a press release While theres currently no way to   researchers are optimistic that further experimentation will help them solve mysteries about this often fatal condition Chen hopes to start preclinical trials with replicated heart cells this time testing drugs on the cells With this new model we hope we are now on a path to develop better therapies for this lifethreatening disease said Daniel Judge MD a cardiologist ARVDC expert and medical director of the Center for Inherited Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in a press release
