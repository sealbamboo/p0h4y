Im bummed that the green coffee weightloss cure touted by Dr Oz doesnt work It could have been the perfect painless antidote to my habit of lying on the sofa eating Russian chocolate But the one flimsy bit of research that suggested that green coffee extract might speed weight loss was   putting an end to a supplement saga that made serious coin for the purveyors of the stuff  and got the telegenic heart surgeon scolded by Congress in June for promoting snake oil Now theres nary a mention of green coffee extract to be found on the   But if its adios green coffee extract its hello to the next dubious cure on that site and so many others Enzymes are big   are being hawked online The Federal Trade Commission recently forced manufacturers to reimburse  million to customers who bought   that allegedly melted fat And the Food and Drug Administrations evergrowing   also includes phony treatments for diabetes autism and concussion If Id succumbed to Dr Ozs promises I would have been out some bucks but probably not harmed Many fake cures not only distract people from getting effective care they can be dangerous Fraudsters typically   who are overweight have a serious disease like cancer or something without a cure like arthritis multiple sclerosis or HIVAIDS Heres how to market your own dubious cure or avoid them with a hat tip to the   and   Most people rely on experts to summarize the science for them which they should says   a researcher in computational biology at Johns Hopkins University who tracks supplement hype Dr Oz puts himself out there as one of those people but unfortunately hes just a terrible scientist Most people assume that medical doctors like Oz know their way around research Salzberg told me but thats not always the case Unfortunately he believes stuff thats just wrong So whats a person in search of a miracle to do Be skeptical Salzberg says always be skeptical When someones selling you something ask Well whats in it for them For Oz it may be that its much more satisfying to talk about miracles than it is to admit the less glamorous part of health There is no miracle weightloss cure Salzberg says The way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories But nobody wants to hear that If he went on his show every day and said Eat less nobody would watch
