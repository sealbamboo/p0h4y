A pretty young woman was sitting in the examining room with her right forefinger stretched out on the table for inspection I had never seen her before but at first glance she looked fine and so did the finger An hour later  no exaggeration  it had become clear that the finger would recover but the patient was an insoluble mess She was a devoutly religious something in the city on a church mission from her rural home She had been volunteering at a dropin center for the homeless helping to prepare dinner when she felt a sting in the tip of the finger and looked down to see a red mark and a dot of blood She could not find the object that had poked her but she knew immediately what might have happened She had seen a few used syringes lying around the place and perhaps one had somehow gotten into the sink and perhaps she had stuck her finger with it and perhaps it had just been used by an  infected addict and perhaps right that minute the virus was coursing through her own veins So of course she went to the nearest emergency room She knew that medication taken promptly could prevent HIV and she wasnt taking any chances It turns out that she had been down this path before often seeking out HIV testing and prevention just in case She admitted to me that she might have a little bit of a   given the absence of any standard risk factors in her life Unfortunately though when she hit the emergency room at the height of the evening rush they didnt probe her psycheÂ  Instead they just did for her what they do for all started treatment for the worstcase scenario with a few days worth of pills and sent her off to an expert to sort it all out and decide whether to continue the prescription As my other scheduled patients piled up in the waiting room she and I went over the story again and again There might have been a scratch on the finger but it was clear that there had been no syringe nowhere but in her terrified imagination The more I reassured her the more distraught she grew sobbing wildly pleading for a prescription for her pills to complete the monthlong course of prevention The ghost of Blaise Pascal slowly materialized in the far corner of the room He spends so much time there I should get him a hospital ID tag B Pascal Resident Philosophy More than Hippocrates and the usual crowd it is Pascal who might be said to inspire a great deal of modern medical thinking  and not always necessarily for the best Back in the th century Pascal enunciated his famous wager arguing that in the absence of hard evidence it makes far more sense to believe in God than not to believe If there is a God unbelievers stand to suffer mightily in the next life If there is no God believers will come to no harm Better to minimize your upcoming eons in hellfire and believe A   pointed out that doctors might be tempted to use similar reasoning in patient care consciously or unconsciously favoring a worstcase scenario to minimize future trouble Say a patient is very sick and the prognosis is unclear The doctor who confidently predicts recovery will look incompetent if the patient dies The words of the doctor who predicts death though will be overlooked in the general celebration should the patient recover Hanging crepe with the family of a sick patient is a Pascalian stance that minimizes future unpleasantness Those instincts often surface in the rest of medical care when reason and evidence fail us  and even when they dont Think of all the treatments scans and biopsies that are possibly probably almost certainly or absolutely completely utterly unnecessary All are done for fear of great future harm to our patients and our reputations alike even when no chance of such harm exists Oh chrie go ahead give her the pills Pascal said in that elegant accent of his He had said exactly the same thing to the ER doctor a few days before Cut your losses and the ridiculous amount of time this is taking Shell be happy the pills wont hurt her Think how terrible it would be if she actually has been exposed to HIV Youd be in big big trouble then Pascal is always so convincing and very difficult to ignore This time though I just couldnt buy it There was no chance she had been stuck with a needle The pills were unlikely to harm her physically but honoring her irrational fears would certainly do her no good Suppose she really does have an HIV risk and shes just not telling you Pascal hissed Suppose this is all a weird ruse Think of the really major trouble youre going to be in then Of the hundreds of decisions I make in a week not one comes without a fear of an unlikely what if Often I cave It was ridiculously difficult to stand firm to willfully ignore all the variations on future trouble that Pascal is always so helpful in detailing I sent her off without the medication still sniffling back to her psychotherapist at home Pascal vanished in a huff But hell be back
