For years a Utah garage concealed a grisly secret the bodies of seven babies strangled or suffocated and placed in boxes Authorities say Megan Huntsman    six of her children wrapped their bodies in towels or shirts and then put them in plastic bags before entombing them in the garage What they may never know is why In most cases of infanticide women kill a single newborn often after an unexpected pregnancy said Dr Neill Epperson an associate professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Center for Womens Behavioral Wellness There are women who dont even recognize they are pregnant and panic or have an extreme psychological reaction when all of a sudden they give birth Epperson said People react differently Some cry out for help Others might dissociate and go on autopilot Others might give birth and think the baby is dead Those women generally dont do it again I dont even want to guess why someone might have done it six times This sounds like a serial pattern Epperson said Huntsman was arrested Sunday on six counts of murder and is being held on  million bail Authorities said a seventh baby appears to have been stillborn Its unclear how she concealed so many pregnancies from her estranged husband and three older daughters  a teenager and two adults Huntsman certainly wouldnt be the first convicted of serial infanticide Though rare it happens all over the globe In  Dominque Cottrez  a woman from VillersauTertre France admitted to   In the same year another French woman Celene Lesage  was sentenced to  years in prison after police discovered the corpses of six infants shed murdered hidden in a cellar In the United States Marybeth Tinning who is now  was sentenced in  to  years to life after being convicted of smothering her monthold daughter Though Tinning was also suspected in the deaths of six of her other children she was never tried or convicted for those deaths We dont know much about serial baby killers in part because they are so rare said Nancy KaserBoyd a forensic psychologist who is on the expert psychiatric panel for Los Angeles County Six times is totally different from a onetime event KaserBoyd said Frankly it could be someone who is not high functioning who is not careful about pregnancy and then when the baby comes is not motivated to do anything like file for adoption or anything like that In several cases of serial infanticide the mothers have had children that were allowed to live Its not clear why some babies were killed and others not Epperson drew a distinction between serial baby killers and women like   who drowned her five children in a bathtub in a single day Though Yates was initially convicted of murder on retrial a jury found her not guilty due to insanity She had a wellknown psychotic disorder and had been in treatment long before it happened Epperson said There was clear evidence of major mental health problems I do want to be clear though that there are a lot of women with mental health problems who are fine parents and a lot of people who are terrible parents who dont have any mental health problems So could a woman like Huntsman have been suffering from psychosis each time she killed a child Andrea Yates was obviously in the midst of a psychotic episode Epperson said But to have six psychotic episodes    Still psychologist Diane Sanford believes postpartum depression can play a role even in cases where there are serial infant murders These women arent well said Sanford a postpartum expert and coauthor of Life Will Never Be the Same A Real Moms Postpartum Survival Guide Theyre psychotic and probably delusional and if they dont get treatment they continue to be ill and then during pregnancy and postpartum their hormones make them vulnerable to an intensification of their already existing illness So these kinds of tragedies occur Sanford interviewed a woman Paula Sims who drowned two infant daughters Although she originally blamed an intruder It was pretty clear to me that she suffered from postpartum psychosis on each occasion and didnt get the treatment she needed If you have postpartum psychosis and are delusional and your thinking improves enough between episodes  it could happen Sanford said Huntsman should also be evaluated for psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia KaserBoyd said If I were asked to do a forensic evaluation on this woman I would look for a history of special education placement developmental disability a history of being a victim of child abuse KaserBoyd said I would look at what her world was like Does she have any support
