When essayist Eula Biss was pregnant with her son she decided she wanted to do just a bit of research into vaccination I thought I would do a small amount of research to answer some questions that had come up for me she tells NPRs Audie Cornish And the questions just got bigger the more I learned and the more I read In the US vaccination rates are high for measles mumps and rubella the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about  percent of infants receive vaccinations The vaccination of children born between  and  will prevent  million illnesses according to the CDC But resistance to vaccination has existed nearly as long as vaccination itself And Biss found that questions about vaccination were also questions about environmentalism citizenship and trust in the government Biss traces some of this history in a series of essays called  In writing this book I became very wary of the idea of a middle ground What I saw when I was doing research is that in pursuit of a middle ground people will kind of split the difference between the two extremes that theyre hearing And I think whats problematic is that people are seeing vaccinating on schedule on time as an extreme position So theyre splitting the difference between that and the other extreme  which is not vaccinating at all  and doing partial or spacedout vaccinations And Im not actually convinced that thats a viable middle ground Theres a great blog    and one of the writers on that blog pointed out that when you split the difference between information and misinformation you still end up with misinformation So I think there are situations where a middle ground is not desirable Though Im the kind of thinker whos very drawn to compromises and to nuances I think in this particular area the position that is sometimes seen as extreme  which is vaccinating a child fully and on time  Ive come to believe is not an extreme position I think that protecting children at the age where theyre most vulnerable against diseases that are highly contagious is prudent I think theyre working very hard and I think there are some great minds going at it But I think that sometimes what the medical community is doing is too limited And I dont think thats necessarily their fault Theyre often addressing medical questions And I dont think that this debate is always a medical debate  I think its actually often not a medical debate I think its often a social debate And I think that peoples resistance to vaccination isnt going to disappear until we address some of the nonmedical reasons for that resistance and peoples discomfort and distrust of the government Thats bigger than what most medical professionals can handle This isnt the only country where you see that causing a problem There are countries where its a much bigger problem and those tend to be countries where the political situation is much worse than it is here Nigeria and Pakistan are two countries that have had a lot of trouble with polio And part of the reason is that theres a lot of political unrest and people really distrust what the government is doing That has an effect on peoples health and it has an effect on the health of children And so this is one more reason for us to be invested in good political systems because its a public health concern There are so many different reasons people dont vaccinate that Im not even sure it can be looked at as a cohesive movement Some people have concerns that are really healthbased and some people are resisting capitalism when they resist vaccination Some people are resisting what they feel is the corrupt pharmaceutical system and corrupt medical system So there are all kinds of different angles here and I do think I came to understand all of them better through this research And I also came to understand my own reservations better Really the project of this book  its a social critique but it started out as a selfcritique I was curious about why I myself was reluctant to vaccinate my son And that did give me some insight into why other people arent vaccinating I would prefer for my son to have as little medical care as possible as little contact with the medical system as possible I think vaccination is actually one way to try to help ensure that  making sure that he doesnt get something like pneumonia that might mean a hospital stay where things will be done to him that will make me uncomfortable or that he will be treated in a way that might feel excessive to me I think the best way for me to keep him out of that system is to engage in this highly effective preventative medicine
