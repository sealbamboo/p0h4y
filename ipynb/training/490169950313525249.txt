NPRs Jason Beaubien is in Sierra Leone covering the Ebola outbreak that began in March in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries When we spoke Friday  he had an inspirational story to share I have some good news for you Today I was at that corner of Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia where the first cases of Ebola were reported I was following around   Doctors Without Borders Theyre training volunteers to explain to the community what causes Ebola what the symptoms are how to protect yourself Were in this meeting with probably three dozen people and this guy walks in He is the former health officer from the region called   which sits right up against the Guinea border And he got   He had just gotten out of the treatment center this week He walked in to this heros welcome everyone started cheering and clapping It was like he was taking the stage in   He came running up to the front of the room declaring that hes free of Ebola and that he survived It was this incredibly joyful moment Hes Saidu Kanneh and hes about  years old He just had this spring in his step this incredible smile across his face He was full of energy He was planning to spread the word that you can survive this He refers to himself as overhappy He was one of the first medical workers dealing with cases He said he was working with this woman who had Ebola He was wearing rubber gloves but there was a gap between the gloves and his shirt He believes thats how it happened He spent  days in the treatment center in   and got out this week completely cured MSF people tell me no virus could be detected in him anymore I talked to him   separating the isolation area He was saying he was incredibly bored inside He would come and sit by the fence and listen to his radio He was eager to get out Supposedly people are able to do that But we didnt see any family members interacting with patients while we were there Thats not to say such interactions are not going on But people are quite nervous about coming to the treatment center The MSF people say getting people in early for treatment gives them about a  percent better chance of surviving You basically treat it like influenza You rehydrate patients If people have a fever you knock it down with Tylenol If doctors told him to drink  liters  gallons a day of water he drank  liters  gallons For him it was just focus focus focus on recovery Ebola is not quite as scary as it seemed when I first got here Its not like everybody here has Ebola There are a couple hundred cases in this part of Sierra Leone  a district with half a million people Thats not to downplay the problem But being here has made me realize that Ebola is not as in your face as you think itd be And its quite clear that this can be contained Everybody seems to feel this is going to go on for months  if were lucky  rather than years People are hoping to get over the hump and see numbers go down The turning point has not been reached But the elements are coming together that could wipe this outbreak out
