Fish can be challenging Were told to eat it twice a week because its such a lean highprotein highomega animal but were also told to avoid certain fish like swordfish and large tuna because of high mercury content other types like Atlantic cod or whats left of it because of overfishing and farmed salmon because of ecological considerations  But its worth it to become friendly with different types of fish not just the farmed salmon found in every supermarket If you seek a fishmonger that has a reputation for sustainably caught or raised fresh seafood youll be on the right track Broaden your repertoire think sardines petrale sole and Pacific cod Some of my favorite hotweather dinner party menus revolve around cold fish dishes Not sushi but fish that I cook allow to cool and then serve with a robust sauce or a vinegar and onion marinade With the exception of a carpaccio these are the recipes I focused on this week I steamed fillets of petrale sole let them cool and topped them with an uncooked tomato sauce spiked with fresh tarragon and basil and perfumed with orange zest In a more robust dish I rubbed fillets of Pacific cod with a sweet and spicy Mediterranean spice mix then poached them in a light vinegarspiked broth I made two different versions of escabeche one from Spain the other from Mexico one with sardines  a terrific lowcost highomega fish  the other with shrimp Although fish  like houseguests  shouldnt stick around for more than a couple of days I found myself enjoying my recipe test leftovers all week
