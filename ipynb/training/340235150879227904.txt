
 A doctorintraining we both knew listened intently to our conversation but when we asked him about his experiences with patients he looked lost and struggled for a response  My generation is different from yours he finally said and then told us about getting caught sneaking back to the hospital earlier that year to talk with a couple of patients He had already officially signed out for the night but even going back just to say hello would count toward and push him over his hour weekly work limit Such a violation could cause his residency program to lose its accreditation My generation is different because we cant have the same relationships with patients as you did the young man said We just dont have the time His comment unnerved me then and for a long time afterward I knew he was being honest about his own experiences but I couldnt believe that the same held true for all doctorsintraining After all most people I knew became doctors because they wanted to interact with patients   Now a   what the young doctor told us doctorsintraining   spending less time with patients than ever before How interns and residents spend their time has been of interest to academic researchers   but in the late s as training programs came under increasing pressure to limit the work hours of young doctors   raised concerns The researchers trailed  doctorsintraining over five nights and found that residents spent only about  percent of their time with patients with the bulk of their nights at the hospital devoted to paperwork tasks that did not have to be done by a doctor like drawing blood and inserting intravenous catheters and frequently interrupted attempts at sleep  Medical educators were distressed by the findings and over the next  years residency programs and academic medical centers instituted a series of changes meant to remedy them Hospitals hired trained nonphysician teams to draw blood and start IVs They eagerly adopted electronic medical records in order to streamline documentation  Finally in  under increasing pressure from politicians unions and sleep experts the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education issued a mandate that limited an interns time at the hospital to  hours per week Then two years ago they   requiring interns to work according to a complicated algorithm of hour days at most with mandatory naps and days off Now the largest study on intern work to date   reveals that while the initiatives of the last two decades were implemented with the best of intentions the result has been a perfect storm of unintended consequences Researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland shadowed interns at two different internal medicine training programs over the course of almost  hours They recorded the time the interns spent talking with and examining patients meeting with families attending educational conferences discussing treatment plans with other doctors sleeping eating and even walking around the hospital As in earlier studies the researchers found that current interns spend the majority of their time in activities only indirectly related to patient care like reading patient charts writing notes entering orders speaking with other team members and transporting patients   But when they calculated the amount of time spent face to face with patients the researchers found that interns were devoting about eight minutes each day to each patient only about  percent of their time Medicine is such an experiential learning experience said Dr Kathlyn E Fletcher an associate professor of medicine at the Clement J Zablocki Veterans Administration Medical Center and at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who has published extensively in this area Its really astonishing that so little time is spent at the patients bedside The dramatic decrease in time spent with patients compared with previous generations appears to be linked to new constraints young doctors now face most notably duty hour limits and electronic medical recordkeeping The study found for example that interns now spend almost half their days in front of a computer screen more than they do with patients since most documentation must be done electronically  As a result efficiency has become an overriding concern Compared with previous generations of young doctors who spent a significant percentage of time eating or trying to sleep the interns in the current study spent only about  percent of their time doing so You can only carve up the hours in so many ways said Dr Lauren Block the lead author of the paper and a clinical fellow in the division of general internal medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Theres not a lot of fat that can still be squeezed out  Young doctors required to see the same number of patients in less time try to speed up their work by culling from computer records all available information about patients their symptoms and even their physical exam before seeing them in person When finally in a room with patients they try to speed up their work again but by limiting or eliminating altogether gestures like sitting down to talk posing openended questions encouraging family discussions or even fully introducing themselves We have to ask ourselves if spending more time on electronic medical records than with patients is time well spent said Dr Leonard S Feldman senior author of the study and assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine If youre only spending eight minutes talking to and examining a patient something is certainly going to be missing While   that patient satisfaction and outcomes suffer and inappropriate prescribing increases when doctors spend less time with their patients there may be even longerterm repercussions of such hurried interactions A young doctors   how he or she treats patients once in practice In addition because observation of diseases and their myriad manifestations is critical to building a doctors clinical skills some worry that todays young doctors wont have had enough interactions with patients to be able to recognize the more subtle signs and symptoms of disease or of impending emergencies when they begin practicing on their own While more research still needs to be done augmenting federal support of residency training programs to increase the number of trainees decrease resident workload and make the current restrictions on hours more flexible could help alleviate some of the pressures young doctors now face and allow them to spend more time with patients  There is just no substitute for time in doctorpatient relationships Dr Fletcher said Efficiency is important but it isnt the end of the story
