A lethal mix of failures at a Cumbrian hospital led to the unnecessary deaths of  babies and one mother an investigation has ruled The   into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust found  major failures from  to  at Furness General Hospital It called the avoidable incidents serious and shocking And it criticised the wider NHS for the way it had monitored and regulated events at the hospital Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in the House of Commons that the tragedy was a second Mid Staffs albeit on a smaller scale In an echo of the inquiries in the   the independent report said the problems found represented a simultaneous failure of a great many systems at almost every level from labour ward to the headquarters of national bodies Mr Hunt made number of recommendations saying that the tragedy must strengthen our resolve to deliver real and lasting culture change so these mistakes are never repeated He has appointed Dr Mike Durkin National Director of Patient Safety at NHS England to draw up new guidelines about reporting serious incidents as well as establish an independent national team that can go on rapid fact finding missions on a no blames basis as soon as issues arise  And hes asked Prof Sir Bruce Keogh Medical Director of NHS England to review the professional codes of conduct for doctors and nurses to ensure mistakes are reported not covered up The investigation  led by Dr Bill Kirkup a former senior Department of Health official  found Despite the failures starting in  and continuing throughout the period including a cluster of five major incidents in  it was only in  that the issues at Furness General came to wider attention This was after strong criticism from a coroner who looked into the death of newborn Joshua Titcombe The coroner ruled Joshua had died of natural causes in  but midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection Around this time a report came to light that the trust itself had commissioned It was produced in early  but suppressed by the trust But before that the trust had failed to act on earlier incidents and even distorted the way information was presented to inquests  The CQC regional health authority and ombudsman had not acted properly on what they knew either  There was knowledge of five major incidents in  as the trust had revealed them as part of its application for foundation trust status which is reserved for elite trusts But the regulators did not take the necessary action to fully investigate what had happened and the trust gained foundation status in September  Dr Kirkup said This was a disturbing catalogue of missed opportunities His inquiry makes  recommendations including Six midwives are already due before the NMC later this year  and a seventh is being investigated Meanwhile a police investigation into the death of Joshua Titcombe is continuing and the Health and Safety Executive is looking into the case Pearse Butler chair of the Morecambe Bay Trust said The trust has made some very serious mistakes  More than that the same mistakes were repeated For these reasons on behalf of the trust I apologise unreservedly to the families concerned I am deeply sorry that so many people have suffered She said the trust would look to learn the lessons of what went wrong She said there was a new leadership team in place and extra staff had already been taken on James Titcombes son Joshua was nine days old when he died of sepsis He was born at Furness General Hospital and was transferred to two other hospitals before dying in Newcastle We asked repeatedly if Joshua should have antibiotics and we were told No he didnt need any said Mr Titcombe  He was wheezing and he wasnt feeding properly and my wife called the emergency bell because he was grunting  And every time we were told Joshua was fine and that there was nothing to worry about At no stage was a doctor ever called Afterwards Joshuas progress chart went missing never to reemerge and the coroner later said there was a suspicion that it may have been deliberately destroyed On the reports publication Mr Titcombe said I think I feel deeply sad angry as well and vindicated all at the same time For me this report really lays out how preventable Joshuas death was I really recognise now when we talk about missed opportunities in this report that for me means not having a sixyearold
