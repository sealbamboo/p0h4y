We dont know what happened to the missing Malaysia Airlines jet which throws the families of the passengers of Flight  into a kind of painful inbetween Their loved ones arent here But theyre also not certainly dead Theyre just  gone In the five days since the plane disappeared these loved ones have been in anguished limbo  a state known as ambiguous loss coined by psychologist and author   That is when somebody is missing or has vanished without a trace and you dont know their fate or the whereabouts of their body and whether theyre dead or alive Boss says So it becomes so uncanny and strange for the families theyre never quite sure if the person is truly dead Its a feeling that can apply to dozens of experiences like losing a pregnancy or losing a family member small pieces at a time to Alzheimers or dementia And it also applies to the families of the missing missing children missing persons or soldiers missing in action It is the worst kind of loss to process  I dont mean to say one kind of loss is worse than another But this is the kind of loss that creates suffering without closure Boss said There is no closure ever if bodies cant be found One afternoon in Omaha Kelly Murphys yearold son Jason Jolkowski left their home to head to work His little brother saw him leave the house and neighbors saw him walking to his old high school where a coworker planned to meet him in order to give him a ride And that was the last anyone ever saw him says Murphy He literally just disappeared off the face of the earth Its been  years and we really dont know anything more than we did on day one She says that usually families in this situation have something to work with a violent boyfriend an estranged parent a missing jetliner But this one theres just absolutely nothing And that makes it harder you have nothing to go on Part of the reason that ambiguous loss might be so taxing on a person is the fact that our brains crave information Some scientists have posed the theory that humans are innately informationseeking creatures we need answers we need closure and we need an ending It becomes a problem of cognition Its actually difficult for the brain to process this loss because there is no information about it Boss says You go through partial stages of grief but you cant go through all the stages You dont know what youre grieving for Murphy says Shes been reading the stories of the families of the Malaysia Airlines passengers calling their loved ones cell phones in the days and weeks after Jason disappeared she did the same thing with Jasons phone So I can relate to what theyre going through You want to cling to hope Murphy says But as the days pass Im sure that in their logical minds they know this doesnt look good What I hope for them is that they find some answers that give them some sort of peace Because after a death there are a prescribed set of rituals according to your culture throwing a handful of dirt on the coffin or spreading the ashes in a favorite place of the deceased All of these rituals have a purpose helping the person process the grief But with the missing  when a person is simply mysteriously gone  the people left behind are helpless Any ritual or burial or memorial has to be purely symbolic This was Sue Scotts life for  years since Dec   when her brothers plane went missing in Laos Even though the flame of hope is so minute after so many years you never quite give that up Scott said I think youre always hoping for them to walk through the door I dont think that ever goes away Some miracle will happen and they will walk through the door Little bits of information trickled in over the last four decades about Captain Doug Ferguson Investigators found his crash site They learned that he died holding off the enemy while two pilots were rescued Later they found pieces of his plane And then confirmed just last week  they found   Fergusons remains were finally found and identified Scott said Many had said that it was really gutwrenching So I didnt know what to expect Scott said of when she heard the news last week But actually I felt a sense of peace as a result For me in some sense it was a sense of relief to finally be able to move forward And I dont mean get on with my life What I mean is to celebrate his life Scott said Scott got her answer and Captain Doug Ferguson will finally be coming home to Tacoma Wash on May  to be buried Her story has a concrete ending Murphys after more than a decade still doesnt So shes learned to live in the notknowing as she calls it Its not something shell ever get over and shes not interested in that anyway Shes channeled her grief over Jasons disappearance into the formation of   a nonprofit that provides support for missing persons They will grieve off and on for the rest of their lives and this is normal Boss says There is no closure on ambiguous loss and we need to acknowledge that Its OK to not get over it thats OK even with an ordinary death
