Back in January the Food and Drug Administration issued two proposed food safety rules to prevent tainted food from entering the food supply According to these   farmers who dont qualify for exemptions must monitor and document water quality freezer temperatures encroaching wildlife and any other possible sources of contamination But some small farmers are worried their businesses will be killed by paperwork and expensive monitoring systems required by the law At the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest Caroline Smith DeWaal says small farmers are overreacting These are commonsense safety measures they need to be taking anyway DeWaal says DeWaal who is food safety director for CSPI has been fighting for produce safety reform for more than  years But she says Congress didnt get on board with a new law until the food industry decided to back it She says that happened after a big  tainted   in  The outbreak actually resulted in people not buying or eating spinach not only the fall that it happened but for many years afterward she says DeWaal says commercial growers and grocers see   after big outbreaks Thats why theyve been fighting for these new food safety rules  But small farmers  especially in New England  tell a different story At his farm just outside Montpelier Vt Joe Buley says hes terrified He grows cucumbers that he turns into gazpacho and chilled cucumber dill soup Buley says the cost of complying with the FDAs new rules would stifle his ability to grow and could put younger farmers out of the business altogether Theres gonna be an enormous amount of documentation which is going to require an enormous amount of administrative time or fairly expensive software and monitoring equipment says Buley Mike Taylor deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA says most farmers who sell less than  of product each year are at least partially exempt Together those exemptions exempt from these new produce safety rules  of the  produce operations in this country  thats almost  percent Taylor says The problem is all the exceptions to the exemptions especially for small farmers who dont just farm but say turn a cucumber or tomato harvest into soups and sauces Buley says its doing things like storing or processing produce that can disqualify farmers from those exemptions Youve gotta dig a little deeper into the fine print he says Youre going to find youre exempt except And the except is gonna nail you Youre gonna get it But for all the anxiety the new rules have stirred up among small farmers the FDA still lacks funding from Congress to enforce them Without that funding farmers like Buley who want to sell to mainstream supermarkets may find its grocery stores anxious about lost revenue  not the feds  who are demanding they comply
