Some chronic pain sufferers are waiting nearly two years to access services according to a report into NHS chronic pain care The report from Healthcare Improvement Scotland found that some patients waited  weeks to see a specialist  The Scottish government said substantial progress had been made in treating chronic pain Chronic pain affects about  of the population or  people in Scotland  The condition is defined as pain which lasts for more than  weeks despite treatment Report figures showed that patients waited an average of  weeks for treatment  There were waits of up to  weeks to see a psychologist in the Borders largely because there was noone in the post for nearly a year Typically patients across Scotland waited  weeks to see a psychologist  weeks to see a hospital specialist and  weeks to see an expert in musculoskeletal conditions  As well as the Scottish government target for treatment within  weeks the  Patient Rights Scotland Act also gave patients a legal right to inpatient or daycase treatment within  weeks  However there is nothing patients can do if health boards breach these waiting times   The report authors said long waits to see musculoskeletal specialists were especially concerning since early treatment by one of these health professionals is known to reduce the risk of ongoing chronic pain  The report also found services were patchy and poorly resourced  Four health boards had no dedicated physiotherapy service four had no pain nurses and four had no pain psychologists all contrary to NHS guidelines   GPs had little involvement in chronic pain services and there was insufficient dialogue between health boards and patients or charities  The authors also pointed out that if NHS guidelines were being followed they would expect to see twice as many patients being referred for a specialised procedure called spinal cord stimulation The Chairman of Action on Pain Ian Semmons said despite  years of government reports services had got worse In Scotland a lot has been said but nothings been gained  Is this going to be another report which sits on the shelf and doesnt get acted on Weve had a tremendous increase in calls to our helpline from Scotland over the last few years from people who just cannot get access to pain management  Theres no obligation for health boards to implement effective pain management services in their area he said  There should be a national policy driven from the top The view was echoed by charity group Pain Concern The organisations chairwoman Heather Wallace said Its depressingly true that pain services remain patchy and inequitable waiting times can be long and we need better access to psychology and spinal cord stimulation  However she added that the report did offer something new For the first time there is a shared vision of what a good pain service looks like and there are steps in place in every health board to drive forward change The Scottish government says services have improved Health Secretary Alex Neil said substantial progress had been made to improve care including an investment of m as well as pain management programmes and a service model which all health boards will implement  The Scottish government also confirmed that a new national centre for pain would be set up  It will offer residential courses on how to cope with the effects of chronic pain and manage the condition  An announcement on the exact location for this centre is expected next month
