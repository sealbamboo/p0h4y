 An internal study by Johnson  Johnson into failure rates of its nowrecalled ASRXL hip implant device projected that  percent of the implants would need to be revised in less than  years court documents indicated The  study performed about a year after JJs   examined outcomes of  surgeries involving the metalonmetal devices at  US centers an average of  years after implantation range  to  years Testimony by a DePuy statistician in a California court case unsealed last week indicated that the companys analysis showed that  revision surgeries had already been performed in these patients On that basis an implant survival rate of  percent over  years was projected corresponding to a revision rate of  percent That figure is nearly triple the year rate JJ cited in its  recall announcement   percent to  percent based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales However independent studies of the same registry have suggested the revision rate could approach  percent after  years The ASRXL device is a hip resurfacing system in which the femoral head is left largely intact but is capped with a rounded metal plate articulating with a metal cup implanted into the pelvic acetabulum Some  of the ASRXL systems and a similar device called the ASK Hip Resurfacing system had been implanted worldwide at the time of the recall the company indicated JJ is now facing thousands of lawsuits over the devices The California case in which the internal study was made public involved Loren Kransky a former prison guard who initially received the ASRXL resurfacing in  and underwent revision last year Problems with the DePuy resurfacing products have helped fuel a larger furor over metalonmetal hip replacements generally including total arthroplasty devices that are much more common Last week the FDA issued a proposed rule that would force all manufacturers of metalonmetal hips to   through the premarket approval application PMA process Even devices currently on the market based on k clearances would have to be reapproved with a PMA the FDA said Although the reasons for the higher failure rates seen with some metalonmetal devices remain uncertain    particularly chromium and cobalt used in most devices metal alloys  are thought to play a strong role In the Kransky case court documents indicated that his doctors performed the revision at least in part to cure what they believed was poisoning by chromium and cobalt leaching from the device Metalonmetal hip systems are now estimated to account for less than  percent of the market down from as much as  percent early in the previous decade Highly crosslinked polyethylene and to a lesser extent ceramic have become the preferred materials for the articular surfaces in these devices However metalonmetal is the only technology available for resurfacing Source
