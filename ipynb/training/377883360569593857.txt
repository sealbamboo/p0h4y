Most people who have eaten spicy Chinese food know the distinctive tingly numbness caused by Sichuan peppers Now research detailedin the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B explains why Sichuan peppers cause those tingles  they activate sensors in the lips that respond to light touch The findings may help researchers understand exactly why humans perceive certain taste experiences as they do said study coauthor Nobuhiro Hagura a cognitive neuroscientist at the University College LondonÂ  Sichuan peppers   grow throughout China and the   The seeds of the plant are often added to foods throughout the region and often cause a tingly numb sensation on the lips similar to a slight electrical current Past research suggested the active tinglestimulating ingredient in Sichuan peppers was a chemical called sanshool Other natural chemicals such as menthol and capsaicin in   activate sensors in the tongue that detect heat and cold Though research found that sanshool activates nerves that sense touch exactly how it did so wasnt clear  To find out Hagura and his colleagues put ground Sichuan pepper on the lips of  men  After a few minutes the mens lips began to feel   The team then used a machine to mechanically vibrate participants fingers and asked them if the vibrational frequency on the finger was faster or slower than the tingle on their lips  The peppers caused the sensation of about  vibrations per second which corresponds to the frequency sensed by nerves that sense light touches on the skin  The findings could help broaden the understanding of how signals in the skin are translated into complex touch sensations in the brain Hagura said It could also help scientists understand how touch plays into   Sichuan peppers dont add much flavor to food so their main draw must be the tactile sensations they provide Hagura said  This may offer an opportunity to understand how the quality of touch can alter the perceived taste Hagura told LiveScience
