All of a sudden theres some movement in the development of vaccines against Ebola Johnson  Johnson said Thursday that the company is speeding up work on its part of an experimental twoshot vaccine being developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease JJs Crucell unit would make a vaccine that would prime the immune system A second shot from a company called   would be given later to boost the immune response The vaccine combination would target the Zaire species of Ebola thats now spreading through West Africa The JJ vaccine worked well in tests on macaque monkeys the company said If all goes as planned the vaccine could be tested in humans starting in the first half of  The JJ vaccine has been a long time coming The scientific work involving Crucell now a JJ subsidiary and NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health   The initial goal was a vaccine that would simultaneously protect against two Ebola species and   a related hemorrhagic fever But a multipronged vaccine like that would take more time to refine and test so JJ has pared down the vaccine goal to move up the start of human tests by a year We will only focus on the Zaire strain as a target Dr Paul Stoffels JJs chief scientific officer told Shots That allows us to accelerate the vaccine development The JJ approach has some particulars that set it apart The Crucell shot makes use of a modified human cold virus to get bits of Ebolas genetic material into cells inside the human body Once there the noninfective bits of Ebola trigger an immune response Similarly the Bavarian Nordic   uses a   of the smallpox virus to carry Ebola genetic material into human cells While Ebola versions of these vaccines are new the viral carriers being used have been tested previously for safety in human Stoffels said Of course we still need to build in the Ebola piece We havent tested that in the clinic yet he said But the vector which is the carrier for the vaccine is safe And therefore we think and we hope that the vaccine will be safe as well This week   NIAID began human testing of a different Ebola vaccine being developed in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline An NIAID spokeswoman said the first doses have been given to two volunteers Also an experimental Ebola vaccine licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp by the Public Health Agency of Canada is expected to begin human testing soon The Defense Department   that work The World Health Organization convened a twoday meeting in Geneva Thursday to talk about how to evaluate and when to use the   now in the works We will do our part JJs Stoffels said But we cant do this without significant collaboration We believe many options are needed
