Caroline Whites son Seb has Downs syndrome Here she explains why she wishes more adults would treat him the way children do If you were asked who or what it was that taught you the greatest lessons in your life your first answer would most likely be a particularly inspiring teacher your time at university a year spent travelling a best friend an influential adult a beloved parent or grandparent   All of these people and experiences have undoubtedly influenced my outlook on life and without question have all shaped who I am today  My steepest learning curve of all has been in the last seven years The birth of my first baby with an added diagnosis of Downs syndrome proved to be truly lifechanging Within that experience I have learned so much  about me about others about priorities and equality But it is Seb himself and the children around him that have taught me the most   My memories of being told my son had Downs syndrome at just a day old are very bleak I was devastated My mind raced with fear of what the future held for us and I imagined a lifetime of exclusion and disability of being on the outskirts being stared at and feeling different  For a time I thought the hurt would never lift At that moment my baby didnt just have Downs syndrome he was Downs syndrome I pigeonholed him into a box of outdated stereotypes and failed to see that actually he was still a baby and my baby Seb  Bit by bit the pain began to ease as I fell hopelessly in love with this little boy With each day that passed he showed me something new about him He grew from a beautiful baby to an adorable but sometimes challenging toddler and from there to an equally adorable and equally challenging little boy   He now loves football and scooting ice cream and chips but hates having his hair washed and going to bed He is a little boy who has learned to read and write who loves going to the cinema and playing with his mates Our lives together could not be further from the bleak outlook I had imagined But still I find myself faced with preconceived assumptions made by wellmeaning adults on a regular basis People will tell me that children like Seb are loving and giving or they will say that Seb seems to have it mildly  And if I am telling someone for the first time that I have a son with Downs syndrome the most common response is Oh and a palpable feeling of awkwardness and on more than one occasion followed with an Im sorry  But with children it is different There is a beautiful innocence through the eyes of a child  They see a person not a syndrome  Seb attends a mainstream school  The children at the school dont know that Seb has a label They have no preconceived ideas of what he should or shouldnt be or what he can or cant do He is just Seb If asked to describe him the other children would say how good he is on his scooter that he loves football that he is a fast runner or that he needs a little bit of extra help at school  If you asked the parents of those children the same question then I still think Downs syndrome would be in the first sentence  Seb now has two younger siblings and I have never told them that he has Downs syndrome I want them to grow up seeing Seb as Seb I dont want him labelled or excused  So it took me aback when Sebs fouryearold brother out of nowhere suddenly said to me Mummy Seb talks funny doesnt he I was unprepared for the question and had to think fast  Well you know some of us are good at some things and some of us are good at others I said trying to buy myself some thinking time  You know how Seb is good at football and you are good at talking Well we are all just different and good at different things Oh yes he excitedly replied maybe he was talking in Spanish Sebs good at Spanish  And that was it  Nothing else nothing more He accepted the explanation and moved on I wish so much when I had been given Sebs diagnosis that I could have seen the world through a childs eyes The news would have made little impact if any I feel so sad that I wasted those precious early days wrapped up in my own unnecessary fear The panic I encountered was without a doubt based on ignorance   I grew up in an era when children and adults with a learning disability were rarely seen I dont remember ever having the opportunity to talk to or get to know anyone disabled as a child Children with learning difficulties and disabilities in general were not seen at school or at dancing or Brownies or on the football pitch or in the cinema  In fact disabled people were segregated into their own community and often the only time you saw anyone disabled was en masse at an outing to the seaside This meant that I never got the chance to see beyond the label they were given and ultimately when my son was given a diagnosis of Downs syndrome I was uncomfortable with it and felt devastated I feel really ashamed of that now
