NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights a new watchdog body says  Healthwatch England which heads up a network of  local patient bodies urged the public to become  savvy consumers rather than grateful patients To help the watchdog set out   for patients It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it The survey of more than  people found one in five had experienced poor care  but of those  had not complained Healthwatch England was created under the shakeup of the NHS earlier this year It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients champion carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern This is its first report to Parliament and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers insisting on our right to safe dignified and high quality care To help achieve that the organisation has set out its list of rights Ms Bradley added Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative Without real and meaningful input from patients it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future he added
