A surgeon in Birmingham has been suspended after a colleague found the surgeons initials branded on a patients liver   If true it is difficult to imagine a plausible defence   It is usual for surgeons or the scrub nurse to test the diathermy  a penlike device which produces heat to stop bleeding or cut tissue  on wet gauze before using it on the patient but not on a patients organs   Similarly an argon laser can be tested outside the patient such as on a wooden spatula to ensure correct focal length and power but rarely on the patients organs I have heard of only one other case of this sort when a surgeon carved his initials with a drill on the inside of a bone flap in a brain operation Although minor there are medical risks to this surgical graffiti   There is a risk of infection and scarring with loss of functioning cells   Using a laser may reduce blood flow by coagulating vessels and cause burns on other parts of the body   Drilling the bone flap could damage the structural integrity of the bone and may lead to infection of the flap   In some cases branding the patient will prolong the operation quite unnecessarily with added risks of complications Yet even if no risks existed it seems the surgeons actions did not benefit the patient nor were they intended to do so   The motivation was selfish not altruistic   In branding their initials on the patient the surgeons broke the Hippocratic commitment to act in the best interests of the patient   They also damaged the trust between doctor and patient   To ensure that patients feel comfortable disclosing their most intimate secrets patients should trust their doctors to the end of the earth   Doctors who breach the trust of their patients  weaken the edifice of trust which their predecessors have worked so hard to build and maintain A cornerstone of modern medical ethics is the principle of respect for autonomy   This requires doctors to ask mentally competent patients for permission to perform tests or procedures on them   In the cases described above the patients did not consent to the bodily inscription   Their autonomy was violated even if no physical harm arose from the breach  Another source of moral discomfort is the vanity that the inscription  of the surgeons own initials  reflects on the scribes moral character and attitude   Arrogance in any line of work is an unattractive trait  In medicine it sits uneasily with the obligation to treat patients with dignity   The surgeons actions bring the medical profession and surgeons in particular into disrepute   They do little to dispel the traditional  and in my view unfair  reputation of surgeons as egotistic The branding of initials on a patient may say nothing about a surgeons technical ability or their bedside manner but it does display a worrying lack of judgement and professionalism  It represents multiple breaches of the General Medical Councils Duties of a Doctor including the following injunctions Never abuse your patients trust in you or the publics trust in the profession Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity Make the care of your patient your first concern Be honest and open and act with integrity More difficult than evaluating the moral rightness or wrongness of the act is the question of punishment   What should be the appropriate penalty for surgeons found guilty of such misconduct knowing that the surgeon in question may be technically proficient and that no physical harm has befallen the patient   As when sentencing offenders in court the severity of the sentence will depend on the individual features of the case but my own view is that the nuclear option of permanent removal from the medical register also known as being struck off would in many cases be too harsh   Once reprimanded a surgeon is unlikely to repeat the mistake
