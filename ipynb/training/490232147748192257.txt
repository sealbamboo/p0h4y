This is the move you bust out when youre short on time and desperately in need of a hardcore burn jumping lunges Celebrity trainer Bob Harper said this is one of the best doubleduty exercises he knows Jumping lunges are a time saver because they strengthen and tone the lower body hips to calves while also giving you a jolt of cardio and putting your balance to the test This is not an easy move but its a highly effective one Harper said Position yourself so one foot is on the floor in front of your torso the other behind Finding the right position can be tricky at first Your goal is to make sure the knee of your forward leg stays directly over the ankle when you drop into the lunge movement Once your feet are in place lower yourself down into a lunge position chest up eyes forward At the bottom of the movement rocket yourself up a few inches off the floor switching legs in midair Repeat Height is less important than speed and total lower body engagement This is not the time to be loose and sloppy Harper suggests Tabata training for this one because he says its the best way to get in the toughest workout possible in the least amount of time It looks like this  seconds of movement followed by  seconds of rest for eight rounds So as many jumping lunges as you can do for  seconds rest for  and then repeat for eight rounds in all Follow me on Twitter
