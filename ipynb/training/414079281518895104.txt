Chelsea loves helping her parents Chris and Linda prepare food for the whole family They say she spends much of her free time watching the Food Network looking out for new recipes But Chelsea cannot taste the food she makes She can eat almost no food at all She suffers from a rare disease that has caused her intestine to fail irreversibly I have an unusual body compared to other people she says almost dismissively but thats more than an understatement Chelsea has to wear a special backpack for  hours every day that feeds her nutrients intravenously My stomach doesnt work and thats why I have a line she says because well I cant eat real food so Ive got to have IV fluids and so the line goes into my artery so I dont have to have food to my stomach Chelsea has been sick all her life She suffers from   an energy production problem meaning mitochondria in cells dont function properly She also has   or a toorapid heartbeat  In addition in  she was diagnosed with   a rare condition in which the intestine loses the ability to contract and push food through the gastrointestinal tract This problem led to the intestinal failure Her life story is one of pain suffering and fighting Shes has had to endure numerous stays at hospitals more than  surgeries and even went into lifethreatening septic shock once Last year was our worst where she went into septic shock on Halloween and woke up in the morning couldnt use half her body Linda Wheeler recalls Chelseas situation has deeply affected her family which includes four other children When you really step back and think about all the activities you go to it normally revolves around some kind of food You know whether its sports family or birthdays says her dad Chris Wheeler Even though Chelsea cant eat she does her best to lead a fairly normal life She refuses to wear her backpack with the nutrients at school and she sets the table for the family ahead of dinners even though shes not able to taste the meals she helps prepare The kids come home from school and shes in the kitchen preparing them snacks Linda Wheeler says It must be her way of coping But Chelsea cannot cope with intravenous feeding much longer Shes in need of whats called a small bowel transplant where the part of her intestine that has failed will be replaced Its a fairly rare procedure but Chelseas doctor Donna Zeiter says the risks are decreasing As our ability to manage rejection develops as our ability to manage infection and infectious complications has improved survivability has actually become quite acceptable Its not clear when the operation could take place Currently  patients in the United States are awaiting an intestine transplant according to the   The intestine cannot be taken from a living donor  Unfortunately youre waiting for a child to die Linda Wheeler says  They had told us anywhere from six months to three years So I think theres no way to know It is clear however that the procedure will be expensive and the Wheelers will have to pay some of the bills out of their own pocket  Their community of Oxford is helping out A giving tree has been set up at the Oxford Town Hall where people who donate can hang paper doves with their names Shes one of us and were very proud of her says Oxford First Selectman George R Temple Were proud of her courage Shes very happy and upbeat and optimistic and just the kind of kid that you cant help pull for The Childrens Organ Transplant Association has also taken on Chelseas case and started a   and   where donations to help pay for costs arising from transplant operations can be made The Wheelers say if a donor is found Chelsea will have to remain in the hospital for close to a year including for the procedure as well as the immediate aftercare  Chelsea doesnt seem to doubt she will make it Im all messed up but you know I just have to wait for my transplant and then most medical things will go away she says in a defiant confident tone She continues to plan for her diner It will be called Chellys because thats her nickname and she has already found a building in her hometown where she would like to set the restaurant up This girl who has fought all her life to stay alive says she wants nothing more than to offer people a great culinary experience  even though she cant enjoy it herself right now You dont need to be a millionaire to eat there every night she says as her eyes light up but you will feel like a millionaire when you eat there
