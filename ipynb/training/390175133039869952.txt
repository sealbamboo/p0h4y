Her husbands dementia worsens  Bills are piling up and knotty daily and longterm decisions must be confronted The wife is exhausted overwhelmed lonely She needs support from the family So she turns to the adult children  his from a previous marriage   But will they help or make the situation more difficult   Every year nearly a halfmillion adults over age  remarry and a growing proportion of these spouses  usually the wives  eventually will become primary caregivers Many will look for aid from those with whom their ties may not be particularly strong their partners adult children New research suggests the caregivers may be in for bitter disappointment A study published this month in The Journal of Marriage and Family examined   The researchers found that nearly half of the people whom the women felt had a negative impact on their caregiving were the husbands relatives  most prominently his adult children Generally these women felt that their stepfamilies created conflict or that their support was minimal or  nonexistent  Research has already shown that dementia caregiving for intact families is demanding intensive and isolating This study underscored that    One woman told me I called a family meeting to discuss how to manage things but no one showed up said   the lead author and a research investigator at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan   The family meeting is often urged by social workers Dr Sherman added but it simply doesnt fit these situations Dr Sherman and her colleagues extensively interviewed   women who were  the primary caregivers for their  failing husbands asking them to sort out which relationships were most and least helpful among friends professionals and family The women were largely in their s and s though their ages ranged from  to  They were still living in their homes with their husbands for whom they had roundtheclock oversight   These women have unique vulnerabilities Dr Sherman said I know adult stepchildren who step up in every sense of the word but for most of these women disagreements with stepchildren was the most stressful aspect of providing care for the husband    For many of the women the interviews were cathartic she said They were giving voice to buried feelings and were startled and relieved to know that they were not alone in their experiences    Some women were being sued by stepchildren who felt money was being misspent There were disputes about who should be in charge Some adult stepchildren perhaps long estranged from their fathers in the aftermath of the previous marriage simply turned their backs     In Dr Shermans study  negative networks of such relationships were significantly associated with  increased burdens on the wives exacerbating their stress and depression   These were not women who coparented these adults Dr Sherman said They came relatively later I was still surprised that more people were not involved out of obligation to their fathers But they may have thought Shes there so I dont need to be     professor of sociology department at Rutgers University said that when parents divorce fathers generally have far less contact with children than mothers  Before he remarried he may have already had a strained or cool relationship with his children Dr Carr said So if the caregiving wife wants help from them they may not have had a rosy relationship with him to begin with    A more benign interpretation she suggested was mismatched life cycles  If the wife is in her mid s the adult stepchildren may be in their late s and early s Those are their peak child care and work years and they have competing demands said Dr Carr an editor of a special section in the journal in which this study appeared called Stepfamilies in Later Life    The results were not completely stark Fifteen women felt that their relationships with their stepfamilies were working Some even framed the new reality with their husbands as a time of healing between their stepchildren and them or between the father and his children   The women often did find positive emotional and practical support elsewhere In descending order they cited their friends professionals their relatives like siblings then the adult stepchildren and finally their own children   Armed with these insights Dr Sherman said professionals could tailor interventions to meet the needs of these women Doctors typically ask the caregiver Do you have children nearby But then they dont ask Are these people you can rely on   The researchers are aware that the study reflects one point of view the caregiver of a loved one who is slowly being erased before her eyes   Now Dr Sherman has started to study these kinds of cases from the perspective of the adult stepchildren
