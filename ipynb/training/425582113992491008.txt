Latino immigrants in the US say the quality and affordability of health care is better in the US than in the countries they came from   the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health But many report having health care problems About a third of immigrant respondents  percent said theyd had a serious problem with being able to pay for health insurance in the past  months And more than  in  had a serious problem affording doctor and hospital bills and prescription medicines But the health issue that Latinos said is most concerning for them and their families  whether they were born in the US or immigrated here  is diabetes Last year in another poll Latinos said cancer was the biggest problem facing the country Hispanic populations have a high prevalence of Type  diabetes About  percent of Latino adults have been diagnosed with it or have prediabetes a stage of the disease that often goes undetected One important factor Latinos may be   to the disease  a risk that can be aggravated by environment and diet Take the example of East Los Angeles an area heavily populated by MexicanAmericans Like many of her friends and family members Rebecca MartinezRocha says she struggles with her weight At one point she weighed more than  pounds I dont think I realized it at the time whether it was denial or I stopped getting on a scale she says but I was morbidly obese And as it turns out MartinezRocha was   a diagnosis she received at a local health clinic I wasnt aware of the fact that I was ill I figured that I was relatively young in my s and early s she says It was kind of one of those aha moments in life where you look at it and put it all together and you think How did I get here  The doctor who diagnosed MartinezRochas condition is   a diabetes specialist and professor at University of Southern Californias   Shes also the director of a diabetes program at   Peters says Type  diabetes is the plague of the Latino community she treats Individuals here are getting diabetes at rates weve not seen before About  percent of the Latino population she sees has diabetes Peters projects that number will climb to nearly  percent over the next few decades if nothing changes in the environment or diet of local residents Peters told MartinezRocha she was on her way to getting insulindependent Type  diabetes MartinezRocha says she got very scared and made major changes She lost  pounds But many patients dont do that in large part because prediabetes is often silent Unless people go to a doctor and get their blood sugar measured theyll never know they have it And thats a shame Peters says because prediabetes can be turned around If somebody has prediabetes they need to lose weight  not a lot of weight maybe only  to  pounds she says They dont have to become skinny to benefit she adds Studies show that moderate weight loss can reduce diabetes risk by half Losing weight is hard for many people But MartinezRocha says its even harder when you live in a neighborhood that offers lots of highfat highsalt and highsugar food If you drive around my neighborhood every corner youll see a taco stand a fastfood restaurant a sweetbread store places selling tamales or fried food MartinezRocha says In NPRs poll with the   and    in  MexicanAmericans rated the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in their neighborhoods as fair or poor  a public health researcher and professor of public health at UCLA calls neighborhoods like this where healthy food is hard to come by food swamps Walk into the typical corner market he says and the first things youll see are signs for liquor and lottery tickets cigarettes soda and chips They might sell some fruits and vegetables but theyre typically in the back of the store and in very poor quality Ortega says Our survey found that Latino immigrants generally do not perceive their diets as less healthy in the US  percent see their diet as healthier in the United States and about the same number  percent say its about as healthy One in   percent see their diet as less healthy  that obesity rates among immigrants increase as their duration of residence in the US increases They suggest this might be attributable in part to changes in lifestyle including an unhealthy diet Ortega is committed to turning the Latino diet around As director of the   Ortega is heading a project to convert corner stores in lowincome neighborhoods About a month ago Ortega along with community activists local high school students and store owner Maria Avila transformed the   in the Boyle Heights section of East Los Angeles They added windows and a new paint job and rearranged and organized shelving But most importantly Ortega says they added healthful foods The newly converted store opened to the public in December Today when you walk in the door the first things you see arent cigarettes and junk food  theyre fresh fruits and vegetables This is the fourth corner store in the area to be converted Ortega is still collecting data but anecdotally he says store owners tell him they have more customers theyre selling more fruits and vegetables and theyre making more money But the big question is whether the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables will make a difference in the health of the neighborhood and the epidemic of diabetes For college freshman DeeDee Barba it has made a difference She has taken part in the store conversion project for two years Not only has she learned about marketing and sales but shes also learned about nutrition As a result she says her family now eats more healthfully Part of that includes no dressing on salads We now eat our salads with olive oil and lemon and its actually good she says We eat a lot of fish and chicken we rarely eat red meat We eat rice but we have wholewheat rice We dont drink soda anymore  we drink mostly water High school senior Steven Cardona  has worked with the store conversion project for the past year Learning about nutrition he says has changed his familys diet dramatically Before we would eat lots of fast food but now we eat mostly steamed vegetables rice chicken and lean meats he says Family members have lost a lot of weight and everybody reports feeling better he says Ortega says thats exactly whats hoped for that the availability of healthy food in lowincome neighborhoods like this will make a difference in what residents buy cook and eat And that it will mean changing diets and reducing the high rates of obesity and diabetes in the Latino community in East LA
