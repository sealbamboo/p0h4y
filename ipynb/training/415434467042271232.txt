A former nursing home owner and its manager have been jailed for 12 months for neglecting elderly people.. Philip Bentley, who owned the Elm View home in Halifax, West Yorkshire, was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on Monday along with nurse Faheza Simpson.. Bentley, 65, of Woodthorpe Drive, Wakefield, and Simpson, 49, of Huddersfield Road, Holmfirth, had been found guilty of neglect.. Some residents developed pressure sores due to bad care, the court heard.. The charges against Bentley related to the care of three women. Simpson was convicted with respect to the same three women and a man.. The jury heard how the home suffered from chronic understaffing and even the most basic care procedures were often neglected. Police were called to the home in 2011.. Elizabeth Wright, from CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: "This was a very distressing case involving the wilful neglect of vulnerable, elderly residents. . "As a result these elderly people were left in conditions of unrelieved discomfort and some must have been suffering considerable pain."
