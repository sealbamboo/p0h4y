The minute Emily Letts saw the two pink lines on the pregnancy test she knew she was going to have an abortion She also knew she was going to document what was going to be a major event in her life with a video that she would eventually release on YouTube Now that the video has been viewed more than  million times and unleashed a storm of responses some so nasty that YouTube disabled comments she has some words for her critics I knew I was going to be called a slut and a whore and I knew they would make videos on YouTube burning pictures of me Letts  said in an interview with NBC News Those people dont interest me To be honest I feel sorry that there is so much hatred in their world Im not going to respond to hatred with hatred The   shows Letts before during and after the procedure She talks about her reason for choosing an abortion The pregnancy was unplanned and she wasnt ready to have a baby The whole thing is over in just a few minutes Letts says she released the video to help other women My goal was to reach at least one woman to make her breathe easier and to let her know that she is not alone Letts said My video is not about me Its about using my story as a jumping off point for conversation Women do not need to be shamed into silence Since the video went viral antiabortion voices have come out in force Shes certainly ignoring the life she just destroyed in an effort to have an experience and show how positive a thing it is Anne Scheidler vice president of the Pro Life Action League told the  You cant end someones life like that President of the National Right to Life Committee Carol Tobias told   It is a sad commentary on our nation that someone can be rewarded for filming an event that takes the life of an innocent unborn human being We pray that in the coming years she will understand and be able to accept the ramifications of her actions Even some prochoice advocates were unexpectedly disapproving suggesting abortion should be a private matter and that Letts went too far in making the video and disseminating it to the public In Britain The Telegraphs   who calls herself passionately prochoice wrote Im not denying there are still many things we need to demystify  I just dont think those conversations should involve YouTube For me Emily Lettss video just shows there are some taboos we just dont need to break Brian Wilcox a professor of psychology at the University of Nebraska calls that criticism unfair Its her choice whether she goes public or not with her own experiences Wilcox said And I think one of the things this video does is make other women feel they are not all alone It also opens the topic as one for conversation in a more public way than we are used to The fact is most women have to deal with the decision largely on their own and they have to deal with their emotions before and after all on their own Its very difficult This allows them to see the experience of one other person at least Though Letts was a little nervous in the days before the video went up on YouTube she is happy now even with the negative comments I dont care what you have to say just speak out Letts said I hate the fact that women feel they cannot speak about their experiences Some feel that Letts video has gone a long way to banish stigma At Planned Parenthood we work hard to eliminate stigma around abortion Eric Ferrero vice president of communications at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to NBC While Emilys story wasnt filmed at a Planned Parenthood health center it provides an alltorare opportunity for people to learn more about abortion and we commend her courage and honesty in sharing her story Psychologist Midge Wilson isnt sure how it will turn out in the end Antiabortion groups have been able to use the video to try to paint Letts and others in a negative light said Wilson a professor of psychology and womens and gender studies at DePaul University This allows them to say that women dont take it seriously Wilson said I see what she did as very courageous Shes trying to minimize the stigma and the abortion shaming where nobody wants to talk to you because youre a horrible person For the past two decades antiabortion forces have painted an ugly and frightening picture of the procedure This video undermines that Wilson said The narrative of abortion from the right has been that it is horrible painful and gruesome with baby limb parts coming out Wilson added But  percent of women say their primary feeling after having an abortion is relief The  percent who are filled with regret and remorse are typically the ones who were forced into having an abortion by someone else I think she is part of a movement that is trying to take back control of the narrative
