 chief information officer Clinical Research Network NIHR I think its engagement How do we make the implementation of a system add to the delivery of healthcare and be about improving care and releasing benefits Some of that is about design of systems and some of that is about how a system is implemented ultimately the benefit has to be at the core of what is being put in place  IT strategy lead CWHHE clinical commissioning groups collaborative The biggest challenge is around meeting the expectations on integrated care across multiple organisations using different generations of standards and IT platforms while limiting impact on frontline staff  director of healthcare Polycom There isnt one single big challenge you can focus on There are broad challenges and local issues Establishing a good working system has been done before  there are plenty of successful examples in Europe and north America  electronic prescribing and medicines administration specialist pharmacist System C Healthcare Culture change  getting over the this is how weve always done it barrier  clinical project lead Leeds Care Record The key thing is to know what patterns are important to spot and harness to achieve change For example shepherding a mix of people process information and technology to achieve iterative meaningful change that delivers real results If done right it should deliver better care for patients and better value for money overall  If the Apple Watch takes off like the iPhone then I would suggest wearables will be collecting information on the go sharing it with a clinician and allowing the data to be part of the way care is delivered  A move to openness ie open source open standards will be key to the future of healthcare which is somewhat behind in this regard  Technologies that will take healthcare services to the citizen are a big area of interest Organisations are looking at how they can keep citizens healthy and out of the hospital At the same time citizens want to know why cant I see my doctor on Skype or FaceTime because its convenient Lots of people use these technologies every day in their lives  why not to access the expertise they need  Technology makes it easier to deliver research within the care pathway  for me this is the ultimate gain If research can be delivered by virtue of care being provided and of course with the consent of the patient then the   can lead the world in this area We have a theory of releasing information to enable new questions to be asked That in itself will drive research and outcomes  Electronic recording of prescribing handling of decision support and drug administration mean many things can be audited like timeliness of administration that would not have been practical on a large scale with the paper based system  Getting clinicians on board is absolutely that culture word again If a system delivers benefits and is useful for the delivery of care then the systems will be adopted from our point of view Build a system like those mentioned here today that has the clinician at the heart of it and it will be adopted and benefits will be derived  Its too simplistic to lump all clinicians together  at the ground level many strategies may be required for a successful implementation and personalities will definitely be a factor At the general level though it has to work it has to be worth the clinicians time and there has to be a tangible benefit  The changes involved here involve a mix of people process technology Key to that is that clinicians lead this change and get involved in usercentred design agile developmenttesting piloting etc  I often observe the success of a solution being measured by the ROI return on investment but what we really want to see is the RTH return to health Clearly defined objectives and measuring those criteria is usually standard practice  For our organisation success is when the people making use of the system start to drive forward its innovation its availability and what it will do next  Sharing does make a difference we have worked with vendors the media and through presentations to share A supplier form for care settings where suppliers are encouraged to share more is a great forum as are things like the EHI Awards The NHS needs to share to meet the challenge it faces but I do think it tries to do so its just such a huge scale  Vendors have reference sites for potential customers to see what their products can do  why not the NHS  The move from pilot to whole service change has been a problem in the NHS for years We are now seeing much bolder whole system changes that deserve recognition Greater use of reference sites encouraging visits to successful areas etc The NHS needs to promote its failures as well and permit senior staff to report less than effective implementations wihout it being career limiting  Sharing of best practice has been promoted by the NHS for a long time There are regular conferences exhibitions and competitions highlighting healthcare IT best practice Perhaps formally making it a mandatory requirement on IT departments to share their own findings in all the key areas should be written in to standard operations
