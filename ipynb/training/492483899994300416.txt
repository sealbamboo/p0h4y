Free schools for children with autism are gradually being setup in the UK by community groups with another one due to open in Easter  But in the s parents in Sunderland clubbed together to create what they saw as a real need back in a time when autism wasnt such a wellknown disability In the s Paul Shattocks autistic son Jamie was six Although they say he was a lovely child his parents  like many parents with autistic children  found they needed extra support He slept  hours a night says Shattock In the end the only option we had was for him to go to a residential school But the specialist centre available to them was in Aberdeen some km m away from their home in Sunderland I had to take him that was the worst day of my life I cried my eyes out and he did too Shattock says  Unhappy with his son being so far away Shattock who is the chairman of Education and Services for People with Autism in Tyne and Weir wanted to do something to change the situation and so teamed up with local parents who had children on the autism spectrum They all wanted their children to be closer to home and still receive the correct care and education so looked into setting up their own residential school  The group started by purchasing a a former Jewish day school in Sunderland that needed quite some restoration Despite raising the  needed to buy the building funds were low and the work was eventually done by the parents with help from young unemployed people on Government training schemes  It was a wreck a real seat of the pants operation says Shattock but reports there was tremendous support from the community We spent four years fundraising Every working mens club in Sunderland had social events we approached leek clubs pigeon fanciers associations rotary clubs and round tables for fundswe tried everything It was a Sunderland venture a local venture By  Shattocks mission to provide a local residential school for autistic children was complete  On opening there were just two pupils in attendance It was the first specialist autism school in the country offering a full residential service  weeks per year But very quickly that figure grew to  children aged five to  and local authorities began to fund places  But the school was the start of something much bigger The founders realised there was a need for something more as the children became older and reached leaving age The perceived need led to the setting up of a new college catering for young people aged over   This time the parents took out bank loans secured against their houses in order to buy an old vicarage It too is still running today and provides education placements for young people aged  yrs with autism learning disabilities other disabilities andor mental illness In  Mr Shattock received an OBE for over  years of services to the autism community More on how free schools for children with autism are becoming more prevalent can be read
