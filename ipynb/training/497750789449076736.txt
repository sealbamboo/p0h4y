Even if youre trying its tough to keep score of whats happening with various lawsuits challenging some state abortion laws States led by antiabortion governors and legislatures have been passing a broad array of measures over the past few years aimed at making the procedure more difficult for women to obtain About two dozen states enacted  such measures in  according to the Guttmacher Institute

laws as well as a   that a federal appeals court allowed to take effect last November have one thing in common They represent the latest fight over efforts to make abortion either less available according to one side or safer according to the other Here are some frequently asked questions about the laws and the lawsuits surrounding them Admitting privileges are the right of a physician to admit patients to a particular hospital and to provide specific services in that facility For a physician to be granted privileges a hospital generally checks the individuals medical credentials license and malpractice history Many hospitals also require physicians to admit a minimum number of patients to the hospital each year before they will grant or renew privileges Others require the doctor   of the hospital Supporters of the laws say its about safety Once a physician assumes the responsibility for overseeing the provision of a medical procedure theres an obligation on the physician to follow the care through to its ultimate conclusion including any emergencies that might occur says Ovide Lamontagne general counsel of the antiabortion group Americans United for Life Lamontagne also said the process for doctors to obtain hospital privileges is another safety check Admitting privileges are sort of the professions way of validating the credentials of a provider he said Opponents of the laws however say they are more about making abortion less available Admittingprivileges legislation would impose stricter requirements on facilities where abortions are performed than on facilities that perform much riskier procedures says Jeanne Conry former president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists As an example the mortality rate associated with a colonoscopy is more than  times greater than that of abortion she says yet gastroenterologists who perform such procedures outside of the hospital setting do not face similar requirements in the context of safety And opponents point out that most abortion providers cannot meet the numberofadmissions standard for gaining privileges because so few of their patients   According to the   which

clinics in the Rio Grande Valley were about to close as a result of the admittingprivileges provision  this finding does not show an undue burden   written by Judge Edith Jones The opinion also noted that the lower courts finding that  there will be abortion clinics that will close is too vague Since the ruling the last remaining clinics in the Rio Grande Valley   That left San Antonio which is up

depending on the outcome of   regarding another provision of the Texas law That provision requires abortionproviding clinics to meet the same facility standards as ambulatory surgical centers that do more complex surgeries Those standards include such details as minimum door widths and allowable types of materials to be used in floors and ceilings In Mississippi a different set of judges from the
