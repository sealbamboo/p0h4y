Elderly people face paying  for residential care before they hit the cap on care costs in England an analysis by Labour suggests  The sum is more than double the  figure the cap will be set at when it comes into force in  That is because extra costs such as the fees for accommodation do not count towards the cap Labour said the public was being conned but ministers said they had been clear about what the cap covered The research also suggested that the majority of people  six out of seven  who end up in a home will die before they hit the cap That is because the average length of stay in a care home is just over two years whereas it will take five years for most to reach the cap The  figure is based on how much a person would pay if socalled hotel costs which include accommodation food and bills are factored in This will be set at  a year to start with It also includes the higher costs individuals face when purchasing care home places compared with the price councils get which is what will count towards the cap As councils buy places in bulk they are able to get cheaper deals Figures from analysts Laing and Buisson suggest the gap is about  a week According to the Labour analysis that would mean individuals paying  a week for a care home place but only  counting towards the cap Labour itself is not proposing to cover accommodation costs but said it was highlighting the figures because the government was not being straight with the public Shadow care minister Liz Kendall said Families deserve to be told the facts rather than being conned so they can properly plan for the future and not have the government attempt to pull the wool over their eyes Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said Many older people and their families who have assumed they will benefit from the social care reforms will be shocked and disappointed to find they may not receive much help   It is crucial that the public understands what costs are included under the cap and the impact the proposals will have Ministers said they had always been upfront about the accommodation costs and said one of the aims of the cap was to encourage the insurance industry to develop policies for old age that could cover much more of the fees They also pointed out that once a persons assets  including house and savings  started to drop below  the state would start contributing towards the cost of care which would mean those people would not have to pay the full amount towards the cap anyway This has been incorporated into the policy to protect the less welloff What is more they are also looking at allowing individuals to purchase care home places through their local authority to allow them to benefit from the lower rates A Department of Health spokeswoman added The government is introducing the first ever cap on care costs so that people no longer have to live in fear of unlimited care costs Our changes will help hundreds of thousands and give peace of mind to many more
