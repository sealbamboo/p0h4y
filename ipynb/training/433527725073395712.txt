I have to admit I melt at the creaminess of fullfat yogurt Its an indulgence that were told to resist And I try to abide Stealing a bite of my daughters YoBaby doesnt count does it The reason were told to limit dairy fat seems pretty straightforward The extra calories packed into the fat are bad for our waistlines  thats the assumption But what if dairy fat isnt the dietary demon weve been led to believe it is New research suggests we may want to look anew Consider the findings of two recent studies that conclude the consumption of wholefat dairy is linked to reduced body fat In one   published by Swedish researchers in the   middleaged men who consumed highfat milk butter and cream were significantly less likely to become obese over a period of  years compared with men who never or rarely ate highfat dairy Yep thats right The butter and wholemilk eaters did better at keeping the pounds off I would say its counterintuitive says   executive vice president of the National Dairy Council The second   published in the   is a metaanalysis of  observational studies There has been a hypothesis that highfat dairy foods contribute to obesity and heart disease risk but the reviewers concluded that the evidence does not support this hypothesis In fact the reviewers found that in most of the studies highfat dairy was associated with a   risk of obesity We continue to see more and more data coming out finding that consumption of wholemilk dairy products is associated with reduced body fat Miller says Its not clear what might explain this phenomenon Lots of folks point to the satiety factor The higher levels of fat in whole milk products may make us feel fuller faster And as a result the thinking goes we may end up eating less Or the explanation could be more complex There may be bioactive substances in the milk fat that may be altering our metabolism in a way that helps us utilize the fat and burn it for energy rather than storing it in our bodies Miller says Whatever the mechanism this association between higher dairy fat and lower body weight appears to hold up in children too As we   last year a study of children published in the   a sister publication of the  concluded that lowfat milk was associated with more weight gain over time It really surprised us study author Mark DeBoer a pediatrician at the University of Virginia told us So where does this leave us the   who have complied with the skimmilkisbest edict Well opinions differ The recommendations that led to the fatfree dairy boom were in part born out of concerns about cholesterol Wholemilk dairy products are relatively high in saturated fat And eating too much saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease So many experts would agree that adults with high cholesterol should continue to limit dairy fat But its also becoming clear that there are benefits to fullfat dairy too at least for some consumers As weve   in addition to the body weight association organic whole milk contains beneficial omega fatty acids Its unclear whether more people are opting for whole milk products Though nonfat and lowfat still dominate dairy sales the organic sector is experiencing an uptick in wholefat sales We definitely in the last few years are seeing a trend toward the wholefat products   CEO of farmerowned Organic Valley told us His companys sales of wholefat milk are up  percent he says And sales of skim milk have trailed off Also theres been a   So stay tuned Though its a   finding researchers are continuing to investigate how dairy fat may help people control their weight
