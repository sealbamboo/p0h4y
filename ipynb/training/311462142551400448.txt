One of the most common presentations is the flank pain on one side It sometimes radiates down into the stomach and it can actually radiate down into the genital area That type of pain is pretty commonly seen in stone patients Sometimes theres nausea and vomiting Those type of symptoms are something that gives us a clue that this may be a stone  The CAT scan is the gold standard for imaging for kidney stones Thats usually the way to diagnose it You cant do it from a blood test or anything else  What it does is it blocks the flow of urine in the kidney and it causes backup And its an excruciating pain A lot of people do describe it as worse than childbirth When the system is trying to push urine out what happens is your kidney and your ureter  they have this muscle propagation that goes down the kidney into the ureter  when its trying to push and the stone is blocking it you get these intense pains Thats why we call it colicky it comes and goes and its extremely painful and the main reason for the pain is the backup of urine  Usually if they have two kidneys they urinate fine because youre getting urine on the other side The problem is that kidney is producing urine but it cant get pushed down If you take a pipe and you clog it off and somehow youre still getting fluid into the other end  if its a pipe that can expand it starts expanding  The backup is like that It causes a great deal of pain because youre expanding your system You dont have any popoff valve Once it starts expanding its expanding unnaturally  Its called hydronephrosis and its basically backup of urine into the kidney  There are certain diseases associated with kidney stones things like hypoparathyroidism or some bowel diseases where your absorption isnt normal Things like obesity and diabetes are associated with kidney stones The main dietary factors are low water intake and high salt intake and animal protein  anything you killed to eat If you have high amounts of those intakes it causes your urine to acidify and then it becomes more prone to having stones It just depends on the person If you have a family history youre more apt to get a stone  If the stones are small enough they usually pass on their own Sometimes it can be an uneventful passage or sometimes its just an excruciating passage but we can help them out with pain medicine and some other medicines  We say greater than  mm we start watching them closely They have a higher chance of requiring surgery to pass the stone  Yep they can pass it As long as its small enough and theres nothing abnormal in their system that prevents it from moving through if its small enough people can pass the stones by themselves  It can take a few days Depending on where the stone is and how small it is Sometimes we monitor up to six weeks but if the stone isnt progressing well go ahead and take care of it  If the pain is so much that they cant endure it then we will go ahead and treat If their pain is coming and going and wellcontrolled with things like ibuprofen or other pain medicine sometimes we just wait and let them try and pass it  There are three types of surgery  Theres shock wave lithotripsy  its a noninvasive procedure where you basically put shock waves onto the stone externally to break up the stone Thats a good treatment if it works It requires not as much anesthesia  The other that we use most commonly probably here is ureteroscopy taking a little telescope without any incision you just go up where you pee go up to the stone and you use a laser to break the stone into pieces The much more invasive way is called percutaneous nephrolithotomy and thats when you go through the back Thats for very large stones  The incisions are only about  cm and you use telescopes and you basically get into the kidney onto the stone with one telescope through the back and you treat the stone  Definitely If you have a stone you do have a much higher risk of getting another stone within the next  to  years  About  of people have calcium stones But there are other stones There are stones associated with infection theres stones associated with acid urine called uric acid stones Theres some medications actually cause stones  They can If you have a stone passing down and theres an infection behind it and the urine cant get out so the infection sits there it festers and can be like an abscess and it can actually be fatal if you dont get treated Stones can also cause kidney issues If you leave a stone in there thats blocking your kidney and its a chronic condition  its been in there for a long time  usually you see loss of function in that kidney Some stones believe it or not are completely asymptomatic People dont even know they have them It can be a very large stone or a small stone but they get a CAT scan for some other reason and thats when we pick it up With the increase in obesity we know that thats one of our biggest risk factors and it is increasing in the population Were seeing more people developing stones Were seeing more children developing stones We think this is really largely due to diet  Were seeing it in all populations Before males were highly predominant stone formers versus females Now females are catching up And kids had a very low rate of stone disease and now were seeing more kids with it I think diet the foods we eat have really been playing a part in the increase were seeing
