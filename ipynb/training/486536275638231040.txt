The same genes drive maths and reading ability research suggests Around half of the genes that influence a childs aptitude for reading also play a role in how easily they learn maths say scientists The study of yearold British twins from  families reported in   adds to the debate about the role of genes in education An education expert said the work had little relevance for public policy as specific genes had not been identified Past research suggests both nature and nurture have a similar impact on how children perform in exams  found genes explained almost  of the variation in GCSE exam results However little is known about which genes are involved and how they interact The new research suggests a substantial overlap between the genetic variations that influence mathematics and reading say scientists from UCL the University of Oxford and Kings College London But nongenetic factors  such as parents schools and teachers  are also important said Prof Robert Plomin of Kings College London who worked on the study The study does not point to specific genes linked to literacy or numeracy but rather suggests that genetic influence on complex traits like learning abilities and common disorders like learning disabilities is caused by many genes of very smalleffect size he said   Children differ genetically in how easy or difficult they find learning and these individual differences need to be recognised and respected he explained   Finding such strong genetic influence does not mean that there is nothing we can do if a child finds learning difficult he added Heritability does not imply that anything is set in stone  it just means it may take more effort from parents schools and teachers to bring the child up to speed The study adds to the debate about the role of genes in childrens educational attainment said Dr John Jerrim of the Institute of Education But he said the key limitation was that the authors cannot and do not tell us which genes are actually thought to influence childrens reading and maths ability Until researchers are able to identify the specific genes that are thought to influence childrens reading and math skills and show that such associations are robust in numerous academic studies then such work has little relevance for public policy he said
