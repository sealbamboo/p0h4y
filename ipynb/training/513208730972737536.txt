This year nearly two million American adults and more than  children and adolescents will learn they have a potentially devastating lifeshortening yet largely preventable disease   They will join   who already have   Diabetes and its complications are responsible for nearly  deaths a year the fatality rate among affected adults is  percent higher than among similar people without diabetes Alarmingly recent studies even have linked diabetes to an increased risk of   and   Even people with aboveaverage blood glucose levels but not diabetes    runs in families largely because its primary risk factor  excess weight  runs in families But you can keep it at bay by losing weight and becoming more active Unfortunately as numerous studies have shown intensive efforts to get people to lose weight eat healthier and become moderately active   even among those who already have diabetes It is easier and more effective to avoid becoming overweight in the first place But it is by no means impossible to lose weight and at some point your physical and mental wellbeing may depend on it Here are some diet and   tips that can help Avoid drastic measures Crash diets and kooky eating plans are doomed to fail Its better to make gradual changes in what and how much you eat to give your body a chance to adjust The   conducted among about  people who had prediabetes found that moderate

helpful to write down everything they eat and drink each day for a week or two An excellent discussion of what is known about the effect on diabetes of various foods and supplements appeared recently in Nutrition Action Healthletter at   Some highlights   breads grains cereals sugary drinks and sweets of all kinds  are most problematic for people with diabetes or at risk of developing it Carbohydrates are eventually metabolized to glucose which raises the bodys demand for insulin Consume less of them in general and choose wholegrain versions whenever possible If you must have sweet drinks select artificially sweetened ones In two huge studies of nurses and other health professionals who were followed for  years those who drank one or more sugary soft drinks a day had about   than those who rarely drank them even after their weight was taken into account Fruit juice is not necessarily safer than soda All drinks with fructose table sugar highfructose corn syrup honey or agave may increase body weight insulin resistance and belly fat all of which can promote diabetes But theres good news about coffee Two or three cups of coffee but not tea a day with or without caffeine have been consistently   Consider having coffee unsweetened or artificially sweetened in place of soft drinks Keep in mind that specialty coffee drinks can be loaded with sugar and calories For protein limit consumption of red meat especially processed meats like sausages hot dogs and luncheon meats which are linked to a higher diabetes risk Instead choose fish lean poultry skinless and not fried beans and nuts Lowfat dairy products including yogurt and even fatty ones   the reason is unclear Most protective    spinach chard kale collards mustard greens and even lettuce  as well as cruciferous vegetables like cabbage broccoli and cauliflower But all vegetables are good and should fill at least twothirds of your dinner plate Consider dining several times a week on a big salad adding beans fish or chicken for protein Use dressing sparingly The nutrients magnesium and   are also potentially protective In fact the preventive value of leafy greens whole grains beans and nuts may lie in their high magnesium content In a welldesigned clinical trial of  overweight people with insulin resistance the prelude to diabetes blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity improved in those who took a daily magnesium supplement for six months Dont go overboard More than  milligrams of magnesium daily can cause   Vitamin D long known to be crucial to healthy bones may also be helpful In one study of  overweight or obese adults with prediabetes those who took a supplement of  international units of vitamin D daily   In studies of people who already had diabetes however vitamin D supplements did not seem to help perhaps because their benefit was overwhelmed by the medications taken by participants Of course how much you weigh and what you eat are not the only concerns Regular preferably daily physical exercise is a vital component of any prevention and treatment program for Type  diabetes or most any chronic ailment Weight loss can reduce diabetes risk by about  percent but adding exercise to that can lower the odds by  percent compared with people who remain overweight and inactive according to a study that followed nearly  female nurses for  years  Women who were active for seven or more hours weekly had half the risk of developing diabetes as did women who exercised only a halfhour a week  It helps to live in a community where walking the nations most popular form of exercise is feasible and safe A Canadian study of recent immigrants found a significantly higher incidence of diabetes among those living in areas where it was a challenge to walk  When communities are retrofitted or new living and working environments are developed creating areas conducive to exercise should always be part of the plan
