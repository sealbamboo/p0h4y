When private hospitals transfer patients who dont have insurance to public hospitals its called patient dumping But a study from Stanford University   suggests a twist Hospitals it seems are   likely to transfer critically injured patients to trauma centers if the patients have health insurance Researchers at Stanford University looked at more than  trauma cases at  hospitals around the country to see what happened to critically injured patients who were brought to emergency rooms that werent   They found that nontrauma facilities were much more likely to admit patients who had insurance whether it was private insurance or Medicaid coverage than to transfer the patients to more skilled facilities Its the opposite of the overly aggressive transfer of a poor patient says Dr Arthur Kellermann dean of the medical school at   and a trauma care specialist who was not involved in the study This is actually suggesting that patients who have coverage for critical injuries may not be getting transferred as quickly as they should be Getting to a designated trauma center matters for patients who are seriously hurt  those with severe injuries are   than in a typical emergency room Thats the whole point of trauma centers Kellermann says The expertise the speed of response the capacity to manage complex injuries is significantly better at major trauma centers Thats the whole reason certain hospitals are designated trauma centers Its not just a matter of getting in the door at the   hospital he says but getting in the door at the   hospital The study didnt assess how well the patients who were held at nontrauma centers fared The researchers excluded patients over  and those who were discharged from the ER or who died But   the studys lead author and a former Stanford emergency medicine instructor says critically injured patients admitted to hospitals that are not trauma centers are at risk for worse outcomes Its unclear just who makes that decision to admit or transfer Emergency physicians and nurses typically dont know whether their patients are insured or not But Delgado who is now an emergency care researcher at the University of Pennsylvania says hospital administrators often weigh in on where uninsured patients end up and that same dynamic he says could help explain why nontrauma centers are reluctant to give up paying customers As an emergency physician Delgado says you may get a tap on the shoulder by a case manager that suggests that you should consider transferring the patient out to a hospital where they can be taken care of and where theyre willing to accept them without insurance The business of medicine too often dictates where patients are cared for Kellermann says and that includes whether a hospital admits patients or transfers them away That decision should not be influenced by economics one way or the other he says It should be influenced only by whats in the best interest of patients Its not the first time researchers have found hospitals holding on to insured patients Lowbirthweight babies do best at neonatal intensive care units that care for many such infants but babies covered by insurance   Still there could be other reasons why patients arent transferred to hospitals that have more expertise Patient preference may play a role Delgado is currently researching whether patients prefer to stay at their local community hospital rather than be moved to a trauma center  which might be part of a public hospital or located in an innercity area If patient choice is driving these decisions Delgado says hospitals need to do a better job of educating patients about where theyll get the best care
