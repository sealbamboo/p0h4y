Despite my best efforts I remain bewildered about the surgical mishap I suffered in  It was a debulking operation  the removal of all organs affected by a cancer that originated in my ovaries The procedure was undertaken by the proper specialist a gynecologic oncologist but as I recounted   the surgery did not go well for me It still seems disturbing to me that in the wake of inadvertent but grievous surgical outcomes physicians do not necessarily engage in candid conversations with patients Under the influence of anesthesia of course surgery remains an absence The preparation fasting enemas the shaving of the body leads to the gurney stacked next to others like planes at LaGuardia Then the surfacing to consciousness of pain while someone misnames you in a loud voice and later the morphine drip the effort to haul the bruised and stapled body out of bed  Only later still did I discover that this operation  the removal of my uterus ovaries fallopian tubes appendix spleen omentum a fatty apron covering the abdomen and several inches of bowel  had been suboptimal More than one centimeter of tumor remained in my body In this regard unfortunately I was typical of many ovarian cancer patients Less typical however were the debilitating infections that erupted and a series of tubes that were placed in my body by interventional radiologists because of the formation of an abscess Oozing wounds output bags fevers implanted devices to deliver large doses of antibiotics fearful aches weight loss and blood transfusions such a list does not capture the agony of the recurrent hospitalizations that interrupted my first and second cycles of chemotherapy  all the result of the botched operation  Was the disaster partly the fault of nurses who had not properly purged me before the event After it discussions left agency a mystery as if surgery had somehow eventuated without a surgeon There was a perforation at the resection was the reason given The closest I got to an explanation arrived in the passive voice The bowel was nicked  A medical term surfaced that I could not fathom  anastomosis  defined as the union of parts or branches whatever that means My oncologist who is not a surgeon said sadly Well there was a lot of cancer  Maybe the operation should have been postponed until some of the malignancy had been reduced by preoperative chemotherapy At least one physician friend believes the problem may have been a result of the hospitals culture At his institution he informed me a bowel specialist would have been called in to assist  Truthtelling in language I could understand would have boosted my confidence in the postoperative care Without fixing the physical problems it would have relieved me psychologically Like many people I find it easier to forgive a human failure than an anonymous smokescreen Why is it so difficult for patients and doctors to discuss surgical accidents and complications without violating professional codes of conduct and arousing fears of legal liability A more clearcut blunder in cancer surgery arrives via anecdote A friend of a friend suffers from a neverhealing leg wound Her surgeon had neglected to prescribe antibiotics and wound treatment after surgery on a sarcoma Every day for six months after a second operation had to be performed on the same site she has had to travel to a facility where she lays in a special oxygen chamber designed to promote healing The womans reoperation and neverhealing wound bring up issues of accountability Unlike the sarcoma patient though I cannot isolate the specific cause of my surgical calamity Clearly I did not have grounds to accuse my surgeon of malpractice Actually it troubles me to criticize him since I am grateful to be alive Yet I would not want my daughters or students undergoing what I went through Beyond wordofmouth there should be some easily accessible nonlegal mechanism whereby patients can alert hospital administrators and other physicians about ineffective surgery In the murky area of notgoodenough care available data about adverse events and poor outcomes could prevent suffering A patientinitiated medical review would have convinced me that future surgeries might improve Perhaps this sort of channel exists at some cancer centers but I did not know about it at mine  though chemo fog has to be factored into my befuddlement      For years after the debulking operation numerous interventions did not alleviate my problems but instead aggravated recurrent infections I had to have two abdominal reoperations as well as a host of arduous outpatient procedures  It was a bowel surgeon who eventually solved the problem He too made a mistake  he accidentally left two stents in my body that produced more infection But he always spoke truthfully and in language I could comprehend I am not seeking absolution he said about the stents I feel very bad about what happened but it did happen because I was not on top of the situation I remain thankful for his forthrightness and also for his freeing me from infections in   Just as my second surgeon did not ask for absolution I had no desire to exact retribution  Rather I wished for clarity and a reason to believe that past mistakes could provide an opportunity for future improvements But what I also want  what women really need  would render unnecessary some of these draconian operations and difficult conversations a reliable detection tool for ovarian cancer  When found at an early stage which too rarely happens ovarian cancer can be cured
