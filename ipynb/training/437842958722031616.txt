Taking a sick kid to a drugstore health clinic might be easier  and even cheaper  than going to the doctors office but an influential pediatricians group is warning parents that such sites dont provide the regular highquality care that children need Retailbased clinics are an inappropriate source of primary care according to the American Academy of Pediatrics which on Monday reiterated that it hasnt budged on its  stance despite an explosion of sites at places like Walgreens and CVS Such clinics can lead to fragmented care offered by midlevel medical providers  usually nurse practitioners  who are not specifically trained in pediatrics said Dr James J Laughlin a Bloomington Ind pediatrician who is the lead author of the updated policy The AAP strongly feels that the medical home model of care for kids is best Lauglin saidUnless the retailbased clinics are willing to work collaboratively with us then its not going to be helpful But the firms that run most of the at least  retail health clinics nationwide say they do work with doctors not against them to provide quality care for lowlevel health problems like ear infections and strep throat The American Nurses Association says that studies have consistently shown that nurse practitioners offer highquality care in the clinic settings The latest policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics is just another attempt to preserve the status quo the ANA said in a statement And parents say they rely on the clinics that are open after work and on weekends  when most doctors offices arent If I want to see my childrens pediatrician theres no way Im going to go there and see him that day or the next day said Karin Ide  of Park Ridge Ill who has taken her two boys ages  and  to Walgreens clinics for care If they have flu symptoms or a sore throat or someone has an ear infection and I feel like I need to get them in really quickly Ill go said Ide a single mother who juggles kids and her job at a large local bank Officials with CVS which runs  MinuteClinics in  states and Walgreens which operates  retail health clinics say they follow evidencebased guidelines for childrens care and provide followup reports of clinic visits to the regular pediatrician We believe in the primary care medical home and were supportive of it Dr Andrew Sussman president of CVS MinuteClinic told NBC News We believe we can play an important and complementary role The CVS clinics have relationships with  major health systems nationwide and are helping to ease an ongoing shortage of primary care doctors added Sussman who is the associate medical director for CVS Caremark A clinic visit may also be less expensive than a trip to the pediatrician according to a  that found that retail clinic costs ran  percent to  percent lower than the same visits to doctors offices urgent cares or emergency rooms That same study conducted by RAND Health researchers and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that the quality of care was just as good at the retail clinics as at the other venues CVS launched the first retail health clinic in Minnesota in  The Convenient Care Association a trade group says there are about  clinics nationwide but the AAP estimated there were about  as of  About  million clients have been seen since then the CCA said Between  percent and  percent have been children though the clinics typically see patients older than  months leaving infant care to pediatricians The AAP however said there are still concerns about the quality of care about coordinating health records and about whether what appear to be minor conditions may actually mask larger problems that could be missed by staff in a busy retail clinic I feel like I can be a better doctor for my patients if Im seeing them for a gamut of illnesses said Laughlin who noted that he often uses visits for minor ailments to check on other potential problems But CVS officials point to the case of Camie Brown a high school basketball player who needed a sports physical in October  Natalie Babcock a nurse practitioner at a CVS MinuteClinic in Chesterton Ind heard a heart murmur that other doctors had missed potentially saving the girls life Its just a blessing that Natalie was a skilled practitioner who knew what she was doing said Camies mom Sophie Brown  of Valparaiso Ind Laughlin dismissed suggestions that the retail clinics are draining customers from traditional doctors or that theres a turf war going on over who cares for mild childhood illnesses You could say were fighting a turf battle but you could also say theyre cherrypicking Laughlin said If parents take their kids to quick clinics they should ask that their records be forwarded to the regular doctor to ensure continuity of care Laughlin said For their part the retailers agree We strongly encourage all patients to have a relationship with a primary care physician and medical home for ongoing medical needs and routine exams Walgreens officials said in a statement That makes sense to Karin Ide the Illinois mom who relies on retail clinics after hours but still sees traditional doctors as well I do use them a lot but there are definitely other things that I want to see my primary care physician for she said Its not like Im going to use Walgreens for everything
