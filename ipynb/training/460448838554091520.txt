Oregon has been all in on health reform Its embrace of the Affordable Care Act includes a very successful Medicaid expansion a   federal   to show the state can save money by managing patients care better and of course the states own online marketplace to sell Obamacare insurance But that last point has been a huge problem The Cover Oregon board decided on Friday to ditch its troubled website and join up with the federal HealthCaregov exchange instead The Oregon site launched with high expectations but after   and about  million spent Oregonians still cant use the website to sign up for coverage on their own They have to use a navigator The reasons for the problems are multiple The state wanted a website that could enroll everyone from individuals to businesses owners Medicaid recipients and even children On top of that the contract Cover Oregon drew up with the software giant Oracle to build the site didnt link payment with producing a working website So Cover Oregons board made a choice on Friday Instead of spending another  million dollars to try and fix its troubled website it would sign up with the feds for about  million and be assured of a working system Of course were very disappointed says Dr George Brown a Cover Oregon board member People have worked very hard to make this work And I think theres been significant success if you look at the numbers of people whove been enrolled both through the qualified health plan as well as Medicaid Hes right About  people   through Cover Oregon although many of them had to do it via pen and paper rather than keyboard and mouse But switching to the federal exchange may cause some headaches of its own The  Oregonians who signed up for individual insurance may have to do so all over again says Clyde Hamstreet Cover Oregons third chief in five months Let me say this nobody has to reenroll now What we have to do in November weve got to work out yet Hamstreet says It might be that some companies will have to do it and others wont We have to work that out yet He says Novembers important because thats when the enrollment window opens again and he says the system has to be working Oregonians may have other problems with the federal exchange too For example five of the  health insurance companies currently doing business in the state dont have the computer interface needed to work with the federal exchange So will they go to the expense of setting one up Or will they stop doing business in Oregon Thats unclear Also navigators whove been trained to help people sign up for Cover Oregon will now have to be retrained for healthcaregov Meanwhile cuts are being discussed for an as yet unspecified number of the  people employed at Oregons exchange according to Hamstreet Cover Oregon certainly is going to be around for  We have a lot of work to do Hamstreet says Exactly what Cover Oregon is going to look like in  I think is too early to say
