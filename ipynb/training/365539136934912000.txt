Hightech companies keep trying to fix Americas health care woes This time the effort is a combination of Big Data research and an oldfashioned Christmas club On Thursday a startup called   began offering an iPhone app for women who are trying to get pregnant The app combines a calendar and dataseeking questions around things like fertility cycles emotional and health conditions even the type and quality of intercourse the woman has had  The idea is to improve the odds of pregnancy by showing optimal days in which a woman might become pregnant and at the same time anonymously gather data on a subject that is difficult to study An Android version of the app is expected soon  People can also join a program in which they pay  a month If at the end of  months they do not conceive naturally they get that money back plus a share of funds from participants who did conceive which they can put toward fertility treatment That kind of purposeful forced savings way back when was how banks got people to save for Christmas only they didnt get other peoples money too Once we have a few hundred thousand data points well know a lot more about infertility said Max Levchin Glows cofounder Of the optional payin program he said we think of it as crowdfunding babies Mr Levchin is a wellknown tech figure who was a cofounder and chief technical officer at PayPal where he figured out much of its breakthrough fraud detection system He then started Slide a mediasharing service that was sold to Google for  million and was also an early investor in Yelp and other companies  Glows other founder Mike Huang also worked at Slide and like Mr Levchin worked for a time at Google after the Slide acquisition Investors in Glow include the Founders Fund an investment firm started by several PayPal veterans and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz Over the past several years there have been many efforts by tech executives to address aspects of health care The more successful ones have tended to focus on fitness and nutrition which are not as heavily regulated as say prescription drugs or hospital stays and which dont infringe on the turf of powerful health insurance companies  Mr Levchin called fertility treatments almost ridiculously poorly covered by health insurance an elective treatment that nobody who wants to conceive would call elective Of course for the data to roll in people will have to at least somewhat faithfully enter their data The fertility treatment club could help in that regard To seed the optin program called Glow First Mr Levchin said he was contributing  million of his own fortune  While the app is free Mr Levchins main goal seems to be to amass data on a poorly studied area He said he could find little research for example on the connection between mood or stress and conception That data will be donated to researchers but it could also lead to new ways of addressing the finances associated with not just fertility but other elective treatments  Giving people a better sense of decisionmaking promoting activist health care is the only way to change the system he said This is a transitional first step to building a new kind of way to finance things
