Plans are afoot to test drugs to treat Ebola in West Africa  and those studies could have farreaching benefits far beyond this rapidly expanding epidemic Thats because some of the drugs are based on nascent technologies that can be used to treat other infectious diseases  and even inherited ailments such as   Weve written about some of these drugs here on Shots   At this point its impossible to say with certainty whether any of these approaches is more promising than any other Research is always full of surprises Today we take a look at one of these potential drugs not because its necessarily the best and brightest hope but because its a window on how drug development is evolving The experimental drug is called   And the technology behind it is at the frontier of medical science AVI is being developed by   in Cambridge Mass And its no ordinary drug It goes right to the genetic heart of the Ebola virus As is common among viruses Ebolas genes are written in RNA code rather than DNA One feature of RNA is that you can create a stretch of this material and design it so it will stick to its mirrorimage opposite in naturally occurring RNA In  Craig Mello and Andrew Fire shared a Nobel Prize for exploiting this as a powerful tool for manipulating genes Their discovery is called   or RNAi Simply put a synthesized bit of RNA can jam the genetic signal by binding to a target bit of genetic material and simply getting in the way A Canadian company called   is producing small bits of RNA that will recognize and bind to Ebola viruses in order to put them out of commission But you cant just inject RNA into a persons arm and expect the stuff to make its way to any circulating Ebola virus Naked RNA thats injected into mammals gets broken up immediately with a number of enzymes we have just in our blood says Dr Michael Wong Sareptas senior medical director for infectious diseases Tekmiras drug seeks to avoid that by encapsulating the snippet of RNA inside a tiny bubble of fat lipids to be more technical to protect it from enzymes in the bloodstream Sarepta is trying a different approach Instead of making a segment of RNA to bind to a site on one of the Ebola genes it makes a segment of material that looks a lot like RNA but isnt quite The technology has a melodic name  its a morpholino oligomer To be more precise and less euphonious its a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer or PMO Wong says a short strand of this material will still bind strongly to natural RNA but enzymes in the blood wont digest it AVI is an oligomer that has been crafted to bind to one of Ebolas seven genes The idea Wong says is to shut down that gene and by so doing disable the Ebola virus Its an utterly rational approach to drug design which is what makes it so appealing When AVI was given to monkeys then injected with high doses of Ebola  to  percent of the animals survived Wong said So its promising but far from perfect And because people arent monkeys its hard to say much about this as a human drug until it gets tested in people Wong hopes that Ebola will be one small example of the power of this technology You can change the combination of genetic building blocks in any manner youre interested in and target different things like mutations in human genes he says In fact Sarepta has targeted genetic mutations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy an inherited disease that gradually robs boys of their muscle power This morpholino oligomer targets a small defect in the genetic code for children with Duchenne As a result this mutation remains silent in these boys when theyre treated with the drug Wong says that one small clinical trial has now run for more than   years and he says theyre seeing remarkable safety and tolerability in the boys that are receiving the agent Wong says the boys are continuing to walk and breathe on their own  defying the odds in this disease Sarepta is also pushing another boundary which is procedural rather than scientific Wong says theyre looking for innovative ways to streamline the US Food and Drug Administrations approval process from the  to  years of the usual timeline to something thats much more relevant to todays issues That would require both persuasive science and open minds
