It started with the obvious question How can we help Thats what Chris Siegler wanted to know when Ebola struck Sierra Leone And the answer to that question shows that its not only big international groups that can assist Ebolaravaged countries Siegler has had a long relationship with the West African nation He was a Peace Corps volunteer there in the late s with his wife Jeannie After the year civil war ended in  the Sieglers went to visit Chris whos on the board of the   in Missoula Mont came across a   in Freetown the countrys capital And so a partnership was born Theres a tremendous similarity between the Y in Sierra Leone and the Y in Missoula Siegler says in the fact that its constantly looking for how the organization can serve the community better Missoulas Y has been  s since  sending close to  to help fund programs for kids and teach job skills Theyve also brought staff from Sierra Leones Y to Missoula to study And now the Missoula Y is doing its part to help its sister organization in Sierra Leone When Siegler asked how to help the answer was You can help by just giving us some funds for basic supplies the chlorine buckets   Thats how the Missoula Y began offering aid Now its also paying for delivering food to families that are quarantined in their home for the  days while theyre trying to determine if anybody in the household is affected by Ebola Christian Kamara CEO of Sierra Leones YMCA is grateful for the assistance He says the outbreak of the Ebola deadly disease is something that is psychologically really affecting people here Also the economy is going down as well because life is really not that normal He says there are no longer social gatherings in Sierra Leone as people are trying to avoid physical contact with one another to prevent the diseases spread People are unable to work because of quarantines Schools are closed including those the Y operates  most of its facilities are closed  and there is no longer commercial air service into the country So far Missoulas Y has raised about  to support the Y in Sierra Leone Part of the money is being used to produce radio ads in the local language telling how to recognize the symptoms of Ebola and promoting a hotline for medical help Right now the international community is raising tens of millions of dollars to fight Ebola in West Africa The money coming out of Missoula so far is but a fraction of that but Kamara says it makes a real difference We dont need millions of dollars we dont need thousands of dollars Kamara says Whatever we could have that could be able to support a family support a home support a community support a village not to die I think thats what we need now
