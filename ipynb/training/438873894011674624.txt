There is a growing problem of drug and alcohol misuse among older people as babyboomers age campaigners are warning   says more are drinking too much and alcoholrelated hospital admissions and deaths are rising Drug misuse was also an increasing problem in the age group it said DrugScope said policy too often centred on young people and ageappropriate help was needed The oldest of the babyboomer generation are now reaching old age and the charity says their attitudes were formed when alcohol was becoming more widely available and socially acceptable In addition they tend to have drunk more in middle age than previous generations establishing worrying patterns for old age The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has estimated that the number of people aged over  needing treatment for drug problems in Europe will double between  and  The DrugScope report says about  million people aged over  exceed recommended drinking limits And between  and  alcoholrelated hospital admissions for men aged  and over have risen by  and for women by  Office for National Statistics figures show alcoholrelated deaths among the overs are at their highest level since  when records began  Overall the number of people in drug treatment is declining as is the number of people starting treatment for heroin and crack cocaine  But the number of people aged  and over in treatment is rising as is the number of people in that age group who are new starters  Public Health England has said this ageing population overwhelmingly made up of heroin users is now becoming one of the key features of drug treatment in England and poses  a significant challenge for treatment services in the years ahead DrugScope said increased use of other illicit drugs particularly cannabis was also a growing problem among middleaged and older agegroups The charity says services need to be specifically targeted for older people with drug and alcohol problems Its chief executive Marcus Roberts said Drug and alcohol policy and practice  and the attention of the media  invariably focuses on young people  Drugs and alcohol issues may affect older people differently but that does not make them less real or important They may be a symptom of other problems such as loneliness and isolation caring for a partner bereavement or the struggle to make ends meet He added This is not an issue that we can ignore  The barriers to older people accessing help and support need to be addressed  These can range from a belief on the part of professionals that older people cant change to embarrassment on the part of the individual at having to ask for help   We also need to develop a range of ageappropriate interventions and to make the connections between drug and alcohol issues and olderpeople policy both nationally and locally   Its time to bring this largely invisible issue into the light and to improve the support for older people with drug and alcohol issues Dr Tony Rao chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists older peoples substance misuse working group said The generation of babyboomers now progressing into later life represents a burgeoning tidal wave of substance misuse in the UK with both hospital admissions and deaths from alcohol misuse in older people of particular concern  Substance misuse in older people should now be everyones business and kept firmly on the radar of those commissioning and providing services for this growing hidden and vulnerable population Caroline Abrahams charity director at Age UK said Drugtaking and excessive drinking in later life are serious problems that are often linked with other issues such as bereavement loneliness and isolation  Whilst the spotlight on excessive drinking generally falls on younger people the most significant increases in alcohol related harm are actually in older age groups  She added It is positive that the issues of excessive drinking and drug abuse in older age are starting to be recognised however the problem will only get worse unless appropriate preventative and treatment services are made available
