Alzheimers disease may be killing more than  people in the US each year making it possibly the third leading killer behind heart disease and cancer according to a study that takes a new look at the way the deaths are estimated Right now the mindwasting disease ranks sixth among the nations  of mortality with more than  deaths each year Heart disease is first with nearly  deaths followed by cancer at nearly  But researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago said those figures are based on notoriously inaccurate death certificate reports  and that a review of actual deaths suggests the figure may be five to six times higher possibly boosting Alzheimers into third place If thats true it means that the disease deserves research funding for prevention and treatment on par with such massive scope perhaps  billion a year four times whats now being spent experts said Determining the true effects of dementia in this country is important for raising public awareness and identifying research priorities said Bryan D James an assistant professor with the Rush Alzheimers Disease Center who led the study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology Alzheimers disease and other dementias are routinely underreported on US death certificates James said People filling out the certificates typically focus on the immediate cause of death  say pneumonia when the patient wouldnt have developed pneumonia without first having Alzheimers disease Take Carol Steinbergs father Michael Steinberg a bookkeeper who died in  in Deerfield Beach Fla at age  after a dozen years of living with Alzheimers disease His causes of death included cardiac arrest sepsis and pressure ulcers or bedsores but not the disease that actually killed him she said I always remember it bothered my mother said Steinberg who is now president of the Alzheimers Foundation of America in New York Its sort of a smack in the face not to see that actual cause of death on the death certificate Its not the full story of what the family has gone through Its not the full story of what the person has gone through To calculate the actual effect of Alzheimers deaths James and his colleagues studied more than  people aged  and older who are part of two large cohorts of elderly people who agreed to be tested for dementia and to donate their brains after death Over an average of eight years  patients died Some  people who didnt have dementia at the start of the study developed the disease with a median time from diagnosis to death of nearly  years The average age of the participants was  When the researchers calculated the risk of excess deaths in people who developed dementia versus those who didnt they found it was more than four times higher in people aged  to  with Alzheimers disease and nearly three times higher in people aged  and older That translates into about  deaths from Alzheimers disease in the US population older than  in  James said Thats far higher than the CDCs estimate which experts have long believed undercounted Alzheimers deaths said Keith Fargo director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimers Association We actually think this is a good number We think its an eyeopener he said We hope it reinforces the image of Alzheimers as a fatal brain disease instead of a memory problem But Robert Anderson the man behind the CDCs figures isnt so sure He acknowledges that death certificates likely underreport Alzheimers deaths but hes skeptical that the gap is as large as the new study suggests Its a stretch to extrapolate to the entire US population from a study based on  people said Anderson the chief of the CDCs mortality statistics branch I find it very difficult to believe based on a study like this that there are  deaths He said CDC figures that include underlying causes of deaths showed perhaps  mentions of Alzheimers disease on the nations death certificates The new study is important but it shouldnt be regarded as the last word on Alzheimers deaths Anderson said adding that more research is needed Still if its even possible that half a million people are dying each year from Alzheimers then funding needs to catch up experts said The National Institutes for Health    lists  billion for cancer which affects about  million people in the US and about  million for Alzheimers disease which affects about  million people By my math funding is  times higher for cancer than Alzheimers disease and per capita about four times as high said James But the point isnt a competition of diseases James emphasized Alzheimers recently drew a influx of  million through the farreaching   Still Fargo said scientists tell him that theyd need  billion a year for  years to really tackle the research that will make a difference in prevention and treatment of Alzheimers disease In the past  to  years weve been able to make major strides in terms of the death rates from cancer heart disease HIV and AIDS he said adding that such gains were a result of research attention and funding Now its time to make a similar investment in Alzheimers
