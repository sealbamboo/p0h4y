Taciturn wiry and in his s the patient was hospitalized because of a diabetic toe infection He had no other pressing health issues so those of us in training at the time expected him to go home after a few days of intravenous antibiotics Instead he died in the hospital A second infection took hold in his other foot The first infection never responded to antibiotics so he needed progressively higher amputations to control its spread All the antibiotics gave him uncontrollable diarrhea And before long he was losing weight and needed nutritional supplements like the ones sometimes administered to advanced cancer patients  
 But he seemed oddly indifferent to all the pain and discomfort it was as if he expected only to get worse  Hes not depressed a consulting psychiatrist told us when we became worried that he was sliding into a depression Its just the way he is When his heart stopped one night without warning we were left wondering why a man who should have walked out of the hospital had died instead We reviewed and analyzed the decisions we made searching for some plausible physical causes Finally one of the most senior doctors in the hospital suggested the one we would come to accept the patient never   he would live  I remembered that patient and the senior doctors explanation this week while reading a new book on outlook and health called appropriately enough  There is no shortage of books for anyone even vaguely interested in the mindbody connection Most are brimming with breezy narratives and inspirational tales helpful tips and wellworn truisms But few offer discerning analyses evidencebased recommendations or even the simple acknowledgment of just how hard believing in oneself can sometimes be  It is this wellgrounded gravitas combined with a surprisingly unassuming narrative voice and gentle wit that make Up hard to put down Dr Hilary Tindle an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and respected researcher manages deftly to weave the emerging scientific evidence linking outlook to outcome with a wealth of practical suggestions and individual stories The result is not simply another selfhelp book but a thoughtprovoking and intelligent read By her own account Dr Tindle is a struggling optimist And while it is clearly the second part her optimism that propelled her to draw up this book it is her struggle that gives it its most resonant colors She recounts being diagnosed with a lifethreatening heart condition while in college Filled with anxiety about her upcoming openheart surgery she asks her cardiothoracic surgeon if there is anything she can do to help  You already have he answers referring to her underlying belief that she can do something to influence her outcome The operation turns out to be a success and that response and her reliance on his support become Dr Tindles first lesson in the power of even mitigated optimism and the challenges of maintaining it That lesson is reinforced years later when she begins to see patients and   on the relationship between cardiovascular disease and outlook in tens of thousands of women She finds that even sedentary and obese patients with a predisposition to hypertension and high cholesterol can lose weight stop smoking start exercising and take their medications regularly if they adopt a more engaged and hopeful outlook And that optimism can dramatically decrease their risk of dying or becoming disabled by a host of diseases usually chalked up to aging Perhaps the real fountain of youth Dr Tindle concludes emanates not from a cosmetic counter but from whats between your ears To help the rest of us tap into that fountain Dr Tindle presents a program that starts with abbreviated versions of three questionnaires used in outlook research Readers must ask themselves questions like whether they tend to expect the best or rarely count on good things happening and whether they tend to become consumed by feelings of inadequacy when they fail or if they simply believe they are no different from most people  Quick to acknowledge the differences between individuals and the nuances of particular challenges that some may face Dr Tindle presents several wellproven tools like mindful self compassion to help ease the process and offers brief clear explanations of the science behind cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness and neuroplasticity the ability of brain neurons to form new connections and thus work in new ways  The problem with this compelling and helpful book is of course that pessimists naysayers and others who could benefit the most are unlikely ever to pick it up But those who do may surprise themselves by taking their medications a little more purposefully setting aside time to exercise more intentionally and feeling more than a pang of sadness when they learn toward the end of the book that the cardiothoracic surgeon who operated on Dr Tindle and who later fills in for her late father by walking her down the aisle dies in an automobile accident  That is because with Up Dr Tindle has given us the same gift he gave her  an affirmation not only of who we are but also of what we believe we can be
