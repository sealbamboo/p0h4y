Cameron Lyle has asked a lot of his body over the years but he never expected it to save the life of a stranger A shot put star on the University of New Hampshire track and field team Lyle was at the pinnacle of his collegiate athletic career when he had to make a profound decision A man with blood cancer was desperate for healthy bone marrow and Lyle was the only match on a national registry of potential donors The only problem if Lyle decided to donate it would mean missing some of the most important track meets of his senior season  Faced with cutting his career short Lyle focused only on the chance to save someones life I was surprised I was pretty happy I said yes right away Lyle  told TODAY And then afterwards I thought about everything that that meant giving up but I never had a second thought about donating If I had said no he wouldnt have had a match Lyle had all but forgotten the Be The Match Registry drive that came to his university two years ago He allowed his cheeks to be swabbed and didnt think much more of it Only  out of  people who sign up go on to donate according to the    Then two months ago he got a call Lyle was told he was a possible match for a young man with a rare form of leukemia a disease that gets worse quickly if not treated according to the National Cancer Institute Lyle underwent blood tests which confirmed he was a definite match Once he agreed to donate  something any kind of decent human being would do he said  more tests followed to make sure he didnt have any health problems Time was of the essence They gave me a pretty strict deadline because my recipient needed it pretty fast he said Everything was a go and last week Lyle headed to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston to share his bone marrow with a stranger There are two ways to harvest the cells according to the National Marrow Donor Program with most collections done in an outpatient procedure thats similar to donating blood A quarter of cases however require a surgical procedure in which doctors insert a special needle into the hollow of donors hip bone A syringe attached to the needle draws out the marrow The procedure usually requires general anesthesia and an overnight hospital stay The recipients doctor determines which method is best Lyle needed to undergo the surgical option  It took two hours for doctors to collect about two liters  some eight cups  of bone marrow from Lyles pelvic bone His body will regenerate the marrow in about two weeks Most people can return to their full activities within days after the donation according to Dr Jeffrey Chell CEO of the National Marrow Donor Program  But most people arent track stars who hurl heavy metal objects as part of their normal routine Doctors told Lyle to take it easy and not lift more than  pounds for about a month  routine advice after any surgical procedure Chell said  effectively ending his collegiate track career  This is just an incredible incredible story of what Cameron Lyle has been willing to do said Chell Since anonymity is crucial to the donor process TODAY was unable to obtain information as to the recipients condition since receiving Lyles bone marrow donation However a spokesperson for Be the Match said after a transplant recovery is gradual and usually takes several months or more Oneyear survival rates for patients who receive transplants from unrelated donors was  percent in  up from  percent in  Lyle said he was told that the man received his transplant the day after he donated but that he wont get an update on his condition for  days Until then he plans on recuperating and watching his teammates compete at the America East Conference where hed planned on going out pretty big Lyles donation also meant missing the Penn Relays and other events where he wanted to shine after eight years of shot put training But its OK he said It was worth it I would do it again too
