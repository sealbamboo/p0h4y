A new clinical trial suggests that a daily dose of a probiotic may ease digestive upset in babies Italian researchers randomly assigned  infants less than a week old to receive either a daily oral dose of Lactobacillus reuteri or an identical tasting placebo Parents recorded the daily frequency of bowel movements and spitting up as well as the amount of time babies cried inconsolably Investigators followed the families with weekly phone calls or personal meetings The   After one month the babies who got the probiotic showed a significant decrease in crying time and an increase in frequency of bowel movements compared with those who got the placebo By three months their frequency of spitting up was reduced as well The babies taking the probiotic had fewer emergency department visits and needed less medication for stomach problems Their parents lost fewer days of work and there were no adverse side effects The results were adjusted to account for the effects of breast or bottle feeding vaginal or cesarean delivery and other factors Lactobacillus occurs naturally in humans and the lead author Dr Flavia Indrio a pediatric gastroenterologist at the University of Bari in Italy said that there are thousands of strains available as supplements But the only one tested in clinical trials was the one used in this study called L reuteri DSM  she said  The probiotic has to be given in the right dose she said I do not recommend using it without consulting a pediatrician
