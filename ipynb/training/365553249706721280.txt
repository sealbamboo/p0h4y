Many people who work with startup companies say that entrepreneurs are among the healthiest people they know The reason they note may relate to the disciplined and driven personalities required for entrepreneurship along with the flexible work schedules selfemployment allows But I know a different startup story Most of my friends are men who graduated from Stanford in the past few years which is to say most of my friends are entrepreneurs And many have dropped off the map for long stretches of time only to resurface looking awful with bags under their eyes and shoulders hunched under the weight of so much responsibility I have long wondered if my friends were the exception or the rule A new analysis conducted by GallupHealthways for The New York Times using data from their WellBeing Index which assesses everything from physical and emotional health to dietary habits and life purpose paints a paradoxical picture Nationwide entrepreneurs tend to eat more healthful foods and exercise more than other workers But they also have more stress and are less likely to have health insurance The data come from random telephone interviews with more than  employed Americans across all  states conducted on most days from January  through June  Entrepreneurs defined as both selfemployed and business owners made up about  percent of the sample though the data is not separated by type of small business owner or number of years in business Diet emerged as entrepreneurs greatest health advantage Compared with other fulltime or parttime workers selfemployed business owners were slightly more likely to report they ate healthy all day yesterday or regularly eat fruits and vegetables Fiftynine percent of entrepreneurs reported they exercise for  minutes three or more days per week versus  percent of other workers and  percent reported being obese compared with  percent of other workers Believe it or not everyones not living off highsodium ramen said Joey Pomerenke cofounder of   a support organization for entrepreneurs that was launched in Seattle in May He has worked with hundreds of company founders during his career and says theres a level of freedom you dont have at a corporation that makes it easier to be active and eat well and to create a healthy work culture when building a company from scratch UP Globals employee handbook encourages employees to take advantage if the snow is deep or the lake is calling and to make up work later But Dan MacCombie a cofounder of   a Brooklynbased beverage company said the need to reassure investors of ones commitment can complicate the health picture He described a martyr complex among many entrepreneurs he knows the implicit expectation that if youre not wearing yourself a little thin youre not putting enough effort in He puts a personal priority on sleep while his business partner will go out of his way to cook an elaborate veggieheavy meal because he believes thats important A new nationwide online training group called   was designed specifically to address the unique challenges of people working in the tech industry It was cofounded by Julie Fredrickson who saw her health plummet when she started her first company and as a chief executive put on  pounds had terrible habits and was exhausted all the time she said And I grew up as a competitive athlete in Colorado She and cofounder Dick Talens explained that the scarce breaks and frequent travel required of tech entrepreneurs along with catered lunches and schmoozing over cocktails often result in decision fatigue when it comes to diet and exercise Entrepreneurship certainly has its upsides Entrepreneurs are more optimistic about their futures than other workers according to   of the WellBeing Index conducted last fall and optimism is correlated with good health in some studies The same analysis found they are also more likely to experience enjoyment and intellectual stimulation on a daily basis But entrepreneurs also report more stress and worry than other workers do and slightly more sadness both of which have been tied to worse health Edward Marks cofounder of a mobile app company called Twist said that unlike being an employee so much of your selfworth is actually invested in a company Ive seen entrepreneurs cry Lack of health insurance may deepen entrepreneurs stress Threefourths of selfemployed business owners reported having health insurance compared with  in  among other workers  the most significant difference between the two groups Likely related entrepreneurs are also less likely to visit the dentist One of the biggest reasons a wouldbe entrepreneur doesnt become one is lack of health care said Scott Gerber founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council which provides startup mentorship and resources and conducts research on entrepreneurs needs To address this problem his organization is introducing   an online platform of health insurance plans offered by major health insurers which will be compliant with the Affordable Care Act by  and are tailored for entrepreneurs The net effect of all the differences is that slightly fewer entrepreneurs report being diagnosed with health problems like high cholesterol and high blood pressure But stress remains a constant and too often ignored factor in the lives of selfemployed business owners said Carter Coberley vice president of the Healthways Center for Health Research He said these motivated gogetters either choose not to pay attention to the stress or are so focused on making their work succeed that unfortunately they ignore it to their detriment I think thats a picture thats been missing in the workforce over all he added But it appears to be exacerbated in small business owners because of additional demands
