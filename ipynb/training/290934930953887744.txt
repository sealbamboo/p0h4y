 For patients with type  diabetes the first line of defense is metformin the medication thats typically prescribed along with diet and exercise to help control blood glucose levels More than  percent of the time a person with diabetes will most likely be given   initially unless they have renal failure acute heart failure or liver insufficiency says Serge Jabbour MD director of the division of Endocrinology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia Pa But when metformin fails another class of medications called glucagonlike peptide or GLP which can help control blood sugar levels in diabetes patients GlaxoSmithKline Britains biggest drug maker is asking for US Food  Drug Administration FDA approval for a new onceweekly GLP medication called albiglutide If it is approved it will be joining three other drugs in that same class Victoza Byetta and Bydureon The drugmaker said they would make a similar submission in Europe soon   While it would be good to have another option says Spyros Mezitis MD PhD an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City  questions remain How is it going to be administered Is the   How is this going to replace other medications in terms of price Its another diabetes injectable drug and it remains to be seen how its going to be used in a crowded market GLP medications work by replacing a chemical in the intestines that helps process and absorb sugar since those with diabetes dont have enough naturally occurring GLP in their bodies The drugs work indirectly to trigger insulin through the intestines rather than the pancreas where the body normally produces insulin The three other drugs that work similarly to albiglutide are Victoza which is a daily injection Byetta a twice a day injection and Bydureon which is injected once a week like albiglutide Mezitis estimates  to  percent of his patients with diabetes are on GLPtype medications While insulin is the most direct treatment for those with type  diabetes he explains it has serious side effects like weight gain and can also lead to low blood sugar by pumping the body with too much insulin GLP medications are a step before insulin for those with severe diabetes and a step after trying pills like metformin first Mezitis says A big benefit to using some of the GLP class of medications is that they can be administered less frequently than insulin Insulin needs to be administered a few times a day says Mezitis but a drug like Bydureon or the new medication require just one injection a week Convenience is important but GLP medications do have some side effects that patients should be aware of While some weight loss is a positive side effect because GLP meds can suppress appetite they can also cause nausea vomiting and intestinal pain in some people Despite that Jabbour says they can be a good second choice in certain cases If someone fails metformin this can be a great option he says Albiglutide could help some patients because at least we have another options Jabbour adds We have Bydureon but not all patients do well on it  no drug works  percent
