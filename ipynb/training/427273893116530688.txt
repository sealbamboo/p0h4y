Unders in England are to be banned from buying electronic cigarettes the government has announced Experts say it is not yet known what harm the tobaccofree devices could inflict and that their contents could be damaging young peoples health   An estimated m people in the UK use ecigarettes which were designed to help smokers quit Ministers also plan to make it illegal for adults to buy traditional cigarettes for anyone under  While smoking rates have fallen to their lowest ever level experts fear the electronic substitutes could be encouraging teenagers to take up the habit  The batterypowered devices which can be bought online and in some pubs chemists and newsagents deliver a hit of addictive nicotine and emit water vapour to mimic the feeling and look of smoking The vapour is considered potentially less harmful than cigarette smoke and is free of some its damaging substances such as tar We do not yet know the harm that ecigarettes can cause to adults let alone to children but we do know they are not risk free Prof Dame Sally Davies Englands chief medical officer said Ecigarettes can produce toxic chemicals and the amount of nicotine and other chemical constituents and contaminants including vaporised flavourings varies between products  meaning they could be extremely damaging to young peoples health Katherine Devlin president of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association welcomed the changes in the law saying they had been asking for it for years Its high time that it was mandated in law so that it can be robustly enforced she added pointing out that product labelling made it clear ecigarettes were not for unders Antismoking charity Ash also welcomed the changes but chief executive Deborah Arnott called for a retail licensing system that would mean cigarettes could be legally sold only in shops not in car boot sales or markets The UK currently has few restrictions on the use of ecigarettes despite moves in some countries to ban them Restrictions have recently been mooted in Scotland and Wales where health policy is a devolved issue A Welsh government spokesman said on Sunday it fully supported a ban on ecigarettes for unders and was considering how such legislation could be introduced in Wales In Northern Ireland the NI Chest Heart and Stroke charity is pressing the health minister to introduce a similar ban The law change for England will be introduced in Parliament this week as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill Labour said the policy on banning cigarettes for children was a watereddown version of a policy that Labour called for last year and that buying cigarettes for children should carry the same penalty as buying alcohol for underage drinkers But it said restricting the sale of ecigarettes to unders was a sensible step From  the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is expected to license ecigarettes as a medicine in the UK  This will bring them in line with nicotine patches and gum and allow the agency to apply rules around for example the purity of the nicotine in ecigarettes MEPs have rejected calls for a blanket ban on the sale of ecigarettes across the EU However under a compromise deal strict limits will be placed on the amount of nicotine they contain and individual EU member states will be able to introduce a national ban if they see fit If three or more member states chose that path it could trigger an EUwide ban Smoking remains one of the biggest causes of death and illness in the UK with around  people dying each year from illnesses linked to the habit  Experts want to crack down on the number of young people smoking by bringing the law in line with restrictions on the sale of alcohol The new rules on adults buying cigarettes for unders could be in force by the autumn and may mean anyone caught buying cigarettes for a child could be given a  fixed penalty notice or a fine of up to  We must do all we can to help children lead a healthy life public health minister Jane Ellison said  Some  of yearolds who smoke say they usually buy their cigarettes from someone else rather than from a shop according to Department of Health figures
