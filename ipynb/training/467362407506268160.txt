Pet jerky treats mostly imported from China are now linked to more than  deaths in dogs more than  complaints about animal illness and for the first time sickness in three people who ate the products federal health officials said Friday But Food and Drug Administration officials say they still cant identify a specific cause for the reported illnesses or deaths despite  of testing and investigation The agency continues to caution pet owners that jerky treats are   for a balanced diet and encourage them to consult with their veterinarians both prior to feeding treats and if they notice symptoms in their pets FDA said in a statement The humans who consumed the treats included two toddlers who ingested them accidentally and an adult who may have been snacking on the questionable products which include chicken duck or sweet potato jerky treats an FDA official said One of the children was diagnosed with a salmonella infection which can be spread by touching contaminated pet food and treats The other child developed gastrointestinal illness and fever that mirrored the symptoms of dogs in the house that also ate the treats The adult reported nausea and headache said Siobhan DeLancey an FDA spokeswoman The agency has received about  new reports of illnesses and deaths since its last update in October some involving more than one pet The numbers now include  dogs and  cats About  percent of the cases involve symptoms of gastrointestinal trouble and liver disease  percent involve kidney disease and about  percent involve other complaints including neurological and skin conditions the FDA said About  percent of the kidney or urinary cases also tested positive for Fanconi syndrome a rare disease that has been associated with the treats Agency officials also said they were able to perform necropsies or postdeath examinations on  dogs submitted by veterinarians from across the country In half of those cases the deaths did not appear to be associated with the treats Of the remaining  cases an association with eating jerky treats could not be ruled out FDA officials said The FDA plans to join with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch a study similar to epidemiological traceback investigations used with people comparing foods eaten by sick dogs with foods eaten by pets that did not get sick Pet treats made by national manufacturers Nestle Purina Pet Care and Del Monte Foods Corp now known as Big Heart Pet Brands were returned to  recently after a voluntary recall tied to the discovery of unapproved antibiotic residue in some products last year FDA officials said they had received few reports of illness associated with those reformulated products and no Fanconi syndrome cases In response to consumer demand Milos Kitchen Chicken Grillers and other products are now made in the US with USsourced meat said Chrissy Trampedach Big Hearts director of corporate communications Overall the jerky treat illnesses and deaths have been associated with many different product brands officials said In the new report the FDA said it had detected the antiviral drug amantadine in some Chinese chicken jerky samples sold more than a year ago Officials said they dont believe the drug contributed to the animal illnesses or deaths However the drug which is used to treat Parkinsons disease and influenza in humans should not be present in jerky treats officials said The FDA has warned Chinese and domestic suppliers that amantadine is considered an adulterant which could be grounds for banning the treats for sale in the US The companies have consistently said that the treats are safe to feed as directed and theyve emphasized that despite extensive testing no specific cause of illness has been linked to the products Pet owners and veterinarians have criticized the FDA for not finding the source of the contamination more quickly and for not issuing more farreaching recalls They say theyre sure that the products are dangerous and that the reported illnesses and deaths should be more than enough proof Its really hard to look at the number of cases that come in correlate them with what theyre eating and then go away from that and say no its not related said Brett Levitzke a Brooklyn New York veterinarian who has seen more than a dozen dogs since  with Fanconi syndrome Its quite sad when you see it dawn on the people that theyre trying to reward their best buddy there and then now theyre the ones who have been making them ill he told NBC News
