Canadas Supreme Court has ruled that doctors may help patients who have severe and incurable medical conditions to die overturning a  ban  the court said the law impinged on Canadians rights  The case was brought by a civil rights group on behalf of two women Kay Carter and Gloria Taylor with degenerative diseases Both have since died The government now has a year to rewrite its law on assisted suicide If it does not the current law will be struck down Assisted suicide is legal in several European countries and a few US states  In Canada is it illegal to counsel aid or abet a suicide and the offence carries up to  years in prison Canada is not alone in grappling with the thorny issue of dying laws The debate was reignited in the United States last year by campaigner Brittany Maynard The yearold was forced to travel from California where the practice is illegal to the Oregon where it has been legal since  A legal case is now taking place    Some politicians in the UK are trying to introduce similar rules but the government does not back it  Switzerland allows assisted suicide This does not require a terminal illness but must be performed by a patient and has led to suicidetourism across Europe There is a profound gulf between those who think assisted dying is a fundamental human right and those who have ethical objections and worry about the implications for the disabled and vulnerable There are no easy answers This is one incredible day said Grace Pastine of British Columbia Civil Liberties Association which brought the case Physicianassisted dying is now recognised for what it is  a medical service that brings an end for some individuals to unbearable suffering In the ruling the justices wrote they did not agree that the existential formulation of the right to life requires an absolute prohibition on assistance in dying or that individuals cannot waive their right to life The court limited doctorassisted suicide to patients who are consenting adults who have a incurable but not necessarily terminal disease that causes enduring and intolerable suffering The justices also argued the total ban on doctorassisted suicide deprives some individuals of life as it has the effect of forcing some individuals to take their own lives prematurely for fear that they would be incapable of doing so when they reached the point where suffering was intolerable Dropping the ban was opposed by religious groups in Canada and the issue has divided the disabilityrights community in the country Lawyers for Kay Carter and Gloria Taylor had argued that the ban discriminated against them as they could not take their own life without the help of their doctors Taylor who had Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis died in  Carter had spinal stenosis a progressive compression of the spinal cord She travelled with her family to Switzerland in  to end her life
