 Three months into  chances are good that those grand plans for selfimprovement hatched at the start of the new year have become more of a dead weight Many people vow to   and exercise more stop smoking drinking or spending too much and better organize our wayward lives Research in the   has found that only  percent of New Years resolutions are maintained after one month and six months later less than half still stand Why the swift breakdown People make resolutions that are not necessarily wellcoordinated to either their ability or to reality said Peter Herman a psychology professor at the University of Toronto We know that when people make resolutions in the first place merely making the resolution energizes them That emotional positivity is really hard to sustain when you get in the hard slog  It tends to decline and shift into negativity One of the top problems with most resolutions Herman said is that theyre too broad not firmly defining what it is youre seeking to accomplish If you resolve to lose weight what does that even mean How much weight he asked Clearly concrete resolutions would be better agreed Daniel Akst a columnist for   a Long Island NY newspaper and author of   Dont resolve to be a great novelist resolve to finish a novel All isnt lost however if you find yourself backsliding on your pledges about a quarter of the way through  To get back on track Herman and Akst said people should Resolutions are much easier to follow when the steps to achieve them are almost brainless Thats why Akst is a big fan for example of diets that cut out entire food groups such as the Atkins diet which eliminates carbs or   If youre ever going to succeed at something I think you need a pretty detailed plan to offer fairly lowlevel instructions to yourself Herman said Even saying that youre going to go to the gym twice a week is vague  You want to say Im going to use the elliptical machine for X number of minutes and you probably have to talk to a trainer about what is a sensible plan for you Up the ante by telling loved ones friends coworkers and even your Facebook friends what you plan to accomplish Akst recommended Faced with embarrassment if you fail this kind of kick in the pants is a wellknown psychological tool he said Tell people to chide you when youre doing the wrong thing  it can help a lot Akst noted Just as Odysseus got men to help tie him to the mast so he wouldnt succumb to the Sirens song you can do that Socalled proximal goals are more realistic simply because they set the bar lower  like aiming for a halfpound of   a week instead of two pounds But success is also more frequent and tangible If my resolution is to write a novel Akst said a better resolution would be that Im going to write two pages a day five days a week That way each day you get to succeed and success builds success Herman also pointed out that we live in a culture not noted for training people to persist in the face of tremendous odds We want things to come fairly easy for us Trying to do something less ambitious is a rational thing to do but people are not very good at saying I bit off more than I can chew Many resolutions get derailed because of small potentially temporary setbacks that compel us to chuck our big plans altogether   at a party for example doesnt mean you cant get right back on the wagon the next day with little damage done If you decide to stop smoking but have one cigarette for some reason  does that cigarette represent a failure of your entire resolution or is it simply a blip you can get past Herman said Its not very difficult to anticipate that sort of thing but some people dont think that far ahead
