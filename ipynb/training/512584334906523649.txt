Now the federal health law requires most health insurance plans including all new plans in the individual and small group markets to provide contraceptive coverage at no outofpocket cost to women  That divergence between the Catholic court claim  that any link to contraceptive coverage is forbidden  and the actions of Catholic insurance plans is likely to draw more attention as more large Catholic hospital systems add insurance plans to their portfolios Already a bishop in Arkansas is raising questions about one of the insurers in his state  No one is keeping track of just how many Catholic health plans are entering the insurance market and selling to nonCatholics The latest entry is Catholic Health Initiatives the nations   with facilities in  states  Juan Serrano who heads CHIs new insurance subsidiary Prominence Health said in an interview that over the next year and a half Prominence plans to expand our health plan footprint into additional Catholic Health Initiative marketswhere they make the most sense  He said that as relates to the mandated benefits that are required in the marketplace we are taking the same position that has been taken by other Catholic health plans and it is to cede or contract with a thirdparty administrator who will administer the ERDrelated benefits in an arms length manner ERD refers to the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care a   from the Conference of Catholic Bishops that among other things makes contraception off limits for Catholic institutions  While CHIs thirdparty strategy might please health law advocates the bishop who heads the Diocese of Little Rock Arkansas raised a red flag when the company purchased QualChoice its first commercial plan in that state last spring  Having given this matter serious thought and prayer I am not fully convinced by CHIs reasoning that their acquisition of QualChoice will pose no moral or ethical conflicts Bishop Anthony Taylor said in a     a reproductive health advocacy group that tracks deals involving secular and religious health institutions is keeping a close eye on Catholic plans in the commercial market  Were now seeing more and more of these plans moving into the commercial market in a big way said Lois Uttley director of the group Under the Affordable Care Act these plans are supposed to be covering contraception So they have to figure out some way to get that to their enrollees despite their religious objections to contraception  MergerWatch has been closely watching how Fidelis Care a Catholicowned insurer that this year was the   on the New York state health exchange is handling reproductive health services  Fidelis has arranged for a third party to provide womens reproductive health services although thats not clear on the plans website In its   Fidelis explains it has elected not to offer all reproductive and family planning services including abortion sterilization and artificial contraception as a standard benefit nor to receive premium dollars from the State of New York for such services   Instead the company will inform these same providers that the New York State of Health Marketplace has approved Unified IPA LLC to provide New York State of Health marketplacemandated family planning services independent of Fidelis Care  The online marketplace operates under the health law offering competing plans to people who generally dont have approved employerbased coverage  A spokeswoman for Fidelis wrote in an email that health plan members need not worry about getting special access to the outside insurer because the process is seamless for members Providers simply bill the outside firm  Mike Elliott a principal with Unified IPA the outside firm says he contracts with the same providers Fidelis does and works with the same pharmacy benefit firms to ensure that prescriptions are filled without Fidelis having to participate  From the members perspective theyre getting to see the same doctor they have the same benefit packageand we utilize the same ID number as the health plan said Elliott who says he has been providing reproductive health services to religious health plans for nearly three decades  With Fidelis that process has not been exactly seamless says MergerWatch Uttley said her group called several health plans asking about contraceptive coverage and the response from Fidelis was particularly confusing The customer service woman said Well Fidelis covers contraception if you need it to regulate yourself whatever that means If you need it for other reasons you have to call this IPA  Thats troublesome said Uttley because thats confusing even to a sophisticated insurance consumer used to having health insurance and what we have now coming into the marketplace is a lot of people who have never had insurance Its enough of a challenge to get them to understand how health insurance works without having this wrinkle in it  Another problem for the group is that Fidelis unlike many other nonreligious health plans refuses to allow Planned Parenthood into its network of covered providers not even for prenatal or primary care Uttley said Its not clear to us that women enrolling in Fidelis in New York understand they cant use that coverage at a Planned Parenthood if thats been their primary source of family planning services in the past  In Arkansas the bishops concerns remain unresolved Taylor sought clarification from the Vatican and according to diocesan spokesman Dennis Lee Bishop Taylor has received a substantive response from the Vatican regarding CHIs acquisition of QualChoice and he is actively involved in ongoing private discussions with CHI on how best to comply with the Vaticans response  The issues are clearer to other Catholic health plans that dont have to meet the needs of nonCatholics in the commercial insurance market Theyre arguing in court that any participation with the contraceptive mandate is forbidden  The Little Sisters of the Poor religious order which provides longterm care services with employees insured by   is rejecting the Obama administrations   allowing religious employers to notify the government instead of their insurer that they have a religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage  Any provision of the Mandates services through the planwould violate the Christian Brothers and Little Sisters faith the lawyers argue  In the case of Christian Brothers the administration argues that because it is   it is exempt from the requirements anyway
