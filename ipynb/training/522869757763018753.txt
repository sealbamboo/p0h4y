When it comes to dieting the conventional wisdom holds that losing weight gradually is more sustainable in the long run than losing weight quickly But new results from a longterm clinical trial show that this is just another dieting myth Both fast and slow weight loss produced pretty modest results over the long term But in some respects the rapid weightloss regimen tested in the study worked better than its slowbutsteady counterpart according to a   published Thursday by the journal Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology The study involved  obese Australian adults between the ages of  and  Ninetyseven of them were randomly assigned to a strict diet that replaced breakfast lunch and dinner with   shakes By consuming only  to  calories per day their goal was to lose  of their body weight in  weeks The other  volunteers were asked to drink Optifast shakes once or twice a day and prepare their remaining meals according to the recommendations in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating This plan was supposed to lead to a  reduction in body weight over  weeks Volunteers in both groups also had meetings with dietitians and received educational materials about healthful eating Despite its austerity the extreme diet worked better for more people than the gradual diet according to the study Among the volunteers who made it to the end of the weightloss portion of the study  of those on the rapid plan lost at least  of their body weight For volunteers on the gradual diet only  achieved the same goal One of the reasons for this success was that the extreme diet was more tolerable than the gradual one perhaps because it lasted for only three months instead of nine Only  of those assigned to the rapid weightloss regimen dropped out of the study compared with  of those in the gradual program Volunteers who followed the rapid plan were getting more exercise  extra steps per day on average than their counterparts on the gradual diet an average of  extra steps per day However the gradual dieters saw bigger improvements in both waist and hip circumference The drop in BMI was virtually the same in both groups  points lower for those fueled only by Optifast and  points lower for those who got to eat at least some real food But losing weight isnt the hardest part of a diet  the bigger challenge is keeping it off So the researchers tracked the volunteers who were still part of the study for  more weeks During that time all of them were advised to follow an individualized diet for weight maintenance according to the study Of the  volunteers who completed the study all but six  five who lost weight rapidly and one who lost weight gradually  started to gain back some of the pounds they had shed Those who started with the extreme diet lost a little more than  pounds after the initial week period but gained back  of them And those who lost weight gradually dropped  pounds after  weeks but gained back  of them The net result after more than three years Those who followed the gradual diet ended up losing  pounds more on average than those who followed the rapid diet The researchers found several reasons to endorse the allOptifast diet It is simpler to follow than a gradual diet that requires people to prepare some of their own meals It produces results more quickly which may encourage people to exercise more The hormone changes detected in those on the rapid diet seemed to make them feel less hungry than their counterparts on the gradual diet And it is probably cheaper But in the end both approaches ultimately did a poor job of helping obese people lose weight in a sustainable way A strategy to suppress hunger after weight loss and therefore prevent weight regain  is still awaited the researchers concluded
