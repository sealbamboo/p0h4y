Its the latest craze for people who want to improve their mental performance zapping the brain with electricity to make it sharper and more focused Its called brain hacking and some people are experimenting with it at home The ideas not completely crazy Small jolts of electricity targeted at specific areas of the brain are used to treat diseases like epilepsy and Parkinsons typically with tiny devices that must be surgically implanted One different noninvasive technique is known as   or tDCS A lowintensity electrical current is passed through electrodes placed on the outside of the head Some   suggest that it could help treat conditions such as depression anxiety and chronic pain But whats interesting about tDCS is that anyone can do it and for reasons that have nothing to do with disease Those reasons include learning more quickly or becoming better at video games Scientists have been experimenting for a decade to see whether tDCS can help the brain learn and theyve published dozens of papers on it One   of Air Force pilots showed that those who received tDCS performed  percent better on training tests than those who received no brain stimulation This has attracted the attention of people in the gaming community who think brain hacking as they call it could help enhance their performance Take for example the   According to claims on the devices website the headset can increase the plasticity of the brain and makes the synapses fire faster allowing gamers to focus better and score higher The device isnt approved by the Food and Drug Administration and costs about  The price has prompted some gamers to try to make their own machines using simple instructions found on  Thats what Jared Seehafer did Hes a yearold medical device consultant in San Francisco who heads the   group He made his own tDCS machine using an elastic headband and a couple of electrodes Its powered by a volt battery and produces  to  milliamps of electricity approximately what it takes to light one small LED bulb Its the same amount of electricity used in the lab by researchers such as   director of the Psychology Clinical Neuroscience Center at the University of New Mexico We were interested in how can we take an average healthy person and improve their ability to learn something new says Clark With funding from the Department of Defense Clark set up an   in which subjects studied a series of complicated pictures Hidden in each was a threatening object such as a weapon or a suspicious package The goal was to see how fast the subject could spot the objects with tDCS and without it What we found says Clark is that the people who received a full dose of tDCS learned twice as much in the same hour of training as people who received a very low dose of tDCS or no tDCS at all Clark is a big believer in tDCS He thinks it could become a new kind of medicine with fewer side effects than drugs Other researchers worry that the commercial and DIY experiments are not being properly controlled Its like making your own prescription drugs at home says   a professor of biomedical engineering at the City College of New York Its the difference between a clinical drug trial thats being produced under strict quality control or having people say  Well I can go to my kitchen mix this stuff up What people would be doing at home in that situation wouldnt be safe he says But batteries and electrodes are a lot easier to come by than the chemicals in drugs That means that from a regulatory standpoint tDCS will always be harder to control says   a professor of law and bioethics at Stanford University If the FDA wanted to regulate it how in the world could they regulate something where people can buy the raw materials for  bucks and make it themselves Regulators are still trying to figure out whether tDCS has real and lasting therapeutic value Greely says After all  milliamps is such a little amount of electricity he points out Its going to take many more years of strict clinical studies to determine whether tDCS is a therapy that could be useful or just another strange footnote in the long history of medicine
