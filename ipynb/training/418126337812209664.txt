Does vitamin E help people with Alzheimers disease For years scientists have been trying to find out guessing that the vitamins antioxidant properties might be beneficial But the results from clinical trials have been mixed and    following a report that high doses of vitamin E may increase the risk of death   cautionary  Now a study suggests that vitamin E supplements may be good for some Alzheimers patients after all The benefit was not huge but for a devastating disease that has proved almost impervious to treatment it was notable  The study published in Wednesdays issue of JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association found that over a little more than two years   by about six months on average Vitamin E did not delay cognitive or memory deterioration however Instead it seemed to temporarily protect something many patients consider especially valuable their ability to perform daily activities like putting on clothes and feeding themselves  Compared with other study participants people who took vitamin E also required about two fewer hours of help from caregivers per day the researchers said  Is it really going to dramatically alter the lives of Alzheimers patients Thats unclear said Dr Scott Small director of Columbia Universitys  Alzheimers Disease Research Center who was not involved in the study But it might improve patients ability to bathe themselves and dress themselves Notably in this study highdose vitamin E appeared safe Many doctors had stopped suggesting it to Alzheimers patients after a  analysis suggested that   That analysis looked at vitamin Es effect on patients with various diseases not just Alzheimers  We were concerned about safety and we didnt find a safety problem said Dr Maurice Dysken a professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota who led the new study  Still experts including the authors said the new study did not mean that highdose vitamin E should be taken by everyone with dementia or everyone hoping to prevent it The study found benefit only in people with mild to moderate Alzheimers a result that echoes research in  showing that vitamin E   in people with moderately severe Alzheimers  But other studies have found that vitamin E failed to delay dementia in people without symptoms or with mild cognitive impairment which may precede Alzheimers  It was dead stone cold in the MCI trial said the leader of that study Dr Ronald Petersen director of the Mayo Clinics Alzheimers center You couldnt have found a closer match to placebo Dr Denis Evans a professor of internal medicine at Rush University who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study cautioned against extrapolating the results to anyone without mild to moderate Alzheimers  Does this mean that all of us who dont want to develop Alzheimers should rush out and purchase a bottle of vitamin E he said Oh please dont The study involved  veterans mostly men from  Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country The veterans were already taking drugs like Aricept for mild to moderate Alzheimers One group received  IUs of vitamin E daily much higher than the amount available in a typical supplement Other groups received memantine a dementia drug used in medications like Namenda vitamin E plus memantine or a placebo  What we hoped was that memantine would have benefit vitamin E would have benefit and combined it would have double the effect Dr Dysken said That did not happen  Only vitamin E showed a statistically significant effect Memantine was no better than the placebo at preventing decline and inexplicably the combination of memantine and vitamin E did not work either  There were other confusing results While vitamin E helped people retain their ability to perform daily functions longer it did not significantly slow their cognitive decline the defining feature of Alzheimers  That they found differences in functional measures and not the cognitive measure gives you pause Dr Petersen said  Some studies have focused more on measures of function than on cognitive scores because the ability to maintain daily routines can matter more to patients and their families Functional abilities decline for a wide variety of reasons related to aging not necessarily to Alzheimers noted Dr Evans Most experts say a truly effective Alzheimers treatment will improve both function and cognition  The new study also underscores the complexity of Alzheimers Experts could not explain why vitamin E would work in fully developed Alzheimers for example but not earlier In many conditions treatments ease symptoms at the early stages but lose effectiveness as diseases strengthen  Dr Evans and others said doctors should now consider discussing vitamin E supplements with patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease But Dr Evans said  IUs is a lot and I wouldnt recommend it unless theres some oversight by a doctor  Dr Small said that while he would not twist the patients arm to take vitamin E in the absence of anything else thats dramatic I would certainly raise this with patients Dr Petersen said he might mention it after trying the other treatments he recommends Its not a slamdunk its not a home run he said It does give some credence to the notion that highdose vitamin E might be doing something It gives doctors and patients another option to use as the disease progresses
