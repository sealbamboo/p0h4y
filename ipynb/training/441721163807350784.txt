That compound found in commercially baked bread  yep the one thats in yoga mats too  is in the news again A   from the Environmental Working Group finds that the compound azodicarbonamide is found in close to  food products from Pillsbury Dinner Rolls to Little Debbie products to Wonder Bread As you may recall the sandwich chain Subway got a lot of attention a few weeks back when it announced its plans to remove this compound  which is used to improve dough and maintain bread texture  from its bread And as we reported the   came in response to an online petition posted by the creator of the Food Babe blog The   pointed to a range of possible health concerns linked to the compound  everything from asthma to cancer But what is the evidence behind these claims Lets start with asthma and other respiratory issues The concerns about breathing problems stem from factory workers who have been exposed to high levels of azodicarbonamide But it turns out outside of this occupational exposure theres no evidence that theres any risk at all to consumers Its good to remind yourself to be more skeptical says Justin Pagano who has   that hed like to see more scientific inquiry and reasoning used in these  campaigns He says theres a generational zeitgeist among his fellow millennials to take back food from the control of large companies and demand transparency And he agrees that it is important to be asking questions about how the food we eat may influence our health Even if the questions are tough to answer Take for instance the tricky business of interpreting toxicity John Coupland a food science professor at Penn State has   about the complexities involved He explains that small amounts of two compounds semicarbazide and urethane are formed as azodicarbonamide breaks down during the baking process And its possible that these compounds may pose a risk The real question is whether these tiny concentrations in bread are toxicologically significant Coupland writes Groups such as the Environmental Working Group argue that since its not essential and it could pose health risks azodicarbonamide should be removed from the food supply This is an unnecessary chemical thats added to bread says EWG scientist David Andrews And there are viable alternatives such as ascorbic acid which is a form of vitamin C But the FDA considers small amounts of azodicarbonamide to be safe The agency long ago set an allowable level of  parts per million in dough And food scientist Kantha Shelke of Corvus Blue who works as an independent consultant to the food industry says this is reasonable After all its the dose that makes the poison And  parts per million is very very very small she says But in an era when social media can whip up a frenzy of concern food companies are becoming quick to respond to get ahead of bad publicity  regardless of the science No food company or chain wants to be associated with anything that can be remotely considered harmful Shelke says Which may explain why in the wake of Subways announcement several more manufacturers have also decided to drop azodicarbonamide from their products For instance bread maker   noted that it has already phased out the compound from its bread products And intuitively it just feels  to know that a compound used to make yoga mats is being removed from breads But maybe Im just being closedminded here For a different perspective I reached out to bakery industry consultant   She pointed out that there are many things used in industrial uses that cross over into food use as well And the assumption that its bad for you she says is just not accurate Take for instance sheet rock or gypsum It contains calcium sulfate which is also used as a food additive In fact its used to make tofu Hmmm A vegan favorite contains the same compound thats used to make drywall Who knew
