Stocked with stickysweet desserts fresh baked goods and so many of your favorite foods the supermarket can be a destination for diet disaster We visit the grocery store an average of  times a week which gives us plenty of opportunities to pick up items that can pack on pounds While shedding  pounds and counting Ive learned a few things about navigating the pitfalls of food shopping Culled from my own experience as well as advice from registered dietitians weightloss professionals and food marketing experts these tips may help you pass up the pastries the next time you head down those aisles  Picking through a small dark produce section with halfempty bins and limplooking   could make anyone head for the cookie aisle Choose a bright clean market with varied produce and lean meat selections says Heidi Reichenberger a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association ADA If it has a healthy foods section all the better  Some consumers make better choices in the evening after theyve eaten dinner and the bakery is closed while others find they have more resolve in the am hours When possible shop at the time that works best for you  Spending just  minutes mapping out your menu for the week will help you stay on track If you have the ingredients for healthy meals at home you probably wont want to order highcal takeout says Reichenberger  If youre sad mad or generally feeling blah its easy to reach for ice cream or chips Instead play upbeat music in the car or take a few moments to unwind before entering the supermarket  Head off the hungries by grabbing a delicious snack or stopping for a small fatfree frozen yogurt or smoothie before you shop says Lisa Dorfman MS RD a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and CEO of Food Fitness International in Miami Satisfied shoppers are less likely to be tempted by calorieladen impulse items  Children can undermine your best intentions explains Kenneth Herbst PhD an assistant professor of food marketing at St Josephs University in Philadelphia They may not do it by pulling out their wallets but kids are influential about what you choose to buy If shopping solo isnt an option tame the I want candy tantrums by taking toys or healthy treats to keep kids occupied Or give them responsibility for choosing healthy items  Paying with cash keeps you from splurging on extra items or calories If you take only what your shopping list requires or budget allows you cant buy unnecessary extras counsels Reichenberger  Dont assume an item is lowcal just because its near healthier foods Store managers know that healthconscious customers have been sticking to the stores perimeter for healthier choices so theyve started placing candy dip next to fruit and fatladen prepared foods next to lean meat selections About half of the foods around the perimeter are no healthier or fresher than foods in the other parts of the store says Phil Lempert aka the Supermarket Guru and author of Being the Shopper Understanding the Consumer Choice  The closer a food is to its whole state the healthier it generally is says Gay Riley registered dietitian and founder of NetNutritionistcom an online nutrition information resource In the produce department fill your basket with the most colorful varieties of each food deepgreen romaine lettuce instead of iceberg red cabbage instead of green Beat boredom by choosing mangoes or papayas instead of oranges and organic red bananas rather than bananas  Judge your food choices by the back of the package  the   label  instead of the sumptuous photos on the front says Riley Look for caloric bargains the same way you look for deals on price Opt for packaged foods meals and snacks that have two to three grams of fat per  calories which equals about  to  percent of calories from fat Since four grams of sugar equals a teaspoon she recommends bypassing cereal snacks and other processed foods that have more than five sugar grams a serving Dont forget to check the ingredients which are listed in order of most to least and avoid foods with sugars sweeteners bleached flour and hydrogenated fats and oils  Highfiber foods generally have fewer calories but they   and make you feel more satisfied Riley says Great sources include whole grains beans peas lentils and fruit Look for cereals and breads with two or more grams of fiber a serving Add beans or peas to casseroles and other dishes to make smaller servings more filling and help you reach the recommended  to  grams of fiber a day  Instead of opting for flavorless lowfat or light options which often have as many calories as their fullfat counterparts choose foods with rich flavors such as sharp Cheddar cheese over mild and extravirgin olive oil over virgin or light varieties Youll enjoy the flavor while using far less of the product says Nelda Mercer MS RD a registered dietitian and coauthor of High FitLow Fat  Purchase the makings for lighter versions of your favorite takeout dishes If you crave Mexican food keep ingredients for vegetarian chili and lowfat chicken fajitas on hand When you feel like having takeout whip up one of these satisfying dishes instead A rich but healthier spinach lasagna or mock fried chicken can make you feel satisfied but youre not getting the high amounts of fat sodium and calories that you would by eating the restaurant version says Mercer    fruit drinks and even mealreplacement drinks can be bad news for your weightloss plan Theres a fair amount of research that says mealreplacement drinks arent nearly as satisfying as eating a meal says Sue Moores MS RD a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the ADA Youll often find yourself back at the table still hungry Also bypass soft drinks for sparkling water or seltzer with a splash of citrus and choose the whole fruit which will also give you a healthy dose of fiber over its juice counterpart  Breakfast eaters tend to have an easier time with weight loss Theyre better able to manage their cravings throughout the day explains Mercer The best breakfasts include two or three different food groups she says A bag of trail mix that contains readytoeat wholewheat breakfast cereal nuts and dried fruit coupled with a container of lowfat yogurt or skim or soy milk is a great pick The carbohydrates will give you energy while the protein will stave off hunger longer  If you really cant eat just one pass by the chips cookies or other foods that tempt you to overindulge Instead save those foods for special occasions or buy individual portions such as singleserving bags of potato chips or individual ice cream bars so you dont have the option to eat a largerthanrecommended portion says Mercer  For quick visits choose a basket instead of a cart and pick out your heaviest items first Your arms will get a workout and you wont be inclined to linger  Its easy to do the grab and toss when your cart comes with you Park your wheels at the end of the aisle and walk back and forth to retrieve the products you want Youll get more steps in and think twice before grabbing those impulse items  As you unload your purchases lift reinforced bags to work your biceps while you walk quickly back and forth from the car Youll increase your heart rate while putting your purchases away  Instead of tossing meat in the freezer and stuffing cans and boxes in the pantry organize your shelves cabinets and refrigerator so that healthier foods are within easy reach and more dangerous options are out of sight  Use a marker to label boxes and cans with calorie counts or diet exchange numbers For instance if youre on Weight Watchers write the Points per serving on the package Dividing food into serving sizes can also save time in meal preparation and help you properly judge portions says Reichenberger  If youre feeling pressure from the family to stock up on unhealthy options explain your weightloss goals and ask for their support After all the healthy changes youre making are good for all of you says Mercer
