A Shots post earlier this week by NPRs John Ydstie detailed the family glitch in the Affordable Care Act Thats where people who cant afford their insurance at work arent eligible for help in the new insurance exchanges Many of these Americans most of whom make middling incomes will remain uninsured That   got us wondering Who else is getting left out by health law And who is getting coverage Official government statistics wont be out until next year but   including   from the Urban Institute all agree that between September  and September  the percentage of adults who are uninsured dropped by about by about a third That translates into about  million more people getting health insurance during the year That number is considerably larger than the just under   or so people reported to have bought coverage at a health exchange The difference arises because some customers buying from an exchange were people who previously bought their own insurance They werent uninsured but their plans might have been newly canceled or they shopped in the exchanges to get a subsidy There were also several million who got coverage through the Medicaid program in states that   And some people picked up jobbased coverage as the economy continued to improve A series of   looking at who got coverage found that the biggest gains have come among groups that had the lowest rates of insurance These groups include young adults who are just starting out in the job market people of color people in states that expanded their Medicaid programs people with lower incomes and people in rural areas Another interesting trend is that the uninsured rate fell more for women than for men Thats a little unexpected because the Medicaid expansion allows lowincome men who arent parents to qualify for the first time Women who are pregnant or mothers of young children have long been eligible so there was a bigger pool of uninsured men who could gain coverage Who does this leave out Several diverse groups The biggest is probably   They are not eligible by law to purchase coverage in the health exchanges and in most cases theyre not eligible for Medicaid Its also worth mentioning that President Obamas executive order from last month   under the Affordable Care Act The next big group is adults with low incomes who arent disabled and arent parents and who live in the  states that havent expanded the Medicaid program The   to extend Medicaid to all lowincome people so youre not eligible to buy coverage on the exchanges if your income is under the federal poverty line which is about  for an individual this year In  the Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion was   a little under half the states have opted to decline the federal governments offer to pay nearly all the cost of that expansion Those states  including Texas Florida and Georgia  have all told several million residents in the   Then there are the people who fall into the socalled   They can theoretically afford their own individual coverage but find that insuring the rest of the family is too expensive Yet because of the way the law is written those family members arent eligible for subsidies in the exchanges And finally there are people who dont want coverage and particularly dont want to be required by the government to buy it and other people who still dont know that if they dont get health insurance one way or another they may have to pay a fine next year In fact many of those who remain uncovered wont have to pay any fines There are lots of   to the rules for who will have to pay tax penalties for not having coverage People who are undocumented are exempt as are people who dont earn enough to have to file federal income taxes Also youre exempt if the least expensive insurance would cost more than  percent of your income And there are other casebycase exemptions for people who can claim financial hardships The bottom line is this Framers of the health law never expected it to cover everyone Instead their aim continues to be to get the insured rate up to around  percent
