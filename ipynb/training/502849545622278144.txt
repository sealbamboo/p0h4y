Taco night is nothing new but over the last five days weve had taco week The markets are piled high with irresistible produce  summer squash tomatoes green beans corn peppers and chiles greens and  herbs  and corn tortillas are a great vehicle for them 
Weve seen enough taco trucks especially here in Los Angeles the home of the Korean taco to know that you can wrap a warm tortilla around just about anything and call it a taco I leave the kimchi out of my own though I did make one unconventional filling with tofu a sort of picadillo  cooked and mashed in a salsa ranchera that proved to be irresistible and stick to the Mexican seasonings I love  chiles and cilantro cumin and chili powder and  salsas Vegetables were the focus of each filling and all of this weeks tacos are vegetarian I combined sweet corn and green beans in one and roasted peppers squash and potatoes seasoned with cumin and chile powder in another I grabbed chard from my garden for a few of the fillings and made  use of this summers bounty of squash 
I love the flavor of corn tortillas and theyre a godsend for friends who have trouble with gluten I buy them in packs of three dozen then divide  the packages so  I can freeze them by the dozen because  I usually dont use  tortillas in a week though this week I did As for how much filling to count on for each taco I follow Rick Baylesss advice and use about a quarter  cup As he  says tacos are as much about the tortilla as they are about the filling and you wouldnt want to overwhelm the tortilla any more than youd want to overwhelm pasta with too much sauce
