Even when police interrogators left the room cameras kept recording the teenage suspects Some paced Several curled up and slept One sobbed loudly hitting his head against the wall berating himself Two boys left alone together discussed their offense joking What none did however was exercise his constitutional rights It was not clear whether the youths even understood them Therefore none had a lawyer at his side None left though all were free to do so and none remained silent Some  percent made full confessions and  percent made incriminating statements These were among the observations in   ages  to  from  police departments around the country The research published in Law and Human Behavior adds to accumulating evidence that teenagers are psychologically vulnerable at the gateway to the criminal justice system Youths some researchers say merit special protections If kids are making these poor decisions because their development is not complete then to penalize them with longterm legal consequences is unfair said the studys author Hayley MD Cleary an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and a developmental psychologist specializing in adolescents and the law Research about adolescents during interrogations is usually drawn from laboratory experiments surveys or court records Only a few researchers have had access to actual encounters typically   Dr Clearys study is the first to examine interrogations from a variety of jurisdictions The sample however is small and limited to agencies that willingly provided videos 
 One reason the researchers focused on interrogations is that   But the validity of a juveniles confession can be questionable Was it given voluntarily with the teenager really grasping the consequences of admitting the crime Was it true Teenagers studies show are   that have longterm impacts Adolescents are more oriented to the present so they are less likely than adults to be thinking about the future consequences of what theyre saying said   a professor of psychology at Temple University who writes about teenagers in the justice system and was not involved in this study Teenagers he added are also less likely than adults to know that the police can lie during interrogations The police often promise kids things in the present If you just tell me you did it you can go see your mom  he continued And because the brains reward systems are hypersensitive during adolescence that immediate reward of confessing will trump the thinking of What will happen when I come back to court in a month  Moreover research shows that teenagers aged  and younger   They are very suggestible so that during an interrogation they are more likely than adults   In Dr Clearys study the average age of the juveniles almost all boys was about  In nearly every interview the door was shut to the interrogation room with the suspect sitting in a corner and the interrogator between the youth and the door In half the cases the interrogator had a visible weapon In  percent the suspects were handcuffed or in leg shackles The interrogations were frequently interrupted with other interviewers coming and going The teenager often was left alone One interrogator came and went  times Dr Cleary speculated that interruptions could heighten a suspects anxiety but they could also afford him mental breaks A significant concern about interrogations of juveniles has been   such as the Miranda warnings Dr Steinberg once asked a yearold about the right to remain silent In his new book Age of Opportunity Lessons From the New Science of Adolescence he recounts how the boy who recognized the Miranda warnings from watching Law  Order replied It means that you dont have to say anything until the police officer asks you a question Some jurisdictions require that parents be present for interrogations of teenagers In Dr Clearys study only  suspects were accompanied by parents during portions of the interviews whose duration ranged from six minutes to five hours with the average about  minutes But if parents are not legally savvy their presence   In the videos five parents remained largely silent Some lectured their children and then questioned them taking on the interrogators role A few parents urged their children to come clean inadvertently sealing their fate Parents have conflicting roles Dr Cleary said They want to defend their children against accusations of wrongdoing But we also socialize children to obey the law and tell the truth Some parents might have felt compelled to use the situation as a teachable moment or they might have felt their parenting skills were being threatened Dr Cleary said Its not fair to put parents in that situation particularly without a lawyerBut how do parents balance encouraging children to respect authority against the harm that can befall them by speaking with interrogators Dr Steinberg suggests that parents tell teenagers If youre being questioned by police because they think youve done something bad say you need to talk to your parents first Parents can decide whether to call a lawyer Citing recent research the American Psychological Association   including teenagers during interrogations The recommendations include limiting the length of interviews videotaping them in their entirety assuring that teenagers are always accompanied by a lawyer and that interviewers be trained to reduce the risk of eliciting false confessions from impressionable suspects such as youths This spring the International Association of Chiefs of Police a law enforcement coalition along with the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention developed   Drawing from developmental research the program instructs officers to explain Miranda warnings in language teenagers will understand and not to make false promises of leniency because of youths proclivity toward gullibility We want to avoid involuntary or false confessions from juveniles said   director of research for the association The ultimate goal is to get accurate information from them And if you dont understand juvenile brain development the likelihood is that youll get bad information
