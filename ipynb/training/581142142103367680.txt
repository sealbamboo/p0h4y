Hearts kidneys and other donated organs have added more than  million years to the lives of the American patients who received them according to a new analysis That   published this week by the journal JAMA Surgery covers  years of organ donation in the US Researchers started with  the year when the   began keeping track of all organ transplants in the US Between Sept   and Dec    patients received a donated organ or perhaps two Another  patients were put on the UNOS waiting list but didnt get an organ By comparing the outcomes for patients in both groups the researchers were able to calculate how much longer the transplant recipients lived as a result of their new organs So far that number adds up to  years  a stellar accomplishment according to the study authors And that number will keep on getting bigger as long as any of the transplant recipients are still alive More than half of those extra years   of them  have been lived by people who had kidney transplants the researchers calculated Another  extra years have been lived by recipients of new livers and  years have been lived by people who got new hearts The other beneficiaries included people who received new lungs  extra years a new pancreas  extra years a pancreas and a kidney  extra years and intestines  extra years The analysis does not include patients who had rare kinds of transplants such as heartpancreas transplants and liverlung transplants because there were too few of these procedures to be able to make good comparisons with patients who needed such transplants but didnt get them The researchers also calculated the number of years gained per patient based on the type of transplant they received By this measure heart transplants were the most successful giving patients an extra  years on average Patients who had a combined   transplant to treat kidney failure due to type  diabetes lived an average of  years longer than their counterparts who went on the wait list but didnt get new organs Kidney recipients averaged  extra years liver recipients averaged  extra years intestine recipients averaged  extra years and pancreas recipients averaged  extra years according to the study These results may cause some people to rethink the benefits of organ transplants the researchers wrote For instance a kidney transplant is often viewed as merely a lifeenhancing surgery since someone who doesnt get a new kidney can make do on dialysis But with a typical kidney transplant patient benefiting more than a typical liver transplant patient the operation should be considered a lifesaving procedure they wrote The same argument can be made for transplants involving a pancreas which are sometimes viewed as simply a convenient insulin replacement therapy they added All of this good news was tempered by one statistic however only  of patients sick enough to be put on the UNOS waiting list are able to get new organs according to the study That means more people need to be willing to   The critical shortage of donors continues to hamper this field the researchers wrote If more donors come forward and more transplants are performed Americans can make good on the tremendous potential to do even more good for humankind in the future
