Lynne Cox has spent more than four decades swimming past the known limits of human capacity Driven by an explorers voracious desire to do what has never been done and frankly obsessive about mental and physical preparation she has completed scores of pioneering swims most famously the frigid Bering Strait in just a suit cap and goggles Now she has channeled her vast expertise on the dangers joys and logistics of open water swimming into a new book aimed at the exploding ranks of triathletes and other swimmers who are escaping the safe confines of pools The book   Vintage  brings together research and advice from a range of experts including marine biologists meteorologists hypothermia scientists emergency medical teams and even the famously secretive Navy SEALs She weaves in details and cautionary advice relating to her own swims and those of others like Steve Irwin the Australian environmentalist television star who died while swimming at the Great Barrier Reef when a stingray stung his chest Applying acid such as orange juice urine or vinegar does not have any effect on the sting A boys plunge into a freshwater lake in Finland results in an ear infection which it turns out was caused by algae growing in his ears Earplugs might have helped The publication could hardly be better timed A steep rise in the popularity of triathlons has been swelling the ranks of open water events Some  people dashed into the surf off Los Angeles in early August for the twomile   up from  in  In New York more than  swam around   and some  people circumnavigated Manhattan in relays this summer But Ms Cox  knows something many of them may not grasp Venturing into wild water is a highrisk endeavor The exertion can be intense The environment  a confluence of wind waves sun creatures and self  is unpredictable Swimmers can inhale too much water lose too much body heat overheat underhydrate become disoriented Exiting an ocean swim through surf can subject the swimmer to a maddening swirl of currents and bonebreaking beatings from crashing waves These situations she relates firmly can be lifethreatening This summer a yearold British woman   after collapsing near the end of the mile crossing from England to France In  a yearold Pennsylvania man   near the finish of a kilometer swim in the warm waters off the United Arab Emirates So Ms Cox the product of an artist mother and a father who was a Marine tempers vision and enthusiasm with methodical unstinting effort I could think that I could do it and thats a great way to help prepare she said at a   at Googles New York headquarters But if I dont physically train to do it then mentally Im not prepared to do it and physically and mentally I cant do it So she includes training advice for beginner intermediate and advanced swimmers starting with shorter swims of one to three miles and beefing up the miles and intensity for those aiming at the Catalina channel or the Strait of Magellan What makes for a trusty crew for distance events One crucial factor there must be one person in charge at all times though the role can be serially occupied If a swimmer is in jeopardy whether from the perilous water conditions physical exhaustion or threatening critters there must be no arguing among the crew over what to do Almost  pages are devoted to marine organisms to look out for including what to do if a swimmer is afflicted by jellyfish stingrays or tiny irritants that cause socalled seabathers eruption Sharks get their own chapter Good advice Be careful what you wear If swimming near seals or sea lions dont wear a black suit or a predator might mistake you for dinner Jewelry or metallic swimsuits can attract sharks too The book also includes the Navy SEALs fivepage Risk Assessment Worksheet which rates the likelihood and effects of  hazards among them swimmerinduced pulmonary edema seldom critical and even ambulance stuck in sand seldom catastrophic Part of the point is real safety and part is clearing the mind she said If you think about the energy you use being anxious she said just think about how much faster you could be in your race You dont have to know Ms Cox long to discover that she relishes  her time in the water and even the moments of danger In the opening chapter of the manual a paean to outdoor immersion she writes of water song the music of breath body wind and waves And she offers a benediction elegant in its simplicity to readers who take up the challenge to leave water within walls and head out into the unknown For many of you the open water will become a haven a favorite place to visit and many of you will discover that no matter where you are in the world it will always be a place where you feel at home  an editor on the foreign desk of The New York Times is a longtime openwater swimmer
