Barker looked down at a picture of Christian on her lap She started to cry but regained enough composure to describe how her son was diagnosed eight years ago with a rare form of leukemia when he was  A bone marrow transplant was supposed to help but instead the donors cells attacked Christians body Christians graftversushost disease was quickly getting worse His life was on the line Nothing was working  The Barkers searched for studies he could join but found none Christians doctors desperately wanted to try an experimental drug but first the FDA had to give its blessing   The Barkers and their doctors begged the agency to allow Christian to use the medicine By the time permission was given more than three weeks had passed and the graftversushost disease had moved to stage  the most severe stage Christian died two months later During a panel discussion at a conference on rare diseases Barker says the FDA official noted it can be helpful to lobby ones congressman to get access to experimental drugs  She was stunned by that comment She thought back to Christians final weeks on earth As the disease ravaged his body he bled and vomited constantly Around the clock she changed her sons bloody boxer shorts and bed sheets My son was dying He was hemorrhaging four liters of blood a day When exactly was I supposed to call my congressman Barker told CNN The FDA program that allows patients to use experimental drugs is called compassionate use Barker wonders as do many others if there might be a way to make it a little more compassionate No FDA official at that meeting in February ever suggested that anyone should lobby their congressman to get access to a compassionate use drug says Stephanie Yao a spokeswoman for the agency  Richard Klein the director of the FDAs patient liaison program who was on the panel at that meeting told CNN hes pleased with the compassionate use program  I think the system works pretty well the way it is he says  Many would beg to differ  After Dr Darshak Sanghavi wrote a   he was heartbroken to receive desperate emails seeking his advice on how to navigate the program  Their stories were really sad he says Theres clearly a need for some sort of an improved process  Sanghavi a fellow at the Brookings Institution is convening a closeddoor meeting later this month that will include senior pharmaceutical executives a patient advocate an ethicist and a lawyer at Harvard and Mark McClellan the former commissioner of the FDA  Many drug company executives agree that the system is deeply flawed A main complaint is when patients take to social media and make very public campaigns to get the drugs they want Last month   and made headlines around the world Josh Hardys parents took to Twitter and Facebook when the drug company Chimerix denied their request for an experimental antiviral drug to save Joshs life After receiving death threats from Joshs army  executives had to hire security guards  Chimerix   and granted Josh and other patients like him access to the drug Now that hes had the medicine   and hes been moved out of the intensive care unit In light of that case a biotechnology industry group BIO has decided to take another look at the issue says Sara Radcliffe BIO executive vice president  The situation in which people make pleas on social media standing by the childs bedside wondering whats going to happen tomorrow is a horrible horrible situation says a senior source in the biotechnology industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation  We should be doing better than that the source added We all feel something has to change But the question is  what FDA officials say that since  theyve approved more than  of requests for compassionate use drugs Denials have come almost completely from the drug companies themselves  Nathan Traller knows this all too well His daughter Nathalie  has a rare cancer called alveolar soft part sarcoma and has tried and failed every available treatment The cancer which started in her brain is now in in Nathalies pancreas lungs abdomen intestines and bones  It really couldnt get much more widespread her father says The Trallers reached out to three drug companies asking for use of their experimental cancer drugs All three said no  Two of the companies Merck and BristolMyers Squibb declined to discuss Nathalies case with CNN BristolMyers Squibb issued a statement about patients in general who have no other treatment options It is exactly with those patients in mind that through regulatory approval we work to ensure broad access to our medicines as quickly as possible while also remaining mindful of protecting patient safety CNN spoke with a representative of Genentech the manufacturer of antiPDL the drug Nathalie was denied It really comes down to the fact that we dont have drug supply Krysta Pellegrino said Should we have additional supply in the future its absolutely something we would think about Cant they make more of the drug Not right now Pellegrino answered Why not Because Nathalie isnt the only person whos asked for antiPDL she explained In the past year Genentech has received about  requests Genentech made enough of the medicine for the  people who have been involved in clinical trials  would making more be too expensive Its not a matter of money Pellegrino said Its that antiPDL is complicated to make and Genentech has limited manufacturing capacity Would we have to just for example not manufacture Herceptin in order to manufacture this Pellegrino said naming Genentechs blockbuster breast cancer drug Is she saying that if Genetech made antiPDL for Nathalie and patients like her some breast cancer patients wouldnt get their Herceptin  No Pellegrino answered not necessarily  So what is she saying  We dont have current supply at this time to consider opening a compassionate use program she repeated  Later Pellegrino sent an email saying that making additional antiPDL at this time would mean not being able to make other medicines including those for people with breast colon and lung cancers and investigational medicines being studied for Alzheimers and other diseases  Vickie Buenger isnt quite buying it Sure supply might sometimes be an issue especially for smaller pharmaceutical companies she says But in some cases the lackofsupply argument which is frequently used by drug companies falls short a bit Buengers yearold daughter died of cancer five years ago and since then she formed the Coalition Against Childhood Cancer and helps advise parents seeking compassionate use  Buenger who teaches at Texas AM University with a joint appointment at Mays Business School and the professional program in biotechnology understands that as currently configured perhaps production lines really cant satisfy compassionate use requests But could that be changed  Its like making cupcakes You can only make  at a time because the pan only holds  But that doesnt mean you cant make more than  You just have to change the way youve set up the situation she says  She and other observers think there may be different reasons why drug companies often say no to compassionate use  First compassionate use patients cant be counted as study subjects so they dont contribute to the clinical trials that need to be done to get a drug on the market Second compassionate use patients are very very sick and have failed at multiple treatments They could very well fail on the experimental drug too Companies fear that a death  especially if its a child  could turn the public and the FDA against them Drug industry executives dispute this second point They say they often grant compassionate use to extremely sick patients although they wont say how many requests they deny and how many they allow But they do agree that servicing compassionate use requests in general can divert them from their goal which is to get the drug on the market where it can help anyone who needs it   Companies have an ethical obligation to develop drugs and biologics for patient populations and bring them to market as fast as possible BIO   about compassionate use underlining the sentence for emphasis  Nathan Traller Nathalies father has spent a good part of the last seven months on the phone with pharmaceutical executives trying to convince them to let his daughter try their experimental drugs He thinks Buenger is right  drug companies view compassionate use patients like Nathalie as a distraction as something that sidetracks them from their real work Were just a pain to them Thats really the landscape he says He wonders if there might be some way to reform compassionate use so the drug companies benefit too Is there a way to make it a winwin for the patient and the company Dr Aaron Kesselheim doesnt have an answer but he thinks he might have a path Kesselheim an internist and ethicist at Harvard Medical School whos been invited to the Brookings meeting later this month says the FDA should think about ways to tweak the system so that information gleaned from compassionate use patients might help a drug companys application to market a new drug In the end thats what ended up working in the Josh Hardy situation After the outcry on social media the FDA agreed to allow Josh Hardy and other patients like him to become study subjects Josh won and so did Chimerix Kesselheim offers this simile A drug company wants to make just enough medicine for its clinical trials and not much more just as a wedding caterer wants to make just enough food for the guests and not much more While he doesnt want to insult compassionate use patients in this story they are fraternity brothers crashing a wedding Lets say  people are supposed to show up at a wedding and on the day of the wedding the grooms  frat brothers show up and want dinner They cant get it because the caterer didnt make  pieces of fish he says But lets say there was a national policy that all wedding caterers had to plan for frat brothers crashing weddings Then caterers would build it into their plans to accommodate  extra guests They would build it into their costs he adds   Any requirements about feeding fraternity brothers would be across the board so no one caterer would get an advantage The same would be true for drug companies supplying medicine to compassionate use patients  It might make them less skittish about making drugs available if they all had the same set of rules Kesselheim says And who knows Just as those fraternity brothers might add something to the party instead of just disturbing it the compassionate use patients might just add something to the companys FDA application instead of just bogging it down Thats what Nathalies father wants Im not trying to divert the whole system to benefit my daughter he says All Im saying is look at the system now Is this really the best we can conceive of Its really a headscratcher to me and Im sure its probably a headscratcher to other people too
