I was fighting a rat for the remnants of a corn dog Id salvaged from the trash Thats when I realized Id crossed the final line I had drawn I had told myself as long as I dont shoot up Im OK As long as Im not homeless Im OK But now I was shooting up and homeless and there was nowhere left to draw I had reached the bottom line of my existence I was constantly searching for something outside to fix how I felt inside My first memory of that need was when I was about  My parents had divorced and I was living with my grandmother We had a difficult relationship I wasnt fitting in at school and I was overweight I went into her kitchen pantry and ate an entire container of icing I put the lid back on and placed it exactly where I had found it Before long I began to make excuses so I could hide in the pantry When I went back to my father we moved around I never stayed in the same school for more than a year I was always the new and awkward tall kid and I learned to downplay my intelligence in order to fit in Drugs and alcohol helped me feel at peace with myself and opened the door to being liked by other kids I tried anything I could get my hands on pot alcohol crack hallucinogens pills belladonna seeds and household products that I could huff Only new and stronger chemicals masked how I truly felt about myself unwanted unworthy useless and ugly Eventually substance abuse became the common denominator among the people I allowed in my life If you did not use then I didnt have time for you My judgment began to deteriorate I found myself in places I didnt want to be and doing things I didnt want to do I would get in cars with strangers and drive to another state just on the promise of getting high It is only by the grace of God that I think I was able to survive When I was  I had a daughter but even the unconditional love of a child couldnt coax me away from the demon of addiction When she was  she went to live with her father I sold just enough drugs to cover the cost of what I was using I was now living with others in a riverbed under a freeway overpass The drainage would bring large deposits of aluminum cans which we would exchange for money I was now an IV meth user and couldnt fathom how my life could get any worse I didnt have the courage to kill myself but I also couldnt muster the will to stop using My th birthday was the worst day of my life I remember begging whomever would listen to either kill me or save me but dont leave me here in hell I remember the next day like it was yesterday I felt like a cockroach crawling out from under the bridge that morning When my eyes adjusted to the sun I saw the police officers I had already had many runins with the law and for a moment I weighed whether I could outrun the police this time But my body was just too tired I knew I was again going to prison But strangely this didnt bother me I felt a great weight lift off my shoulders Somehow deep in my heart I knew that I was ready to never live this way again I did my time and with the help of my family I was paroled into a residential treatment center The day I walked in was truly the first day of the rest of my life My mind was ready to embrace the idea of a second chance At a step meeting at the center one night I heard a woman talk about an insatiable hunger she felt in the pit of her stomach  a hunger that could never be filled by any food only drugs She called this hole a spiritual void At that instant I felt like a piece of my puzzle had finally snapped into place I wasnt alone There were others who felt the void and who were waking up every day to fight to stay clean While in treatment I went back to school I was  Within two years I graduated from community college I took out student loans and transferred to a university where I graduated magna cum laude with a bachelors degree in business administration I went after my recovery like I did my drugs and found I was able to accomplish anything I truly wanted Today I work with women who serve their prison sentences in residential treatment along with their children My path to recovery led me to a job where my experience could help others and that is why I feel my life hasnt been wasted I hope I can continue counseling those who share my story I hope I can continue to build my fragile relationship with my daughter And sometimes I just hope
