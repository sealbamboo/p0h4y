Conclusive tests show a Spanish nursing assistant infected with Ebola is cured of the virus, doctors said Tuesday, signaling a huge step forward in her 15-day battle for survival.. Four blood tests over the past four days indicated Teresa Romero's system had eliminated the virus, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas of Madrid's Carlos III hospital. He added that Romeo will no longer have to be kept in isolation but will be closely monitored for after effects of the virus.. The family spokeswoman for Romero, Teresa Mesa, said the nursing assistant could remain hospitalized for about two more weeks. Romero, 44, tested positive Oct. 6. She received plasma from a recovered Ebola patient, but health authorities have disclosed no more treatment details.. Romero still doesn't know that Spanish health authorities approved the killing of the couple's mixed breed dog named Excalibur on Oct. 8 instead of isolating the pet. Nor is she aware of the global interest in her case, Mesa said.. Romero's husband and 14 other people who came into contact with her when she felt feverish after treating Pajares are hospitalized under observation. None has shown Ebola symptoms.
