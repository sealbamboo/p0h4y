When a lean healthy physically active person has a   seemingly out of the blue the cause may well be a heart rhythm abnormality called   Such was the fate of Pamela Bolen of Brooklyn then  who said she collapsed last year at home Luckily her husband Jack heard her fall called an ambulance and within minutes she was at New York Methodist Hospital There she was given the drug   or tPA to dissolve the clot that was blocking circulation in her brain The treatment spared her lasting disability I had   which was completely controlled with medication but I didnt know I had   until I had a stroke Ms Bolen said in an interview The condition slows blood flow from the heart and was the likely cause of the clot that resulted in her stroke About three million Americans have atrial fibrillation characterized by multiple irregular electrical signals that cause the hearts upper chambers the atria to contract rapidly without their usual coordination This sends an erratic signal to the ventricles the lower chambers that supply blood to the lungs and rest of the body People with the disorder face a much higher risk of stroke and most require treatment to prevent this potentially crippling and sometimes fatal consequence As many as one in five or six strokes is due to atrial fibrillation and in a lot of these people the rhythm disorder was undetected before the stroke said Dr Christian T Ruff cardiologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston who studies new treatments for the disorder People with symptomatic Afib as it is commonly called may experience periodic   a sense that the heart is pounding or fluttering     unusual fatigue or   Afib can show up during an   or EKG but because the abnormal rhythm may not occur all the time people suspected of having the condition usually must wear a   for days or weeks to obtain a certain diagnosis This small portable device connected to electrodes on the chest continuously records the hearts rhythm and sends the data to a doctor or company for evaluation Afib is more common in men tall people and the elderly As the population ages the incidence is rising more than  new cases are diagnosed annually a number expected to double in the next  years The condition is also becoming more prevalent at any age experts say because of a rise in three leading risk factors  high blood pressure   and   These   Dr Ruff wrote last year in the journal Circulation Other risk factors include a prior heart attack     excessive alcohol consumption abnormal heart valves lung disease and congenital heart defects Researchers at the University of California San Francisco reported this month in Annals of Internal Medicine that people with a high rate of premature atrial contractions which can be detected by a Holter monitor worn for  hours face a significantly increased risk of developing Afib   the senior author and director of clinical research at UCSFs cardiology division theorized that eradicating these premature contractions with drugs or a procedure that destroys the malfunctioning area of the heart   Step  in treating Afib is to identify and correct reversible risk factors Step   and most important according to Dr Ruff  is to prevent blood clots from forming by treating patients with anticoagulants The most commonly prescribed and least costly treatment is   also known by the brand name Coumadin in use for more than half a century But while highly effective at reducing the risk of stroke warfarin is a very tricky drug It interacts with a number of foods especially those like spinach and kale that are rich in vitamin K and other drugs that a patient may have to take People metabolize warfarin at different rates making it necessary to repeatedly check a patients clotting ability to reduce the risk of excessive   while maintaining an effective anticoagulant level Dr Ruff said that more than half of Afib patients were either not on an anticoagulant or on an ineffective dose Fearful of a hemorrhage in the brain or uncontrolled bleeding in an accident or emergency surgery doctors may prescribe an amount of warfarin insufficient to prevent a stroke he said This concern has spurred the development of several other anticoagulants that are considerably safer and easier to take but also far more expensive than the generic warfarin The Food and Drug Administration has already approved three such medications    Eliquis   Pradaxa and   Xarelto  and others are being studied Patients with Afib are also often prescribed drugs to normalize the rate and rhythm of the hearts contractions Ed Goldman  of Manhattan who was found to have Afib  years ago takes   Cordarone and   Calan and other brand names and said in an interview that he rarely experienced a slight increase in his heart rate Sometimes an   to the heart called   is used to restore a normal rhythm For some patients however neither medication nor cardioversion is able to maintain normal heart rhythm An invasive procedure called   is needed to knock out the area or areas of the heart sending out errant signals A catheter is inserted into a vein usually through a small cut in the groin and snaked up to the heart Small electrodes placed in the heart identify malfunctioning areas which are then destroyed Last year   an electrophysiologist at the University of California San Diego and coauthors described a way to more accurately identify the electrical hot spots in the heart responsible for an abnormal rhythm Ablating those regions was   with ablation the team reported in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology But even when all traces of Afib are eliminated Dr Ruff said continued treatment with an anticoagulant is needed to guard against stroke Once a person has had Afib there is an increased risk of stroke even if their heart is in normal rhythm he said
