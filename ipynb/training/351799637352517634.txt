Milk Celebrities are constantly asking if youve got any because as the longrunning ad campaign says it does a body good But a Harvard pediatrician is arguing that the   of three servings of dairy a day isnt necessarily onesizefitsall For some it may be a significant source of additional sugar and calories   This recommendation to drink three cups a day of milk  its perhaps the most prevailing advice given to the American public about diet in the last half century says David Ludwig who wrote the editorial published online today in the journal JAMA Pediatrics Ludwig is the director of the   at Boston Childrens Hospital As a result Americans are consuming billions of gallons of milk a year presumably under the assumption that their bones would crumble without them Drinking reduced fat milk in particular is recommended as a way Americans can meet dairy intake guidelines and also avoid saturated fat which is linked to weight gain and heart disease But when the fat is reduced in milk or yogurt products its often replaced with sweeteners which makes it taste better but also adds sugar and calories  The worst possible situation is reducedfat chocolate milk you take out the fat its less tasty Ludwig says So to get kids to drink  cups a day you get this sugarsweetened beverage One cup of lowfat chocolate milk is  calories with  calories coming from solid fats and added sugars    By comparison one cup of unflavored reducedfat milk  is  calories with  calories from solid fats and added sugars  People with a highquality diet  those who get adequate protein vitamin D and calcium from things like leafy greens legumes nuts and seeds  may get little or no added nutritional benefit from consuming three servings of dairy a day Ludwig argues  The point is we can get plenty of calcium from a whole range of foods says Ludwig whos also a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health On a gram for gram basis cooked kale has more calcium than milk Sardines nuts seeds beans green leafy vegetables are all sources of calcium Thats certainly true for the kaleconsuming diet perfectionists among us  but for many Americans cows milk is an inexpensive easily accessible source of important nutrients Thats why Ludwig cautions that for people who are eating a lowerquality diet  especially children  milk is still important  For a child or an adult  but especially a child  eating a poor quality diet three cups a day of milk may be the most helpful thing Ludwig says Trouble is we are not great at judging our own quality of diet says Greg Miller executive vice president for the National Dairy Council To skip milk  but continue to get the recommended levels of nutrients like calcium vitamin D and protein  would require a big change in diet for many Americans he says The current recommended intake of calcium for adults for example is  milligrams per day for people ages  to  for those older than  its  milligrams a day A   has about  milligrams of calcium   on the other hand has about  milligrams of calcium  And kids especially arent all of a sudden going to start eating bok choy kale and spinach Miller says   has linked soda fruit juice sports drinks and energy drinks to weight gain diabetes and heart disease prompting groups like the US Department of Agriculture and the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend limiting caloriecontaining beverages However milk  even sugary chocolate milk  is typically left out of the conversation Ludwig says Its about the whole big push of what lengths are we taking to modify plain old milk to get people to drink more says Madelyn Fernstrom PhD certified nutrition specialist and NBC News diet and health editor  Many nutritionists encourage the three servings of dairy a day recommendation at any cost Fernstrom says  even if that means adding extra sweeteners like chocolate or strawberry flavoring to milk or yogurt to make it tasty enough for kids and adults to actually want to eat or drink it  So this newer idea of having lowfat sweetened milk like lowfat chocolate milk  these cancel each other out Youre cutting out the fat but youre replacing it with extra sugar Fernstrom says Its the same with yogurt too the added sugar from the vanilla or strawberrybanana sweetener in many cases outweighs the nutritional good of the dairy No matter what dairy product youre choosing stick with lowfat but also no sugar Fernstrom says Cutting down the fat in yogurt and milk but adding extra sugar  thats a wash when it comes to heart health  Miller believes getting kids to stop drinking sugarsweetened beverages like soda is a bigger battle than flavored milk In his editorial Ludwig recommends broadening the current recommendation from three to zero to three something that Fernstrom says makes sense for some people Switching to nondairy milks like soy or almond is also an option  but keep in mind that these are good sources of calcium but poor sources of protein Fernstrom says   This will depend upon the quality of your overall diet Fernstrom says But even in the best of circumstances dairy products are part of a balanced diet She calls dairy a tripleduty food in that it provides protein calcium and vitamin D These are three big nutrients that many Americans dont get enough of elsewhere
