Were constantly hearing messages that were eating too much and not moving around enough Now researchers suggest that were actually not eating more than we did  years ago its that were much less active And that includes not just middleaged workers tied to their desks but also young men and women who spend their days sitting in front of their laptops To try to figure out the impact of food versus activity   a professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine looked at federally collected health data from the   program from  and compared it to  He expected to find people eating more over the past two decades But instead he   that caloric intake remained about the same which may seem a little surprising given the trends in portion size and the popular belief that were eating more and more he said It may well be that were eating too much but it doesnt seem that we are accelerating our caloric intake Ladabaum added For example it could well be that we were already eating too much back in  compared with earlier decades Even so Ladabaum found the biggest changes were in the amount of physical activity Back in the s  to  percent of people reported doing at least some physical activity in their leisure time But now up to half of Americans say they are not active at all And thats likely an underestimate Ladabaum says because people tend to overestimate their activity All age groups became less active but one of the biggest surprises was in men and women between the ages of  and  The number of white and AfricanAmerican women getting no activity more than tripled that number almost doubled for MexicanAmerican women For white and AfricanAmerican men the people who were inactive more than tripled And among MexicanAmerican men rates doubled This doesnt mean food is not to blame Ladabaum says This is something some of my colleagues have framed as Is it gluttony or is it sloth Those are not nice words but those are the terms in which some people think about this debate says Ladabaum So anybody looking for a simple explanation either A or B were not going to find that its clearly both The problem of inactivity is exacerbated by a changing job market thats taken Americans from the physically demanding manufacturing floor to sitting behind a desk In   out of  Americans had a job where they had lots of physical activity and actually exercised at work by  very few Americans do work that doesnt involve sitting around all day according to   a professor of preventative medicine at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University His   found that only  in  Americans move on the job but Church says thats likely a gross underestimate adding that its probably more like  in  We have these great old pictures seeing cars being built in the s and these men were physically picking up a bumper and putting it onto a car Church says Then you get pictures of cars being built now and theres not even a human being in the room These computers grab bumpers put them on the car and they are then bolted on by another big electronic arm Church took the findings one step further and calculated how many calories were no longer being burned He found it was about  fewer calories burned a day for men and  fewer calories burned a day for women That doesnt sound like much but when its day after day after day it adds up he says So whats a modern cube rat to do Church says given that the workplace has become so sedentary its critical for people to be more active off the job And there are concrete steps people can take to change our sedentary lifestyle Do as   recommend  minutes of moderate exercise such as walking biking or swimming at least  days a week If you think about  calories a day thats  minutes of walking or so not even a fast pace Church says And that may be all you would need to get that calories incalories out equation back in balance
