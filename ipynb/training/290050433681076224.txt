Not quite  months after Haitis devastating  earthquake a more insidious disaster struck cholera Haiti hadnt seen cholera for at least a century Then suddenly the first cases   in the central highlands near a camp for United Nations peacekeeping forces Since then the disease has struck  out of every  Haitians  nearly  people It has killed   The disease struck with explosive force Within two days of the first cases a hospital  miles away was admitting a new cholera patient every   minutes Part of the reason we think the outbreak grew so quickly was the Haitian population had no immunity to cholera says   an environmental engineer at Tufts University Something like when the Europeans brought smallpox to the Americas and it burned through the native populations Lantagne says   of the Haitian cholera strain with one circulating in Nepal around the same time shows the two differed in only  out of  million genetic elements Thats considered an exact match that theyre the same strain of cholera she tells Shots Most scientists now think Nepalese soldiers unwittingly brought cholera to Haiti when they joined a UN peacekeeping force there in  The outbreak started just downstream from their camp Sewage from the camp spilled into a nearby river Lantagne was one of four scientists appointed by the UN to look into the matter   issued in May  implicated the UN camp as a likely origin but it concluded that the outbreak was caused by a confluence of circumstances She tells Shots that the report would come out different today If we had had the additional scientific evidence thats available now we definitely would have written the report in  differently to state the most likely source of introduction was someone associated with the peacekeeping camp Lantagne says Thats important because the UN insists that whatever way cholera got to Haiti terrible sanitary conditions and lack of clean water were responsible for its remarkably fast spread But lawyer   doesnt buy that Its like lighting a fire in a dry field on a windy day and then blaming the wind or the drought for the fire says Concannon who directs a Bostonbased group called the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti More than a year ago the group filed a legal claim against the UN demanding that it accept responsibility Concannon says the UN is supposed to set up a formal mechanism within the Status of Forces Agreements that govern every peacekeeping operation to deal with claims of harm  from traffic accidents and alleged rapes involving peacekeeping soldiers to larger allegations  but it has never done so Since the UN has not responded to its claim Concannons group is pondering whether to sue the agency in a court in the United States Europe or Haiti For its part the UN hasnt admitted anything But in December SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon   a plan to rid Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic of cholera Concannon says thats ambitious  but feasible Cholera can certainly be eliminated from Haiti he tells Shots Its been eliminated from the United States from England from many countries in South America he says This is basically th century technology that needs to be installed in Haiti The Haitian government is expected to release a detailed blueprint for the first two years of the effort sometime this month The entire project is expected to cost  billion and take at least  years But so far the UN has identified only  percent of the money most of it redeployed from earlier pledges Concannon worries the rest may never be found  acknowledges its getting harder to raise money for Haiti as the earthquake fades into history Hes the deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization an arm of the UN Paying for cholera elimination in Hispaniola is the challenge Andrus tells Shots Its a big challenge he says The question is Can it be done I believe it can So were ramping up efforts to do that But even if the money can be found its going to take years to bring clean water and sewage treatment to a sizable proportion of Haitis  million people Meanwhile Haitians will still get cholera and many more will die One stopgap under discussion is to vaccinate Haitians at highest risk of cholera such as the  babies born every year and those in remote areas who cant get to clinics rapidly Andrus who has a background in vaccination programs thinks thats a good idea Haiti has done some great things with vaccination he says Theyve eliminated measles rubella and polio and you cant say that in many countries in Europe We believe they can do it Cholera vaccination is   effective and lasts about two years And of course it also will take money If enough cholera vaccines become available one recent   suggests that vaccinating around half the population would provide enough herd immunity to make cholera transmission much less likely But so far the UN says nothing has been decided about launching a cholera vaccination program of any sort in Haiti
