The Director of Public Prosecutions says it was right not to charge two doctors over claims they offered to arrange abortions based on gender The doctors from Birmingham and Manchester were referred to prosecutors after a Daily Telegraph investigation Keir Starmer QC said there was just sufficient evidence to prosecute but it was not in the public interest and a health regulator inquiry is ongoing MPs are due to debate policy on the prosecution of abortion offences later In the wake of the decision  politicians   to complain that offences against the Abortion Act were not being pursued Attorney General Dominic Grieve will respond to their concerns in the Commons Last month Mr Starmer said he would make the detailed reasons public after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for urgent clarification on the Crown Prosecution Service decision The CPS has   and in a letter to the attorney general Mr Starmer said the cases were by no means clear cut He said Although there is sufficient evidence to bring such a prosecution that is a very narrow basis for a prosecution and the evidence is not strong   I appreciate that others may disagree with the decision arrived at in this case but I am content that the decision not to prosecute on the facts in these cases was the right decision Mr Starmer said the law does not expressly ban genderspecific abortions although it does prohibit any abortion carried out without two medical practitioners deciding the health risks of continuing with a pregnancy outweigh those of termination On the facts of these cases it would not be possible to prove that either doctor authorised an abortion on genderspecific grounds alone  The only basis for a prosecution would be that although we could not prove these doctors authorised a genderspecific abortion they did not carry out a sufficiently robust assessment of the risks Both doctors had been referred to the General Medical Council and had conditions imposed on their registration Having consulted the GMC it is clear that the council will investigate these cases Mr Starmer said It is arguably more appropriate on the facts of these two cases for a professional disciplinary body to evaluate the proper approach that doctors should take than it is for a criminal court Mr Starmer added The outcome in these cases should not be taken as an indication that criminal proceedings will not be brought where an abortion is procured on genderspecific grounds These cases have been considered on their individual facts and merits Mr Grieve said he was satisfied that the decision not to prosecute had been made properly and conscientiously This was a difficult decision and different prosecutors may have come to a different conclusion but it is not for me to say whether it is the right or wrong decision he said It is for the DPP to make his decisions independently and based on the individual facts of the matter
