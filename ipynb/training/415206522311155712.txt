People who avoid gluten will say theyre grateful for the dozens of new products that have enabled them to eat bread cookies snack bars and other baked goods Theyll also sometimes say that many of those products are not very good and contain ingredients theyd rather not eat Enter the upper echelons of bakers people like Valerie Gordon who has been experimenting with glutenfree cakes and cookies for her Valerie shops and cafes in Los Angeles She has a variety of glutenfree baked goods these days blue corn muffins chocolate cake brownies chocolate chips cookies and a snack mix And more is on the drawing board According to industry estimates as many as one in three people are trying to eat less or no gluten a protein found in wheat barley and rye About one in  people are thought to have celiac disease which means that even the smallest amount of gluten will make them ill Others may have less severe issues or have decided that they are happier without gluten Whatever the reason Gordon says she has seen a surge in requests for glutenfree choices I just keep growing our glutenfree offerings because the demand is so huge she said one morning at a table in her Echo Park cafe Its quadrupled in the last few years and I dont feel its going away She recently traveled the country on a tour for her cookbook Sweet and everywhere she went people asked about glutenfree desserts she said It shocked me Not glutenfree herself Im all about wheat flour Gordon said her standards are high for the foods she makes without gluten She tested the commercial alternatives to allpurpose flour which can be found in supermarkets and health food stores they are usually combinations of such things as potato and tapioca starches and rice almond and chickpea flours She found the taste to be grassy with an agricultural aroma not what she wanted for baked goods She cooks some with almond and rice flours but she said she has found a flour she uses frequently in place of wheat buckwheat which despite its name has no gluten It adds she says a caramel flavor Buckwheat and chocolate she concluded are best friends and even better friends with salt That led to a chocolate chip cookie with fleur de sel She first tried making it with a popular commercial allpurpose flour substitute But the recipe did not work well and the results were difficult to control she said The key was that different flours absorb fat in different ways leading to a different finished cookie Now she also makes a glutenfree chocolate layer cake with buckwheat flour Its delicious and birthdayparty rich Shes considering a rice flour shortbread cookie and is testing some toasted brown rice cookies I love the aroma and the texture Gordon said Gordon is not trying to make diet desserts She uses chocolate and butter and other lucious ingredients One of her recent concoctions was the result of an ongoing collaboration with the design firm Commune Communes Roman Alonso doesnt eat wheat  though he makes an exception for baguettes in Paris  and asked for a grainfree granola The result was something called Good a mix that includes chocolate and seeds and nuts Gordon created a monster People love that stuff so much Alonso said some of my friends call it chocolate crack
