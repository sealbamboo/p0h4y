The first human trial of an experimental vaccine against Ebola suggests that it is safe and may help the immune system to combat the virus Twenty volunteers were immunised in the United States Scientists at the US National Institutes of Health NIH described the results as promising  The research is published in the   NEJM None of those immunised suffered major sideeffects and all produced antibodies  Dr Anthony Fauci of the NIH told the BBC On safety and on the ability to produce an appropriate immune response we can call this trial an unqualified success even though it was an early Phase One trial The volunteers were divided into two groups receiving either a low or high dose The antibody response was stronger among those receiving the higher dose The investigators found that seven of the high dose and two of the low dose volunteers produced Tcell immune responses which may be important in protection against Ebola viruses The vaccine uses a chimpanzee cold virus which has been genetically engineered to carry a noninfectious Ebola protein on its surface There are four trials under way of this experimental vaccine The US vaccine is bivalent  aimed at giving protection against the Sudan and Zaire strains of Ebola It is the latter which is responsible for the current outbreak Trials of a monovalent vaccine  against the Zaire strain  are also under way in Oxford Mali and Switzerland  If these also yield positive results then the monovalent vaccine will be offered to thousands of health workers in West Africa Dr Fauci said It will be this large Phase TwoThree trial in West Africa which will show whether the vaccine works and is really safe He added If the outbreak is still going on six months from now and the vaccine at that point is shown to be effective it could have a very positive impact on the current epidemic But he said the longterm aim was to produce a vaccine which would protect against future outbreaks If the vaccine does work it is unclear how long the protection would last These kinds of questions are usually settled during the early stages of human trials But such is the pressing humanitarian need for something which protects against Ebola the whole trial process is being accelerated at unprecedented speed In an editorial in the NEJM Dr Daniel Bausch said that while the trial left many questions unanswered an Ebola vaccine was one step closer The experimental vaccine is being manufactured by the British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline GSK The company says it can produce one million doses a month by the end of  This will require a significant financial outlay It is asking for an indemnity agreement in case problems such as unforeseen side effects were to emerge in the future GSKs chief executive Sir Andrew Witty told the BBC  We are not waiting for that to be settled but it is obvious there are some risks that companies should not be expected to carry on their own
