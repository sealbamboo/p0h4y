Holy moly Theres a case of Ebola in the US That first reaction was understandable Theres no question the disease is scary The World Health Organization now   that the virus has killed about  percent of people infected in West Africa The Ebola case in Dallas is the first one diagnosed outside Africa the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday And the health care system in Texas didnt quarantine the man right away He was sick with    and contagious  for four days before he was admitted to the hospital But when you look at health officials responding to the case in Dallas they seem cool as cucumbers despite the initial misstep I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country   the director of the CDC Dr Tom Frieden Why is Frieden so sure this virus wont spread beyond a handful of cases It boils down to something called   The reproduction number or R nought is a mathematical term that tells you how contagious an infectious disease is Specifically its the number of people who catch the disease from one sick person on average in an outbreak Take for example measles The virus is one of the most contagious diseases known to man Its R sits around  That means each person with the measles spreads it to  people on average when nobody is vaccinated When everyone is vaccinated the R drops to essentially zero for measles At the other end of the spectrum are viruses like HIV and hepatitis C Their Rs tend to fall somewhere between  and  Theyre still big problems but they spread much more slowly than the measles And that brings us back to Ebola Despite its nasty reputation the viruss R really isnt that impressive It typically sits around  to  Even in the current epidemic in West Africa where the virus has been out of control each person who has gotten sick has spread Ebola to only about two others on average Why is that Many factors contribute to the R such as how long youre infectious and how many virus particles are needed to make another person sick But in Ebolas case the mode of transmission probably helps keep its R low Ebola isnt spread through the air like the measles or flu It requires close contact with some bodily fluid such as blood or vomit containing the virus Now at this point youre probably thinking OK But an R of  is nothing to brush off Youre right R of  means one person infects two people who then infect four people then eight    the numbers go up fast But that isnt likely to happen in a place with a good public health system like the US Why Because people with Ebola arent contagious   they show symptoms So to stop the chain of transmission all health workers in Texas have to do is get the people possibly infected by the sick man into isolation   these people show signs of Ebola Then R drops to zero And Texas is free of Ebola Were talking the basic R here for all you epidemiologists So the R that you get when everyone in the population is susceptible to the disease The R is integrated over the time that a person is infectious to others For HIV this could be years But for Ebola that time is only about a week So even though they have similar Rs Ebolas infections per unit of time is much higher than HIVs
