People woken at night by insatiable hunger may have their genes to blame research suggests Nighteating syndrome may appear when the genes that synchronise eating patterns with sleep are faulty research on mice concluded This alters meal times leading to overeating and weight gain About  of people have the condition Signs include waking in the night and being unable to go back to sleep without eating  The syndrome has recently been classified as an eating disorder but the cause is unknown The food consumed is often unhealthy and high in calories leading to weight gain and sometimes obesity The study published in   looked at mice bred with a human version of a bodyclock gene in place of the mouse one When the gene was silenced the mice ate much earlier than normal ones when they should have been asleep Mutations in a related bodyclock gene  implicated in sleep disorders  led to the mice sleeping more The researchers think the genes work together to keep eating and sleeping synchronised A fault in either gene causes disruption in sleeping and eating patterns For a long time people discounted nighteating syndrome as not real said lead researcher Satchidananda Panda of the Salk Institute in La Jolla US It opens up a whole lot of future questions about how these cycles are regulated
