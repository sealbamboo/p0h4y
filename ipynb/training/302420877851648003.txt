A new association representing owners of suntanning salons says it wants to dispel myths and misinformation about moderate exposure to ultraviolet UV light much of which it says is perpetuated by healthcare providers The   ASA which announced its formation on Dec  has  members representing owners of  sunbed salons in the US The memberships primary concern centers on what the group says is flawed research that has misled the public about the benefits of moderate UV exposure Widely cited studies have included homebased tanning beds and cosmetic and medical use of UV treatment which often involves intentional sunburn  sometimes even blistering sunburn according to a statement from the ASA After removing those patients from analyses the risk connected to professional salons virtually disappears One of the primary roles of the ASA is to address and factually dispel these myths and educate the public about intelligent practical sun care for tanners and nontanners ASA board member Diane Lucas president of a national tanning salon chain based in Dallas said in the statement As it corrects misinformation about sunlight and sunbeds the ASA intends to raise standards for tanning salons It is time to have a higherlevel discussion about UV light from the sun and from sunbeds said ASA board president Bart Bonn owner of an Omaha Nebbased group of tanning salons The ASA is going to be a constructive party in that discussion demanding a consumerfirst conversation differentiating proper sun care from blatant overstatements about the risks of UV exposure If the ASA is serious about meaningful discussions with the medical and scientific communities its leaders should take care in what they say and how they say it according to Cleveland dermatologist Kevin Cooper MD The organization alleges in its materials that dermatologists are intentionally giving patients sunburns and that is simply untrue said Cooper of Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals If they are looking for constructive dialogue thats not particularly helpful In particular the ASA has taken aim at the American Academy of Dermatology AAD position statement on indoor tanning Originally approved by the AAD in  the statement has been updated several times most recently in  According to the statement the AAD opposes indoor tanning and supports prohibiting the sale and use of commercial indoor tanning equipment Noting that both the National Cancer Institute and World Health Organization WHO have classified artificial UV light as a carcinogen the AAD calls for implementation of federal state and local legislation regulating tanning salons The AAD also urges the Food and Drug Administration FDA to take action that will prohibit the sale and use of commercial tanning equipment and at a minimum reclassify tanning devices to more appropriately designate the health hazards associated with their use In the absence of FDA action the AAD has recommended The ASA suggests that many physicians  especially dermatologists  refer patients to suntanning salons for therapeutic reasons The ASA statement cites a  survey by the International Smart Tan Network a trade organization showing that  percent of tanningsalon patients are referred by physicians and that  percent of referring physicians are dermatologists The statement characterized as baseless a claim by the AAD that  percent of dermatologists discourage tanning The ASA also wants more discussion of a  report from the   IARC a branch of the WHO which reclassified artificial UV light from possibly carcinogenic to carcinogenic to humans The IARC decision was based in part on a  metaanalysis that showed a  percent increased risk of melanoma among people who reported using tanning devices before age  The IARC data that resulted in a mispromoted number in our view included both phototherapy units and home units ASA board member Doug McNabb told   When you separate the data into three categories  commercial sunbeds home units and phototherapy units  commercial sunbeds have the lowest risk and would be statistically insignificant In contrast the risk of melanoma is increased by  percent with phototherapy units We want to shed some light on that data and make sure people are making decisions on the basis of scientific facts and not on the basis of a newspaper headline or a TV news show added McNabb a suntanning salon owner in Winnipeg Manitoba McNabb reiterated the ASAs intended emphasis on better education and training of suntanning salon employees as well as people who use commercial sunbeds Source
