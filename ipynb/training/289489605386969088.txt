Not so long ago bilingualism was thought to be bad for your brain But it looks more and more like speaking more than one language could help save you from Alzheimers disease The latest evidence from the bilingualismisgoodforyou crew comes from   a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington To test the idea he had older people who grew up bilingual do an attentionswitching task a skill that typically fades with age Earlier research   that people bilingual since childhood are better at the highorder thinking called executive function as they age Gold found that his bilingual seniors were better at the task which had them quickly sorting colors and shapes than their monolingual peers He then added an extra dimension by sticking the peoples heads in scanners to see what was happening inside their brains The brains of the monolingual seniors were working harder to complete the task while the bilingual seniors brains were much more efficient more like those of young adults Neuroscientists think that having more reserve brain power helps compensate for agerelated declines in thinking and memory and may help protect against the losses caused by Alzheimers and other forms of dementia The   was published in the   About  percent of Americans are bilingual and as many as  percent of people in cities like New York grew up speaking two languages Gold might not be an entirely unbiased observer He became a fluent bilingual as a child thanks to the French immersion school he attended in Montreal Hes old enough to remember when speaking two languages was considered a handicap He recalls a cousin ragging him He said Youre not going to learn to speak English properly Not only is that not true but bilingualism gives you benefits in what we call executive control Gold seldom speaks French now though he has learned Spanish to talk with his Mexicanborn wife and her relatives His next task is to see if learning a second language in adulthood would give some protective benefit to those of us who missed the chance to be bilingual as children That he says would be more useful to people
