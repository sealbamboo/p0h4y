Like many parents out there I love Halloween as much as I dread it The joy the kiddos get from the costumes and candy is balanced by what comes after the fights and negotiations that go along with trying to limit their sugar intake Thus was born my candy buyback program I first heard about the concept last year and it totally worked I bought the candy off of my sons  Jake now  and Will a selfdescribed six and three quarters  for  each But children are smart practical creatures They are always pushing boundaries and most of them from very early on harbor the bargaining prowess of a skilled hostage negotiator When treats fly into the house  from generous friends birthday parties holidays my sweet tooth grandpas visit  we have those conversations that make you both proud my kids are so tenacious and exasperated why cant they just   for once Like this one after a recent party Me You can have two pieces of candy Will But Jake had one earlier so I get three Me But that was because yesterday you got TV and he traded his TV time for a treat Will What about can I have four small ones Me It depends Show me which ones  OK minis not funsize Will If I have one more small tomato the actual vegetable can I have six Me Two more tomatoes and you can have five Will What about this Mommy Can I trade one of my funsize Snickers for two cookies Me You can trade it for one cookie Will Mommy please two Me No sweetie Will But thats not fair you gave Jake two cookies the other day Me That was last week Will plus you asked for candy anyway Please stop fighting me on everything Will I dont fight you on   Mommy Halloween is the promise of these negotiations for the dreaded foreseeable future The thought alone saps my energy Why dont I set rules for how many pieces they can have each day Ive tried  they   find some reason to open negotiations Two years ago one of those negotiations devolved into an epic fight the likes of which   captures perfectly warning language is terribly inappropriate  the kind that makes you think Aargh I am the worst parent please let me have not scarred them for life they know I love them right This year theyre older and they came prepared For starters I reminded them they got  each last year Will Were not talking about last year End of discussion I feared for my bank account and my sanity They had sorted out their candy into  bags  Butterfingers Rolos Sweet Tarts Whoppers Milk Duds and so on Over the next  minutes we went back and forth Jake Two dollars a bag Will Five dollars a bag Jake Two Will Five  seven To which both kids burst out laughing Me I think thats slightly extortionary How about  for each of you Will Deal And then they tried for  unsuccessfully and after that took  more minutes to negotiate keeping three additional pieces Five Two Four   and thats final And it was done Fini One negotiation in which somehow Ive given my  and yearold more money than is at all reasonable  but it was worth it to get all these sweets out of my house Negotiations are important I want to teach them moderation to think through what they want and what theyll give up for it and I want them to fight for what they want  most of the time The older they get the more theyll have to make their own decisions and I want them to think strategically thoughtfully and to know that they can trust me to treat them like reasonable human beings as we figure out life Or maybe Ive turned them into moneygrubbing little fiends who calculate what they want down to the penny and will work all their magic to get it You cant win But you   have a lot of fun  and three pieces of candy
