 Modifying an infants diet to include the protein gluten while the mother is still breastfeeding could lower the risk of celiac disease a common intestinal disorder according to a new Swedish study That finding may sound counterintuitive because celiac disease is a condition in which the lining of the small intestine is damaged by glutencontaining foods However the researchers who conducted the study speculate that there may be a window of opportunity in which an infant can develop tolerance to the protein to possibly escape getting the disease We now have proven this way of introducing gluten reduces the risk of getting celiac disease said Dr Anneli Ivarsson a pediatrician at Umea University in Umea and lead author of the study published online Feb  and in the March print issue of the journal   Gluten refers to proteins found in specific grains including all forms of wheat and related grains such as barley and rye according to the Celiac Disease Foundation Celiac disease affects about  percent of the population according to Ivarsson Genetic susceptibility plays a role For those affected a lifelong glutenfree diet is advised Ivarsson and her team compared two groups of Swedish children one born in  during a time when the diagnosis of celiac disease increased fourfold and the other group born in  when it declined about the same amount The children born later had a  percent lower risk of having celiac disease than those born earlier they found Thats quite a lot Ivarsson said While  percent of those in the earlier born group had the disease  percent of those in the laterborn group did The beginning and the end of the period in which the celiac disease diagnoses rose were both marked by changes in recommended feeding of infants including the best age to introduce glutencontaining foods the researchers noted In  experts recommended   In  the experts recommended that gluten be introduced from  months on Experts know that a baby develops what they call oral tolerance to an antigen a substance that produces protective antibodies early in life Celiac disease can be viewed as a failure to develop oral tolerance to gluten or a later loss of this tolerance Ivarsson wrote in her report In her study babies born in the later group who were introduced to glutencontaining foods at  months on were less likely to develop celiac disease We cant prove there is a window of opportunity for developing tolerance Ivarsson said but that is one speculation The findings suggest  but dont prove  that gradually introducing glutencontaining foods in small amounts from  months of age ideally while breastfeeding is ongoing may protect against celiac disease Why should breastfeeding go along with it Breast milk has been shown to promote healthy bacteria in the gut Ivarsson said If mothers can breastfeed they should she added However genetic susceptibility also plays a role she said so a child could still get celiac disease despite following the feeding recommendations If a child does show symptoms get early treatment she said Symptoms include chronic diarrhea or constipation abdominal cramping and gas This is actually what we have been advising for feeding said Dr Peter Green director of the Celiac Disease Center at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City We often get asked by people who are having a baby and there is celiac disease in their family what could they do to reduce the risk of the baby getting celiac disease Green said Weve actually been advising the parents to breastfeed and introduce a little gluten between  and  months The recommendation is based on other research also finding that approach to be effective he added The American Academy of Pediatrics has no official recommendations about reducing celiac disease risk but its experts say that the risk of   at the time gluten is introduced
