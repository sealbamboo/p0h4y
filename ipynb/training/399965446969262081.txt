A couple of weeks later in July  Pippen bought nicotine patches started exercising and never looked back  I was miserable when I was large but I would never admit it he   I can remember looking at myself in the mirror thinking how wonderful it would be to just wake up one morning healthy and physically fit Pippens wife Susan enjoyed walking every night after dinner He joined her on the evening jaunts until he started experiencing shooting pains in his arms and had trouble breathing A visit to the VA Medical Center revealed that he had an  blockage in one of his coronary arteries and Type  diabetes  In November  doctors inserted a stent to improve the blood flow to his heart He barely fit on the operating table  Doctors offered to get him into a bariatric center for gastric bypass surgery as well but Pippen refused  Instead the former Airman st Class went on a lowcarb diet remembering that his drill instructor had forbidden potatoes and bread when an overweight Pippen entered boot camp He had always loved comfort food  biscuits and gravy mashed potatoes cheeseburgers with fries  so the switch was difficult at first But Pippen isnt a man to do things halfway his wife says  It only took one nicotine patch and an inspiring selfhelp book for Pippen to quit smoking  Kevin becomes very focused on whatever he is working on at any one time Susan says I think when Kevin made the decision to get healthy it made it easier for both of us  that we both had to make time for exercise and our eating choices had to be healthier    The couple started planning their meals and grocery shopping together trying new foods like kale and spaghetti squash They even created healthier versions of their old favorites like pizza Pippen took group fitness classes at their gym and swam laps on the weekends He did Zumba and kickboxing and body sculpting and spinning  basically anything to get moving  I love it when Im with a group of people because it just motivates the crap out of me he says You dont want to be left behind so it makes you try harder  In the first year he lost  pounds  Susan worried that once Pippen reached his goal he would revert to his old habits He was neglecting his business in his efforts to lose weight nothing else seemed to matter  Once I decide to do something dont get in my way Pippen says with a laugh It may take me a while to make that decision but once I do Im so driven Over the next  months he lost another  pounds  Pippen is now maintaining at  pounds His body fat percentage is approximately  Susan isnt much of a scale person but shes lost a significant amount of weight as well She dropped from a size  to a size  and now wears extrasmall shirts  Neither is worried about going back to their old lifestyle they like the energy these healthy habits have given them too much to quit  Pippen gave up his lowcarb diet after the first year and has switched to calorie counting He tries to eat less than  a day by making tiny swaps like using unsweetened almond milk instead of   He notices that people treat him differently now that hes healthy whether its at the grocery store or the gym He feels better and he thinks that self confidence shows  The couple goes to boot camp on Mondays and takes a spinning class on Tuesdays and Thursdays Pippen does kickboxing on Wednesdays and swims laps on the weekends while Susan runs on the treadmill She plans to do a few races next year  The hardest part for me is exercising when I dont want to she says The easiest is eating a little chocolate every day without the guilt and buying new clothes
