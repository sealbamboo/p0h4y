The World Health Organization WHO says the day goals it set itself for tackling the Ebola outbreak in West Africa have largely been met The WHO set a target of isolating and treating  of patients and of safely burying  of victims in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea by  December The WHOs Dr Bruce Aylward said only the treatment figure in Sierra Leone had fallen below the mark He warned much work was still needed to get to zero cases The WHOs latest report had put the death toll from the Ebola outbreak at  in the three hardesthit West African countries However Dr Aylward said hundreds of deaths reported at the weekend from Liberia were actually nonEbola deaths and we will be taking them off The WHO later published revised figures showing  deaths in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea with six more in Mali Dr Aylward the assistant director general in charge of Ebola response for the WHO said the yawning gap between disease levels and the capacity to cope had narrowed significantly This was a very very different place than  days ago he said Whenever you read any Ebola statistic take it with a bucket load of salt The UN response mission and the World Health Organization base many of their stats on a hotchpotch of numbers from national health ministries aid organisations and sketchy information their own officials can correlate Ive often seen statistics claiming an improvement or a decline in a particular area  and then subsequently heard a firsthand report contradicting that The truth is this crisis is taking place in one of the poorest corners of the world All three worstaffected countries have bad roads unreliable electricity supplies severely underresourced governments and poorly educated populations So dont expect the numbers to add up every time Foreign aid workers and journalists want things to be neat Around here they are not We do know one thing for certain The number of dead is definitely an underestimate We now believe that two of the three countries  Liberia and Guinea  are currently treating more than  of the reported cases and in Sierra Leone theyre probably achieving that in most of the country He added In all three countries its clear now that more than  of the Ebola deaths that we know about are buried safely And this is because in the past  days the number of safe burial teams has more than doubled He said earlier reports from the WHO that suggested less success in meeting the targets had been revised after analysing the data Dr Aylward praised changes made by communities in the three countries and the strong national government leadership they had shown When asked when the figures for both goals would reach  Dr Aylward said he did not have a crystal ball and that while progress had been made towards reaching the target the current achievements were not good enough to stop Ebola He warned Catching up and isolating cases does not mean you will automatically get to zero  it will need additional measures Dr Aylward said there remained hotspots with rising cases with particular concern for western areas of Sierra Leone But he added The capacity to treat Ebola at district level is strong and getting stronger in Sierra Leone and thats why I think the prognosis is actually very good Earlier the head of the UN Ebola response mission in West Africa Tony Banbury told the BBC there was still a huge risk the deadly disease could spread to other parts of the world  Speaking in Sierra Leones capital Freetown Mr Banbury said It may spread around this subregion or someone could get on a plane to Asia Latin America North America or Europe that is why it is so important to get down to zero cases as quickly as possible
