The new health care law will provide around  trillion in subsidies to low and middleincome Americans over the next decade to help them pay for health insurance Johanna Humbert of Galien Mich was pleasantly surprised to discover that she qualifies for an insurance subsidy since her current plan is being canceled Humbert makes about  a year so shell get a subsidy of about  a month The new plan is similar to her current one but it will cost   about half of what she pays now But where will the money come from to pay for subsidies like these On his show last Friday liberal comedian Bill Maher called the Affordable Care Act a Robin Hood plan It does take from the rich to make better the poor he said You can certainly make a case for that says   of the American Enterprise Institute In a general sense the rich of course subsidize the poor The rich pay more income taxes he says So yes absolutely thats how subsidies are supposed to work So if youre a lowincome person getting a tax credit from the US Treasury to subsidize your health care a big chunk of that credit is coming from taxes paid by the welloff But the authors of the Affordable Care Act didnt want the subsidies to become a drain on the Treasury and add to the deficits So they included provisions designed to offset the cost of the subsidies MIT   who helped develop the law says about half the costs are offset by projected savings in Medicare payments to insurers and hospitals Another quarter is offset by added taxes on medicaldevice makers and drug companies The other source of revenue is a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans he says Those families with incomes above  a year will now have to pay more in Medicare payroll taxes Those provisions actually make the bill a net positive for the federal budget   the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office By the CBOs accounting Obamacare will produce a surplus Gruber says the law will actually lower the deficit by about  billion over the next decade and by  trillion in the decade after However many Republicans have expressed skepticism about those findings The subsidies do mean some lowincome people will pay almost nothing for insurance while higherincome people will pay the full market price Dentist Aaron McLemore of Louisville Ky makes more than  a year and doesnt qualify for any subsidy on the Obamacare exchange The yearolds current policy is being canceled A new policy from the exchange will more than double his monthly premium and nearly double his yearly outofpocket maximum His higher costs arent subsidizing lowerincome policyholders whose subsidy has already been paid by the government But he is providing a subsidy in another way The Affordable Care Act requires him to buy a policy with features he doesnt need Seeing as Im a single male with no kids or dependents and Im paying for pediatric dental care and maternity care it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me McLemore says What Obamacare is doing is moving McLemore out of the individual market  where people are sorted by age and health history and scope of coverage  to a market more like the traditional employerbased group policy in which young and old workers get the same coverage and pay the same premium Its not exactly the same The Affordable Care Act allows insurers to charge older people up to three times more than younger people for policies Still Gruber the MIT economist says the model reflects the basic idea of insurance The notion of insurance is were protected against risk he says What that means is that during a period of time when were healthy we pay more in premiums than we collect in benefits In those periods of time were sick  and we all go through them  we collect more in benefits than we pay in premiums Young healthy people subsidize older people who are more likely to be sick Of course most of those younger folks will eventually become old folks and experience the same benefit
