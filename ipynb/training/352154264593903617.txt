The world is struggling to cope with a growing epidemic of drugresistant tuberculosis Treatment is even more complicated for children TB drugs arent usually designed for kids says   the acting country director for Doctors Without Borders in Tajikistan That means they arent packaged in smaller doses and may not even have been tested for childspecific effectiveness or side effects Almost all the drugs we want to use do not exist in childfriendly formulations he says Hoehn and his colleagues have been running a pilot project in Tajikistan since  to treat children with drugresistant TB Team members often find themselves mixing the powder into a suspension or syrup But curing a regular TB infection requires about six months of treatment with kids taking at least four medications a day For   the regimen lasts longer  two to three years  and kids often need daily injections of antibiotics We wouldnt do that in the West Hoehn says Children would get some central intravenous catheter and the daily doses would be much less painful But we cannot do that here We dont have the means so it must be done into the muscle the   The limited offering of TB drugs in Tajikistan nearly killed yearold Ruqiya Hasanova Soon after the little girl arrived at a governmentrun tuberculosis hospital she started developing a full body rash The doctors suspected measles Eventually a nurse from Doctors Without Borders determined that Ruqiya was having a severe allergic reaction to rifampicin one of the primary antibiotics to fight TB They stopped Ruqiyas antiTB regimen and the rash immediately went away In Tajikistan   comes only in a pill combined with another TB medication So she couldnt take either drug And just like that two of the main drugs in the meager TB arsenal became unavailable to Ruqiya In the end Doctors Without Borders had to specialorder different meds for her from Europe But now its unclear if even these are working Earlier this spring Ruqiyas cough fever and night sweats returned Andy Martin a nurse with Doctors Without Borders says hes now worried that Ruqiya may have drugresistant TB Nailing that down isnt easy but is crucial If her infection is drugresistant shes on the wrong drugs Children tend to have fewer TB bacteria in their lungs than adults And its hard to get kids to cough up mucus from deep inside their lungs where the TB bacteria live If we can get some of the TB bacteria well be able to tell if shes drug resistant or not Martin says After about  minutes of trying to get Ruqiya to cough up the mucus Martin decides that they need to insert a catheter into the little girls nose to get the sample Ruqiya screams and fights against the nurses as they slide the catheter into her nostril The nasal catheter procedure isnt extremely painful Martin says but its scary for children I think all the young children will cry during this procedure he says It is very difficult but you weigh this procedure against the progression of the disease and the futility of treating children with the wrong regimen This sample of mucus from the lungs should allow Martin to tell whether Ruqiya needs to be switched to an entirely new regimen of far more toxic TB drugs Left untreated an active TB infection such as Ruqiyas can destroy her lungs spread throughout her body and eventually kill her But the treatment itself also can have intense side effects including nausea joint pain headaches and insomnia Another common sideeffect is hearing loss Eighteenyearold Rosigul Shaimurdova has been battling drugresistant TB for more than two years Her current medication has left her permanently deaf Drugresistant TB forces patients to make awful choices   from Doctors Without Borders says  Would you rather have hearing loss or would you rather die To put it very bluntly Shaimurdova lives with her mother and more than a dozen extended family members in a small flat in a mildewed Sovietera apartment block TB has taken over her life She dropped out of school She doesnt sleep at night and is irritable during the day her sister says As Shaimurdovas health has fluctuated shes been in and out of the hospital During her most recent stay Shaimurdova says that she had pain throughout her body and the disease sapped all her strength It was very hard for me she says I couldnt get up and walk I felt like my bones were boiling in water Shaimurdova is home now She takes  pills a day plus one injection to combat TB Her condition appears to be improving Her doctors say that shell never regain her hearing but they expect shell be able to beat the TB infection
