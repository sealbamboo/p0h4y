The White House acknowledged today that it overreported the number of signups under the Affordable Care Act by nearly 400,000 people.. Some people with separate medical and dental plans were counted twice, leading the administration to state erroneously that more than 7 million had enrolled in coverage under ACA, instead of the correct figure of about 6.7 million.. The discrepancy was discovered during . The Associated Press says: "Those consumers have separate dental coverage in addition to a medical plan, and were double-counted by mistake, said [White House spokesman Aaron] Albright. They had purchased both the medical and dental plans through HealthCare.gov and state insurance markets created under the law.".

Ultimately, the correction means the White House did not reach its original target of 7 million.
