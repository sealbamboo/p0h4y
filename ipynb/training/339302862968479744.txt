Look in any vending machine and you can find plenty of snacks with dubious nutritional profiles Take the ones in the state Capitol in Salem Ore Weve got a lot of Cheetos and PopTarts and candy bars and cookies and things like that says state Rep   She notes that the   has a direct impact on the state so she introduced a bill to have vending machines on state property switch to healthful options Like many public health advocates KenyGuyer stresses that shes not trying to dictate what people eat  just make it easier for them to make a healthful choice when theyre pressed for time or seeking a snack But it turns out that this public health campaign impacts an unexpected group the blind In  Congress gave blind vendors priority to operate vending and concessions on federal property with the   States then extended the same treatment to state buildings Why To create jobs for the blind And finding employment is still a struggle for the blind today Their unemployment rate is  percent which means that the jobs and income from the Randolph Sheppard Act still matter Kevan Worley director of the   says  blind entrepreneurs go to work every day to feed their families because of the Randolph Sheppard Act Thats significant Its the most successful employment program for the blind ever conceived Worley says the program does about  million in annual sales with participating vendors earning a  median salary And now blind vendors are worried that if junk food in the vending machines is replaced with more healthful fare theyll take their business elsewhere But whether this actually happens is unclear  theres some evidence that mandating  percent or more healthful food in vending machines harms business The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working together with blind vendors and vending machine companies to find ways to positively impact offerings and selections without affecting the blind vendors bottom line Together they are finding snacks that are affordable and actually fit in the existing vending machines and looking at ways to highlight these options such as little green tags that can inform and motivate consumers Do vending machines contribute negatively to the overall diet asks Joel Kimmons a nutrition scientist who worked on the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions vending machine recommendations I think the question can be turned around and you should ask Can vending machines contribute positively to the overall diet  The   has gone through an overhaul Instead of mandating  percent healthful snacks the bill now calls for the creation of a task force to gather all interested parties together And blind vendors like Worley hope this collaborative approach will be the best way forward You know I understand if we dont reduce health costs thats going to be a huge economic impact But I dont want to balance the health of the nation on the backs of blind Americans he says We can develop ways to have our cake and eat it too
