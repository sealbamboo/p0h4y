Overall the cancerrelated death rate has been decreasing researchers say as a result of improved screening and treatment options Yet while deaths from breast prostate and colon cancers are projected to drop deaths caused by liver pancreatic bladder and leukemia cancers are expected to increase In fact liver and pancreatic cancers will surpass breast and prostate to become the second and thirdleading causes of cancerrelated deaths the researchers say  Weve been able to turn the tide in other cancers with an investment in research said lead author Lynn Matrisian vice president of scientific and medical affairs at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network which funded the study Were hoping that with increased effort  we will be able to impact and change those projections The rate of pancreatic cancer has been slowly increasing for the past  years says Dr Otis Brawley chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society Some of that rise can be attributed to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes  Many Americans are not aware that the combination of obesity highcaloric intake and lack of physical activity is the secondleading cause of cancer in the US Brawley said It is linked to at least  types of cancer of which these are two This is an American problem  the rise in pancreatic cancer is not as severe as in Europe where obesity is less of an issue Overall the number of cancer cases is expected to   due to the rapidly aging population In  the United States had about  million cases of cancer in  researchers expect that number to reach  million  Were living much longer in the United States so the number of people  age and older will be much greater Matrisian said And thats of course one of the biggest risk factors for cancer Age Lung breast prostate and colorectal cancers are currently the most common in the United States Known as the big four these cancers have the highest incidence rates and receive the most research funding from the National Cancer Institute  This is unlikely to change by  the researchers say except for colorectal cancer which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases   The decrease in colorectal cancer falling from the top four incidence and top two in deaths seems to be primarily the result of advances in colorectal cancer screening the report authors write  The dramatic increase in thyroid cases is not a new epidemic they say but simply an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed And while thyroid cancer has a  fiveyear survival rate only  of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis The pancreas is difficult to scan with current imaging technologies Matrisian says because of its location in the body And pancreatic tumors are often surrounded by dense tissue that render drugs useless Surgery is the only treatment known to cure pancreatic cancer but less than  of cases are operable the report says  If we want to change the death rate for these diseases it is necessary to increase the investment in understanding them and identifying early detection strategies the report says
