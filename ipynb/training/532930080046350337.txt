Several years ago I saw a woman with unexpectedly high blood pressure Her readings were as high as  way above the normal value of  Though she was otherwise healthy she was at risk of a stroke Because extreme hypertension in young women can be caused a blockage of an artery to the kidney I scheduled an MRI within in a few weeks But she never had the test or followed up with me Patients frequently miss appointments and tests that their doctors schedule Noshow rates range from  to  percent In some instances like when a patient skips a cardiac stress test for example then has a heart attack the hospital might classify what occurred as a systems error Ideally such cases lead to new policies that prevent similar events But what about less drastic cases in which followup is necessary but not an emergency Should patients be held responsible for not showing up Or does the medical profession have an ethical and legal duty to try to track down the individuals  Patients miss appointments for many reasons Some simply forget or get confused Others may have conflicts If they promptly reschedule there is no problem But many do not or when they call the doctors office cannot get a prompt new appointment  When I schedule tests and followup visits I expect that they will occur As such one might assume that there are foolproof systems in place to ensure followup Yet this is far from the case From a legal perspective rescheduling needs to occur Medical liability experts   say missed appointments and failures to follow up pose some of the greatest legal risks for physicians But putting a system into place for following up with absent patients is expensive and timeconsuming at a time when many physicians offices and hospital clinics are just trying to stay afloat  Fortunately experts are devising systems to expedite followup For example a family medicine clinic at the University of Wisconsin lowered noshow rates from  to  percent by interviewing noshow patients implementing a new scheduling process and doublebooking the number of slots that corresponded to its noshow rate Other   making reminder calls before an appointment reducing wait times and creating a more welcoming environment  From an ethical perspective things are hazier Do patients really have no responsibility when it comes to followup After all nonadherence by patients is a wellknown and inevitable phenomenon If one argues that doctors or their colleagues need to call all people who miss appointments why shouldnt we also be calling every day to make sure patients are taking their medications exercising or adhering to their diets  Certain patients surely require special attention nonEnglish speakers persons with dementia or other neurological conditions and those with social problems that interfere with their ability to show up Doctors offices should anticipate these types of issues and work with patients to improve compliance But there is a limit to what can be done For example many of the patients I treat at Bellevue Medical Center do not have stable addresses or working phones And realistically my colleagues and I already work late trying to squeeze in more and more patients as reimbursements go down Do we have an ethical duty to hire additional staff members to call missing patients Or should we do so ourselves after we get home from work or on the weekends Indeed physicians may even secretly hope for a few absentees which enable them to spend extra time with the patients who do show up  One thing experts agree on is improved documentation If a doctor schedules a test or appointment for a patient that is particularly important he or she should document having emphasized this issue with the patient While this is not a foolproof method for preventing lawsuits it helps to clarify the physicians performance and line of thinking about the case Even when a clinic staff member calls patients in advance my noshow rate still hovers from  to  percent If the visits are for checkups I do not routinely call the patients but if there are urgent matters to be discussed I do Some of my patients have received delayed care because of missed visits although thankfully there have been no serious outcomes that I know of But the chance is always there    So what did I do when my patient with hypertension seemingly disappeared I called the number in the computer The person who answered told me that she had unexpectedly moved back to her native country in Africa So I did what I could I told him to contact the woman and urge her to get prompt diagnosis and treatment either there or here I said her condition was potentially dangerous He promised to pass along the message And then I wrote a note documenting the conversation
