In this weeks Scrubbing Up Dr Gavin Sandercock argues there has been a wellmeaning but misguided focus on obesity while the harm caused by inactivity has been overlooked We are used to seeing reports warning of an obesity timebomb But the extent of the problem is often exaggerated   for  from the National Child Measurement Programme suggest  of five to sixyearolds are obese  That equates to  children in each class of  In  it was    Does a year increase of just over one child per class seem like an epidemic Other data suggests childhood obesity levels are starting to plateau or even fall slightly  Overweight and obesity levels among two to fiveyearolds   at  for boys and  for girls between  and  But public healths continual focus on food and obesity leaves the more harmful effects of inactivity overlooked and ignores the role of physical fitness in health promotion and monitoring Despite its absence from the title obesity was mentioned  times in the minute parliamentary select committee on   Dietary advice changes almost continually eat less fat ban junk food tax fizzypop The   has proposed a tax on unhealthy foods to enable local authorities to help overweight and obese children  But are we missing the point Healthy eating is important but it is not the answer to obesity Most interventions such as breakfast clubs or free school dinners may actually increase the calories consumed Arguably inactivity is a better predictor of ill health than obesity Figures from the   BHF published this January show less than a fifth of children say they move enough  a figure thats still falling  Shockingly the BHFs own direct assessment of activity using accelerometers showed that none of the  to yearold girls and only  of boys they measured actually did enough exercise All children and young people should engage in moderatetovigorous intensity physical activity for at least  minutes a day But I think a better approach would be to measure fitness  Changes in activity levels often fail to have a big impact on body mass index BMI But it is very rare that anyone who becomes more active for example by walking to school or work or training for a funrun does not become and feel much physically fitter  I routinely test the fitness of elite sports people the public cardiac patients and entire schools Our research in schools shows decline in childrens fitness  What is needed is a wideranging set of changes to help children be habitually more active more often  If we measured fitness as the    we would see the problems that physical inactivity is causing and realise just how successfully some of the fantastic initiatives supported by Sport England the BHF and UK Active really are  BMI is a symptom of inactivity but it should not be used as the last word in measuring success of interventions to increase physical activity Anybody of any size can benefit from being more active whether they see a change in their weight or not
