The number of women getting double mastectomies after a breast cancer diagnosis has been rising in the past  years even though most of them dont face a higher risk of getting cancer in the other breast That has cancer doctors troubled because for those women having the other breast removed doesnt reduce their risk of getting breast cancer again or increase their odds of survival And they dont know why women are making this choice Worry about the cancer coming back is one of the biggest reasons according to a study of women in Michigan and California that tried to figure out which women decided on a double mastectomy and why Women who had a breast MRI were more likely to decide on a double mastectomy even if the scan didnt show more cancer Usually theres something on the image that cant be fully explained says   an associate professor at the University of Michigan and lead author of the   which was published Wednesday in  The thing that shows up on the MRI may well be nothing but its really difficult to know that you saw something unusual and then not worry about it Hawley and her colleagues looked at  women who were diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast from  to  or from  to  In all  percent of the women seriously considered having a double mastectomy and almost  percent of them decided to have that surgery More than twothirds of the women who had the double mastectomy   percent  had no genetic or family risk factors that would make it more likely that they would get breast cancer again Women with more education were more likely to choose double mastectomy the study found as were women who had had genetic testing even if the results came back showing they had no increased risk That surprised Hawley she thought women who got good news on a genetic test would be less likely to then have a prophylactic mastectomy She doesnt know if simply having a genetic test is enough to get women thinking seriously about double mastectomy or if theyre making the decision before they get the results back Hawley studies how patients make decisions about cancer treatment and says this study raises a big question Are women not understanding the risk information that doctors communicate or do they understand and decide to go ahead with the surgery anyway I think the answer is both are going on Hawley says Women are hearing the message but not completely understanding Risk information is difficult to convey and understand especially when youre getting a cancer diagnosis And even when women understand they are choosing to go ahead Most women wont lower their risk of cancer by getting a double mastectomy because their risk of getting breast cancer again was already very low And removing the noncancerous breast doesnt affect the survival rate from the existing cancer For women who dont have a family history of breast cancer or the BRCA genetic mutations other cancer treatments including lumpectomy and single mastectomy can improve a womans chances just as much as double mastectomy Hawley says Not feeling like double mastectomy is the only thing you can do to do everything possible would be a good thing to get out there she adds it seems like theres pressure to consider it now and if you dont do it youre not doing everything possible Hawley is testing a decision tool aimed to help women weigh their choices for breast cancer treatment and hopes that it will help reduce the anxiety that comes with a cancer diagnosis and the difficult decisions that follow
