Could medical marijuana be an antidote for the nations scourge of fatal overdoses caused by prescription pain medication A new study suggests the answer is yes and its set off a flurry of medical debate over the risks and benefits of making cannabis more widely available to patients The new research   finds that deaths associated with the use of opiate drugs fell in  states after they legalized medical marijuana Compared with states with no formal access to marijuana those that allowed certain patients legal access to cannabis saw a steady drop in opiaterelated overdoses that reached  on average six years after the states medical marijuana laws took effect The striking implication is that medical marijuana laws when implemented may represent a promising approach for stemming runaway rates of nonintentional opioidanalgesicrelated deaths wrote opiate abuse researchers Dr Mark S Brown and Marie J Hayes in a commentary published alongside the study If true this finding upsets the apple cart of conventional wisdom regarding the public health implications of marijuana legalizations and medicinal usefulness That apple cart has already been shaken by a growing body of research that suggests marijuanas psychoactive ingredients may enhance the painkilling effects of opiate drugs allowing patients using marijuana for pain to take lower  and less dangerous  doses of opiate medications Its so apparent that our patients can decrease diminish or wean themselves completely off of opiates and that it improves their quality of life said Dr Donald Abrams a UC San Francisco oncologist who was not involved with the study In a small study published in  Abrams found that cancer patients taking morphine and oxycodone experienced greater pain relief at lower opiate blood concentrations when a vaporized form of marijuana was added to their drug regimen He has just begun recruiting for a study that will explore whether the same formulation can reduce pain inflammation and opiate doses in patients with sicklecell disease But those who have opposed expanding access to medical marijuana said they were not persuaded that cannabis  a plant designated by the Drug Enforcement Agency as having no recognized medicinal use  is a safer alternative to opioids Clearly the study raised an intriguing hypothesis but many questions still need to be answered the National Institute on Drug Abuse said in a statement released Monday The analysis should not be oversimplified the statement warned Patients in  states and the District of Columbia now have the option of seeking a prescription for medical marijuana Two of those states Colorado and Washington also allow recreational use of the drug Chronic pain is thought to be the leading indication for cannabis use The study authors led by the University of Pennsylvanias Dr Marcus A Bachhuber focused on the years  to  The raw figures collected from states death certificates showed that rates of fatal opioid overdoses were higher in the states that had implemented medical marijuana laws than in those that had not But the researchers took those raw numbers and adjusted them so that it would be easier to make direct comparisons between the states For instance they accounted for the fact that each of the states that legalized medical marijuana during the study period did so on different schedules In addition they took into account a wide range of factors known to influence opioid abuse including state unemployment rates and policies tightening access to prescription painkillers The results showed that after a state began to implement a medical marijuana law the rate of its nonintentional opiate overdose fatalities fell compared with those of states without such laws And that comparative decline picked up steam over the first six years after the laws went into effect On average the statistical analysis showed states passing medical marijuana laws saw annual reductions of roughly  in their opioidrelated death rates compared with states with no such laws In their first year after implementation of the laws the  states averaged an opiaterelated fatality rate  lower than those of states without legalized medical marijuana The average difference between the two groups of states widened at two and three years out returned to  in year four then rose to just over  in years five and six About  of the nations fatal opioid overdoses occur among patients who have legitimate prescriptions for their medications The authors wrote that in states where access to medical marijuana is legal legitimate opioid drug users may take lower doses of that prescription pain medication making overdose less likely Others may use marijuana in place of benzodiazepine drugs  sedatives that make a fatal overdose much more likely Still other patients who might initiate opioid medication use  and go on to risk overdose  may never start if they are able to get pain relief from medical marijuana the study authors wrote That connection may be intrinsically appealing  some might view the idea that people could use a milder drug versus an opiate as an improvement said Kevin Sabet director of the University of Florida Drug Policy Institute in a statement But the new study suffers from too many uncertainties to allow that conclusion he said Dr Mark Ware a pain specialist and professor of family medicine at McGill University in Montreal called the JAMA Internal Medicine study very interesting and methodologically robust But he added theres probably a temptation to extend the findings of this study to far broader conclusions than are justified The United States is conducting a natural experiment on a national scale said Ware who is executive director for the Canadian Consortium for the Investigation of Cannabinoids an advocate for more research on marijuanas medical potential Before physicians and government officials can draw conclusions on the public health benefits of medical marijuana laws he said they need more detailed studies of how medical marijuana users take the drug and how its use affects physicians prescribing decisions especially for patients with chronic pain
