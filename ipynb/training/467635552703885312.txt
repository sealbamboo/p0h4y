That which walks like a duck and talks like a duck is not always actually a duck Thats the argument the American Medical Association has been using for decades to block public access to doctors Medicare billing records The AMA worries that people and the press will misinterpret the numbers when they see how doctors bill the governments  billion health care program for the elderly and disabled and that doctors who are doing nothing wrong could be unfairly accused of fraud But the medical association lost that argument last month and now doctors Medicare billing data is    dense complicated records And those records are beginning to tell stories and the independent newsroom ProPublica took a look a   at one particular type of medical service in the data In order to get paid doctors have to label everything they do for a patient with a billing code Routine visits for established patients are billed on a scale of  to  A level  code is for a short easy office visit level  is meant for the longest most complicated office visits which are also paid at a higher rate Office visits account for about  billion in Medicare spending every year One emergency medicine physician in Newhall California   billed Medicare for a level  visit an average of  times per patient in  A number that high raises huge red flags really high in the sky waving their arms ferociously says   a specialist in medical coding and reimbursement The more typical doctor in California bills for only one or two of these highlevel visits per year for each patient MorinSpatz says when she sees doctors with coding practices like Ordogs she thinks one thing I think that they are trying to code based on how much money they want as opposed to coding with a goal to satisfy the requirements of each particular level of service Californias medical board has tried to revoke Ordogs medical license for what it called incompetence making false statements and inadequate record keeping He is still practicing but currently on probation and did not return multiple requests for comment Ordog is one of hundreds of doctors in California with   In fact three California physicians are among the top five nationally in billing for the highest number of complex level  office visits Nationwide some  doctors always billed at the highest level possible for routine office visits In    doctors billed at the highest possible level for every one of their Medicare office visits NPR tried to contact  of these physicians Most didnt return the phone calls but   did Shes director of transplant infectious disease at the University of Colorado in Denver Levi works in the only academic medical center for hundreds of miles in any direction Its where other hospitals in the region send some of their toughest patients And therefore Levi says the time that is required to take care of them is longer than for some of the other specialties in infectious disease  and that results in the higher coding That sort of context isnt obvious in the   of Medicare payment data that was made public for the first time last month Levi is concerned people will misinterpret the information There has to be an understanding and recognition of specialty care that is provided in only a few places she says So I think its dangerous to lump everyone together and base everything on a code Dr Aris Sophocles a Denver physician who teaches medical coding to medical students and doctors says thats a perfectly reasonable caution But not every doctor who frequently bills at the highest level is being honest he says When I see someone in family medicine I get suspicious says Sophocles Similarly in other specialties such as general internal medicine and gastroenterology I become suspicious Sophocles is hardly on a witch hunt In fact hes also an attorney and he helps defend doctors who get prosecuted for having fishylooking billing practices He says Medicare does audit doctors and some have had to pay Medicare back or even face jail time which causes them to err on the side of undercoding  charging less than perhaps they should Some though are either unaware or unafraid he says And they tend to overcode anyhow and the release of this database may indicate who those people are In a statement to ProPublica Medicare officials said that it would be highly unusual for doctors to bill at the highest level  percent of the time
