The number of premature births and childrens hospital visits for     in parts of the United States Canada and Europe barely a year after they enacted smoking bans researchers reported in The Lancet last week The new analysis combined the results of  studies encompassing more than  million births and nearly  asthma attacks Experts called it the best evidence to date that legislation creating smokefree public places and workplaces improves childrens health even in the womb The results are very impressive said Dr Brian Mercer chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland who noted that half a million American babies are born prematurely each year If you could prevent  percent youd prevent nearly    in the US alone each year said Dr Mercer who was not involved in the study Dr Vincenzo Berghella the president of the   said There are over a million babies dying of being born preterm every year in the world We can make major strides in decreasing that with smoking bans After an exhaustive review of relevant studies spanning  years the researchers analyzed five that looked at perinatal and child health after local smoking bans in North America and six studies conducted after national bans in Europe Hospital visits for childhood asthma and premature births both declined about  percent in the year after smoking bans took effect the researchers found The investigators also pooled data from two studies and found a  percent reduction in the number of children born very small for their gestational age after the introduction of smokefree laws An earlier analysis of the impact of smoking bans on adult health   The new report offers another very good reason to institute smoking bans in public places said   an associate professor of health policy and medicine at Vanderbilt University who has studied birth outcomes linked to maternal smoking Only  percent of the worlds population is   and  percent of children worldwide are routinely exposed to secondhand smoke Growing up Dr Aliyu said he stifled coughs as his father smoked in the car Adults can just walk away or change their environment he said A child cant Despite fears that bans could lead to more smoking at home studies have shown the opposite is true Strong smokefree laws change social norms about smoking and consequently people implement smokefree policies in their own homes as well said   the director of the   at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health Thats probably how smokefree policies have such a direct impact on child health she added A  surgeon generals report   Yet we are still not doing a good enough job at protecting our children from secondhand smoke Dr Cohen said About half of Americans are protected by complete smokefree policies in workplaces restaurants and bars according to the Americans Nonsmokers Rights Foundation a nonprofit group In   its authors argue that strong tobacco control policies are a way to contain medical costs now not in a decade or two as experts used to think  exceeded  billion nationwide in  So even a  percent decrease in emergencyroom visits for asthma could translate into roughly a  billion savings said Dr Sara Kalkhoran an internist at the University of California San Francisco and a coauthor of the commentary The new analysis did not prove that smokefree laws caused the improvements in childrens health And the researchers didnt evaluate other factors like taxation of tobacco products and advertisement bans which could have contributed said   the director of extramural research at   We cant say that every country that does this that it will help to this degree she said referring to smoking bans in public places But this very welldone analysis again demonstrated the importance of limiting exposure to smoke for pregnant women and children she said The authors note that further studies are needed to estimate the effect of smokefree laws on respiratory tract infections in children a major problem of secondhand smoke The authors also cite a pressing need for studies of tobacco control laws in low to middleincome countries Our hope is that this kind of work will catalyze the introduction of smokefree laws and as that is done the opportunity is taken to evaluate their impact and strengthen the evidence said   the senior author of the paper and a health care policy fellow at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Still Dr Sheikh and his coauthors concluded It is now evident that earlylife protection from involuntary secondhand smoke exposure holds great potential to reduce the consequential disease burden
