
 Every so often even I am too busy or tired  or both  to cook But Im also too busy or tired to go out This usually happens when Ive been cooking all day as Ive been doing a lot lately because Im not only testing recipes for this column but also preparing food for booktour  cooking demonstrations  On these nights I dont want to get down another frying pan or saucepan I crave a sandwich and I turn lovingly to my toaster oven I rummage in the refrigerator  there is always something like greens Ive blanched a roasted red pepper a box of mushrooms that are beginning to shrivel or a hunk of butternut squash left over from another recipe test I try to keep my refrigerator stocked with a few different cheeses  goat cheese and feta a blue of some kind Gruyre and Parmesan This year because my son went away to boarding school  and I cant go through a loaf of bread before it goes stale Ive begun to keep loaves of sliced wholewheat country bread in the freezer so that I can pull it out by the slice when I need it  On the night that I came up with the idea for this weeks series of Recipes for Health  I had been preparing quiches all day for a cooking class with more cooking left to do that night I reached in the refrigerator and grabbed the bowl of beet greens from the farmers market that Id blanched the day before  blanch greens  when you get them home  its a great habit some delicious Gorgonzola and two slices of bread It took me about  minutes to slap the sandwich together and toast it in my toaster oven I decided then and there that since I would be going out of town the following week I would clean out my refrigerator over the next few days using all of the lingering vegetables in grilled cheese sandwiches where the vegetables shine as much as the cheese I took leftovers on the plane they were even  good cold  Mushrooms add a somewhat meaty essence to this quick vegetarian sandwich  A satisfying dinner that can be put together in  minutes  The sweet and earthy flavors of roasted squash are a tasty contrast to salty feta  The Middle Eastern nut and spice mix called dukkah is the surprise touch in this sandwich  Roasted artichoke hearts are an optional addition to this vegetablefilled sandwich
