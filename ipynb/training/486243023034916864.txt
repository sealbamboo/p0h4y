The modern idea of stress began on a rooftop in Canada with a handful of rats freezing in the winter wind This was  and by that point the owner of the rats an endocrinologist named Hans Selye had become expert at making rats suffer for science He would subject them to extreme temperatures make them go hungry for long periods or make them exercise a lot the medical historian  says Then what he would do is kill the rats and look at their organs What was interesting to Selye was that no matter how different the tortures he devised for the rats were  from icy winds to painful injections  when he cut them open to examine their guts it appeared that the physical effects of his different tortures were always the same Almost universally these rats showed a particular set of signs Jackson says There would be changes particularly in the adrenal gland So Selye began to suggest that subjecting an animal to prolonged stress led to tissue changes and physiological changes with the release of certain hormones that would then cause disease and ultimately the death of the animal And so the idea of stress  and its potential costs to the body  was born But heres the thing The idea of stress wasnt born to just any parent It was born to Selye a scientist absolutely determined to make the concept of stress an international sensation He wrote I dont know  books and articles I mean it was a massive massive output from the man says Jackson He was an incredible man He only slept four or five hours a day He was always the first in the lab and the last to leave his energy was fantastic Selye went all over the world promoting the gospel of stress As Selye wrote in his biography   one of  books he authored to promote the concept of stress Stress will have been my cathedral and I shall polish and perfect it  I know my child will outlive me But Selye wasnt the only highprofile scientist who decided to promote the idea that stress posed a profound danger to health In the mids two American cardiologists  Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman  created the idea of the Type A personality Their argument essentially was that there existed in America an entire class of people who lived lives so full of stress and pressure that their bodies were especially prone to disease particularly heart attack The doctors published a study that claimed the coronary disease rate for men with Type A personality was twice as high as other men This idea of a special driven and stresssensitive subset of personality really captured the American imagination You can still see it today says   director of public health research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Literally many thousands of websites still talk about Type A behavior in a fairly uncritical way It still has that grip in popular culture The thing most people dont realize as they worry over the dangers of stress Petticrew says is that much of this foundational scientific research on stress was funded and guided by a very particular sponsor Whats never really been appreciated is that the tobacco industry was a major funder and stimulant of research on stress he says Specifically Selyes work but also research on   Type A personality is to a large extent a construct of the tobacco industry For the past decade or so Petticrew and a group of colleagues in London have been searching through millions of documents from the tobacco industry that were archived online in the late s as part of a legal settlement with tobacco companies What theyve discovered is that both Selyes work and much of the work around Type A personality were profoundly influenced by cigarette manufacturers They were interested in promoting the concept of stress because it allowed them to argue that it was stress  not cigarettes  that was to blame for heart disease and cancer In the case of Selye they vetted  the content of the paper they agreed the wording of papers says Petticrew tobacco industry lawyers actually influenced the content of his writings they suggested to him things that he should comment on They also Petticrew says spent a huge amount of money funding his research All of this is significant Petticrew says because Selyes influence over our ideas about stress are hard to overstate It wasnt just that Selye came up with the concept but in his time he was a tremendously respected figure Selye was one of the major scientists of the th century he was nominated for a Nobel Prize  times Petticrew says So I feel its impossible and its misleading to talk about stress without acknowledging the fact that he had a very very close working relationship with the tobacco industry And they helped him to shape his ideas and he helped them to shape theirs This is also true of the work around Type A personalities and the notion that a highly stressed personality  not cigarette consumption  caused heart disease particularly in men Petticrew says that though early studies some of which were funded by tobacco companies showed a connection between Type A and heart attacks as more studies have piled up the original findings of Friedman and Rosenman have been undermined There have been very few studies which have actually shown that Type A behavior is a risk factor for illness certainly for coronary heart disease Petticrew says Of the studies that do show that and there are only four in three of them the researchers had some contact or money from the tobacco industry Thats not to say and absolutely shouldnt be said that all Type A behavior research is tainted by tobacco money But it has had a major skewing effect on the field which I think has been completely unrecognized NPR contacted Altrias Philip Morris tobacco unit the primary funder of Type A research and also a major contributor to Selye The company had no comment about the research a spokesman said all the research happened too long ago In the years since Selyes foundational work research on stress has exploded Theres no question that stress particularly chronic stress in childhood has a very serious impact on longterm health But some scientists now argue that our usual narrative of stress  that stress is universally bad for health  is too onesided and doesnt reflect the reality that some degree of stress can actually benefit people Stress isnt always a bad thing Still the narrative of stress promoted by the tobacco industry through research and marketing is alive and well A ghost from a long time ago continues to shape how we see and experience stress
