A viable effective vaccine against malaria has long eluded scientists Results from a preliminary study have ignited hope that a new type of vaccine could change that The experimental vaccine offered strong protection against malaria when given at high doses scientists   Thursday in the journal   The study was extremely small and shortterm And the candidate vaccine still has a long way to go before it could be used in the developing world Nevertheless   who leads the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases calls the findings unprecedented The vaccine called PfSPZ protected  of the  volunteers from   including all six who received the high dose By contrast  of the  participants who werent vaccinated came down with malaria Its true to say that this is really impressive to have this degree of protection Fauci says about the results But on the other hand you have to temper it by saying the numbers are still relatively small The trial needs to be replicated on a far larger scale he says And its still unknown how long the malaria protection lasts The participants in this study were all bitten by five mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite   three weeks after getting the vaccine shot Because everyone got exposed at the same time this study wasnt designed to show how PfSPZ works over time For any vaccine to be successful in the field it would need to ward off the disease for years after the inoculation Three weeks would be way too short Previous experimental vaccines have shown some effectiveness against the malaria parasite but none have provided high levels of protection against the disease In November another candidate vaccine showed   in tests among young infants though it provided children moderate protection against the parasite PfSPZ is different from these previous vaccines because it uses whole weakened parasites to trigger an immune response instead of just a small part of the parasite like a protein on its surface We dont have any vaccines against parasitic infections like malaria because the parasite is so complex It changes itself in your body It morphs from one stage to the next says Stephen Hoffman the CEO of the Rockville Md company   which developed PfSPZ Specially PfSPZ gets certain immune cells called T cells to attack the parasite directly instead of relying primarily on an antibody response The idea that somehow one is going to make a vaccine that just attacks one of those thousands of proteins and thats going to provide longterm protective immunity has always seemed odd to me he says But thats what all the other approaches are about Sanaria is moving quickly to conduct larger scale trials of PfSPZ in Africa A study in Tanzania is slated to start in six weeks If things go well with the upcoming trials Hoffman says the earliest the vaccine might be available for widespread use would be in late  or early
