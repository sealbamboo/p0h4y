Bradley Manning may want to live as a woman but the young man sentenced to prison this week for leaking hundreds of thousands of secret government documents will face a difficult  if not impossible  task of beginning to switch his gender behind bars  Manning    Thursday that he intends to request hormone therapy while at Fort Leavenworth prison  I am Chelsea Manning I am female the Army private wrote in a statement read on TODAY Thursday  Throughout Mannings courtmartial for divulging government papers to the website WikiLeaks the soldiers gender confusion was a factor used by the defense The move raises a host of questions about Manning about transgender inmates in the US  and about the treatment itself Here are answers from experts and advocates familiar with sexchange issues         Manning is being held at the military prison in Fort Leavenworth Kan where the now discharged soldier is expected to serve at least seven years and up to the full sentence of  years  The Army does not provide hormone therapy or sexreassignment surgery for gender identity disorder Kimberly Lewis a spokeswoman for the prison told NBC News  Mannings lawyer David Coombs told TODAY that hes hoping Fort Leavenworth would do the right thing and provide hormone therapy for Manning If Fort Leavenworth does not then Im going to do everything in my power to make sure they are forced to do so Coombs said that Manning hasnt discussed whether to pursue sexreassignment surgery while in prison Manning reportedly expressed ongoing distress over gender confusion and created an identity dubbed Breanna while deployed and now identifies as a she named Chelsea She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria the preferred term for gender identity disorder or GID according to Dr David Moulton the defenses expert on forensic psychiatry Its a rare condition in which people feel that their physical gender does not match who they are on the inside In a statement read on TODAY Manning wrote Given the way that I feel and have felt since childhood I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible I hope that you will support me in this transition No inmates have received sexreassignment surgery while in US prisons though dozens of lawsuits have forced changes at the state and federal level that have opened the door to such treatment said Jennifer Levi director of the Transgender Rights Project for the Gay  Lesbian Advocates and Defenders or GLAD In the highestprofile case so far a Boston judge told Massachusetts officials to grant the procedure last year to a transgender prisoner Michelle Kosilek Kosilek formerly known as Robert is facing a life sentence for the  murder of wife Cheryl Kosilek Kosileks doctors have said that surgery is the only treatment that will fully address her gender identity disorder she attempted castration and tried to commit suicide twice while held in an allmale prison That court decision is pending on appeal Kosilek has already received hormone therapy and laser hair removal Other inmates have received hormone therapy and other care for transgender issues Under old rules transgender inmates housed by the federal Bureau of Prisons were treated only for their existing conditions when they were admitted to prison If they took hormones for instance that was maintained But in  after a lawsuit the prison bureau changed its policy to allow treatment and care for problems diagnosed after incarceration Treatment options will not be precluded solely due to the level of services received or lack of services prior to incarceration the new policy states That opens the door to new options including surgery Very little is known about transgender inmates in military prisons advocates say Mannings request may even be unprecedented  No one knows how many of the nearly  million prisoners in the US are identified as transgender A  study by the California Department of Corrections identified more than  transgender inmates in a population of about  equal to about  percent But the National Center for Transgender Equality estimates that the actual figure may be much higher When that group surveyed transgender people in  officials found that  percent of nearly  respondents reported that theyd been jailed at some time in their lives     Doctors who treat transgender people and advocates who lobby on their behalf say that inmates are legally entitled to health care while incarcerated  including services for gender identity issues  Treatment for people with severe gender dysphoria is medically necessary said Dr Sherman Leis of the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery who performs sexchange operations three days a week  Just as diabetics need insulin and people with heart problems need surgery inmates with gender identityrelated health problems require the most appropriate treatment said Mara Keisling executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality  This is America we do not deny prisoners health care Keisling said What happens if they break a leg while theyre in custody What happens if they develop schizophrenia It is illegal to withhold those treatments  For those in and out of prison switching genders is a protracted complicated process that involves years of psychiatric counseling hormone therapy and  sometimes but not always  surgery experts say Maletofemale transgender people typically take the female hormone estrogen in sufficient doses to influence the development of breasts and other secondary sex characteristics They must receive adequate regular doses for the rest of their lives to maintain their new gender They often also undergo laser hair removal If surgery is indicated it can involve a range of procedures including removal of the original sex organs and reconstruction of new genitals Other surgeries can include removing or augmenting breasts and reshaping facial contours Leis said  Coombs Mannings lawyer told TODAY that his clients final goal is not necessarily surgery  No I think the ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she never had an opportunity to be Coombs said   Cost ranges widely from  to  or more for surgery with ongoing costs of up to  a month for hormone therapy and more for psychotherapy  If a prisoner receives care while incarcerated the taxpayers would foot the bill advocates say GID is diagnosed by a doctor and the lifealtering treatment must be prescribed Besides prisons usually go by birth gender when assigning inmates so even after gender reassignment a newly female prisoner could end up in a male population or in isolation for her own protection Fort Leavenworth spokesman George Marcec told the Associated Press that Manning would need to petition for a transfer to a federal prison to receive hormone treatment In addition the prison staff can separate highrisk prisoners from the general population based on the level of security risk to the inmate and others he added Officials with the United States Disciplinary Barracks said that they have procedures to ensure that Manning and any other transgender inmates are protected from abuse and assault while in custody  The USDB has implemented risk assessment protocols and safety procedures to address high risk factors identified with the Prison Rape Elimination Act the agency said in a statement
