If a recent federal court ruling stands any young woman will be able to walk into her neighborhood drugstore find the   near the shelves stocked with   and KY Jelly and buy it  no questions asked That would be a surprising change At the moment girls  and younger must have a prescription to buy the morningafter pill which helps prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse As a result even though it is nonprescription for everyone else even an older woman can buy it only at the pharmacy window and she must show a valid ID and proof of age Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and at numerous professional medical societies have long endorsed easier access to Plan B the most common brand of emergency   But in  Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services took the unusual step of   to make the pill universally available On Friday a   Nancy Northup president of the   a legal advocacy group that sued to expand nonprescription access to Plan B called the ruling a resounding triumph for science over politics The irony is that despite the long legal battle to make the morningafter pill more widely available greater access to Plan B is not likely to have a dramatic impact Its unlikely to trigger another sexual revolution change sexual mores or even to reduce pregnancy rates among unmarried women most observers agree Studies have suggested that many women are not aware that there even is a morningafter pill Plan B is expensive about  and many women could find the price alone a deterrent If drugstores choose to keep Plan B locked up teenagers may be reluctant to ask for it Moreover Plan B is not a panacea While it is most effective when taken within days or hours of unprotected intercourse it doesnt always work Still Plan B and another option Next Choice were effective in at least half of the instances they were used according to one review of published data And some studies have found that the drugs are just as effective two to four days after unprotected sex as they are when taken the next day Even when the morningafter pill was made available in advance to young women in clinical studies however they often did not use it and pregnancy rates were not affected Older girls were just as likely to use other forms of   though some studies found that younger girls from troubled backgrounds said they were more careless when given access to a morningafter pill Compared with years past American teenagers have been postponing sexual activity beginning sex on average at  Teenage childbearing rates have dropped sharply in the past  years At the same time more than half of births to women under the age of  now occur outside marriage according to government data This is not a magic bullet said Dr Susan Wood an associate professor of health policy at George Washington University Its just one more tool in the toolbox  one more option that can help women have that second chance if they need it Conservative opponents continue to raise questions about the drugs mechanism calling it a possible abortifacient although the scientific consensus is that the morningafter pill is a contraceptive that prevents pregnancy by interfering with ovulation and not with implantation of a fertilized egg Dr Mary Davenport recent president of the American Association of ProLife Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledged that her groups opposition to Plan B is rooted in broader concerns about casual sexual activity   and single motherhood Fear of pregnancy is a deterrent to sexual activity Dr Davenport said When you introduce something like this it changes peoples behaviors and they have more risky sex Teens will be counting on this morningafter pill to bail them out and theyll have more casual encounters Giving minors direct access to Plan B also takes parents guardians and other responsible adults like physicians out of the equation at a time when young women may need their help and advice she said The next legal step is not clear Justice Department officials have not said yet whether they will appeal the decision Ms Northup said all eyes were now on President Obama who has championed contraception coverage as an essential component of   and despite the controversy surrounding this issue made it a required element of employerprovided   under the Affordable Care Act Whether were talking about emergency contraceptives or aspirin the standard should be whether it is safe and effective for people to use without a prescription Ms Northup said This is very safe You cant misuse emergency contraception Why in this area are we asking for a different standard
