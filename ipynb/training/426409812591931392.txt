By the time I rushed to his room my patient had already ripped out his IV packed his knapsack and was making his way to the door his hospital gown on backward flapping like a cape over the jeans he had hurriedly slipped on He told me he felt fine now after coming in feverish and sweating a few nights back and despite his poorly controlled HIV and the strong possibility that the lump in his neck was lymphoma We had been waiting several days for the biopsy results but now he had had enough Ive got things to do he declared Call me when you know Wait We uh almost I stammered He glared at me and continued his barechested charge toward the door Just then the attending physician arrived and calmly approached the patient He offered him a glass of water and asked if they could chat for a few minutes Patients leaving AMA or against medical advice were not uncommon on this floor The attending had practice It showed He said he understood the patients frustration apologized for the delay and promised to Â call the doctors in the pathology department to see why the test results were taking so long He asked where the patient was planning to go why he felt it so important to leave and offered to connect him with social services that could help take care of things outside the hospital He grabbed a napkin and drew a quick sketch explaining how his disease would likely progress and the many risks of leaving without treatment All right doc Ill give you a couple more days the patient finally said Together  in white coat and gowncape  they strode back to his room Doctors negotiate every day almost constantly  sometimes dramatically often imperceptibly They hold family meetings to resolve sensitive endoflife issues They address barriers to medication adherence They encourage patients to receive uncomfortable screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms They refuse treatments that are requested but not medically indicated Yet they receive almost no formal instruction in how to do so Dealing with medical colleagues creates an additional layer of negotiating complexityespecially in busy academic centers with competing demands on specialists time Medicine is increasingly a team sport In  only about  fulltime clinical staff cared for the average hospital patient today that number is   Doctors consult other doctors many times a day to discuss potential treatment options and decide on the best course of action They work closely with residents students nurses physician assistants care coordinators and others to implement those plans At each interaction opportunities for collegiality and efficiency  or rancor and resentment  abound That can mean the difference between a timely or delayed blood draw accepting or refusing a consult or getting those biopsy results today versus tomorrow Recognizing the importance of negotiation medical schools are starting to invest in communication training for students  and it seems to be paying off Research suggests communication training can improve   diagnostic   and   But good communication by itself is only part of the solution We need to teach doctors how to negotiate Negotiation in this context is not about winning or losing or haggling over price or scare resources Its about exploring underlying interests and positions to bring parties together in a constructive way Its about creative innovative thinking to create lasting value and forge strong professional relationships Its about investigating what is behind positions that may seem irrational at first to understand the problem behind the problem The medical profession is no longer one in which doctors dictate a given treatment course to patients who are then expected to follow it Rather clinicians and patients deliberate about treatment options weigh costs and benefits together and determine the best course of action This approach requires eliciting patient concerns and addressing underlying fears to arrive at the most effective strategy for maximizing health and wellbeing As diseases like HIV and some cancers that were once uniformly fatal become chronic conditions and a greater diversity of treatment options becomes available the ability to negotiate longterm care plans will only grow in importance Physicians are also increasingly assuming leadership roles They are expected to negotiate with a vast array of third parties including health plans governments and pharmaceutical companies Health care changes double down on this expectation The Affordable Care Act creates incentives for doctors and hospitals to band together to create networks known as Accountable Care Organizations  provider groups responsible for caring for an assigned patient population Under new Medicare rules providers can be paid less if they have low patient satisfaction scores or   As quality metrics and costeffectiveness play a larger role in reimbursement physicians will need to negotiate with governments and insurers to establish fair and reasonable performance measures Each medical encounter then becomes a multiparty minitreaty signed by doctor patient and family members  and sometimes consulting physicians ancillary staff insurers hospitals and governments Law business and public policy schools all offer classes in negotiation recognizing the interdisciplinary and interdependent nature of their professions Isnt it time medical schools did too
