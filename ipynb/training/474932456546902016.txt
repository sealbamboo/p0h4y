The  in Milwaukee was horrific But in looking for an explanation for the attempted murder by two other adolescent girls there have been attempts to vilify Internet memes such as   as putative causes for this kind or any kind of violence We have to remember that the boogeyman will always play a pivotal role in the normal development of children and adolescents  and neurobiology can help us understand why Hes present in the myth of the Golem and the French folk tale Bluebeard Many of the novels of Neil Gaiman The Graveyard Book Coraline or Stephen Kings horror tales such as It are aimed squarely at either yearolds who feel vulnerable to the dark and terrifying supernatural or those of us who remember what it was like to be  Reread Ray Bradburys The Halloween Tree Youll remember the fun of a good scare The preadolescents love for the macabre is tied to a higherorder contemplation of what it means to be frightened in the first place Those of us who enjoy scary stories and scary movies dont just enjoy being scared We enjoy asking ourselves   were scared In neurobiological terms this is called a metacognition This means that we experience something and then we ask ourselves what we think about what we experience The attempts to place blame for the attack on the shoulders of phenomena like Slender Man unduly implicates fictional entities for horrific acts Humans including  yearold kids are much more complicated than that In fact the characteristics of this particular boogeyman a faceless character with long spidery limbs who is able to hypnotize children are even a tad clichd But thats part of the appeal of the horror genre  the spinetingling predictability of a good scary story Let me tell you about ThumpDrag ThumpDrag lived in the mythology of my summer camp when I was  years old Campers were told from the first day we arrived to fear a humanlike creature that lived in the woods surrounding our cabins The creatures name ThumpDrag came from a gross yet poorly defined abnormality in either his right or his left leg Because of his bum appendage he had a distinctive walk that allowed for a predictably rhythmic footfall THUMP DraaaagTHUMP Draaag These two sounds his healthy foot planting forward and then the deadened limb being dragged along behind him were of course easily imitated by excited counselors and not a few campers We would always know they told us that ThumpDrag was approaching even before we heard his growls We would hear his walk Oh yeah ThumpDrag also loved to eat campers The real mysteries of life girls and politics and why our nation seemed always to be at war these mysteries were just barely present in my preadolescent psyche But I definitely devoted a lot of mental energy to ThumpDrag However I did not for one second think that he was real Heres the thing When I remember these stories I smile Why did I enjoy this feeling then and why do I enjoy it now It just so happens that the   in this kind of metacognitive inquiry around ages  to  That makes sense if you think about it When you have your first crush it behooves you to know not just that you find yourself smitten but to ask yourself why you are smitten That kind of selfawareness is essential to negotiating the murky waters of emerging adulthood The stakes are pretty low when you ask yourself why you love a movie like Salems Lot But the stakes are pretty high when you ask yourself why you love another human being Some of us maybe even lots of us practice these metacognitive skills in genres that are soundly separate from real world mysteries This brings us back to the bogeyman There is of course no Slender Man There was never a ThumpDrag But the adolescent brain loves to think about why it thinks anything powerfully In other words the adolescent brain loves to think about what it feels The teen brain is essentially an animated and interactive gathering of the gods on Mount Olympus Jealousy battles power It could be the theme of a good horror story
