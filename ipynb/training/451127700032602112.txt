People with low   levels are more likely to die from   and heart disease and to suffer from other illnesses scientists reported in two large studies published on Tuesday The new research suggests strongly that blood levels of vitamin D are a good barometer of overall health But it does not resolve the question of whether low levels are a cause of disease or simply an indicator of behaviors that contribute to poor health like a sedentary lifestyle smoking and a diet heavy in processed and unhealthful foods Nicknamed the sunshine nutrient vitamin D is produced in the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight It can be obtained from a small assortment of foods including fish eggs fortified dairy products and organ meats And blood levels of it can be lowered by smoking   and inflammation Vitamin D helps the body absorb   and is an important part of the immune system Receptors for the vitamin and related enzymes are found throughout cells and tissues of the body suggesting it may be vital to many physiological functions said Dr Oscar H Franco a professor of   at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands and an author of  which appeared in the journal BMJ It has effects at the genetic level and it affects cardiovascular health and bone health he said There are different hypotheses for the factors that vitamin D regulates from genes to inflammation Thats the reason vitamin D seems so promising The two studies were metaanalyses that included data on more than a million people They included observational findings on the relationship between disease and blood levels of vitamin D The researchers also reviewed evidence from randomized controlled trials  the gold standard in scientific research  that assessed whether taking vitamin D daily was beneficial Dr Franco and his coauthors  a team of scientists at Harvard Oxford and other universities  found persuasive evidence that vitamin D protects against major diseases Adults with lower levels of the vitamin in their systems had a  percent increased risk of death from heart disease  percent greater likelihood of death from cancer and a greater mortality risk overall When the researchers looked at supplement use they found no benefit to taking one form of the vitamin D But middleaged and older adults who took another form vitamin D  which is the type found in fish and dairy products and produced in response to sunlight  had an  percent reduction in mortality from all causes compared to adults who did not In the United States and Europe it is estimated that more than twothirds of the population is deficient in vitamin D In their paper Dr Franco and his colleagues calculated that roughly  percent of all deaths in the United States and  percent in Europe could be attributed to low vitamin D levels We are talking about a large part of the population being affected by this he said Vitamin D could be a good route to prevent mortality from cardiovascular disease and other causes of mortality In the second study  a team of researchers at Stanford and several universities in Europe presented a more nuanced view of vitamin D They concluded there was suggestive evidence that high vitamin D levels protect against   stroke   and a host of other illnesses But they also said there was no highly convincing evidence that vitamin D pills affected any of the outcomes they examined Based on what we found we cannot recommend widespread supplementation said Evropi Theodoratou an author of the study and research fellow at the Center for Population Health Sciences at the University of Edinburgh The second study also looked at bone health While Vitamin D had long been believed to help prevent   fractures from falls clinical trials in recent years have challenged the idea The study also found no evidence to support that assumption Vitamin D might not be as essential as previously thought in maintaining bone mineral density Dr Theodoratou and her colleagues wrote Dr Theodoratou was not alone in suggesting people hold off on taking vitamin D supplements for now Even though Dr Franco found them to be beneficial he said that more research was needed to show what levels are best Instead of taking pills people could improve their vitamin D levels with an adequate diet and  minutes of sunlight twice a week he said The most important factors in obtaining vitamin D are going out and doing some exercise and following a healthy diet he added And in   in BMJ Paul Welsh and Dr Naveed Sattar of the British Heart Foundations Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Center pointed out that previous research extolled the virtues of antioxidant   only for major trials of vitamins E and C and   to show null or even some harmful effects of supplementation They said vitamin D pills should not be recommended widely until clinical trials that are underway shed more light on the benefits and potential side effects But Duffy MacKay a spokesman for the   a supplement industry trade group said that vitamin D is not easily obtained through food alone and noted that exposure to sunlight has its dangers  He said he agreed with Dr Franco that more research was needed to identify an optimal dose and duration of vitamin D But there is enough positive research currently to indicate that people should be supplementing with vitamin D for a variety of positive health outcomes he added
