Baby boomers have never needed more care to ease their pain and suffering But there simply arent enough specialists to get the job done Theres   of as many as  physicians focused on palliative care and hospice care Right now there are  hospice programs and  hospital palliative care teams in the US according to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine That means theres   specialist for every  older adults living with a severe chronic illness There have to be more people for whom this is a specialty says Dr Thomas Smith   at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore If you dont have enough people to be out there practicing and showing people a better way to communicate a better way to relieve pain a better way to help peoples distress it wont happen Patients with many kinds of illness  from chronic to lifeending  can turn to palliative care for help with symptoms The specialty also spans psychological counseling help with family conflicts and spiritual support The American Board of Medical Specialties defines the subspecialty as Hospice and Palliative Medicine Although hospice is most often a homecare service palliative care consultation services are more common in hospitals or outpatient clinics In Europe or Canada or Australia hospice care and palliative care are the same thing says   executive vice president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine who also works at a palliative care clinic outside Denver But in this country the Medicare hospice benefit has defined hospice care as a wonderful set of services but only for people in their last six months of life Smith says that giving palliative care alongside usual care is now the accepted best practice You can show that people live longer people probably do live better and their relatives  if they happen to die  do a lot better if you get palliative care involved he says If you have these conversations people are less distressed and less depressed So if palliative care has so much to offer why arent there more specialists available to provide it Well Smith notes that specialties like family medicine geriatrics and palliative care dont pay as well as others When youve got an average oncology salary of  and an average primary care salary of  which do you think people are going to go into he asks But Storey says theres actually a lot of interest in the field from doctors nurses social workers and chaplains Hes more concerned about a bottleneck that is slowing certification The American Board of Medical Specialties allowed doctors who were already practicing in this field to sit for a certifying exam up until last October and we had thousands of doctors sit for that exam he says The bad news is that now in order to sit for that exam you have to do a oneyear fellowship and there are only  fellowships turning out two fellows a year So all of sudden were down to about  doctors a year that we can get board certified Nurses are another important part of palliative care teams Although there are limited   on the short supply of nurses in the area Storey says that the National Board for Certification of Hospice and Palliative Nurses is certifying lots more people than we are To get more doctors and nurses into the field involves figuring out how to certify more people how to incorporate hospice and palliative medicine into primary care and other specialties and how to use nurse practitioners and physicians assistants more effectively in providing this care To answer these hows Storey hopes Congress can lend a hand with the   which Senators Ron Wyden DOre and Jack Reed DRI introduced last month The AAHPMcrafted legislation  previously proposed in  and   would open education centers train physicians to teach palliative medicine give training fellowships to midcareer physicians and award grants and contracts to doctors who enter the specialty either to teach or practice Smith and other doctors are also encouraging specialists like oncologists cardiologists and surgeons to learn the basic aspects of palliative medicine In a recent     Drs Timothy Quill and Amy Abernethy proposed a broader approach in which the primary care physician or treating specialist could manage many palliative care problems initiating a palliative care consultation for more complex or refractory problems The case for expanding palliative care is now clear advocates say especially for difficult cases Were going have to pay attention to the most expensive patients and our previous structure has basically rewarded doctors for just doing more and more and more and more stuff Storey says Weve now got very good research to show that just doing more procedures and tests on people in their final months of life isnt better They dont live longer theyre not more comfortable and often the opposite is true
