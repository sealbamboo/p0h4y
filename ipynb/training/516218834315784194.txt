Im going to show you two kinds of nothing The first is a small patch of space way way out in the universe remote from everything with nothing in it no stars no planets no bits of dust no debris no atoms not even one Its as empty as empty can be And next Im going to show you a painting Except it isnt a painting its a canvas on which you see  absolutely nothing No marks no paint no human gesture It too is totally empty It was made by the American artist   Now comes the riddle If you showed that patch of empty space to a physicist he or she would tell you It isnt empty No matter how remote every inch of our universe carries a mysterious dark energy that is pressing out in all directions Were not sure how it works but across this same patch you will also find threads of gravitational force stretching to every part of the universe while deep down in impossibly small subatomic nooks and crannies theres a riot of coming and going a quantum flux with little clouds of matter popping in then out of existence like summer storms A patch of empty space may look empty but in fact its nothingness contains all kinds of invisible somethings Empty is always hiding secrets Its the same with the picture Sixty years ago it wasnt blank It was a fully realized drawing made of charcoal crayon paint and pencil by one of the worlds great artists   In  it was sitting in a folder with a bunch of other drawings in de Koonings Manhattan studio  until the day Rauschenberg knocked on de Koonings door The two artists had never met Willem de Kooning was a star Rauschenberg a newcomer still in his s who had been thinking about how to paint emptiness Hed just exhibited a group of all white canvases empty of color Now he wanted to do the same thing with a drawing make it empty if he could only figure out how How do you make an empty drawing He thought Wait what if I took a drawing and erased it That would be going from something to nothing So he tried He drew a picture rubbed it out and felt silly Something was subtracted but nobody cared Rauschenberg wasnt important not yet and erasing a Nobodys something was not like erasing a Somebodys something and thats when he decided he would do a totally crazy thing he would go with no invitation to the hottest most successful artist in the city and ask him to hand over a drawing that would automatically have artistic and commercial value and tell him I want to erase what you give me Thats how I will create empty You see how ridiculously you have to think   He wasnt sure he had the nerve to walk into the Great Mans studio but found the address and nervously cradling a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey he rang the buzzer He remembers hoping de Kooning wasnt home But he was De Kooning invited him in They chatted for a bit and then Rauschenberg explained what he wanted to do De Koonings reaction was a little odd he took the canvas he was working on off its easel and set it like a doorjamb against the already closed front door locking both men inside the studio Rauschenberg thought Oh no  OK I dont like it   but Im going to go along with it because I understand the idea De Kooning began rifling through his stacks of drawings until he found one held it up and thought no and stuck it back in again I want to give you one that Ill miss he said Rauschenberg embarrassed wanted to blurt out Hey it doesnt have to be a good one in fact if its too good art dealers will hate me Just give me something minor but he was too shy to speak Meanwhile de Kooning kept looking He couldnt have made me more uncomfortable Rauschenberg recalled De Kooning pulled out a second set of drawings chose a few and said These I would miss I like them But then as before he dropped them back into their folder No he said I want it to be very hard to erase Im going to make it so hard for you to erase this That led him to a third folder where he found an image made of charcoal crayon pencil and paint  thats the one he handed over to Rauschenberg who took it said thanks and left When he got back to his studio he set about the painstaking business of erasing Bills gorgeous painting from the paper without leaving a mark As de Kooning had promised it wasnt easy It took me about a month and I dont know how many erasers to do it he said But he managed When he was done the drawing was gone Today it sits a total blank You can stare at it forever and not know what it had been or perhaps in some ghostly way still is because the painting isnt telling and de Kooning and Rauschenberg are both dead so they cant tell You wouldnt even know thered once been something to look at except for the title Its called   Same for the patch of space The universe doesnt tell what its hiding though its hiding a lot All those planets stars moons and great clouds of dust we can see are a small percentage of whats actually there Most of the universe is made of dark matter that neither emits nor absorbs light So most of whats going on in the universe looks like well  nothing We are surrounded by Nothing Everywhere we go we have no idea what were not seeing We dont know what gravitational fields look like what dark matter looks like what quantum foam looks like what de Koonings drawing looked like but what the scientists and the artists are telling us in their very different ways is that if we lean in and pay very close attention sometimes what looks like Nothing is the best place to find the most interesting  somethings
