There are so many fish in the sea But from a diners viewpoint peering down at a sliver of white fish atop a bed of sushi rice a lot of them look the same Now a   from the ocean conservation group Oceana confirms that theres a pretty decent chance that fish on the plate or on ice in the seafood case is not what its labeled to be That means that seafood wallet cards designed by conservation groups to help steer consumers towards   choices may not be doing much good Between  and  Oceana took  seafood samples from  retail outlets in  states When they tested the   they found that  percent were mislabeled Sushi vendors and grocery stores were the most likely outlets to sell mislabeled food though Oceana says the fraud can happen before it reaches them Earlier   by Oceana and the   revealed that seafood mislabeling is common in cities like New York and Boston where people eat a lot of fish But the report out Thursday shows its happening across the country and is as bad or worse in places like Texas and Colorado Some  percent of the retail outlets sampled in Austin and Houston sold mislabeled seafood while  percent in Colorado did so So whats the big deal with fish sold under a pseudonym Well for one its often just a form of swindling  a cheap fish like tilapia sold as red snapper But Oceana says the practice also can put consumers at health risk when species like king mackerel which is high in mercury or escolar which contains a naturally occurring toxin than can cause gastrointestinal problems are marketed as grouper and white tuna respectively Oceanas also concerned that substituting cheaper easiertofind fish for rarer more valuable ones gives consumers a distorted sense of the market Of the fish types most heavily sampled by Oceana those sold as snapper and tuna had the highest mislabeling rates   and  percent Only seven of the  samples of red snapper purchased nationwide were actually red snapper the report found The majority of fraud is various fish standing in for snapper  its used as catchall name for all kinds of white fleshed fish says Oceana senior scientist   But there are real conservation concerns when you slip in things in place of the real thing People think snapper must be doing great because its everywhere but its overfished Consumers using wallet cards from groups like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and NRDC could end up buying exactly the species theyre trying to avoid Warner says because mislabeling is so prevalent One reason mislabeling has gotten so rampant is that the US now imports  percent of its seafood and less than  percent is inspected for fraud That means wouldbe fraudsters have a lot new options for substitutionsThe Food and Drug Administration regularly updates   of seafood approved for sale  in  alone  new species were added to the list including cornetfish sampa and claresse So whats the government or a consumer to do about all this Oceana would like to see an international traceability system where retailers would be required to tell consumers where and when a fish was caught and what gear was used Requirements like these would help the industry  one of the least transparent in the food system  more accountable The National Fisheries Institute argues that the problem is one of enforcement  the FDA needs to do a better job of enforcing laws that are already on the books to discourage fraud And they encourage consumers to seek out retailers  through the
