Anyone who has ever drizzled doused or  heck  drenched their food with Sriracha knows the hot sauce can make almost any dish taste better But could these spicy condiments also make us a little happier The science geeks over at the   made a little   that breaks down the beloved rooster sauce into its molecular components The video also explains why Sriracha and other spicy sauces burn so bad but then feel so good Sriracha has five main ingredients jalapeno peppers vinegar garlic powder salt and sugar There are also a few preservatives thrown in there But its the first ingredient that wields the molecular magic Jalapenos and other chili peppers are packed with two potent compounds    and dihydrocapsaicin These molecules perform a mind trick on our nervous system They make us think our tongues have touched something scalding hot like boiling water To keep the tongue from getting burned the brain triggers the sensation of pain Something like Holy cow Wash this Sriracha out of my mouth immediately But your nervous system isnt going to just let you suffer with your mouth on fire So it also launches a whole series of actions to help us deal with the pain It releases endorphins  the morphinelike compounds that give you a natural high And it makes the nerves on our tongue more tolerant to pain In other words spicy peppers may hurt at first but then they have an analgesic effect Doctors and scientists have known about this painrelief power of capsaicin for centuries And theyve been trying with modest success to develop analgesic   using these molecules A few years ago the Food and Drug Administration even approved a highconcentration   for treating neuropathic pain So how do these spicy molecules work When Sriracha hits your tongue capsaicin activates sensory neurons in a very specific way They bind and open up a receptor on the nerves surface called   This receptor also gets activated by high temperatures  anything above  degrees Fahrenheit So your brain thinks the nerve is touching something hot when the hot sauce hits the receptor A similar mechanism happens with mints and cough drops that give your tongue a cooling icy sensation Cold temperatures are sensed by a receptor closely related to TRPV called TRPM And guess what molecule also activates this receptor The menthol in peppermint and spearmint So minty gums trick your mind into thinking youre eating something cold
