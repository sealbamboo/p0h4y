This is a dream that weve had for  years or so in the stem cell field said John Gearhart director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Gearhart first proposed this approach for patientspecific stem cell generation in the s but was not involved in the recent studies  Stem cells have the potential to develop into any kind of tissue in the human body From growing organs to treating diabetes many future medical advances are hoped to arise from stem cells  Scientists  this month that they used skin cells from a man  and another man  to create stem cells from cloned embryos  We reaffirmed that it is possible to produce patientspecific stem cells using a nuclear transfer technology regardless of the patients age said colead author Young Gie Chung at the CHA Stem Cell Institute in Seoul South Korea On Monday an independent group led by scientists at the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute   using a similar approach They used skin cells from a yearold woman with Type  diabetes to generate stem cells matched to her  Both new reports follow the groundbreaking research published last year by Shoukhrat Mitalipov and colleagues at Oregon Health  Science University   In that study researchers produced cloned embryos and stem cells using skin cells from a fetus and an monthold baby  Its a remarkable process that gives us these master cells these stems cells that are essentially the seeds for all of the tissues in our bodies said George Daley director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Boston Childrens Hospital who was not involved in the recent studies Thats why its so important for medical research  The first developments in the field of stem cell research used leftover embryos created by the union of sperm and egg from in vitro fertilization  But embryonic stem cell research is controversial because to use the stem cells for developing medical treatments the embryo is destroyed Embryos have the potential to develop into a fully formed human bringing up ethical questions  Scientists later realized that its not necessary to use embryos to obtain stem cells that match patients Shinya Yamanaka won the  Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for discovering how to make induced pluripotent stem cells or IPS cells IPS cells are made by inserting genes to turn back the clock on mature cells that already have specific functions It doesnt matter what the cell was before it can now be reprogrammed as any kind of cell researchers want Why then would researchers bother to make stem cells using cloning which requires human eggs and the creation of embryos  People have made patientmatched stem cells using IPS methods said Dieter Egli senior author on the Nature paper that could have implications for diabetes treatment and researcher at the New York Stem Cell Foundation But it is not clear in the US at the very least and also elsewhere how and if these are going to be translated into people Egli points out that there have been some reports that IPS cells may have shortcomings when converted into specific cell types and that stem cells produced by cloning may be better  But which stem cell type is better and safer  the IPS cells or cells from cloned embryos That is still an open question To settle it there would need to be a comparison of the two stem cell types generated using the DNA of the same person Gearhart doesnt see the cloning method replacing the use of IPS cells which are not controversial and dont require that women donate their eggs  As we learn more about the reprogramming process that normally occurs in the egg following fertilization we can use that information to produce better IPS cells Gearhart said  The process of extracting eggs is complex and expensive having enough supply is a serious concern Daley said  The more we learn about reprogramming the more I think IPS will be the one of choice Gearhart said  An embryo the earliest stage of human development is a cluster of cells smaller than the period at the end of this sentence  To make a cloned embryo scientists use equipment analogous to like a halfmilliondollar video game Daley said Researchers perform surgery on eggs with needles that are the th of the size of a human hair They use joysticks to manipulate the tiny equipment spearing the egg removing its DNA and then transferring the nucleus of a skin cell into the egg That process which is called nuclear transfer sets in motion this remarkable process of early human development Daley said We trick this reconstructed egg into thinking its been fertilized  Chungs group  which led the Cell Stem Cell study  used this cloning method that Mitalipov had pioneered to get two stem cell lines out of  eggs It seems that the quality of oocyte egg plays a pivotal role Chung said  Egli and colleagues had their own spin on the cloning process amending it so that it happens in a more controlled way Their study in Nature used electricity in combination with chemicals and manipulating the calcium concentration to improve the procedure They generated stem cells specific to the diabetic patient who had donated skin cells the eggs came from donors  This group got four cell lines from  eggs said research assistant Lydia Mailander The average egg donation is  to  oocytes Researchers estimate it would take two such donations to get one stem cell line In mice Egli and colleagues showed in a separate study that the cloned stem cells from the diabetic patient mature into glucoseresponsive beta cells which secrete insulin into the bloodstream of the animals Its not clear that there are enough eggs in supply to support a largescale production of stem cells this way experts said  For the nearterm research purposes there seem to be enough eggs available for stem cell cloning About  egg donor cycles occur annually in the United States Egli said  But egg donation for research is generally low Gearhart said   about  million Americans have Type  diabetes the target population for a potential stem cell therapy  The cloning method takes a few weeks and is not significantly faster than generating IPS cells Egli said  Including compensation to the woman an egg donation cycle costs about  Egli said It may not at all be more expensive than IPS if the cells that we make are actually better he said Thats why its important to do these comparisons Such a comparison would be interesting said Daley but the advantages would have to be considerable to beat out IPS which is much more efficient and less ethically contentious that Yamanaka the Nobel winner taught us  Still from a research perspective the cloning method could help scientists interested in understanding how an egg reprograms the cell Daley said It could help answer How does an egg reset the whole identity of an adult cell back to an embryonic state  Stem cell cloning research might in this way teach scientists how to make stem cells more efficiently he said and optimize them for medical applications  Mitalipov told CNN in  that the embryos created in his study from skin cells and eggs would not grow babies That would have required additional technology and it wasnt part of the study But the same basic nuclear transfer principle used in Mitalipovs Chungs and Eglis studies was used create Dolly the sheep the first mammal clone  In Dollys case an embryo created by nuclear transfer was transplanted to a ewe which gave birth to a sheep  In the case of human embryos generated in these stem cell experiments it would be dangerous and unethical to attempt to transfer them into a uterus Daley said
