Doctors have been putting in a lot of ear tubes Its the most common outpatient surgery in children Despite how common the tubes are its been hard for parents to know if and when a child should get them Pediatricians are confused about it too says   chairman of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn NY And ENT doctors To reduce the confusion the American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery has issued the first   on ear tubes officially known as   The tiny tubes are placed in the eardrum to drain fluid from the middle ear The idea is to reduce the risk of repeat ear infections and hearing loss About  percent of children have tubes by age  Its a  billionayear business Rosenfeld says and not all of those kids benefit Children often get fluid in their ears after ear infections but the fluid usually goes away on its own even if its been there for several months The new guidelines say that tubes should not be considered in children who have had fluid in the ears for less than three months Children with repeated ear infections also dont always need tubes the guidelines say Thats different than whats being done in a lot of practices Rosenfeld who chaired the guideline committee tells Shots In many cases the infections clear up on their own Candidates for tubes include children with frequent ear infections and fluid that never really clears up as well as kids with fluid and other symptoms such as hearing loss balance problems and poor school performance Children with symptoms of autism may also need tubes the guidelines say because the shortterm hearing issues that comes with fluid in the ear can compound their issues The big news for children who already have tubes is that they almost certainly dont need ear plugs or neoprene headbands to swim This apparatus is often prescribed to keep water out of the tubes You dont need to worry Rosenfeld says The tubes are so small that a child would have to swim more than  feet deep to push water through the hole into the ear he says They can swim bathe jump in the pool go to the beach You dont need to keep water out of the ears So then why are ear doctors recommending this stuff The big clinical trial showing that ear plugs dont reduce ear infections was done in  The evidence on this is not new Rosenfeld agrees It just hasnt been disseminated and implemented in practice If the message catches hold this time it may get even more crowded at the pool
