This year as I always do on New Years Day I will host an open house and serve my beloved blackeyed peas salad But I had also found halfbags of various grains and beans in my pantry and wanted to use them up so I decided to work them into a few other dishes for my buffet mostly salads that will hold for a few hours Most of these staples are foods that are considered symbolic of good luck and expanding fortunes in the New Year by different cultures For example Italians eat lentils at the New Year because they resemble coins and expand when cooked I will double my money by combining lentils with coinlike carrot slices in a delicious Middle Eastern salad I use lots of greens and herbs in my salads as well green leaves also symbolize money and growth One condiment I make with lots of cilantro and parsley is a spicy Yemeni herb paste called zhoug I have no idea if the ingredients are symbolic at New Years in the Yemen but fresh herbs fall into my greens category The herb paste is delicious with just about anything you choose to serve it with I reconstituted the halfbag of Israeli couscous I found in my pantry dressed the couscous with the zhoug and will use it as a filling for a frittata All of this weeks Recipes for Health are designed to stand up when left out on a buffet for a few hours Even if they dont make you rich they will contribute to your wellbeing which is what I wish you for the New Year  A colorful version of a good luck blackeyed peas salad  The contrasts of textures and the crisp clean flavors of the fennel and celery combine in an irresistible salad  A hearty salad with great texture and a citrus finish  A combination of Mediterranean lentil salads that works well for buffets  A frittata is the perfect home for some leftover couscous
