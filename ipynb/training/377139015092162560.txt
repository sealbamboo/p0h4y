For many science fans watching Stephen Hawking give a speech  perched on a stage nearly motionless in his wheelchair holding forth in the computerized voice that has become his trademark  is a rare treat  At Caltech where the physicist comes for regular extended visits people line up for hours for a chance to get a ticket Those who cant get admission to the lecture hall watch on screens set up outdoors craning their necks for a glimpse of their hero Now readers everywhere can share a piece of that experience as Hawkings new memoir  which expands on his popular talks  goes on sale Tuesday My Brief History a play on the title of his bestseller A Brief History of Time is a breezy page volume heavy on anecdotes and photos peppered with  doses of hard science and good humor Its a quick read with  chapters organized more or less chronologically Hawking writes about his childhood his studies at Oxford and Cambridge and his sometimesunorthodox personal life He describes ups and downs with his two former wives Jane and Elaine in a chapter called Marriage which emphasizes the challenges Hawkings deteriorating health posed for the women he married Jane became more depressed he writes in one memorable passage Hawkings illness  he has a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a degenerative nerve disease that has left him wheelchairbound for decades   is everpresent in the book though never the dominating focus  By describing the progression of his disease throughout the narrative he gives a sense of how slowly his symptoms came on As a student at Oxford Hawking writes he became increasingly clumsy In  soon after moving to Cambridge he got his diagnosis  By  shortly after his wedding he writes that he began finding it harder to walk  In  during a stint at Caltech he began using an electric wheelchair By the mids he had turned to computer programs to help him write and speak Today Hawking wiggles his cheek to move a cursor across a screen and pick out words He can write about three per minute according to his publisher Bantam Books Hawking took two years to expand the text of his lectures to complete My Brief History The science in Hawkings book is a slower read than the autobiographical material and includes chapters on black holes and the Big Bang as well an extended section on time travel   to find out if he thinks such a thing is possible  Hawking also describes how he came to write   why hes flattered it has been compared to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and which aspects of its science he now wishes he had explained more effectively In the books final chapter No Boundaries Hawking looks back on his life loves work and travels and writes he is quietly satisfied with his life  Hes booked to travel into space on Virgin Galactic  On the last page of the book a photograph shows the scientist without his wheelchair   floating unfettered during a zerogravity flight
