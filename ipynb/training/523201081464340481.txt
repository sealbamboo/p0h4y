A   in Ohio closes its doors because a nurse who later came down with Ebola shopped there A   who handled samples from the patient who died in Dallas has confined himself to his room on a Caribbean cruise ship   and in Texas with only tenuous links to people infected with Ebola are closed and cleaned with bleach None of its medically necessary Theres no reason to think that even a nurse with a very slightly elevated temperature    had a temperature of  when she flew home to Dallas from Cleveland  could infect anyone else Why the fear Experts blame the news media mostly Politicians dont help either they say Members of Congress   and Prevention of failing the keep Ebola out of the United States even after the CDC said that would be impossible to do and predicted just what has happened  that an Ebola patient would travel here and might in fact infect others What CDC has said is that the virus will not spread far in the United States and that it will not spread casually  and it hasnt The two nurses infected Vinson and   were in close physical contact with Thomas Eric Duncan after he was extremely ill Thats just when doctors have repeatedly said people   And no one in casual contact with Duncan has become infected  including his fiance   who stayed in her apartment with a sick Duncan for days and who was forcibly kept there with soiled laundry for days by authorities afterwards Trohs almost through with the day incubation period for Ebola with no sign of infection And she could not conceivably have been infectious to anyone else before becoming sick herself If these people arent posing a threat to anyone why are they being isolated CDC and state health department measures to keep an eye on people who were in direct contact with patients are appropriate medical experts say Their actions actually help manage fear says risk perception expert David Ropeik They are being respectful of peoples fear Ropeik said In a crisis people want to know you care Some of the other actions  like Clevelandarea schools closing after a middle school worker traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines Tuesday on a different flight but perhaps the same aircraft as Vinson may be excessive but again are in response to fear They are taking drastic steps for a risk that is rather remote said George Kapalka professor of psychological counseling at Monmouth University in New Jersey Theres no doubt   and no doubt that many dont believe repeated messages about how Ebola can and cannot spread One look at say NBC Newss Health   gives a clear demonstration of that Total BS All the people who were on those planes she was on and all the people in the cafeteria anyone she was near is at risk remarks Su ONeill on a story mentioning Vinsons flight Theyre afraid not because of the official actions but because media coverage of the measures is overdoing it Ropeik says Our risk perception is how we feel about the few pieces of information we have because none of us are experts Ropeik says So what they have largely are the types of alarmist coverage that gets to the top of the newscasts The oh my god another patient or mistakes have been made sort of coverage This sends a clear danger signal Ropeik says The media is undoubtedly complicit in stoking this fear not by covering the story  thats fine They are complicit by burying all the qualifiers about how minimal the risk is Its medias job to find mistakes and missteps But the tone of many stories and programs has gone too far in Ropeiks opinion Even if the hospital in Dallas mistakenly turned Duncan away at first it didnt lead to an outbreak and officials have been correct so far in saying Ebola will not spread widely in the United States  unlike in West Africa where its infected more than  people and killed half of them Politicians weighing in and demanding travel bans that all health experts agree are useless and unions claiming that health workers dont get adequate training are not helping matters Ropeik says None of those mistakes tell us the system is not competent to stop this from becoming a public threat Ropeik said When you poison trust in the people who are supposed to keep us safe our fear goes up Theres another factor Media and many people in general want to be the first to raise the warning about a new danger The social phenomenon is if you know first you are helping protect the tribe Ropeik said Its a form of empowerment and the sense of control is reassuring But keeping an entire nation in a state of unnecessary frenzy can itself damage health I am kind of concerned that the anxiety over this that many people may experience may have more negative effects on them than any risk of catching Ebola Kapalka said Theres plenty of evidence of the negative effect of living in fear Ropeik agrees The people who are fomenting excessive fears both the critics of the government and the media are threatening public health far more than Ebola he said
