There are many stereotypes myths and incorrect information about sex for boomers and beyond Contrary to popular opinion older couples are doing the deed a lot  and STDs are more of an issue than you might think        Reality A study by the National Council on Aging finds that  percent of men and  percent of women have better sex lives now that theyre over  than when they were in their s But before boomers get too excited about these stats they have to realize that the study is only looking at a select group of people who are still having sex said Debby Herbenick research scientist at Indiana University and coauthor of Great in Bed But there is good news to the study As we age we are more prone to being satisfied and content with a lot of things Herbenick said Our lives arent black and white and filled with drama anymore        Reality The average couple in the United States reported that they had sex  times annually according to a study by the National Opinion Research Center But that number falls to  times for couples in their s Its not as bleak as it may appear however I would suspect that in the younger years the focus in a relationship is on sex said Howard Markman professor of psychology at University of Denver and coauthor of Fighting for Your Marriage As couples get older the focus is more on sensuality So while its true that older couples may not be having sex as often as younger couples they may have more fulfilling romantic relationships than their younger counterparts Markman said        Reality A  study examining the sex lives of people age  to  found that sex frequency peaks around  to  years old said Herbenick author of the study But one of the biggest predictors of sexual satisfaction for older men wasnt how often they were having sex  but how often they were touching and cuddling        Reality Onethird of younger women need to use lubricant during sex because of dryness but not many of them report it Herbenick said Only half of women in their s use lubricant and  percent of women in their s use lubricant Its not a big deal because the issues tend to be mild she said        Reality The over set is among the fastest growing populations when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases Widows and divorcees are reentering the dating game with new partners and they arent quick to use condoms because they are beyond their childbearing years They also arent as suspicious of their significant others having multiple partners Markman said And sex among the elderly is far more prevalent than suspected he said Regardless of your age condoms and STD testing are necessary
