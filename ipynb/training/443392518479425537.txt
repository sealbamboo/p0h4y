For a  monthly membership the website   promises to train your brain with games designed to stave off mental decline Users view a quick succession of bird images and numbers to test   for instance or match increasingly complex tile patterns to challenge memory 
 While Lumosity is perhaps the best known of the braingame websites with  million subscribers in  countries the cognitive training business is booming   of Mountain View Calif promises brain fitness for life   owned by the British education company Pearson says its training program will give students improved attention and capacity for learning The Israeli firm   is developing a brain stimulation and cognitive training program that the company calls a new hope for   And last month in a move that could significantly improve the financial prospects for braingame developers the   began seeking comments on a proposal that would in some cases  Much of the focus of the brain fitness business has been on helping children with attentiondeficit problems and on improving cognitive function and academic performance in healthy children and adults An effective way to stave off   or prevent Alzheimers  particularly if it were a simple website or video game  is the holy grail of neuroscience said   director of the neurocognitive disorders program at   The problem Dr Doraiswamy added is that the science of cognitive training has not kept up with the hype Almost all the marketing claims made by all the companies go beyond the data he said We need large national studies before you can conclude that its ready for prime time For centuries scientists believed that most brain development occurred in the first few years of life  that by adulthood the brain was largely immutable But over the past two decades studies on animals and humans have found that the brain continues to form new neural connections throughout life But questions remain whether an intervention that challenges the brain  a puzzle studying a new language or improving skill on a video game  can really raise intelligence or stave off normal memory loss A series of studies in recent years has suggested that certain types of game training can improve a persons cognitive performance In February  however an analysis of  of the best studies on brain training led by the University of Oslo researcher   concluded that while players do get better the increase in skill   In other words playing Sudoku or an online matching game makes you better at the game but it doesnt make you better at math or help you remember names or where you left your car keys But other studies have been more encouraging Last September the journal Nature published a study by researchers at the University of California San Francisco that showed   did improve   The findings are significant because the research found that improvements in performance werent limited to the game but also appeared to be linked to a strengthening of older brains over all helping them to perform better at other memory and attention tasks In addition brain monitoring during the study showed that in older participants game training led to bursts in brain waves associated with attention the patterns were similar to those seen in much younger brains In January the largest randomized controlled trial of cognitive training in healthy older adults found that gains in reasoning and speed through brain training lasted as long as  years Financed by the National Institutes of Health the Active study Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly recruited  volunteers with an average age of  The participants were divided into three training groups for memory reasoning and speed of processing as well as one control group The groups took part in  sessions of  to  minutes over five to six weeks and researchers measured the effect of training five times over the next  years Five years after training all three groups still  in the skills in which they had trained Notably the gains did not carry over into other areas After  years only the reasoning and speedofprocessing groups continued to show improvement The researchers also found that people in the reasoning and speedofmentalprocessing groups had   The claims about commercial brain games are a mixed bag said Sherry L Willis a University of Washington research professor involved in the Active study There is a tendency for companies to say a certain measure represents X ability but there may be insufficient if any research to support the assertion added Dr Willis who said a version of the training used in the Active study was available through   and   Earlier this year the National Institutes of Health invited applications to more rigorously test brain fitness training to stave off cognitive decline Researchers say they hope the effort will help establish a consistent standard for determining whether a braintraining intervention works But while the science remains unclear entrepreneurs have seized on what is likely to be a sizable marketing opportunity In May hundreds of researchers and businesses will gather in San Francisco for the   to explore the latest research and the newest technology While there is no real risk to participating in the many unproven braintraining games available online and through smartphones experts say consumers should know that the scientific jury is still out on whether they are really boosting brain health or just paying hundreds of dollars to get better at a game Im not convinced there is a huge difference between buying a  subscription to a gaming company versus you yourself doing challenging things on your own like attending a lecture or learning an instrument Dr Doraiswamy said Each person has to personalize for themselves what they find fun and challenging and what they can stick with
