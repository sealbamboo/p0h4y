The taste itself isnt so bad on the surface but putting chunky coconut oil in your mouth before being fully awake can trigger a gag reflex Luckily the time goes by quickly and afterward I admit my teeth felt polished throughout the day as if Id just come from the dentist  But whats the scope and scoop on this mouth rinse practice Does it work Its not given proper credit said Guha who was trained in Ayurveda a traditional form of medicine that relies on natural healing in India She explains that using liquids in the mouth for health purposes is mentioned in two ancient Indian Ayurvedic texts one written in  BC and the other in  BC and the practice is part of one of the oldest health systems in the world  Oil pulling for oral hygiene is common But before you go racing out to the store for oil the   that because of a lack of evidence they do not recommend oil pulling as a replacement for standard oral health care such as flossing and teeth brushing  that about  systemic diseases including headaches and diabetes can be cured Yet there is a lack of knowledge on the science and side effects behind the practice according to Guha Guha says there are two oil pulling techniques kavala and gandusa  With kavala you fill your mouth with liquid and hold it there for a couple of minutes before swirling it around the mouth and spitting it out The process shouldnt exceed more than three or four minutes its repeated at least two or three times  Gandusa is the technique of holding the liquid still in the mouth for three to five minutes The liquid is then spit out and the process is repeated In Ayurveda many different liquids can be used depending on the condition being treated and the physiology of the person Milk honey and hot water containing herbs are just some of the other mediums explains Guha For daily oral hygiene she recommends using coconut or sesame oil which she says have mild abrasive powers and more healing benefits than other oils and are less harmful  Results can be expected in a few months she says with benefits such as reduced plaque cavity prevention and stronger gums for individuals who already have a healthy mouth For the person with plaque buildup she recommends a teeth cleaning first for faster results  involving sesame oil and  adolescent boys with plaqueinduced gingivitis found that oil pulling reduced plaque and the bacterium Streptococcus mutans   as being a major cause of tooth decay and overgrowth of bacteria in mouth can also lead to    also using sesame oil found similar results summarizing that oil pulling had a significant effect on plaque and gingivitis For coconut oil users   found in the oil can be a benefit It is known for its antimicrobial properties such as the ability to fight off viruses bacteria and yeasts Mark Wolff professor and chair at the New York University College of Dentistry expresses skepticism about oil pullings effects on oral health  I am not sure there is any harm but I have never seen it have any positive effect on my patients who have been using oil pulling or in clinical research that has been published  There is also little research available on the effectiveness of these treatments to cure other diseases Guha warns that there can be negative side effects if improper technique is used including dry mouth excessive thirst muscular stiffness exhaustion and loss of sensation or taste in the mouth  Individuals who are interested in trying kavala or gandusa to treat health conditions need to review all credentials of Ayruvedic practitioners before starting any treatment Guha says that there are very few trained professionals in the United States as none of the Ayurveda schools here are accredited only schools in India provide the proper certifications Bottom line If youre just looking for a natural way to boost your oral health you can oil away without supervision and get about the same benefits as commercial mouthwash Just dont forget to floss
