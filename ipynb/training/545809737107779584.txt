More than 257,000 U.S. doctors will see their Medicare payments cut by 1% next year because they didnâ€™t meet federal goals for using electronic medical records, said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.. Some 28,000 providers will be docked another 1% of Medicare pay for not prescribing medications electronically. About 200 hospitals were informed in October that they also will lose 1% of their Medicare payments in 2015 for missing a deadline for EMR use.
