Incidents such as this prompted McCarty  of Dallas to finally take action against his weight Since September  he has dropped  pounds Its not easy You didnt get big overnight so its going to take a little time McCarty tells others who want to follow his lead Its going to take some work You just got to decide for yourself thats what you want At foot McCarty who works in maintenance at an office building describes himself as a short round person But it wasnt always that way He was initially a skinny child but he gained a lot of weight between the second and third grades That summer he stayed home and watched TV and ate  Other children made fun of him calling him sheep dog and fat boy  McCarty knew the health risks of being overweight He has always been diligent about annual physicals because his fathers siblings died of cardiovascular problems and his father has had a heart attack Yet McCarty remained healthy in adulthood by other measures His blood pressure and cholesterol were fine so he never consistently weighed himself He thinks he reached  pounds in his s I thought I didnt need to lose weight because Im healthy he said  At one annual physical McCartys doctor told him he still needed to lose weight and that he was very lucky  to have normal vital signs but they wouldnt necessarily stay that way  The doctor said McCarty remembers Youre going to be in a world of hurt But the message didnt make a dent in McCartys unhealthy habits until last August when he decided to race his youngest daughter for one mile He thought he would finish in about  minutes He estimates he weighed between  and  pounds at that point  It was horrible he said It took me  minutes to do a mile And because of poor route planning McCarty couldnt make it back he had to call his wife to pick him up  The next day he told his wife No more sodas He would start walking It was time for a change  A big help to McCartys weight loss effort was the arrival of a new gym Downsize Fitness behind his workplace The facility is specifically geared toward overweight and obese people and their equipment and workouts are tailored for larger bodies  McCarty didnt realize before going to this gym that he could modify challenging exercises such as pushups and jumping jacks to accommodate his fitness level  He also liked that everyone there had the same goal weight loss There were no perfectly toned bodybuilders in sight  The gym made exercise personal Hed get calls from employees asking what time hed be showing up I wasnt just a number there he said They knew what level I was at They pushed me to my limits Now McCarty works out five times a week He runs four times every week a total of at least  miles and does weights twice a week Hes also a personal trainer at Downsize Fitness helping others reach their goals To help his physical transformation McCarty made drastic changes to his eating habits  Before my range of food was Hamburger pizza something fried McCarty said Now processed foods are strictly forbidden He eats a lot of fruits and vegetables grilled chicken and grilled fish  When he drinks sweet tea he dilutes his serving to  water Of course he still splurges on one guilty pleasure now and then The Oreo Cookies Blizzard at Dairy Queen  The journey hasnt always been easy During his running and training earlier this year he tore a meniscus in his left knee  I was scared to death  if I couldnt work out the old me would pop back out he said  His surgery was on a Thursday By Monday he was back at the gym working on his upper body chest and shoulders  Two weeks later he was walking on the treadmills At three weeks he was able to jog and by the fourth week he could run again Beyond the numbers on the scale McCarty has seen many benefits to his weight loss Remember how he agonized over a running a mile in  minutes in August  In June he ran a K race  miles in under  minutes After he crossed the finish line and saw his time I just started crying he remembers I just kept walking and thinking about where I came from  At his job hes noticed a change as well Hes always had to be on his feet all day but because of his weight he used to avoid tasks involving standing on ladders and leaning or reaching  he was scared he would fall  Now Im like a little ninja up there he said I can reach over and I dont care about falling no more  Weight loss contests at Downsize Fitness proved lucrative for McCarty He originally had no intention of winning the first round from September to December but when he learned he was close he stepped up his workout to four hours a day five times a week That earned him  The January to June phase which came with a  prize was an incentive to keep going with his weightloss efforts After winning he paid off his truck and bought his wife a nice camera the rest is in savings  He has since kept off the weight but the gym wont be doing more of these contests a spokeswoman said  McCarty has several more goals to keep himself motivated  Right now hes training for a halfmarathon that takes place September  and in October hell do a sprint triathlon His goal for next year is a half Ironman  He also wants to help the rest of his family get fit McCarty has issued a challenge Theyre all going to run a K together in December  I dont want to be a hypocrite to my kids and saying Youve got to lose weight now  he said But I am going to challenge them to do this one thing for me I think theyre going to like the results  Next month the family is going back to the same amusement park  Silver Dollar City in Missouri  where McCarty had to give up his seat on a roller coaster last summer  Trying to buckle the seat belt then led to unexpected twists and turns in his life Now hes ready to experience the full ride
