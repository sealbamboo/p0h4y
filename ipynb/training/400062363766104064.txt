Attention pregnant women If you want to help your child get into Harvard lace up those sneakers and exercise Hardly a week goes by without science delivering new evidence that exercise boosts the brain Studies have linked exercise to brain health in     and   A trio of researchers from the University of Montreal figured the same might hold true for babies in utero as well Dave Ellemberg and Daniel Curnier two professors from the universitys Department of Kinesiology and graduate student Elise LabonteLeMoyne recruited women who were in their first trimester of pregnancy and randomly assigned them to an active or sedentary group Women in the active group were advised to get at least  minutes of moderate exercise using at least  of their maximal aerobic capacity at least three times a week during their second and third trimesters while women in the sedentary group pretty much took it easy After the babies were born researchers tested their brains to see if they could spot any differences between infants whose mothers exercised and infants whose mothers were couch potatoes The researchers fitted the  to dayold babies with specialized caps made up of  soft electrodes that detect electrical activity in the brain You can check them out in the photo gallery above Then they waited for the babies to fall asleep Once they were snoozing the scientists played a series of sounds  some new some familiar  and measured the response of the infants brains Sure enough the babies whose mothers had exercised had more mature brains than the babies whose mothers were sedentary according to study results presented Monday at the   meeting in San Diego Though the women in the active group were asked to exercise for a minimum of  minutes per week they wound up doing so for  minutes per week on average For the sake of comparison the women in the sedentary group averaged only  minutes of moderate exercise per week according to the   We are optimistic that this will encourage women to change their health habits given that the simple act of exercising during pregnancy could make a difference for their childs future Ellemberg said in a statement Ellemberg and his colleagues will continue to follow the babies until they are at least  year old to see if the benefits of prenatal exercise are longlasting In addition to auditory memory they are also evaluating their cognitive motor and language development    and like   on Facebook
