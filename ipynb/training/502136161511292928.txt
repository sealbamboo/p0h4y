People were screaming and throwing rocks The police were firing shots and hitting protesters with their batons A riot had started in the slum neighborhood of West Point in the Liberian capital of Monrovia A riot is tough enough without knowing that youre in an Ebolainfected neighborhood says NPR photographer David Gilkey who was in West Point when it began West Point is where angry residents rushed into an Ebola holding center on Saturday night the  patients were suspected of having the virus The assailants resented that they werent getting information about the facility and that people from outside their neighborhood were being brought in They screamed at the patients telling them to leave Fearful that these individuals might indeed have Ebola and might have infected others the government quarantined the densely populated West Point neighborhood this morning The roughly  residents awoke to find themselves blocked in by checkpoints and a buffer zone The quarantine is intended to stay in place for  days  the maximum time it takes for new infections to become apparent Then police escorted in a government minister whose children live in West Point she wanted to bring them out That was the trigger for todays riot reports NPR producer Nicole Beemsterboer Photographers Gilkey and Tommy Trenchard also working for NPR captured the chaos with their cameras Gilkey also shared his impressions of the experience A little amped up Its just crazy You think about covering a riot or a very tense situation Imagine whats been going on in Missouri Now add Ebola They were confused why they were being kept inside wanted to know why they couldnt leave The quarantine happened overnight so they awoke to being locked into their neighborhood You always have to be careful when youre in a tense situation like that Its not like you just run around taking pictures at will You have to be careful to not inflame the situation which you could easily do by sticking a camera in someones face You sort of take a step back Laughing I dont know Ive been in riots all over the world You have to really really pay attention to whats going on and know which direction people are going which way you can get out But its just a really different situation because in this particular case people are running and screaming and bumping into you and any one of them could have Ebola And the last thing you want to have happen is that you trip and fall and cut yourself Or you get hit in the head with a rock and now you have an open wound The strangest thing to me about this whole thing is that youre dealing with something invisible It just preys on your mind all the time Exactly The only thing I can compare it to is working in Afghanistan with land mines You know when you go out on a patrol in Afghanistan theres the risk of stepping on a land mine And yet you go because youre there to cover the story And you hope youre not the one that steps on a mine or youre not near a mine when somebody else steps on it But you dont know where the mines are And you cant change that So you somehow put your fear on the side and go forward
