British drug maker AstraZeneca PLC recently made an abortive acquisition approach to Forest Laboratories Inc. before the specialty-drug company agreed last week to be bought by Actavis PLC for $25 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.. Late last year, AstraZeneca approached Forest about a deal for around $70 a share, according to some of the people. The cash-and-stock deal that Actavis sealed valued Forest at $89.48 a share.
