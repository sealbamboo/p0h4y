Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has backed calls to dissolve the trust that runs the scandalhit Stafford Hospital Mr Hunt said Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust would be scrapped and while its two hospitals would remain open many services would move to other hospitals The trust has been in administration since April when services were deemed unsustainable by watchdog Monitor However campaigners who oppose the move said they may challenge the decision in the courts Under the plans Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals would be operated by other local providers Mr Hunt said the changes would secure the safe and highquality services that the people of Stafford deserve having endured years of uncertainty and failures in care He added I want Stafford to be a proper district hospital that continues to meet the needs of patients nearby including for emergency care and births He said he wanted to dissolve the trust as soon as possible to stabilise local health services Stafford could still retain consultantled maternity services after Mr Hunt agreed to NHS England carrying out a review into the issue The original plan from administrators had been for maternity services to close but this was later amended to allow for the creation of a midwifeled unit Mr Hunt has now agreed to review that decision to see whether consultantled services  needed for more difficult births  should be retained The trust was criticised in February  in   for causing the suffering of hundreds of people under its care between  and  The inquiry criticised the costcutting and targetchasing culture that had developed at the trust Receptionists were left to decide which patients to treat inexperienced doctors were put in charge of critically ill patients and nurses were not trained how to use vital equipment Cases have also been documented of patients left crying out for help because they did not get pain relief and food and drinks being left out of reach Data shows there were between  and  more deaths than would have been expected between  and  although it is impossible to say all of these patients would have survived if they had received better treatment  made  recommendations aimed at tackling the wider cultural problems in the NHS Sue Hawkins from the Save Stafford Hospital group said We were expecting the trust to dissolve We understood from the outset that would be the case but we are a semirural area and people are going to have to travel long distances to receive care Its been a very lengthy process I wouldnt wish this on any other hospital Cheryl Porter another campaigner said the decision to move services was unacceptable for a community of this size She argued hospitals in StokeonTrent Wolverhampton and Walsall were not ready to take the extra patients Gail Gregory from Stafford whose husband is being treated at the hospital said she had expected the decision because the trust had a toxic name She said The hospital has been made a guinea pig for new government policies She blamed the poor care on the rush to Trust status She added Fifty thousand local people know the value of their hospital and this fight is not over Stafford Borough councillor Ann Edgeller said she was pleased the hospital would remain in Stafford but there was still a lot to do to keep essential services In some ways its good that we have still got a hospital two years ago we thought we might lose it she said The most disappointing thing is not knowing what will happen to paediatric and maternity services Its something weve got to fight for   there are a lot of new houses being built not half a mile away from Stafford Hospital and it worries me that UNHS might not be able to cope Staffords Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy said local accountability on the trust board was crucial We must now see a merger with the University Hospital of North Staffordshire and Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust and not a takeover he added Maggie Oldham chief executive of the trust said she wanted to pay tribute to staff at the hospitals Mid Staffs has come a long way over the past few years and I am very proud of all of our staff and what they have achieved she said I would also like to remind patients that we are still working as usual and that they should please keep their appointments and keep using the services provided at Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals Philip Atkins leader of Staffordshire County Council said While this will undoubtedly be a bitter blow for campaigners it is also an opportunity to show how the county can now lead the way in demonstrating how integrated hospital and community care can be both delivered safely and meet the highest standards Christina McAnea head of health for Unison said the decision was bitterly disappointing for the local community and staff The facts show patient care has improved massively she said If key services are to be transferred to neighbouring trusts it is vital that they are given the financial resources needed to take on the extra responsibility
