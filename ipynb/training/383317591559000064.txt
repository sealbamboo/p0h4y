For the groups who had spent years insisting that   giving them the same wage and hour protections as other workers last weeks action by the Labor Department has brought jubilation For nearly  years these aides  mostly women many minorities and immigrants  have been exempted like teenaged baby sitters They werent entitled to the federal minimum wage or no matter how many hours they worked to overtime pay When Evelyn Coke an veteran aide from Queens got fed up and brought a lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court in  the justices   saying this was a matter for the Labor Department In ill health herself she died two years later at  The Obama administration   but the groups lobbying for change  labor unions AARP advocates for seniors and people with disabilities the Direct Care Alliance and other workers groups  still had to wait nearly two years for action Meanwhile many aides continued to rely on food stamps and Medicaid Now that the Labor Department has   supporters are using words like historic and victory In a celebratory conference call with reporters last week a Virginia aide named Lauralyn Clark who earns  an hour said We work hard to give our clients a good quality of life This way we will be able to have one too It was a Norma Rae moment Yet as Ive been talking to people since Im learning that the immediate effect of the ruling may not be particularly dramatic First the new rules dont take effect until Jan   an unusually long delay There was enough anxiety expressed by opponents that they decided to give people plenty of time to figure it all out said Catherine Ruckelshaus legal codirector of the National Employment Law Project a key force in the campaign At that point the rules extend the minimum wage to home care workers But they are already covered in  states and the District of Columbia and several of those including California Washington and Massachusetts have minimum wages higher than the federal rate of  an hour If campaigns to raise the federal wage gain traction home care aides will of course benefit but that seems like a long shot at the moment People who hire aides privately through the socalled gray market are now also obliged to pay minimum wage and overtime though theres no real enforcement mechanism to ensure that they do The more significant change Ms Ruckelshaus agreed will come with overtime In  an aide who works more than  hours for a single employer  either an agency or a private individual  must be paid time and a half thereafter Only  states currently require overtime But its a change that may not affect large numbers of aides because theyre primarily parttime workers who often wish they had more hours on the job than they do The industry particularly opposed this provision and predicted dire consequences Home care companies will have little choice but to employ workers parttime rather than fulltime as Medicaid payment rates and consumers with limited incomes cannot afford higher costs the chair of the   said after the Labor Department decision But in states that already have overtime regulations Ms Ruckelshaus pointed out theyre all managing to do it and its worked out Agencies may hire another worker for a client who needs a great deal of care but if only a few more than  hours are involved its cheaper at these low wages to pay time and a half Moreover the overtime rules dont cover livein helpers though they do require employers to keep better records of the hours worked and to pay at least minimum wage  Does this mean that after all this time the new regulations wont bring much change for most home care aides Not exactly One boost is that these workers will now get paid for their travel time not just the hours they spend providing care Deducting the time it takes to go from one clients home to another often brought a workers pay below minimum wage even in states that supposedly required it Theres always this chiseling and backsliding that goes on said Ms Ruckelshaus Thats no longer permissible Which leads to the really significant improvement for this workforce federal oversight Almost by definition home care workers are a scattered group harder to organize ask the unions that are trying and to communicate with than employees in a central workplace They havent had much recourse when an employer either an agency or a private person keeps them on the job  hours a week without overtime pay or fails to pay for travel time reducing their wages So aides have tended to react to poor working conditions high injury rates and low pay by leaving their jobs rather than lobbying to improve them Turnover rates are dismayingly high a problem not only for workers but for those they assist Now the Fair Labor Standards Act covers home care aides just like their counterparts in nursing homes or hospitals Federal overseers are adding themselves as enforcers and theyre an important one Ms Ruckelshaus said As there are more knowyourrights educational materials workers will feel empowered to ask when theres something wrong with their pay stub
