If you get health insurance at work chances are you have some sort of wellness plan too But so far theres no real evidence as to whether these plans actually improve the health of employees One thing we do know is that wellness is particularly popular with employers right now as they seek ways to slow the rise of health spending These initiatives can range from urging workers to use the stairs to requiring comprehensive health screenings The   by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that  percent of large employers and  percent of smaller employers offer at least one wellness program Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation What makes wellness so popular with companies It really is part of their strategy to help employees be healthy productive and engaged says Maria Ghazal vice president and counsel at the Business Roundtable whose members are CEOs of large firms And its really part of their strategy to be successful companies And theres another reason wellness has gotten so pervasive said health consultant Al Lewis Workplace wellness is a big industry unto itself Its somewhere between  billion and  billion which creates an awful lot of people saying Do more of this stuff  he says Lewis has become something of a crusader against the spread of wellness around the nation Hes coauthor of   detailing its failings Among the many problems with wellness plans he says is that a lot of them arent so innocent We call them pry poke prod and punish programs he says That refers to programs that ask intrusive questions like how much alcohol a person consumes and whether a woman is planning to become pregnant They might also require significant medical interventions or tests such as comprehensive blood assays The plans urge employees to participate and punish them if they dont Under   wellness programs must   But more than a third of large companies now use financial incentives which include both rewards and penalties for those who dont participate according to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey For example at   last year officials were forced to backtrack on a plan that would have required professors and other nonunion workers  and their spouses  to undergo comprehensive health screenings every year including measurements of cholesterol blood sugar and body mass Those who declined would be charged an extra  a month for insurance Employees rebelled and the university   the fines Ironically says Lewis for all the money some wellness plans spend to screen thousands of people most companies dont actually have that much health spending that could be saved by wellness In a company with  workers he says they might have had  heart attacks of which one may have been theoretically preventable with a wellness program Thats a big reason why most independent studies have   When there have been savings health economists Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt   for The Upshot part of   they tend not to have come from improving workers health Wellness programs can achieve costsavings  for employers  by shifting higher costs of care to workers they wrote In other words if people dont participate or dont meet the wellness goals they pay more for health coverage Some programs can even do harm says Lewis For example false positive results from screening lowrisk people end up causing workers anxiety and their health plans still more money Lewis is quick to add that screening tests recommended by the   are appropriate but their guidelines are routinely ignored by corporate wellness programs But not everyone outside the wellness industry is quite so pessimistic Harvard health economist Kate Baicker is the lead author of a   that found some potential savings It could be that when all the full set of evidence comes in it will have huge returns on investment and the billions were spending on it are completely warranted Baicker says But for now there are very few studies that have reliable data on both the costs and the benefits Meanwhile the federal government is divided on how to regulate this area The Affordable Care Act   It lets employers link up to  percent of premiums to participation in wellness activities  and up to  percent if those activities involve quitting tobacco But the independent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is   including   with its more than  workers It says their programs discriminate against those with disabilities The idea of having to follow more than one set of rules is frustrating employers We want to be certain that following the Affordable Care Act is what were supposed to be doing and there shouldnt be additional requirements beyond the ACA said Ghazal of the Business Roundtable The CEOs are so upset about the wellness lawsuits theyre   entirely unless things are clarified
