William Pooley the British nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering in West Africa has returned to Sierra Leone to resume his work He said there was a real emergency in the country and he was delighted to be back on the front line  Mr Pooley will start work at a hospital in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown on Monday  Having recovered from Ebola his immune system should be able to fight it but the extent of any immunity is unclear  Doctors are not certain how long his immunity will last or whether he is completely resistant But Mr Pooley said Its massively safer for me to work there now than it was before It is unclear if someone can contract Ebola twice If a person has successfully fought off the infection it means their body has learned how to combat the virus Scientists do not know how long this immunity lasts  it could be lifelong or it may wane English nurse William Pooley who recovered from Ebola after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp has donated some of his blood in case it offers clues about how to kill the virus The Spanish nurse who became the first person to contract Ebola outside West Africa tested negative for the virus after reportedly receiving human serum containing antibodies from Ebola survivors A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine of survivors of the Ebola virus outbreak that occurred in  in the Gulu district of Uganda  While in the UK the yearold had said he was impatient to return to his work in Africa and would travel as soon as he had a new passport His old one was incinerated when he was evacuated  The nurse from Eyke in Suffolk was flown back to the UK by the RAF on  August and was taken to the UKs special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London He was treated during the early stages of the infection before the onset of internal or external bleeding  Unlike many people in Africa he was given the experimental drug ZMapp which seemed to lower levels of the virus in his body  He has since made a full recovery and has donated his blood for medical research  Mr Pooley said I would like to once again thank the team at the Royal Free Hospital and the RAF who provided me with such excellent treatment and support  But the real emergency is in West Africa and the teams out there need all the support we can give them  I am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all I can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible More than  people have died in the Ebola outbreak which is the largest in history  Mr Pooley will work at the isolation unit at Connaught Hospital in Freetown Sierra Leone where he will train staff and set up new isolation units  He will work with a team from Kings Health Partners  a collaboration between Kings College London and three NHS trusts  which is operating in the country Dr Oliver Johnson programme director for the Kings Sierra Leone Partnership said It is fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team here at Connaught Hospital  The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day and so Wills experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to stem the flow of cases  The best way of stopping Ebola spreading even further is to fight it at its source and I look forward to working with Will to do just that
