A British study has found that having shingles can increase the risk for heart attacks The retrospective study   included  shingles cases and  matched controls The researchers followed the subjects for an average of  years after they contracted shingles After adjusting for body mass index smoking cholesterol hypertension diabetes and other vascular risk factors they found that over all having shingles increased the risk of a heart attack by  percent and the risk of a socalled ministroke or transient ischemic attack by  percent though it did not alter the risk of having a major stroke But in people who developed shingles before age  the relative risks increased dramatically a fold increased risk for stroke a fold increase for transient ischemic attack or TIA and a fold increase for heart attack The reasons are not completely clear but the herpes zoster virus can spread to the blood vessels from the nerves and cause inflammation which may lead to vascular disease  If you have shingles get yourself checked for other vascular risks said the lead author Dr Judith Breuer a professor of virology at University College London We need to do more studies to figure out if preventing shingles is also a way of preventing stroke heart attack and TIA she added But if you have other risk factors you may want to consider the zoster vaccination
