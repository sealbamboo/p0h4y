Hello, everyone, and how are you this morning? A spot of rain is falling on the Pharmalot campus, making for a gloomy start to yet another busy day. Nothing like a soggy start is there? Nonetheless, we will muddle onward, fortified by a cup or more of needed stimulation. Please feel free to join us.  Meanwhile, as we reach for the umbrella, we are passing along some tidbits that we hope you will find useful. Have a good day, stay dry and keep us in mind if you hear anything interesting….
