Up to a fifth of the NHSs work does not benefit patients and could cause harm the health minister has said In a speech Mark Drakeford called on the Welsh health service to adopt a policy of prudent medicine prioritising resources on proven care  It could mean surgery like tonsil removal may not be offered if it was considered of little benefit and antibiotics prescriptions could be cut It has led to criticism that the policy could see health services rationed But one of Wales most eminent doctors warned the NHS faced financial collapse unless changes were adopted In practice the changes could involve not offering patients surgery for example to remove tonsils if it was considered to be of little benefit It could mean limiting the amount of drugs used for chronic pain management and reducing the number of antibiotics prescribed by GPs The policy was announced during the health ministers speech to the NHS Confederation Conference   in Cardiff Mr Drakeford said the plan would lead to better care and help get the maximum value for every pound you spend in the NHS It means starting with the things that are the most basic most proven and most likely to work And you try those first And if those things dont work then of course you move on he said What research studies show is that while the health service sets out to do good in peoples lives it doesnt always succeed  So we know people come into hospitals and they acquire infections we know over prescribing antibiotics in the long run does more harm than good Studies show that almost  of what every modern health service does either does no good or does harm Every health board has lists of procedures they dont normally offer because theyre not effective what I want to do is make that a national list so we do this on a concerted national basis But the policy has been attacked by the Welsh Conservatives shadow health minister Darren Millar who suggests it amounts to rationing services at a time of dwindling resources Patients should be entitled to timely treatment in accordance with their clinical needs and to suggest otherwise is very concerning he said Rationing services and forcing patients to wait longer for treatment to help health boards meet their financial targets cannot be the answer to increasing demand  Instead the Welsh Labour government must reprioritise its budget and put a halt to the recordbreaking budget cuts they are imposing on the health service But Professor Sir Mansel Aylward a key health advisor to the Welsh government speaking to BBC Wales rejected those claims saying a policy of prudent health care will see money better spent This is not a matter of money alone  its about delivering quality and benefit to patients and getting rid of waste harm and variation he said  Why should we spend perhaps  of the budget of NHS Wales on things that dont work  Thats not rationing its saying were giving people the quality they expect  Were reducing the harm they face and were showing were doing this in as economic and efficient a way as possible Why should we expose people to an operation or the complications of postoperative recovery when we know whats being done doesnt work Sir Mansel who is also chair of Public Health Wales also argues unless the changes can be implemented in the next two years the Welsh NHS could find itself in a bleak financial position He added I think the next two years are critically important but we will be managing  However after that it is bleak unless we do something that will make a difference financially If nothing is done within the next couple of years we will be at a place that is very near collapse Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said it had long been known that Wales spent more on healthcare per patient than other parts of the UK but with worse outcomes As a member of the health committee we have been told repeatedly by health officials at every level of the NHS that we are spending money on the wrong things she said I am pleased that the Welsh government has finally woken up to this fact  However the devil will be in the detail and I will be looking at the proposals very closely to ensure that patients in Wales are not losing out as a result Mr Drakeford insisted he had not made any calculations about how much money could be saved if the policy was adopted  He conceded the policy would involve putting an extra responsibility on individuals to take better care of themselves Prudent medicine makes sure those with the most urgent needs get to the front of the queue and get seen first he said But prudent medicine definitely also means saying to the citizen as well as the service there are things you can do differently and we need to do differently if we are to go on having a health service in the future
