About 100 outpatients, visitors and staff were evacuated from a hospital in North Yorkshire due to an acid spill.. Firefighters wearing gas-tight suits were sent into Harrogate Hospital to tackle fumes caused by the spill in the endoscopy unit at about 08:40 GMT.. The spill involved a drum containing peracetic acid which was soon made safe, the fire service said.. No-one was injured and there had been "no impact" on inpatients, a hospital spokesman said.. The incident had caused minor delays in the outpatients department, but patients with appointments should attend as normal, he added.
