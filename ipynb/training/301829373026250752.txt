  You may want to pause before you take your next calcium tablet In a large longterm study of Swedish women researchers found that calcium intake greater than  mg per day was associated with higher death rates The increase in death risk was more pronounced in those who consumed high amounts of calcium in their diets   used   as much as doubling their death risk compared to those who ate foods with a lot of calcium but did not take supplements Higher death rates were also observed among women who consumed fewer than  mg of calcium per day Death rates did   increase in those whose total daily calcium intake fell between  and  mg per day We know   says Joan Salge Blake MS RD a clinical associate professor of nutrition at Boston University who did not work on the study After age  its not so much adding to bone mass but making sure you dont withdraw from bone prematurely Americans are living longer so we have to make sure they are living better and have adequate bone mass later on in life so they can enjoy their later years with strong bones But many Americans dont meet their calcium needs with diet so they turn to supplements These findings highlight the idea that with calcium and especially calcium supplements some is good and more may not be better Blake says The recommended amount of calcium intake for a woman between  and  years of age is  mg per day according to the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine But women are falling short of that guideline  getting only an average of  mg of calcium per day says Blake That number comes from the latest What We Eat in America survey Blake adds that Americans on average eat one and a half   instead of the recommended three Calcium supplement use is common especially for people who dont get enough nutrients  or think they dont  from diet More than  percent of women middleaged and older in the United States regularly take calcium supplements the study authors write in their report For this study researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden pulled data from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry and the Swedish Mammography Cohort established from  which followed women born between  and  The researchers obtained dietary questionnaires from the mammography cohort  completed by  women at baseline and  women in  They measured reported calcium intake and death from all causes in addition to death from cardiovascular disease   involving reduced blood supply to the heart due to narrowing of the arteries and stroke While the findings published today in the   show an association between high calcium intake in women and higher death rates from all causes and cardiovascular disease they did not show such an association with stroke death rates Past observational studies have linked calcium supplement use to lower overall and cardiovascular death but they have also linked the supplements to higher incidence of heart disease Additionally metaanalyses of studies have found an association between the use of calcium supplements and ischemic heart disease and stroke Just last week a study published in   found that   may be nearly  percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those who do not take supplements Interestingly the researchers on that study did not find the same risk in women The upper intake level for calcium a number which national guidelines recommend people stay under is  for men and women  and older according to the Institute of Medicine But its difficult to go above that cap from diet alone says Blake When you already get enough calcium from food calcium in excess often comes from supplements or from   Getting too much of something from supplements or overly fortified foods could be problematic but getting too much from Mother Nature is not as risky especially considering Americans arent meeting recommended dairy servings The takehome message of this new study for Blake is that people wondering about calcium supplements should look at their own individual diets If youre getting the right amount of dairy and eating wellbalanced meals You can probably get this a recommended healthy amount of calcium from your diet she says
