Several years ago a mosquito bite on Elizabeth Loboas right leg became infected turning into an oozing sore that refused to heal Her doctor prescribed a stiff course of antibiotics But Dr Loboa decided to try another remedy An associate professor of biomedical engineering at North Carolina State University she had been experimenting with a new kind of bandage a scaffold of microscopic fibers that could be inserted into a wound to encourage tissue growth The fibers were coated with silver to fend off infection   The bandages were not approved for medical use but Dr Loboa decided to appoint herself the first human test subject The silverinfused bandages worked Within a few days she said the infection was gone She retains a small scar  and a deep admiration for    Amid concern over the rise of antibioticresistant bacteria silver   an oldtime remedy for infection  is enjoying a renaissance  And its a very stcentury one Hightech microscopic particles of the metal are being embedded as antimicrobial agents in products from athletic clothing to stuffed toys from bed linens to food containers An   from the Wilson Center the public policy and research organization based in Washington lists everything from a contour foam neck support pillow to lounging socks from the Sharper Image  Many researchers arent sure thats entirely a good thing As interest in silver nanotechnology increases so does the worry that we are pursuing its benefits without fully understanding its risks Scientists worry about evidence  that the particles may cause unexpected environmental harm new studies suggest they may damage plants and fish in ways that had not been predicted by traditional silver exposure  And they worry about other unresolved health issues such as    and the  apparent ability of the particles   Dr Loboa director of North Carolina States cell mechanics laboratory is particularly concerned about studies that show silver nanoparticles    Theres evidence that the particles  penetrate into plasma membranes and they   she said in an interview While Dr Loboas experimental bandages use silver it is not in nanoparticle form Nanoparticles are astonishingly small Silver nanoparticles can be as tiny as five nanometers a human hair is  to   nanometers wide Theres some evidence that the smallest silver particles are the riskiest more reactive with other elements and    Silver isnt the only material being microsized for commercial use Researchers are investigating everything from titanium dioxide nanoparticles in cosmetics to selenium and cadmium in nanocrystals known as quantum dots which function as very miniature semiconductors  But silver offers some of the best insights into whats worth worrying about with regard to nanoparticles and what isnt  and    Its a poster child for why we should be looking at these materials said Mark Wiesner director of the Center for the Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology consortium at Duke University  Traditional silver is considered a lowtoxicity metal its fairly inert in the body and at acute doses its bestknown effect is blue discoloration of the skin But Dr Wiesner said silver nanoparticles dont always behave in the same way One concern is that increased uses of silver nanoparticles in consumer and medical products will mean increased environmental contamination as the products are washed and the particles released into water supplies Researchers are working now to try to predict what will result said Greg Lowry a member of the nanotechnology consortium and a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University Dr Lowry collaborated in an investigation last year designed to mimic a lowlevel release of silver nanoparticles into a complex natural environment The study showed that even in small amounts they    Nanoparticles seem able to attach to living cells    something like a timerelease medication This is a metal that weve studied for centuries said Michael Hochella a professor of geochemistry at Virginia Tech and another member of the group But with silver nano theres some kind of chemistry going on that we havent put our fingers on  As a rule he said silver likes to bind with sulfur in the environment forming a fairly inert and harmless silver sulfide compound But recent studies suggest that nanoparticles more easily evade the bond This seems to especially true of the tiniest particles Dr Hochella said  A study from the University of Oxford this year suggested that the smaller particles were also unusually reactive with oxygen molecules in water The scientists reported that the intensity of that reaction   which is poisonous to aquatic organisms So far most scientists agree that such findings suggest a relatively minor health threat to people using products with silver nanoparticles The more serious concerns are environmental Dr Wiesner said Still the growing uneasiness over the particles led the Natural Resources Defense Council to file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency in  claiming that the agency was    And the EPA has its own concerns Last month the agency moved to stop a New Jersey company that was embedding silver nanoparticles into food containers without bothering to register the product  The EPA can   if they are using the nanoparticles for antimicrobial action The  NRDC notes that companies frequently try to evade this requirement  Theyll just say that its about a fresh smell and not mention the antimicrobial aspect said Jennifer Sass an NRDC senior scientist And our concern is that this means that people are being exposed without adequate information Rosalind Volpe executive director of an industry organization the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group acknowledges that products using silver nanoparticles may not always be registered But even so she says that the amount of particles involved is too small to add up to a meaningful threat I think the EPA is doing a good job she said Theyve done some very conservative risk assessments And antimicrobial silver is a valuable tool she said adding Remember this is an emerging technology  we need to look at the benefits as well as recognize the risks From the scientific standpoint said Dr Wiesner studying nanoparticles also offers some unexpected benefits researchers are gaining a new and better understanding of the way plants take up metal for instance and of the unexpectedly complicated interaction of silver with living cells  But given the uncertainties he added theres reason to approach the technology with some caution Is it important to use silver nanoparticles to protect a child from bacteria on a teddy bear he said We should be asking whether thats really a significant benefit particularly when we dont yet fully know the risks
