If time is short and you want to start burning calories quickly, try the up and over. This uncomplicated cardio drill helps you work on your balance and turn a strength workout into a sweaty cardio circuit. Amy Dixon, personal trainer and head of group fitness at Equinox Santa Monica, uses it on her "Breathless Body, Vol. 2: The Edge" DVD and demonstrates it here.. Add this cardio drill between strength exercises or anytime you have five minutes for a mini cardio workout.. More cardio = less love handles.. From a standing position, jump to the right, swinging your arms up and lifting your knees up and around, as if you are clearing a low hurdle. Tap your left foot as you land while your arms come back down. Then immediately jump back to the left, driving your arms and knees back up and over the imaginary obstacle, tapping your right foot down. Alternate this lateral hop from side to side for 30 seconds.. Beginners can modify the move by stepping up and over with arm swings rather than hopping. More advanced exercisers can turn the tap-down into a hop and balance with the foot off the floor before jumping back to the other side.. Work as hard as you can for 30 seconds. Rest for 15 seconds. Do the drill a total of four times.
