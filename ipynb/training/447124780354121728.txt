Im not nave about the corporate world Burton Richter told me when we spoke about  a very upscale continuing care retirement community  Dr Richter  has served on corporate boards He directed the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center for  years among his other faculty and administrative positions at the university And his honors include the Nobel Prize in physics The five other named plaintiffs in the proposed suit have impressive resumes too with an abundance of advanced degrees Yet when they grasped that Vis management had not stashed their sizable entrance fees in a reserve account it astounded me and a lot of the residents Dr Richter said CCRCs are state regulated and there is no consistency from state to state as to what residents rights are said Katherine Pearson a Penn State law professor and authority on this type of senior housing Though such communities come in many configurations  some operate more like rentals without big upfront fees  buying into a place like the Vi can take most of a residents life savings Yet most state regulations if they exist at all emphasize disclosure more than consumer protection You can have a financial disclosure law that puts  percent of the burden on the resident to understand its significance Ms Pearson said New York and New Jersey have strong CCRC regulations she said Virginias are weak and Californias have serious gaps Most dont require reserve funds for the eventual refunds of entrance fees So how can older people who arent Nobel laureates but are contemplating moving into a CCRC figure out whether a community is financially stable and smoothly run whether residents interests are protected whether the investment makes sense The National Continuing Care Residents Association incorporated in  works to educate prospective residents and increase state oversight With its  individual members nine state associations and  member CCRCs it probably represents close to  people the groups incoming president Dan Seeger estimated One of its committees has drafted a national residents bill of rights and expects to present it at the groups semiannual meeting in Mystic Conn next month Other committees are working on model laws to increase financial transparency and stability which they hope state governments will adopt The association also wants to develop an index of financial solvency with which prospective residents can compare facilities Right now the average shopper is floundering Mr Seeger said This is a vulnerable population that probably believes theres more government regulation than there is Let me direct you to two association websites The   contains information about the organization including a list of state associations The site informally dubbed   takes a more educational approach Jack Cumming an actuary and the groups research director has posted scads of videos and consumer guides research documents and proposals Neither site is a model of userfriendly navigation finding the information you want requires some poking around To see court filings from CCRC litigation including the Vi lawsuit for instance you need to look under the News tab on the NaCCRA U top menu bar Cant some semiretired graphic designers and programmers design a snazzier and more serviceable website for these folks Nevertheless novices in the world of CCRCs can learn a lot from whats there Theyre a good group very committed to CCRCs and wanting to do things to strengthen the industry said Steve Maag even though hes often on the other side of the fence as the director of residential communities for Leading Age which represents nonprofit providers The stuff they put out is fairly accurate and well thought out Ms Pearson also recommends an online tool called   started by a financial planner and an accountant who operate independently of CCRC developers and providers LifeSite delivers financial data for hundreds of CCRCs  occupancy rates operating margins recent fee increases  for about  a search Ms Pearson   on the Elder Law Prof Blog which she writes and edits with other law professors People who live in these complexes tend to like them All of us believe in the CCRC way of life the value and usefulness of seniors banding together to mutually help each other meet the contingencies of growing old Mr Seeger said But CCRCs essentially offer a form of longterm care insurance in which seniors pay in advance to have care later on with much less state regulation than insurance companies face In boom times they make so much sense Ms Pearson said of CCRCs With the slowdown in the economy these issues have come about Now that the recovery means more CCRCs on drawing boards she doesnt want those issues forgotten
