In biology you cant get much simpler than viruses They stick onto cells pop open and then dump their genes inside to reproduce But the naming of viruses isnt so easy to follow Theres the new HN   through China And   is popping up in Southeast Asia Last summer HN   dozens of people at country fairs Oh lets not forget that pain in the neck HN or the swine flu which   through the US in  What in the heck do all these Hs and Ns mean H is short for hemagglutinin And N is short for neuraminidase More about those in just a moment But first weve got to cover the ABCs Influenza comes in   A B and C Those categories tell you a bit about how dangerous the viruses can be Influenza C causes the mildest disease Although influenza B can make you just as sick as A it has never triggered a worldwide pandemic Those have all come from the influenza A strains Among other things influenza A viruses are fashionistas They cover themselves in an array of accessories But instead of wearing Dolce and Gabbana influenza prefers H  N aka hemagglutinin and neuraminidase Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are little protein spikes on the flus surface that help it invade cells Just like handbags and shoes the spikes come in a variety of styles There are  versions of hemagluttinin and nine for neuremanidase Each flu picks out one style from the N rack and another from the H rack The new bird flu in China HN covers itself in H and N while HN is a bit more lowkey and goes only for style No  from each All told there are   subtypes of influenza A from HN to HN All of them exist in wild birds around the world so they are all bird flus But every now and then one evolves the ability to infect other animals HN is one of the more promiscuous It can infect birds people pigs and horses HN on the other hand only makes its way into people and birds But all influenza A strains are social climbers Theyre always itching to try out new living quarters So they mutate And they also do something even more insidious They swap accessories Geneticists call it   And historically it signals trouble Say a bird gets infected with two viruses HN and HN When the two viruses reproduce inside the birds cells HN can grab accessories from HN This creates a new strain that looks like HN but can now infect people because it started off as just HN Thats what happened in  during the Asian flu pandemic says computational biologist   from the National Institute for Medical Research in London Since HN had never infected people before our immune systems had never seen these accessories and thus we had little defense against it The new strain ended up   roughly  Americans But the virus didnt stop there It then picked up H from birds in  to cause the Hong Kong flu pandemic Goldstein tells Shots That killed another  Americans What about more recent epidemics The  flu was a real mess he says The virus had some segments from HN circulating in humans from the  pandemic It had genes coming in from birds an H coming from pigs and an N coming in from a completely different virus he says They all then mixed together in pigs Scientists are still trying to figure out HN So far it looks like the virus got its H from ducks its N from migratory birds and a splash of other genetic material from chickens immunologists   recently in   But how this fashion bug found its way into people is still a mystery
