  A new study projects there will be  million Americans   by  up from  million in  The study published in the journal   indicates an outsized need to boost research efforts develop innovative treatments increase the caregiver workforce and move toward finding a cure for the disease The risk for developing   increases as a person ages And the anticipated ballooning of the number of people with Alzheimers is due to increasing lifespans and a sizable aging baby boomer population of  million   percent of the US total  who are expected to live well past previous generations Currently  in  Americans over the age of  has Alzheimers disease which is the sixthleading cause of death in the United States according to the Alzheimers Association Symptoms include inability to recognize people or objects and difficulty with motor skills and speech According to the authors of the   study in  there were  million people with Alzheimers between  and  years old  million between  to  and  million  and older Among the estimated  million Alzheimers patients in  approximately half will be  or older say the researchers The research team analyzed data from  to  on  African Americans and whites in Chicago who were  and older They interviewed subjects every three years to screen for dementia and then combined that information with US Census Bureau death rate data and projected death rates Without having these numbers we generated its like knowing a hurricane is coming but not knowing what category its going to be in says Jennifer Weave ScD assistant professor at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago and coauthor of the study Its kind of like climate change Until it stares you right in the face its hard to really comprehend the magnitude of the problem Parsing and predicting these numbers wasnt an easy task says Weave The US government does not keep count of the number of people with Alzheimers like it does with diseases such as cancer or HIV Some research suggests that half of the people who have Alzheimers dont know they have it she says In the th century life expectancy increased steadily because of many factors such as better medical treatment vaccines improved nutrition and cleaner water among others In  the year  a typical Americans average life expectancy was  years By  that number had increased to  years and by  to around  according to the National Centers for Health Statistics In the past decade that number has risen to almost  years according to the US Centers for Disease Control CDC These figures alone speak volumes about just how overwhelmed our health care system may be in the coming decades Alzheimers disease can be active for a decade or more and as the disease progresses a patient requires aroundtheclock care whether at home or in an assisted living or nursing home facility Both routes for care tax not just a patient but also their   explains LouEllen Barkan president and CEO of the Alzheimers Associations New York City chapter People who become ill live a long time with the disease says Barkan Most people cannot afford the kind of care were talking about Alzheimers is an incredibly costly disease In  the country spent  billion on Alzheimers according to a recent report from the Alzheimers Association As the United States works to reshape its health care system  expanding Medicaid and scaling down Medicare  the situation becomes more dire she says This is going to bankrupt the system We need to look at how money is being spent she saysWe do not have enough nursing homes we do not have enough nursing home beds and we dont have enough people trained in care at these nursing homes In New York alone experts predict that  out of  people will have Alzheimers or be caring for someone with the disease within the next few decades says Barkan I look around and I wonder where is everyone going to go The real question is how will government pay for that care That will play itself out in the next  to  years she says In recent years scientists have developed newer treatments for Alzheimers but there is no cure in sight There are several medications on the market that work by stopping the breakdown of acetylcholine a neurotransmitter that is believed to be important for cognition and memory Drugs in this class include Aricept Exelon and Razadyne Some recent research has looked into developing an   to prevent the disease Some medical experts who work closely with the aging population say its essential to encourage preventive care Zachary  Palace MD a geriatrician and director of the Hebrew Home a nursing home in Riverdale NY says he observes that residents who work to keep their brains sharp and stay busy by doing activities such as playing crossword puzzles socializing and staying physically active tend to fare better and are less likely to develop dementia I think we need more emphasis on what we do know says Dr Palace Last year President Barack Obama signed a bill that outlines a national   initiative to develop effective treatments for the disease and related forms of dementia by the year  Two trials underway at the National Institutes of Health funded through Obamas plan have shown promise One is for an   treatment and the other is a large scale prevention trial involving people at highrisk for developing the disease Research can also tell us which ways of managing Alzheimers is most effective for caregivers says Weave Its possible we wont figure out how to cure Alzheimer but we may figure out how to manage it
