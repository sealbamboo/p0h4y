If your cardiologist is away at a conference when youre having a stabbing feeling in your chest dont fret You may be more likely to live A  published Monday in the journal   found frail patients admitted to teaching hospitals with two common types of heart problems were more likely to survive on days when national cardiology conferences were going on The researchers also discovered that heart attack patients who were at higher risk of dying were less likely to undergo angioplasties when conferences were occurring yet their mortality rates were the same as similar patients admitted at other times An angioplasty in which a doctor unblocks an artery with an inflatable balloon inserted by a small tube is one of the   procedures for cardiac patients The conclusions about teaching hospitals surprised even the authors who had begun their inquiry anticipating that death would be more common during cardiology meetings because hospital staffs were more shorthanded than usual Finding the opposite the researchers speculated that for very weak patients aggressive treatments may exceed the benefits Theres something very specific about cardiology meetings and cardiology outcomes said   a professor at Harvard Medical School and the lead researcher of the study I can tell you with almost certainty that something different is happening in the hospital but I cant tell you why this is happening The study looked at Medicare patients admitted to  major teaching hospitals between  and  during days that the American Heart Association or the American College of Cardiology held their annual meetings These conferences draw thousands of doctors nurses pharmacists and other medical professionals who come to hear of the latest research therapies drugs and technologies as well as to network and socialize with colleagues Dr Patrick OGara   of the American College of Cardiology said he was reassured by the finding that patient mortality didnt increase when those doctors were away People should take away from this particular paper that they should be confident of going to a teaching hospital at any time of the year he said He cautioned against drawing any conclusions from the papers finding that mortality rates dropped for some people noting that the data are not granular enough to provide information about what types of patient therapies the patients received For patients with heart failure heart attacks or cardiac arrest the researchers examined death rates  either in the hospital or within  days of leaving and compared them with the rates for patients hospitalized on the same days of the week during the three weeks before the conferences started and the three weeks after The lower death rates during conferences were limited to highrisk patients in teaching hospitals Researchers didnt see a change in mortality for highrisk patients in other hospitals The study also found that the majority of patients with more robust health had no greater chance of expiring if their hospitalization overlapped with a conference The researchers found that  percent of highrisk patients with heart failure where the heart muscle doesnt pump blood as well as it should  died on conference days while  percent died on the nonmeeting days The difference was even greater for patients with cardiac arrest when the heart isnt pumping blood The study found  percent of cardiac arrest patients died when conferences were underway while  percent died on other days The researchers suggested several possibilities but also found reasons to doubt those explanations It could be that cardiologists who attend conferences are more likely to do aggressive medical treatments such as complex angioplasties than are those doctors who skip conferences While invasive treatments often save lives they can also result in infections and other complications some of which can be deadly The researchers also postulated that when a patients primary cardiologist is out of town a substituting doctor may be less likely to perform an aggressive intervention However the researchers were unable to find evidence of any procedures that were being performed less frequently for heart failure or cardiac arrest patients during conference dates Jena said aggressive procedures such as placing catheters into neck veins to measure the heart can cause complications but arent always easy to identify in the Medicare billing data used in the study The researchers hypothesized that during conferences there might be fewer patients undergoing elective procedures therefore giving the remaining doctors more time to focus on the urgent cases However they didnt find any decrease in the number of heart patient admissions during conference days They also found no difference in the general health of patients hospitalized on meetings days and those admitted at other times One more possibility Jena said is that the doctors who leave are primarily researchers and they dont take care of as many patients as other doctors so they are worse doctors Heart attack patients were just as likely to die on conference dates as other dates But  percent received angioplasties or stents when conferences were going on less than the  percent who received these interventions other times Patients at the very least are no worst off and in fact they may be better off by having less stenting Jena said
