 Its been well documented by researchers that   including in a recent study in the   But how smoking affects the progression of bladder disease hasnt been as well known In a study published in the   researchers from the University of Miami and the University of Southern California report that bladder cancers in those who smoked most intensely were  percent more likely to be deadly than bladder cancers in those who never smoked or smoked less In addition they report theyve discovered markers that may someday improve treatment choices for the most serious bladder cancers For the study the researchers looked at bladder tumors and smoking history in  multiethnic patients recruited through the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program between  and  A person was classified as a smoker if he or she smoked at least one cigarette per day for six months or longer The second group of smokers were patients who smoked for  to  years or more than  cigarettes a day for less than  years and group three was composed of patients who smoked for more than  years They found that at five years the likelihood of dying from bladder cancer was  percent for those who never smoked or were light smokers  percent for patients who were moderate smokers and  percent for those patients who were the most intense or heavy smokers In addition to the link between smoking intensity and seriousness of bladder cancers they also found changes in particular proteins in bladder cancers that became deadly We have identified a panel of nine molecular markers that can robustly and reproducibly predict bladder cancer prognosis independent of standard clinical criteria and smoking history said Anirban Mitra MD PhD from the USC in a press release The researchers found that patients with alterations in six to nine of these bladder cancer markers had very poor outcomes possibly indicating they could have benefited from more aggressive treatment They also said the studys findings confirm the theory that an accumulation of changes in proteins is more important than individual changes in determining the characteristics of a given cancer The study also reinforces the fact that smoking  especially smoking a lot  is bad for your health in a number of ways beyond lung cancer and   Not only can smoking increase your risk of bladder cancer it is a risk factor for other types of illnesses not immediately associated with cigarettes For women who already have HPV the human papillomavirus it can   according to another   study  theres good news Experts have found your health begins to improve within minutes of the last puff from the last cigarette and the improvement continues in the years that follow
