Lose weight and those pounds shuffle off unmourned Good riddance Please dont come back soon But where does weight go when we lose it We talk about burning off fat and it does burn in a way going through a complex biochemical process But mass cant be created or destroyed so the atoms that made the triglycerides that plumped up the love handles have got to be somewhere That mystery was bedeviling   an Australian and former physicist turned TV personality and science educator Meerman had recently lost  kilos  pounds and he was wondering where the fat went So he teamed up with   a lipid researcher at the University of New South Wales to figure it out Their   were published Tuesday in the lighthearted Christmas edition of   formerly the   The adipose sleuths started with this chemical formula which describes what happens when you burn a molecule of triglyceride the predominant fat in a human body C H O O  CO H Oenergy If you remember your high school chemistry youve already figured out that when you metabolize fat you end up with carbon dioxide water and energy Oxidizing  kilos of human fat requires inhaling  kilos of oxygen to produce  kilos of carbon dioxide and  kilos of water the authors figure Thats based on the work of other scientists Meerman and Brown then fired up their calculators to figure out the proportion of mass that ends up as CO  versus H O   percent compared to  percent Carbon dioxide is a common gas in the atmosphere so its pretty obvious where it would go Yes we exhale lost fat There it helps plants photosynthesize if youre feeling noble and contributes to global warming if youre feeling guilty Exhale more CO  and youll lose more weight  especially if youre exhaling more frequently because youre running The relatively small amount of water produced by fat metabolism could be disposed of through urine sweat or other bodily fluids the authors note Many people think that fat metabolites are disposed of in feces or converted to muscle Meerman and Brown write but thats not correct We recommend these concepts be included in secondary school science curriculums and university biochemistry courses to correct widespread misconceptions about weight loss And let your fat drift away on the breeze
