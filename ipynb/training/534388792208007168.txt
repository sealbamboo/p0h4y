If your partners kiss is on your lips his microbes are too A passionate kiss that lasts more than  seconds transfers about  million bacteria researchers say The evidence   Sunday in the journal   comes from  couples ages  to  who made out for science Tough gig Each couple had their mouths swabbed and spit to measure the bacteria in their mouths Even before kissing the couples had similar mouth bacteria To our surprise we found that those people that are intimately related  share much more of that bacteria on their tongue than unrelated individuals   a microbiologist at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research in Amsterdam and lead author of the study told NPRs Rob Stein He believes it may be due to other shared habits among couples like using a certain toothpaste or smoking To see if kissing transfers microbes from one person to another the couples then smooched after drinking probiotic yogurt The researchers focused on  and  which together usually make up only about  percent of the bacteria in human saliva and  percent of the bacteria on the tongue But after the yogurt kiss the  and   in the person on the receiving end rose substantially  up to  percent in saliva and  percent on the tongue This led them to the estimate that each smooch carries  million bacteria Couples who kissed at least nine times a day were more likely to have similar saliva microbes Put simply kissing affects the microbes living in your mouth says Kort To be clear were talking about French kissing here not a grandmotherly peck Kort and colleagues believe this vigorous osculation could be a way to change your microbiome Theres a number of   that show that its healthy to have a high diversity of microorganisms in your mouth says Kort And it might be fun to try Could changing the microbiome be as simple as a lip lock It is provocative to think that we can perhaps donate beneficial microbes by an oral microbiome transplant  says   a microbiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine who didnt work on the study in an email to Shots Maybe we could transplant the mouth bacteria of a person who doesnt get cavities to one who often does says   a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine who did not work on the study There may even be evolutionary reasons for the swap she says like when a mom of a newborn kisses a baby it may actually be sampling the microbiota If youd like to find out how many microbes you and your partner swap the results of the study have been used to fuel a KissOMeter at   billed as the worlds first museum of microorganisms Just stand on the stage and pucker up and sensors will detect the type of kiss youre sharing A readout will tell you how many and what types of microbes youve just shared But that requires a trip to Amsterdam If you really want to know that is Some of us just might prefer kissing in the dark
