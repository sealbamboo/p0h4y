
 Stories of misdiagnoses circulate throughout the testimonies of people contending with all sorts of cancers Such errors made by patients as well as doctors bring in their wake a sense of betrayal selfrecrimination and anger Should we accept them as inevitable Like many women I misinterpreted the muted symptoms of ovarian cancer Bloating satiety fatigue and constipation are often attributed to menopause aging indigestion irritable bowel syndrome depression laziness or whining My general practitioner prescribed half a cup of wheat bran applesauce and prune juice every day By the time a CT was ordered a year later the cancer had progressed to an advanced stage that is treatable but not curable I was furious at myself and upset with my doctor People leading active lives seem especially prone to dismissing subtle warning signs The philosopher Gillian Rose declared I was so attuned to regular exercise of body and mind that I could easily take minor symptoms of illhealth in my stride Similarly the physician and marathon runner Dr Geoffrey Kurland deceived himself about symptoms of leukemia I now realize that for several months my body had been giving me warnings I had chosen to ignore warnings that something was not right with me Physicians are particularly likely to miss a cancer diagnosis in the case of young adults According to S Lochlann Jains book Malignant doctors often work under the misguided assumption that cancer is a disease of older people leading to an immorally high number of delayed diagnoses and in turn the large proportion of latestage cancers When she received a latestage breast cancer diagnosis in her mids Professor Jain turned to the tort system because her doctor had first refused to biopsy a lump in her breast and then ordered a fine needle aspiration rather than a more reliable core biopsy A false negative deferred treatment   undertaken by the National Coalition on Health Care along with Best Doctors Inc found a disconnect between what cancer specialists assume to be the case about physician misdiagnosis and the facts of the matter A majority of the  doctors in the study believed that from zero to  percent of patients are misdiagnosed however research indicates that the actual figure may be as high as  percent I suspect that patients would put the percentage higher  There are of course numerous causes of misdiagnosis physician overconfidence or complacency insufficient time with a patient unreliable detection tools and poor pathology protocols knowledge limited by over or underspecialization fragmented informational systems and patient inattention or repression But regardless of cause the results can be catastrophic Ironically the fate of a sociologist who studied endemic medical errors illuminates the consequences of a misdiagnosed sarcoma Marianne A Pagets physician in Illinois failed to order a chest Xray in the course of investigating the source of her back pain And then a Florida physician misread an Xray as normal Ms Paget first experienced symptoms in late  It took eight months to get the cancer diagnosis Despite extensive treatments she died in Dec  at age  Misdiagnosis can result in devastating surgical blunders too A friends sister Lisa underwent surgery for what her doctor assumed was a benign ovarian cyst which he removed He saw a suspicious area on the second ovary and  without waiting for the pathology report of the frozen section  cut into it It turned out the lesion was cancerous and by slicing into it he had released cancer cells into her body A senior surgeon stepped in and successfully completed a much larger operation than had been planned then insisted that the first surgeon tell Lisa what had happened Lisa was horrified by the first doctors huge mistake which increased the risk of recurrence dramatically But the honesty of both doctors allowed her to keep a sense of trust in them  Lisa uses the word mistake when she talks about her first surgeons error avoiding words like incompetence negligence and malpractice that suggest culpability dereliction of duty violation of professional standards and the legal assignment of blame In contrast Professor Jain points out that legal recourse and in particular lost chance claims which establish the difference in prognosis if the cancer had been found sooner can be used to raise doctors consciousness about cancers occurrence in younger people and help patients gain compensation for expensive injuries that are irreparable Missed diagnoses make up a considerable proportion of malpractice claims But how many of us have the strength or the money or expertise to manipulate complex legal systems and take on the burden of proof in order to protest bungles that continue to exact their toll in suffering And since patients make mistakes too we often concede that they arise less from irrevocable faults in our physicians and more from the fallibility of medicine To err is human to forgive divine as the poet Alexander Pope put what has since become a platitude mistakes happen  In my all too human way I struggle to forgive the honest mistakes of my doctors who are also mere mortals Sometimes though I have trouble forgiving myself
