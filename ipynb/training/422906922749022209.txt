Thousands of children could be dying each year because the World Health Organization has not updated guidelines for treating those going into shock UK researchers warn  They say the advice to give large quantities of fluid is deadly The updated guidelines in  did not recommend a change which the researchers described as disappointing and puzzling The WHO said it had to be very vigilant when changing guidelines And that it aimed to publish a new set of interim guidelines by early  Critically ill patients can go into shock as a result of severe infections such as malaria or fluid loss It changes the way blood flows around the body leaving patients looking pale  The recommended treatment is rapid fluid resuscitation  a large injection of fluid via a drip  This brings children out of shock   Three more children out of every  treated would die with fluid resuscitation when compared with those slowly given small quantities of fluid the study indicated In those with the most severe shock  died with the resuscitation compared with  given the low fluid doses it suggested Prof Kathryn Maitland a paediatrician with the Medical Research Council and Imperial College London criticised the WHO for not changing guidelines   She told the BBC Were very concerned that two and a half years later the guidelines have not changed She said there was a lack of data on the precise number children being diagnosed with shock But she added We can be confident that if hospitals follow the guidelines there will be excess mortality it is likely to run into thousands The WHO said the study came threequarters of the way through the last update and that systematically assessing all the evidence on managing shock would have delayed the other guidelines  Dr Elizabeth Mason the WHOs director of maternal newborn child and adolescent health told the BBC It was a fairly difficult decision but we dont make decisions based on one study alone even if it is fairly groundbreaking As an organisation we have to be very vigilant in making recommendations we need a systematic review of the evidence otherwise with every new study we could be changing WHO guidelines She said new interim guidelines were anticipated by the end of the year or the beginning of next year
