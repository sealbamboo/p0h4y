for the start of   and whiteheads With earlier onset of   when the adrenal gland awakens and menarche first period the authors of the guidelines suggest there appears to be a downward shift in the age at which acne first appears Ive definitely seen a shift said   a dermatologist at Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford who did not help draft the guidelines Its not uncommon for a  or yearold to walk in with the first signs of acne But whether children are experiencing early or precocious puberty has been the subject of scientific debate A more likely cause of the increase in cases some experts say is that parents are less tolerant of acne and doctors more willing to provide powerful acne treatments to children Although widely prescribed most of these drugs are used offlabel and only a few have been tested in children so young According to   which assessed an estimated  million physician visits for acne by children  to  the average age for seeking acne treatment has decreased slightly from  in  to  in  The proportion of acne visits by children  to  rose to  percent from practically zero  a pediatric dermatologist said more yearolds in her Cincinnati practice say that their acne began two or three years ago or say I started in the third grade  Pediatricians refer patients to her at earlier ages now she said But Dr Lucky isnt convinced that more preteenagers today have acne a study she conducted in  found that out of  girls ages  and    Instead she suggests that a change in mindset might be spurring more aggressive treatment in younger children Twenty years ago a pediatrician would say Ah youll outgrow it and now we think Why wait to outgrow it when we can address it earlier  said Dr Lucky who has been a paid consultant to Galderma Complicating matters some dermatologists and pediatricians report that parents are often more keen on seeking help than their children Some parents are perfectionists said Dr Benjamin who was a paid consultant for Ortho Dermatologics But most just dont want them in school bothered with acne or teased or bullied for their skin And the young patients Dr Benjamin meets plenty who are not focused on the look of it and when they are  or  they ask Can I go play a video game  However some are keen to tackle their acne At  Salma ElBadry didnt take kindly to her bodys march toward maturity She would get mad if she had a party and she would have to hide a pimple said Dr Nahla Hedayet her mother At that age its a pretty big drama So they consulted Salmas pediatrician who first prescribed benzoyl peroxide and then RetinA Her face cleared up but Salma now  and a swimmer said the skin got so irritated it really hurt She is more optimistic about Differin a retinoid Dr Benjamin just prescribed because its softer she said Dr Lisa M Asta a pediatrician in Walnut Creek Calif first determines who is really bothered by the acne My rule of thumb with preadolescents and younger adolescents is if the acne isnt going to scar and isnt bothering the child   she said If a prescription is merited Dr Asta also weighs its price Its about finding that sweet spot  a regimen that the kids will adhere to that works and is affordable  can be a predictor of more severe lesions If you have a yearold with a moderate degree of acne the odds of them having much more severe acne is very high said   the chief of pediatric and adolescent dermatology at Rady Childrens Hospital in San Diego and a chairman of the new treatment guidelines The authors were convened by the American Acne and   Society sponsors included pharmaceutical companies like Galderma and Valeant but they did not have any say in the guidelines By recognizing acne at an earlier age said Dr Eichenfield who has been a paid consultant for Galderma and Medicis doctors can minimize the physical scarring and psychological impact of acne Most acne drugs for children are prescribed offlabel meaning that clinical trials were done on patients older than  One exception is a gel with a retinoid and benzoyl peroxide which the Food and Drug Administration approved in February   Topical retinoids are the most commonly prescribed drug in such cases according to an   of an estimated  million doctor visits for acne patients under age  to be published in Pediatric Dermatology The study conducted by the Center for Dermatology Research Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that dermatologists prescribe topical retinoids more frequently than primary care physicians who prefer oral   which can reduce bacterial colonization of skin and follicles Its worth noting that tetracycline an oral antibiotic should not be used in children younger than  because it can permanently stain developing teeth Yet an estimated  patients some as young as  were prescribed tetracycline according to the study Untreated severe acne can lead to permanent scars or in darker skin   marks that can disturb a child more than pimples They care about brown
