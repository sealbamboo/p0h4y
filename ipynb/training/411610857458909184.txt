The last time we discussed   particularly women readers shared some wrenching experiences Karen from Los Angeles wrote that when her father who had Parkinsons disease moved in with her and her sister she wound up losing her job in finance and became his fulltime caregiver I wouldnt give up one moment I had taking care of my father she said but she described herself as  years old very little in savings and no prospects for another decent job with benefits I have not worked in over seven years KR from New Jersey commented When I left my job to take care of my father I never imagined that it would be this long Now that he has died she feels hopeless about finding work in a changing industry And since she has stopped contributing to Social Security and funding her K she is frightened about her own future The federal Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act introduced Thursday in Congress would provide paid leave for workers who need time off to care for family members with serious health conditions to care for a newborn or to recover from health problems including pregnancy and childbirth It wouldnt solve every problem for working caregivers but its passage would certainly help Dont we already have a federal Family and Medical Leave Act We do enacted in  but it was always intended to be a first step not the last said Debra L Ness president of the   which drafted that measure This proposed new legislation uses the same definition of a serious health condition including incapacity involving hospitalization chronic conditions like diabetes and longterm disability from dementia stroke and other diseases But it improves on the existing law in two ways First it would cover vastly more American workers The Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to companies with at least  employees the new measure would cover employees regardless of the size of their company and would include more parttimers and the selfemployed Second unlike our current unpaid leave the new legislation calls for paying employees part of their salaries while they are recovering or caring for infants or ailing family members An insurance program funded by small payroll deductions from both employers and employees each contributing twotenths of  percent of weekly wages it would allow workers to take up to  days leave a year and to be paid  percent of their wages up to a  monthly cap California and New Jersey have offered similar benefits for several years Rhode Islands new law takes effect next year Check out the partnerships explanation of   This not only affects folks who get the care but people who give the care Ms Ness told me in an interview Theyre probably working because they have to and they dont have an economic safety net Indeed a MetLife analysis of adult caregivers based on federal data estimated that   in lost wages and pension and Social Security benefits But really neither Ms Ness nor I need to tell New Old Age readers how caregiving or a personal health crisis can cost them in every way financially physically emotionally The more central question to my mind is whether this bill has a prayer of passage anytime soon It took nine long years to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act former President George HW Bush vetoed it twice before former President Bill Clinton signed it into law And that involved unpaid leave Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Democrat of New York and Representative Rosa DeLauro Democrat of Connecticut introduced the new measure but havent enlisted any Republican cosponsors which doesnt bode well The Obama administration hasnt commented though it may this spring at a promised summit on working families And on the long list of organizations supporting the law  the National Alliance for Caregiving the American Public Health Association womens groups unions religious associations  groups representing the elderly like AARP and LeadingAge and the National Council on Aging are conspicuously absent Already battling to maintain Social Security funding they may not be eager to back another payroll tax however small and however separate from Social Security On the other hand heres a question from Ann Bookman an elder care researcher and director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston Why is it that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world we havent come up with paid leave where the money doesnt have to come out of workers pockets Dr Bookman fears that lowincome employees will struggle if even small sums get deducted from their paychecks and would prefer that government share the cost with them and their employers Still she applauded the two legislators for undertaking the challenge of giving American families the support that people in every other developed nation already have This is definitely a step forward she said If it happens Well check in from time to time to track the measures fate
