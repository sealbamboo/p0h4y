Its one of the next big hurdles for the Obamacare rollout What will happen when hundreds of thousands of lowincome Californians shift from county health plans to the states huge MediCal system on Jan  Judging from a similar surge in  patients and physicians could see plenty of problems Starting on New Years Day  Wednesday  as many as a million formerly uninsured or underinsured people will begin moving onto MediCal rolls and reporting to clinics and hospitals that have agreed to provide treatment at set rates Also for the first time childless and healthy lowincome adults will be eligible and benefits will include mental health and substance abuse treatment Healthcare advocates are overjoyed about the expansion of services which is subsidized by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act At the same time they recognize that this is the kind of influx that can leave patients and doctors in a lurch  confused about such things as whether a longplanned surgery is still authorized or where patients should go for prescription refills When  senior and disabled MediCal members were gradually switched into managed care in  advocates reported numerous cases in which patients suffered as doctors and health plans didnt coordinate properly to deliver necessary ongoing medications and treatments for ailments as serious as cancer schizophrenia and diabetes Healthcare providers struggled as well many were assigned new patients with no way to review their medical histories This time officials and healthcare providers say they hope to avoid such disruptions Were using the same system we would use in an earthquake said Louise McCarthy chief executive of the Community Clinic Assn of Los Angeles County comparing the planning effort to a disaster drill This is going to be seismic We have to approach it as such The first step in getting ahead of potential problems making sure computer systems align According to the state Department of Health Services about  Californians are likely to wind up in MediCal  a billion program  after applying for the first time through Covered California the state healthcare insurance marketplace  others have tried to sign up through county human services agencies Those new members wont join a MediCal managed care plan right away But more than  new MediCal participants will roll over immediately from special countybased health programs formed to ease the transition to Obamacare Using money from the Affordable Care Act some California counties opted to start providing medical services for MediCal expansion eligible patients early in  so those patients could be cued up to move automatically into MediCal this week Los Angeles Countys Healthy Way LA program represents more than half of this population with  people signed up as of Nov  Planners are attempting to make sure that the state and county records for these patients match up with the enrollment rosters at the health plans contracted by MediCal  giving providers at least some idea about which patients are headed their way and what their needs may be While some advocates fretted that the proper data werent coming in fast enough Amy Luftig Viste who directs community partner programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services said on Dec  that she was feeling like were in a good place with the process When Los Angeles County compared its preliminary enrollment lists to those kept by the health providers who will run MediCals managed care plan in the county it found that the records matched for  of members Viste said Most Healthy Way LA patients are sticking with clinics and providers they visited in the past she said But even if every bit of data aligns perfectly and people go to doctors who expect them problems getting patients the care theyve been promised will probably arise she said California has determined that the vast majority of patients making the transition can continue seeing their current doctors  regardless of whether the providers are in their managed care networks  for  months It will be up to the the health plans and providers including LA County to work out how to make that happen Hoping to give clinic and hospital employees tools to help LA County ran training sessions to let them know what to expect starting Wednesday The health plans Health Net and LA Care which will run the MediCal operation in the county have staffed up for the change creating special triage teams to handle problems Preparations at community clinics have been frantic said Cynthia Carmona director of government and external affairs for the Community Clinic Assn She described neardaily transition planning meetings late this month as a sprint to get things thought through The clinic staff wanted a crisis plan by Christmas she said so her association began circulating an eightpage collection of frequently asked questions on Dec  The document attempts to answer such questions as What should a patient do if they were scheduled for a Department of Health Services specialty care appointment but were turned away What is the pharmacy network for LA Care and Health Net and How do I know my former Healthy Way LA patient successfully transitioned to MediCal The document also discusses failed enrollments missing paperwork and ID cards misidentified medical home assignments physician networks specialty and followup care It comes with a list of key phone numbers for when problems arise Carmona has asked member clinics to report incidents starting Wednesday The association will begin summarizing problems that arise in emails to healthcare centers starting Friday The bottom line planners said is that MediCal patients should get treated no matter what Were hammering home the message that continuity of care trumps everything Viste said McCarthy of the Community Clinics Assn was on board  if still concerned If we cant figure out your coverage youll still get cared for she said Whether we can figure out if well get paid for it thats a big question there
