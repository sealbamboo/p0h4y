Its something a picture could never prepare you for and loser or not this agonizing illness was infecting millions of people just  years ago But thankfully its a disease thats next on the cards for global eradication There is no treatment or vaccine Its eradication involves simple interventions such as clean water and sanitation and the use of community health teams explains Cairncross a water engineer by background and now professor of environmental health  People become infected with Guinea worm after drinking water contaminated with the larvae of the parasitic worm   typically in remote rural areas The larvae then grow in the host into adult worms over the course of one year at which point females burst out of their hosts foot or leg to lay eggs The eggs need to be laid in water and as people stand in their shallow dugout wells to collect their daily water supply or to relieve the terrible burning of the residing worm the worm seizes the opportunity and contaminates the village water supply in the process Its rarely fatal but patients often remain sick for several months meaning they cant work which impacts their income and the local economy The only treatment is the extraction of the worm from a patients leg which is then bandaged to enable recovery Cairncross has been involved with the global   since the early s when he joined UNICEF to target the disease in West Africa Guinea worm is extremely rural and is found in the poorest parts of Africa where health services simply dont reach he says Its a disease of poverty The US Centers for Disease Control CDC initiated GWEP in  off the back of the success of the smallpox eradication campaign Since the disease is solely spread by contaminated water the program was used as an indicator for the United Nations  International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade IDWSSD and largescale advocacy for the campaign began in  when the Carter Center got involved  is led by former US president Jimmy Carter who wanted to use his status to broker peace and fight disease worldwide Since  the center has operated with a mandate to resolve political conflict and combat disease Guinea worm factors in both Since  numbers have plummeted from  million cases across  countries in Asia and Africa to just  cases in  in four remaining countries  Chad Ethiopia Mali and South Sudan where the majority of cases lie The challenge now is finding those last cases because with eradication the nearer you get the harder it gets says Cairncross The cases left are either unreachable or forgotten he adds Guinea worm sometimes known as the fiery serpent is not on the radar of most Western governments especially with so few cases remaining worldwide causing the cost per case to increase dramatically  A milliondollar case search in Guinea once found only one case of the disease which had been imported says Cairncross But aside from these costs for surveillance the control of the disease itself is simple clean water and education It is a matter of education explains Dr Ernesto RuizTiben who directs the Carter Centers program  A crucial aspect of disease control is teaching locals to filter their water with basic nylon filters and to avoid standing in water when infected People are encouraged to strain water through nylon filters or even clothing material to remove the worms larvae before they drink it The shallow nature of the muddy watering holes people use means they frequently stand in them when collecting water  In the fight to educate the real progress has been made using local villagers The program pioneered the role of the community health worker who are now commonplace for a variety of global health programs  The extreme rural nature of Guinea worm means those leading the programs cannot be in the field enough to monitor the disease closely A large proportion of the control efforts are therefore run by local volunteers and community teams who act as surveillance units keep an ear out in their local village to see who may be infected and supply people with filters at water collection points  As communities learn about the worm and its life cycle they discover that they can get rid of it by themselves We give them the lessons but they do the work says RuizTiben Thats why it can be eradicated worldwide The intended date to reach eradication was  Previous targets were  then  now who knows explains Cairncross We need local government backing funding and commitment  The disease can also reemerge due to negligence and insecurity during conflict which is why the majority of cases now occur in South Sudan In  an outbreak occurred in Ghana due to government officials allowing a water supply to degrade and become infected Although cases are now few if left the disease can return and spread making the hunt for the last cases all the more important RuizTiben is determined to find these cases and remove the disease from our planet once and for all Well be standing until the last worm goes he concludes
