The number of people who use electronic cigarettes in the UK has tripled over the past two years to  million a health charity estimates It says just over half of current or exsmokers have now tried electronic cigarettes compared with  in   Ash surveyed more than  adult smokers A separate study found that most ecigarette users were using them to reduce smoking Use of   among people who have never smoked remains small at  Ash said Ash has commissioned a series of surveys on electronic cigarette use since  with the latest survey conducted in March Of those now estimated to be using electronic cigarettes around  are thought to be exsmokers and  million to be using them alongside normal cigarettes or tobacco Current smokers using the cigarettes regularly have risen from  in  to  in  When exsmokers were asked why they used electronic cigarettes  said they wanted help giving up smoking Among smokers  said wanted to reduce the amount of tobacco they smoked and  said they used ecigarettes to save money Deborah Arnott chief executive of Ash said The dramatic rise in use of electronic cigarettes over the past four years suggests that smokers are increasingly turning to these devices to help them cut down or quit smoking Significantly usage among nonsmokers remains negligible    Another study   which covers England has found that electronic cigarettes are overtaking the use of nicotine products such as patches and gum as an aid to quitting smoking It also found that the proportion of smokers who gave up smoking in the past year had increased and smoking rates in England were continuing to fall  Study leader Prof Robert West said Despite claims that use of electronic cigarettes risks renormalising smoking we found no evidence to support this view   On the contrary electronic cigarettes may be helping to reduce smoking as more people use them as an aid to quitting   Ms Arnott added While it is important to control the advertising of electronic cigarettes to make sure children and nonsmokers are not being targeted there is no evidence from our research that ecigarettes are acting as a gateway into smoking   Ashs survey suggests that most electronic cigarettes users or vapers use a rechargeable product with replaceable cartridges or a reservoir   Simon Clark director of Forest a group that supports smokers said it welcomed the rise of ecigarettes and was glad people had a choice of what to smoke But he suggested that most smokers using ecigarettes were experimenting with them rather than using them to give up smoking altogether We havent seen a significant fall in smokers Most smokers still find electronic cigarettes quite basic and it will take a few more years for the technology to improve
