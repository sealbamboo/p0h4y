Use of ADHD drugs continues to rise in the United States but the group whose use is increasing the most may come as a surprise young women An   of prescriptions filled from  to  through Express Scripts a pharmacy benefit management company found that use of ADHD medications rose  percent overall The companys database includes  million people with private insurance The medications largely stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall are still most commonly prescribed to boys ages  to  While childrens use of ADHD meds rose  percent adult use rose  percent To find out more about whats going on we talked with   a psychiatrist who is the vice president and national practice leader for neuroscience at Express Scripts This is an edited version of our conversation ADHD is no longer just a childhood condition Many of the children and adolescents who were diagnosed  years ago are now adults and we know that about  in  kids carry ADHD with them into adulthood I think thats one reason why the numbers in adults are going up And theres been progressively more attention on ADHD in the public sphere More adults recognize the symptoms Oh Im not concentrating Im not focusing Maybe I have ADHD Then theres overdiagnosis overtreatment and perhaps misuse Frankly many prescribers mistake a patients objective reporting of symptoms like being forgetful for ADHD Are there life stressors is there a medical condition is there depression or anxiety that explains this better Men are less likely to go to the doctor and take the meds and fill the meds Were thinking about the  yearold whos going off to college Theyre going to the doctor only once or twice a year Its been known for a long long time that if girls have ADHD they are more likely to have the inattention form not the hyperactive aggressive disruptive form Perhaps that difference in how ADHD can look is why the diagnosis is missed in girls They may be quietly suffering and having trouble in school but theyre not disruptive They move on into life where those inattentive symptoms may reveal themselves as academic and social pressures compound Now its becoming more of an issue And lastly we know that women in the United States are increasingly juggling more and more and more Women still tend to have the majority of the responsibilities at home particularly when families start up That elevation of pressure and stress can either produce symptoms like ADHD or that additional stress can express the underlying ADHD that previously had not been diagnosed There may be an element here of medication being prescribed offlabel to help with that as well as the desire to suppress appetite and lose weight Its totally not approved for that But its popularized and perhaps glorified to some extent in popular media including womens magazines Ive seen references to using these medications for weight loss I think were into the iceberg We forecast that use of ADHD medications will be  percent higher in five years Thats the main reason why Express Scripts decided to do this deeper analysis to see whats driving the trend If we see patterns from prescriptions that are coming in we can intervene if someone shouldnt be on this medication or if we suspect fraud Were beginning to put our brains around tightening those monitoring systems
