A rat with some human genes could provide a better way to test Alzheimers drugs The genetically modified rat is the first rodent model to exhibit the full range of brain changes found in Alzheimers researchers   in   Its a big step forward for drug development says   a program director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke or NINDS which helped fund the work The closer the model is to the human condition in representing the disease the more likely the drug will behave and cure the way it would in humans In recent years drug companies have developed several Alzheimers drugs that seemed to work in animals but   with the disease A lack of good animal models for Alzheimers may be one reason for those failures researchers say For the past couple of decades Alzheimers researchers have relied primarily on mice that carry human gene mutations that cause people to get the disease in their s or s Like people these mice develop socalled amyloid plaques in their brains But thats where the similarity ends In people with Alzheimers after plaques appear huge numbers of brain cells die Thats never happened in mice despite lots of genetic tinkering Corriveau says So researchers began to consider a different rodent model the rat Rats are  million to  million years closer evolutionarily to humans Corriveau says which means their brains are more like ours But early efforts to insert Alzheimers gene mutations into rats didnt work any better than with mice he says Then a group of scientists began studying a line of rats that are known to get some of the same health problems people do as they get older We thought that they would be sort of on the cusp of normal aging says   a professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Southern California And then if we added into that mix these mutant human genes that cause Alzheimers we might have a much better and much more full model of the human syndrome Once they inserted the mutant genes the rats began to develop plaques in their brains just like the mice had Town says But unlike the mice he says these rats also developed socalled tangles in their brain cells another hallmark of Alzheimers The big shocker came when we started counting numbers of neurons in their brains Town says It turns out that they lose up to about  or  percent of the neurons in brain regions that are classically associated with Alzheimers disease The rats also began to lose their ability to do mental tasks like navigate a maze And as the animals get older Town says they perform even worse much as you would see in a human being that would have these mutations Towns lab has already begun testing some potential Alzheimers drugs on the new rats And Town says hes already getting calls from other scientists who want to try the new rats in their labs
