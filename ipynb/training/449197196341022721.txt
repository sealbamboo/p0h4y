Lack of food is the leading cause of child death worldwide killing  million children each year and accounting for  percent of all child mortality Undernourished children who survive still face a daunting future including reduced intellectual capacity and a higher risk of disease and disability And while economic growth is presumed to get more children fed a booming economy alone doesnt fix the problem researchers say Childrens health isnt tracking with improvements in standard of living and economic growth according to   a social epidemiologist at Harvard University and the studys senior author Subramanian and his colleagues evaluated data from  low and middleincome countries collected from  to  Researchers looked at each countrys gross domestic product and the proportion of stunted underweight and wasted low weight for height children under  years old An increase in GDP per capita resulted in an insignificant decline in stunting And when the researchers compared the changes in GDP to the changes in the number of wasting and underweight children there was no correlation at all It wasnt that the association was just weak or small Subramanian told Shots That was the case he said especially for stunting More striking was the fact that the effect overall was just practically zero He says things like unequal income distribution and lack of efficient implementation of public services are possible causes The  were published Thursday in the journal   Countries that grow economically tend to invest the money back into sectors that led to the growth in the first place Subramanian says Consider India where the tourism industry plays an important role in the countrys economy and is a rapidly growing sector I see dramatic improvements in fourlane roads  airports getting fancier which helps people like me when Im traveling he says However for the majority of the population I dont see improvements for the slums that I pass through every day where I lived UNICEF did report   in overall child nutrition in  but with the number of undernourished children still in the hundreds of millions and with progress slow in the poorest parts of the world Subramanian says we havent made a huge dent for sure The latest UNICEF   indicates that among children ages  and younger over a quarter were stunted  percent underweight and  percent wasted in  with numbers highest in subSaharan Africa and South Asia The solution starts with understanding how a child becomes malnourished Subramanian says One way is through food insecurity both in access to food and the nutrients in the food available Another is lack of sanitation and clean water Both lead to higher incidence of disease which in turn stunts a childs growth We do know that these factors that actually directly affect undernutrition causally have not improved a heck of a lot in these countries  despite economic growth says Subramanian
