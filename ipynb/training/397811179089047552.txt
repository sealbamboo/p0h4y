Most sore throats arent strep But because strep bacteria can in rare cases cause rheumatic fever people often feel like they should get tested for possible strep infection It might be possible to skip that step someday by checking whether your neighbors have been getting   researchers say Aside from reducing the cost and inconvenience of needless clinic visits the neighborhood strep check could reduce the risk of being needlessly treated with antibiotics Streptococccal infections are contagious so it makes sense that the more people in the area who are infected the more likely that a sore throat could be strep But only about  to  percent of sore throats in children are caused by strep and that numbers even smaller in adults So researchers at Boston Childrens Hospital decided to investigate if using the actual numbers of people with strep throat could be used to predict the likelihood of one person being infected They did that by working backward looking at data from visits to CVS MinuteClinics in six states They noted the symptoms of people who came in with sore throats and whether or not they had a positive strep test That gave them  visits for people age  and older Serious number crunching ensured The researchers also had to come up with a list of symptoms that a person could diagnose themselves A nurse or doctor typically asks people if they have fever a cough or other cold symptoms In an exam they also look at the patients throat and see if lymph nodes in the neck are swollen Asking people about just two symptoms  fever and lack of cough  is the most important Combining that information with an odds ratio based on the number of strep cases in the area in the past two weeks predicted the likelihood that someone would actually test positive for strep about as well as scoring systems used by clinicians If this formula could be turned into a test that people could do on the phone or online the researchers estimate about  doctor visits could be avoided each year for people who have a low risk of strep Patients with higher scores might be told to come in for a physical exam and possibly testing as would patients whose symptoms worsened after the first analysis But the test isnt perfect About  people with strep throat who would have gotten antibiotics based on an inoffice test wouldnt have been diagnosed using the stayathome formula the report says And this system isnt yet available in a smartphone app or available at all Right now its more useful as evidence that big chunks of health data that are increasingly available from electronic medical records or crowdsourced databases may have practical applications rather than just for medical research Even the number of   for flu symptoms are accurate predictors of disease spread researchers have found The   were published online in   Last year the Infectious Disease Society of America  its recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of strep in children and adults Bottom line sore throats that are accompanied by cold symptoms such as coughs and stuffy noses are almost certainly viral and dont need to be tested
