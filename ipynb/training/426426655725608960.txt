Today two decades down the road clean eating or eating clean is a major movement spurred by people from all walks of life who want to feel good about what theyre putting in their bodies  When I asked via Twitter What does clean eating mean to you I received a variety of replies from simply eating fresh fruits and veggies to not eating anything artificial  Over the years Ive honed my personal definition of what it means to eat clean and while Im sure it will continue to evolve heres my current take on what this philosophy which Im a huge fan of is all about This one is pretty straightforward  instead of a banana nut muffin eat a banana and some nuts The primary principle of eating clean is to replace processed foods with fresh and natural foods To me this means foods that havent had anything added to them and havent had anything valuable taken away  So even if youre not growing quinoa in your back yard you can buy this whole grain in the bulk section of your market or in a box where the only ingredient is quinoa and only quinoa Thats a far cry from a refined grain thats been stripped of its fiberrich bran outer skin and nutritious germ the inner part that sprouts into a new plant bleached and doctored up with preservatives I dont think its realistic to never eat anything that comes out of a jar box or bag but when you do the very first thing a clean eater looks at is the ingredient list Reading it is the only way to really know whats in your food and choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible  For example I was once at the market with a client who was on a mission to clean up her diet She said I bet crackers are out of the question right My response was Lets look at the ingredients  I picked up one of my favorite brands which are made with organic short grain brown rice organic whole quinoa organic pumpkin seeds organic sunflower seeds organic brown flax seeds organic brown sesame seeds organic poppyseeds filtered water sea salt organic sea weed organic black pepper organic herbs  all real and recognizable ingredients a list that practically reads like a recipe I could recreate in my own kitchen  We then checked out her usual brand made with among other things sodium acid pyrophosphate monocalcium phosphate and TBHQ short for tertiary butylhydroquinone Dumfounded she said I saw reduced fat on the box and assumed it was OK I never even thought about reading the ingredients  Bingo Clean eating is about focusing on quality first and not letting terms like zero trans fat low sodium or sugar free fool you into thinking that a processed food is healthy   In addition to reading ingredient lists so you can ditch products made with artificial additives including flavors sweeteners colors and preservatives clean eating is about steering clear of foods made from genetically modified organisms and those treated with hormones and antibiotics and going organic when possible to reduce foods grown with manmade pesticides and fertilizers  In my opinion clean eating considers how these issues affect you as well as how they influence the planet and their bearing on a sustainable food supply In other words in addition to choosing not to pollute your body with substances that serve no biological purpose clean eating is also about connecting the dots regarding how food production impacts issues like the rise in antibioticresistant bacteria algae blooms and dead zones in our oceans and the effects of substances like BPA on our metabolisms  This is why clean eating is a movement not a trend One aspect of clean eating I really love is replacing packaged foods with homemade versions from salad dressing to energy bars and everything in between I call it retrotarian eating because it harkens back to a time before things like frozen chicken nuggets existed and many of the doityourself substitutes are very simple  For example when I make a stir fry instead of buying a premade sauce laden with sodium sugar and preservatives I whisk together a little brown rice vinegar fresh squeezed citrus juice minced garlic and fresh grated ginger  These days you can find a clean recipe for just about anything including fiveingredient ice cream and old school food trends like homemade baby food and pickling veggies in Mason jars are making major comebacks   To me part of eating clean is thinking of food as preventative medicine After all the phrase you are what you eat is literally true so being thoughtful about your food just makes sense  Nutrients create the foundation for the structure and function of every cell in your body and because your body is in a continuous state of maintenance and repair the health and functioning of your cells is directly determined by what youve been eating  Whole natural foods provide the building blocks that go to work to uphold your muscles bones organs immune system and hormones So cleaning up your diet is a lot like starting to build and support your body with the highest quality raw materials  For these reasons Ive seen a commitment to clean eating truly transform my clients lives from clearer glowing skin and shinier hair to more energy better mood and sleep quality clearer thinking less aches and pains and even a greater sex drive  And if they slip back into old patterns they really feel the effects After going on a trip relying on processed road food for a long weekend and feeling like a zombie one client couldnt wait to get back to eating clean And when she did her bloating fatigue and apathy disappeared Pretty powerful So if youre just getting started begin by pulling out the foods in your fridge freezer and cupboards reading the ingredients and cleaning house no pun intended
