The three scientists who   this years Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine all made discoveries that illuminate how the bodys cells communicate The research has sweeping implications for our understanding of how nerves in the brain transmit signals how the immune system attacks pathogens and how hormones like insulin get into the bloodstream Bioengineers have already harnessed the discoveries to manufacture new vaccines and improve the quality of insulin for diabetics The winners include two Americans  James Rothman of Yale University and Randy Schekman of the University of California Berkeley  and the Germanborn Thomas Suedhof of Stanford University Both Schekman and Suedhof are also investigators at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Their discoveries took place over the course of  years The work got its start with a few simple experiments in cells of yeast  the same organism that leavens bread and brews beer In the s biologists already knew that cells werent just sacks of fluid Rather they contain sophisticated highway systems that shuttle material from one compartment to the next This cargo moves around cells in bubblelike compartments called   In a healthy cell some of these vesicles make their way to the cells surface where the material is released outside the cell Thats one way that cells communicate with each other and with organs in the body In    a new professor at the University of California Berkeley had recently found mutant yeast cells that had faulty transport systems The cargo just piled up at the cells surface like cars stuck in a traffic jam By figuring out which genes were defective in these yeasts Schekman discovered dozens of components that built and controlled the cells transport system But there were still many pieces missing In particular it wasnt known how a cargo vesicle knows   to go on the cells surface and then   to dump out its contents Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who are traveling around hundreds of miles of streets How are they going to find the right way Where will the bus stop and open its doors so that people can get out Nobel committee secretary Goran Hansson said Monday There are similar problems in the cell to find the right way  and out to the surface of the cell Take for instance two neurons in your brain One neuron communicates with another by secreting   such as dopamine and serotonin But a neuron must release the neurotransmitter at a particular place  and at the right time Otherwise the message will never make it to the second neuron or the signal will get scrambled Thats where Rothman and Suedhofs research comes in In the s and s   now  figured out that a signal on the vesicles surface that helps it dock at just the right place on the cells surface The process works a bit like a zipper A protein on the vesicle zips up with another one on the cells membrane to position the cargo in the correct location Then a few years later   who is now  identified the trigger mechanism that dumps the neurotransmitter outside the cell at just the right time by unzipping the two proteins This transport system has served as the foundation of modern cell biology and neuroscience And breakdowns of the process is involved in a vast range of diseases including Alzheimers cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophies and some autoimmune disorders
