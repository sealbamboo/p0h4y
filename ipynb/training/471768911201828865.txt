Theres new evidence that an oral cholera vaccine might help stop an epidemic in its tracks Thats the encouraging message from a study that tested a twodose vaccine during a  outbreak in Guinea The virus was  percent effective in preventing immediate infection of a   that afflicts up to five million people a year and kills around  Earlier studies looked at the protectiveness of oral cholera vaccines over a twotofive year span This is the first time a vaccine has been tested as a way to stop transmission in the shortterm The   used   which costs  a dose making it the cheapest of three oral cholera vaccines on the market Its a daunting task to deliver two doses of a vaccine in the space of two weeks in the midst of a public health emergency But thats what health care workers did More than  doses were administered in the  outbreak The study in this weeks   examined the outcome in two coastal territories where the outbreak was most severe and cholera victims are often too far from clinics that could offer timely care Researchers compared the number of cholera cases in a group of  people who got two doses of Shanchol and  who did not receive the vaccine The number of participants would have been bigger one author says if the vaccine hadnt been so effective The best proof is that in areas where people were vaccinated there were no ongoing cases of cholera after vaccination Rebecca Grais told Shots Grais is with   the research arm of Doctors Without Borders which funded the study along with the Guinean Ministry of Health She said that as part of the study local people received clean water and sanitation and cholera victims were treated I hope this will dispel some of the myths about the use of oral cholera vaccine so it can be included in the arsenal of responses to outbreaks Grais says Those myths she says include the concern that vaccination in the midst of an epidemic will detract from other triedandtrue responses such as clean water sanitation and treatment and the worry that the vaccine wouldnt protect fast enough to make a difference In particular Grais hopes the study will accelerate plans by the World Health Organization to mount an   in South Sudan where nearly  people are living in temporary displacedpersons camps in unsanitary conditions The study was too small however to answer another important question How effective is a single dose of vaccine in place of two More research is also needed on the vaccines safety and effectiveness for pregnant women and children under  months old Meanwhile efforts are increasing to make cholera vaccination a real option for stricken countries The WHO recently established a stockpile of the vaccine that contains two million doses and the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization has pledged  million doses over the next five years But the world will need millions more doses say Drs   and   two Haitian physicians who authored a   on the shifting response to cholera that accompanies the new study
