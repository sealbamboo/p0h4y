Diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in her early s Kris Hallenga is determined the disease is not seen as something that affects only older women Through her charity CoppaFeel she is fighting to raise awareness of breast cancer in young people  I dont think Ill ever forget the minor details of that day says Kris Hallenga The weather was beautiful I can remember exactly what I wore  this miniskirt with tights My mum said it was way too short but I wore it anyway  The doctor just walked into this tiny little room and in a roundabout way just spat out the fact that I had breast cancer says Hallenga A week after the diagnosis scans revealed the cancer had spread to her spine   That was five years ago when Hallenga was  I had stage four cancer there is no stage five I know the drugs can stop working at any time so until then Ive got a lot of living to do   is used by doctors to describe the size of the tumour and the extent to which the disease has spread  At stage one the cancer tends to be smaller and contained within the area it started in By stage four the cancer can be any size and has spread to another area of the body Hallenga discovered she had metastatic or advanced breast cancer in  after a late diagnosis  That was end of innocence really says her mother Jane  All of a sudden you have to realise and start fighting against whats been handed to you this fate Hallenga says she will never know whether she would now be free of breast cancer if she had been diagnosed earlier The cancer has since spread to her pelvis liver and hips and she also has a tumour in her brain She has hospital visits every month body scans every three months and takes a range of medication to help slow the spread of the disease When I was diagnosed I read that my life expectancy was just two and a half years Thanks to treatment Im still here five years later but so is my cancer says Hallenga She is determined that other young people should be trained to spot the early warning signs of the disease and check their breasts regularly  A month after her diagnosis Hallenga set up a charity called CoppaFeel with her twin sister Maren to help raise awareness at schools and music festivals about the importance of early diagnosis The chance of developing breast cancer before the age of  is around   which increases to one in  or  before the age of   One in three women diagnosed with breast cancer in England is aged over  Although the risk of getting the disease does increase with age some studies suggest the types of breast cancer diagnosed in younger women   Therefore survival rates can be lower for younger women with breast cancer than for those in their s or s  In   of women in England aged  were alive five years after diagnosis compared with  of females aged  The earlier the diagnosis the less chance the cancer will have spread to another part of the body Approximately   with stage four or advanced tumours live for more than  years compared with  of women with stage one breast cancers Young women who have been diagnosed late after an emergency referral often contact Hallenga for advice and support She has come to see herself as a voice for those who are going through the same thing Her family however wish she would just sometimes take a break  Shes like this superwoman who is taking on the world trying to save lives trying to beat this cancer says her sister Maren I think sometimes she just needs to have a good cry about it or just get angry about it  According to Kris Hallenga there is no real respite when living with advanced cancer  You can never predict whats going to happen from one day to the next and you can never say Oh Im fine Im in remission none of that exists This is incurable and its going to happen at some stage I just wish it happens a few million years in the future or never says Hallenga However she is making the most of everything in her life and says that every day she enjoys and is grateful for is another level of acceptance Cancer has given me a life and given meaning to what I do with my life   Id really hope and like to think that I would have that same appreciation of life even if I didnt have cancer but this has just made it all the more important As she stresses on her   she does not want to be described by anyone as fighting suffering or battling She would rather be known as simply living  will be broadcast on Wednesday  March at  GMT on BBC Three Or catch up later on
