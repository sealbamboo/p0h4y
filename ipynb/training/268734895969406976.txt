A robotic suit that gives the wearer superhuman powers sounds like the stuff of science fiction But technology like that is making the leap from fantasy to reality Though much of the gear is still experimental the equipment is giving some paraplegics a chance to walk again Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Nashville Tenn for instance have developed a robotic exoskeleton that straps over paralyzed limbs With crutches paraplegics can stand walk and even climb stairs Its really a lot like a leggedSegway says   an engineer at Vanderbilt and head of the exoskeleton project You lean forward to walk forward lean less forward and cause it to stop lean back and cause it to sit The researchers have tested the model with patients at the   an Atlanta hospital that specializes in spinal cord and brain injuries And the developers have licensed their model to   a maker of industrial equipment which aims to get a product on the market by  Other companies are working on exoskeletonstyle devices too including   of Berkeley Calif   in Israel and   in New Zealand The Ekso device and Argos exoskeleton called ReWalk are only available in rehabilitation centers and hospitals in the US for now To move wearable robots like these from hospital to home will require approval from the US Food and Drug Administration And   to show there are health benefits for the exoskeletons are already under way What we really are selling until we have clinical proofs is a gadget   Eksos CEO tells   How do these contraptions work The Vanderbilt model is powered by four motors  one at each hip and knee joint  that are controlled by two microcomputers With crutches for balance users lean forward to stand up and control their steps with hip placement To take a step with their right foot they shift their weight onto their right hip The battery lasts for about two hours of continuous walking The   and Ekso devices employ similar but slightly different designs ReWalk uses a wrist band to control movement and   includes a control pad to adjust various walking factors The Rex exoskeleton is heavier  pounds but it stabilizes the body leaving the hands free The Vanderbilt device incorporates electrodes that are affixed to the skin and tell a persons muscles when to contract and relax to move the device When the users legs get tired the motors kick in based on an adaptive computer algorithm that Goldfarbs team developed It looks at what you did during your last few steps and it alters from person to person and within a person from day to day and hour to hour explains Goldfarb The companies want to take their devices mainstream But the prices are high Eksos rehab model runs  plus a  yearly service fee The ReWalk devices costs  Argo plans to submit a personal version of ReWalk expected price around  for FDA clearance by the end of the year Until the devices receive the regulatory stamp of approval from the FDA its unclear how much insurance companies would cover says Vanderbilts Goldfarb Most companies have models for everyday personal use in the works but none have received FDAs OK yet All these systems are designed differently says   an engineer at the University of Houston in Texas We dont know which system is best for whom Developers hope to tailor exoskeletons for those suffering from paralysis due to stroke or muscular dystrophy as well Regulatory hurdles aside the next technological step is controlling the robot with the mind ContrerasVidal has already developed a cap that measures brain signals and translates them into instructions for the Rex exoskeleton By augmenting these exoskeletons we can reach a larger population says ContrerasVidal At the same time we can learn more about how the brain works
