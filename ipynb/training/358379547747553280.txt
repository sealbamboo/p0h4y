When it comes to providing health care for an aging nation the bad news is no longer news We already   and other professionals  nurses social workers pharmacists aides  trained to care for the elderly and the shortage is projected to increase The good news confirmed by   in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is that nurse practitioners can markedly improve the quality of care for older patients Say you have recently begun to experience troubling urinary incontinence Your primary care doctor should offer you behaviorallifestyle treatment like Kegel exercises which men as well as women can do So says an evidencebased practice model called ACOVE  developed to help guide health professionals through complex geriatric conditions How closely care hews to the models recommendations is expressed as a percentage Its like a report card said Dr David Reuben director of geriatrics at the University of California Los Angeles and lead author of the new study Behavioral treatments not drugs should be the first line of defense against incontinence he said because for most people its been shown over and over that its at least as effective and without the side effects In his teams study of  people over age  patients with incontinence at two primary care practices were either seen by a physician alone or managed jointly by a primary care doctor and a nurse practitioner What percentage were treated according to the ACOVE  quality indicators The report card please Of the patients seen only by a physician not one was told about Kegel exercises or other nondrug methods for reducing incontinence Of the patients treated by a physician and a nurse practitioner  percent were offered nondrug approaches The UCLA researchers looked at four common conditions urinary incontinence falls depression and dementia All four tend to receive lousy scores on ACOVE report cards meaning patients with those conditions receive a small percentage of the recommended assessments and treatments  even though they are problems with serious consequences People who fall break hips Dr Reuben said People with incontinence are limited in going out and participating in social life These are major reasons for institutionalization When it came to treating depression patients seeing a doctor and a nurse practitioner received about the same care as those treated by doctors alone In both groups patients received  percent to  percent of recommended care But when patients showed up with one of the other three conditions the addition of nurse practitioners meant much higher scores Patients who saw a nurse practitioner along with a doctor received  percent of the recommended assessments and treatments for falls compared with  percent for those who only saw a doctor  percent for dementia versus  percent and  percent for incontinence versus a particularly dismal  percent The nurse practitioners may have paid more attention Dr Reuben said because managing these conditions was their job They were focused on it and they had the time to do it comprehensively And these were general nurse practitioners not those specializing in geriatrics  a track being phased out nationally in favor of a supposedly more integrated adult nursepractitioner program Before readers accuse me of physicianbashing let Dr Reuben explain the benefits of the team approach There are certain things doctors do well certain things they dont do well certain things nurse practitioners do better he said He added that he sympathized with primary care doctors working with elderly patients who have many chronic conditions The job is too big Its too complicated Theres too much to do In the case of incontinence explaining behavioral treatment takes considerable time What doctor seeing  patients in one morning is going to be able to sit down and explain Kegel exercises Dr Reuben said Its just not going to happen So adding nurse practitioners to the mix sounds like a smart response especially given how many more geriatric patients the health care system will have to handle in coming years But back to the bad news This was hardly the first study to demonstrate the advantages of teams in geriatric care yet professional territoriality and mistrust have prevented much progress Getting physicians to delegate is a huge issue Dr Reuben said In fact a number of physicians participating in this study would not refer their patients to the nurse practitioners When are we going to learn to acknowledge and appreciate the skills and abilities of each member of the health care team asked Dr Barbara Resnick a gerontologist at the University of Maryland in   accompanying the study Maybe not soon In May the New England Journal of Medicine reported the results of a mail survey of  physicians and  nurse practitioners which revealed starkly different opinions on the nurse practitioners role Do doctors provide higherquality examinations and consultations than nurse practitioners during the same kind of primary care visitÂ   Threequarters of the nurse practitioners said no The realm of aging and caregiving contains so many questions we cant yet answer and problems we dont know how to solve We cant cure Alzheimers disease or even say what causes it But we know how to use nurse practitioners to improve geriatric care We just dont
