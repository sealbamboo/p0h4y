Sleep is essential for good health as we all know But a new study hints that there may be an easy but unrealized way to augment its virtues lower the thermostat Cooler bedrooms could subtly transform a persons stores of brown fat  what has lately come to be thought of as good fat  and consequently alter energy expenditure and metabolic health even into daylight hours Until recently most scientists thought that adults had no brown fat But in the past few years scanty deposits  teaspoonfuls really  of the tissue have been detected in the necks and upper backs in many adults This is important because brown fat unlike the more common white stuff is metabolically active Experiments with mice have shown that it takes sugar out of the bloodstream to burn calories and maintain core temperature A similar process seems to take place in humans For the new study   researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health persuaded five healthy young male volunteers to sleep in climatecontrolled chambers at the NIH for four months The men went about their normal lives during the days then returned at  every evening All meals including lunch were provided to keep their caloric intakes constant They slept in hospital scrubs under light sheets For the first month the researchers kept the bedrooms at  degrees considered a neutral temperature that would not prompt moderating responses from the body The next month the bedrooms were cooled to  degrees a temperature that the researchers expected might stimulate brownfat activity but not shivering which usually begins at more frigid temperatures The following month the bedrooms were reset to  degrees to undo any effects from the chillier room and for the last month the sleeping temperature was a balmy  degrees Throughout the subjects bloodsugar and insulin levels and daily caloric expenditures were tracked after each month the amount of brown fat was measured The cold temperatures it turned out changed the mens bodies noticeably Most striking after four weeks of sleeping at  degrees the men had almost doubled their volumes of brown fat Their insulin sensitivity which is affected by shifts in blood sugar improved The changes were slight but meaningful says Francesco S Celi the studys senior author and now a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University These were all healthy young men to start with he says but just by sleeping in a colder room they gained metabolic advantages that could over time he says lessen their risk for diabetes and other metabolic problems The men also burned a few more calories throughout the day when their bedroom was chillier although not enough to result in weight loss after four weeks The metabolic enhancements were undone after four weeks of sleeping at  degrees in fact the men then had less brown fat than after the first scan The message of these findings Celi says is that you can almost effortlessly tweak your metabolic health by turning down the bedroom thermostat a few degrees His own bedroom is moderately chilled as is his office  which has an added benefit It keeps meetings short
