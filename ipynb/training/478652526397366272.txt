Twentytwo states and the District of Columbia now have laws allowing for some form of medical marijuana Florida appears poised to join the club Polls show that voters there are likely to approve a November ballot measure legalizing marijuana for medical use If it passes regulations that would set up a market for medical marijuana in Florida are still at least a year away But cannabis entrepreneurs from around the country are already setting up shop in the state In Miami Fort Lauderdale Tampa and Orlando theres a business conference every few weeks devoted to a product thats still illegal There are a lot of names for marijuana but in the industry they mostly call it cannabis Tom Quigley runs a group called the   Dont confuse that with the Florida Medical Cannabis Association or the Medical Marijuana Business Association of Florida just three of the dozens of groups started in the months since it became clear that the marijuana measure was moving ahead While the vote is months away there are many who see Floridas impending embrace of medical marijuana as an opportunity thats too good to miss Quigley greeted about  of them at his conference in Orlando We cant teach you in one day how to run a cannabis industry business but what we can do is bring the best information to you Quigley says There were seminars on cultivating the best strains converting cannabis into oils and concentrates and on marketing and legal issues Since California became the first state to approve medical marijuana in   other states have followed suit If Florida approves it it will be the first state in the Southeast to do so And with nearly  million residents it will be the biggest market outside of California The National Cannabis Industry Association estimates medical marijuana will be a  million industry in Florida  one that Quigley says will have all kinds of economic opportunities If you want to become a bud tender that works inside one of these dispensaries as an occupation if you want to run your own business theres that opportunity as well Quigley says Right now in Florida the cannabis industry is mostly talk But money is lining up as well Quigley is with ArcView an investors group that funds cannabis industry startups CannabisRX a real estate company based in Arizona is also active here investing in properties it plans to sell or lease to growers and operators of dispensaries We look at light industrial commercial buildings that are in the right zoned areas of the cities says Llorn Kylo CEO of   And we usually seek between  and about  square feet Along with real estate CannabisRX also offers budding entrepreneurs financing and consulting services to help them get their businesses off the ground At the Orlando conference Meg Sanders of   a grower with three dispensaries in Colorado flew in from Denver Sanders says shes always looking for opportunities to expand  including in Florida For us weve worked very hard to create a fantastic template of what we do And if theres opportunity in other states well definitely be there at the table says Sanders Its unclear exactly what opportunities will arise in Florida If the medical marijuana amendment passes the state wont issue regulations for another six months to a year Floridas governor recently signed into law a very limited version of medical marijuana  one that allows production and sale only of a special strain thats low in THC As part of that law just five nurseries will be allowed to grow it They have to be large operations that have been in business in Florida for at least  years Chris Rumph a prospective entrepreneur at the conference says that regulation has many wondering how welcoming Florida officials will be to the emerging cannabis industry Opening up to nurseries that have been around  years I think thats kind of silly says Rumph We live in a state where weve got thousands of nurseries with people that are very educated and knowledgeable about plants and how to grow things effectively So theres a little bit of suspicion there for me How the medical marijuana regulations will be written though is for the future For activists and entrepreneurs the first task is mobilizing Florida voters to actually approve the medical marijuana amendment
