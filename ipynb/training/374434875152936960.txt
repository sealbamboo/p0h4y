Israel is in the midst of a massive emergency immunization drive of all children under the age of  against polio Why Health workers detected the virus in southern Israel in February Since then theyve found it in  different sewage samples across the country the   said Wednesday Yet so far no children have gotten sick or been paralyzed by the virus Israel has one of the highest rates of   immunization coverage in the world says Chris Maher of the World Health Organization And thats one reason why the country has avoided polio cases so far But health officials are still very concerned about the situation The vaccination campaign aims to give polio boosters to a million children Theres no way that  percent of the population can be immune at any given time Maher says So any time that virus is circulating in the environment if theres a person whos not immune theres a risk that that person is going to get clinical polio Theyre going to get infected and theyre going to get sick Israels last polio case was reported in  and the WHO declared the country poliofree in  The fact that the virus is being found across a wide geographic area in Israel shows that it has reestablished a foothold in the country Maher says and that its reproducing in the community The situation in Israel is a significant one because it represents an area of circulation in a world that really doesnt have very much polio anymore he says Last year there were only  recorded polio cases on the planet And they were in remote areas around Nigeria Afghanistan and Pakistan This year there have been  cases   so far with  of them occurring in    a country that had been poliofree since  Genetic testing of the polio samples from Israel shows that the virus recently came to the Middle East from Pakistan Exactly how it got there  by boat plane truck or bus  is unclear But what is known is that the virus can   inside someones intestines without making that person sick and then escape into a new environment Theres concern that the virus circulating in Israel may spill out of the country says Emory Universitys   who has worked extensively on polio Theres enough virus circulating in Israel that it could get out of that area in to other countries Orenstein says To ensure the entire community is protected against polio Israel has started using the oral vaccine instead of the injectable one The oral vaccine contains a weakened live form of the poliovirus which can spread through the environment and help immunize kids that dont get vaccinated Getting rid of polio flareups like the one in Israel right now is a crucial part of eradicating polio globally Orenstein says Although eradication efforts are focused on the remaining reservoirs in Nigeria Afghanistan and Pakistan he says the rest of world cant let its guard down against the disease Weve got polio down The issue now is to knock it out he says That will give us global security that never again will this disease cripple our children or our adults
