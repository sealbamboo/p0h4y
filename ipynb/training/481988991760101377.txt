There is fierce debate about the role of added sugar in contributing to the obesity crisis  UK government scientists today   of added sugar people should eat each day And the World Health Organization has also said people   of their daily calories from the sweet stuff  But calculating how much sugar we eat is not as simple as it sounds  Sugar is sugar  right Not quite Health professionals take a dim view of sugars added to processed food but say that naturally occurring sweetness in milk and fruit is largely fine with the exception of juice  Current advice says no more than  of a persons daily food calories should come from added sugars or  once alcohol is taken into account  That works out at about g of sugars for a woman and g for a man depending on how active they are And its this level which has just been halved in a   by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition  But look at the back of a food packet and youll see a guideline amount for total sugars  including those naturally occurring in fruit and other ingredients  While there is no UK government health guideline for total sugars the   on labelling in Britain and across the EU  That g equates to more than  small g teaspoons of sugar  Some sugar content is easy to work out a ml can of regular CocaCola or Pepsi contains g  or almost nine teaspoons of sugar all of it added But a ready meal of sweet and sour chicken can also contain more than g or fiveandahalf teaspoons some of which is naturally occurring in the pineapple And just to confuse things further packaging previously showed guideline daily amounts GDA for men women and children but this has been    which under European legislation can only be shown for adults  Reference intakes are not the same as dietary reference values DRVs which are what health professionals use when calculating added sugars  taking us back to the   Its nigh on impossible for people to work out how much added sugars they are consuming says nutritionist Katharine Jenner of campaign group Action on Sugar  All methods of assessing a populations food intake have their limitations Anyone who has tried to keep a food diary knows how difficult it is to remember every morsel consumed from office biscuits to the kids leftovers However the National Diet and Nutrition Survey is the most complete probing of the UKs eating habits   The latest NDNS report found that all age groups were eating more added sugar technically known as nonmilk extrinsic sugars than the  level but that children were exceeding it to the greatest degree  Young people aged  get the most of their daily energy from sweet stuff at more than  Adults are more measured just nudging over    Soft drinks are the biggest single source of added sugar for young people with boys aged  getting  of their intake this way  Sweets chocolate and jams made up another  of childrens sugar intake and younger children also get a large proportion of their sugar from cereals  including cakes and biscuits  and drinks including fruit juice    For adults aged  the main sources are also confectionery and jams soft drinks and cereals Alcohol adds another   Scientists are still investigating whether there are direct causal links between high sugar intake and weight gain type  diabetes heart disease and other illnesses  What is known is that eating too many calories without enough exercise can lead to obesity  and obesity is a risk factor for other conditions  Latest figures show obesity in England climbing over recent decades before levelling off   Among young children the proportion who are obese has fallen but campaigners say   to reduce the amount of sugar children eat
