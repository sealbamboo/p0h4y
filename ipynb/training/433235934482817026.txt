Energy drinks tend to get a bad rap The Food and Drug Administration has investigated reports of deaths and   linked to them Hospitals have reported   And on Capitol Hill last summer senators   about marketing to kids But when it comes to caffeine intake teenagers seem to be getting far more caffeine from coffee drinks A   published in the journal   finds that  and yearolds are consuming almost double the amount of caffeine from coffee compared with a decade earlier And increasingly younger tweens and teens ages  are getting more caffeine from coffee too It was a surprise researcher   of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us about the uptick in coffee Shes the lead author of the paper which compared consumption in  and  But interestingly Branum says that over that time period caffeine consumption overall has remained about the same So does this mean adolescents must be drinking less of other types of caffeinated drinks Turns out yes Consumption of caffeinated sodas like Coke and Pepsi is down about  percent among older teens And while energy drink consumption did increase during the period Branum and her colleagues found that the drinks account for just a small sliver of overall caffeine consumption Among  and yearolds its less than  percent of their caffeine consumption Collegeaged young adults ages  to  appear to be the more regular consumers of energy drinks but theyre still only getting about  percent of their caffeine from this source Now as weve   adolescents are not always aware of how much caffeine theyre drinking Especially when theyre new to the coffee habit The Center for Science in the Public Interest took a look at several popular items and analyzed their caffeine content It   that a ounce cup of coffee from Starbucks contains about  milligrams of caffeine which is roughly five times as much as a ounce can of Diet Coke And   from the University of Florida show just how much caffeine variation there can be in coffee drinks Other interesting findings from the   study
