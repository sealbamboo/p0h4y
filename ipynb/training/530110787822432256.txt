The kids are asleep and Ive settled into a comfy armchair in the corner of my New England living room one of my favorite spots for shopping online Ive got my laptop open and Im ready to search for a bone density test Really Im calm but this is a seismic moment In most of the country it is still nearly impossible to compare the price and quality of anything in health care Ten years ago I tried filing Freedom of Information Act requests to get this information and got nothing Occasionally sources would leak me spreadsheets from one hospital or another Websites that mine such data are   to fill the void revealing price tags on everything from an office visit to a cesarean section But thanks to a law enacted in October Massachusetts health insurers now have to make all their prices public  in advance This is a very big deal says   undersecretary for consumer affairs in Massachusetts Were letting the light shine in The online tools also calculate   cost based on your plan Anthonys office has launched an ad campaign urging patients to shop around She says doctors and hospitals are becoming frequent users of the online cost tools too Theyre already saying I dont want to be the highest priced provider on your website  I thought I was lower than my competitors Thats exactly the kind of reaction we want to see she says Its key to getting at why one hospital charges three four or five times more than its competitors she says and to seeing if exposing these differences will drive down prices Im just talking about sensible rational pricing Anthony says and right now health prices are anything but that Take for example the cost in Boston of an MRI of the upper back which the numbers show can range from  to  That to me is a very big range says Sue Amsel who oversees the shopping   at the insurer   In this case the most expensive MRI is at Boston Childrens Hospital  and the option of lowest cost is at New England Baptist a hospital that specializes in orthopedics The total cost of most surgeries is not yet available but Amsel says you can now search for hundreds of tests procedures and office visits Its eyeopening she says Im always surprised at the difference between providers Now most of us dont have a strong incentive to shop We pay the same  or  copay no matter where we get an MRI But more and more people have highdeductible plans says Amsel where patients pay the full cost of an office visit or test up to the amount of their deductible The benefits not just in getting to choose Amsel says Its primarily for getting you the information about whatever youre having done so you can plan for it After spending a lot of time window shopping for common tests I have some tips There are no uniform prices they vary from one insurer to the next And you have to read the fine print on these sites to know what is and is not included in the dollar figure youll see online
