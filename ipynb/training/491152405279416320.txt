No one likes it when a new drug in peoples medicine cabinets turns out to have problems  just remember the Vioxx debacle a decade ago when the painkiller was removed from the market over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attack and stroke To do a better job of spotting unforeseen risks and side effects the Food and Drug Administration is trying something new  and theres a decent chance that it involves your medical records Its called   and its a  million government project to actively go out and look for adverse events linked to marketed drugs This pilot program is able to mine huge databases of medical records for signs that drugs may be linked to problems The usual system for monitoring the safety of marketed drugs has   It largely relies on voluntary   from doctors pharmacists and just plain folks who took a drug and got a bad outcome We get about a million reports a year that way says   the director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research But those are random They are whatever people choose to send us Figuring out from those reports if a drug is really to blame for the symptom isnt easy And if the side effect is something common such as a rash or a stroke there might not even be any reports because doctors might not connect a patients symptoms to the drug We need a rapid way to find out whats happening with drugs especially safety of drugs after theyre approved and on the market says Woodcock Thats why the FDA is turning to workers at the operations center of MiniSentinel which is located in a brick office building near Fenway Park in Boston Here people in cubicles can send out queries to  data partners that include health plans and insurance companies Their health records include nearly  million Americans If you have insurance through a private health plan the chances are pretty good that your data may have been used in one of these studies says   the principal investigator for MiniSentinel and a professor at Harvard Medical Schools Department of Population Medicine Almost all of that data comes from billing records  not what your doctor has scribbled in your chart but rather the codes for any diagnostic tests and procedures you undergo These codes are on your medical bill Platt says the data partnership has been carefully set up to preserve patient privacy His own records have probably been part of a study says Platt but he has no way of knowing that Weve built the system so the analyst here would have no way to say Lets see if Dr Platts data is in there  he says The system is built so that that is an impossible question to ask Its taken five years for Platts team to build MiniSentinel from scratch and make it a routine part of FDAs work Were now doing hundreds of queries a year he says For example they ran a search when the FDA got some troubling reports tentatively linking intestinal problems to a blood pressure drug called olmesartan They had noticed that patients who had received this drug were having these complications that they thought might be related to the drug recalls Platt At first MiniSentinel found no connection Then the FDA asked for a second search this time focusing on people who took the drug for long periods They found a link Platt says As a result the FDA added a   to the drugs label It was possible to provide an answer that otherwise would frankly just be unavailable to them says Platt MiniSentinel has been an experiment to see whats possible but its contract ends in September and the FDA will be deciding what to do next Almost everyone agrees that the ability to sift through huge amounts of patient data is the way of the future  but not everyone believes that we really know how to best do that sifting yet I think its a good and important step that the FDA is moving in this direction says Thomas Moore a senior scientist at the nonprofit   The problem is I think they have underestimated how far they have to go Billing data were never meant to be used this way says Moore who questions how well they can reveal side effects from drugs He thinks the biggest danger is that people will get a false reassurance about safety He points to a controversy over a new bloodthinning medicine called dabigatran Reports had come in about serious bleeding episodes says Moore but the FDA published an   in a leading medical journal basically discounting all that  saying that using MiniSentinel they had seen no unusual risk for this drug The agency is now taking another more nuanced look at dabigatran after critics   how well the FDA had designed the original MiniSentinel study People at the FDA are aware that when doing this type of research with big data the way you set up the question can affect the answer Things may change depending on what claims data set you use or how you run your definitions how you set up your parameters and so forth says Woodcock And theres no doubt these studies are vulnerable to all these changes She says thats why the FDA is also involved in another effort to explore all these potential effects This effort is led by   a foundation set up by Congress Right now its major project is research on how to use large databases to study the safety of medicines on the market This is a new science and much work needs to be done to develop and continue to improve the methods behind this says Troy McCall who is managing the   for the ReaganUdall Foundation The foundation does get some money from the FDA but supports its research with other funds And so far all the money for this particular project has come from pharmaceutical companies like Merck Pfizer Novartis Johnson  Johnson GlaxoSmithKline AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly McCall says he doesnt think its seen as an industry project because the work is so important Clearly at the end of the day this is all to benefit patients and ensure that drugs that are on the market are safe he says adding that patients also benefit when safe drugs are not unnecessarily removed from the market Drug companies do have a big interest in what stays on or off the market But Woodcock sees no problem with industry funding the development of the scientific methods that will then be used to help make regulatory decisions It would be very difficult to develop a method that was going to favor your drug when youre developing a general method I think Woodcock says But what I would say is OK who is going to develop these methods We need them developed Officials at the ReaganUdall Foundation say it operates transparently and has different stakeholders represented on its governing boards But one board member who represents consumers says she finds the lack of independent funding troubling I think that creates an appearance of a conflict of interest and potentially a real conflict of interest says   president of the nonprofit National Center for Health Research If all the money is coming from the pharmaceutical companies whose livelihoods are going to be affected by what the project finds I just think thats an untenable situation Zuckerman says she worries that industry funding might influence the methods that eventually get used for finding signals in big data that drugs are unsafe  and that could potentially limit what this new approach will reveal about the medicines Americans take every day
