Its an ageold question in marriage  would you rather be happy or right Bruce Arroll of the University of Auckland in New Zealand tried to answer the question scientifically but says the experiment went badly wrong We thought everybody would be happily living ever after says Arroll a professor in the School of Population Health whose findings are reported in the Christmas issue of BMJ formerly the British Medical Journal They chose a married couple and controlled the experiment by arranging for the husband to change his behavior The intervention was for the male to agree with his wifes every opinion and request without complaint Even if he believed the female participant was wrong the male was to bow and scrape Arrolls team writes in BMJ It was decided without consultation that the female participant would prefer to be right and the male being somewhat passive would prefer to be happy Arroll admits that his team didnt go into the experiment with a neutral attitude We thought that by agreeing one partner with the other that it would make them both happy he told NBC News It was Arroll says a disaster The data safety monitoring committee stopped the study because of severe adverse outcomes after  days the team writes The wife who didnt quite know what was going on just got out of control he says Her behavior was just getting increasingly sort of demanding and sort of bossy I guess would be the word which became unbearable for the male participant he says  After just  days the the mans quality of life score had plummeted from  out of  at the start to  while the wife wasnt really much happier  her happiness score rose slightly from  to  We didnt expect the adverse events says Arroll  Arroll who says he personally has been happily married for  years refused to disclose who the study subjects were The outcome could be different if the husband were always allowed to be right Arroll says but he has no plans to replicate the experiment No I guess we thought one of the hazards is divorce and one is homicide he says only half joking Plus hes achieved his goal  getting published in the Christmas BMJ a firmly tongueincheek issue I couldnt retire until I had done it he says Its actually extremely difficult to get into
