Older adults and their caregivers have complained for years that Medicare which now covers  million Americans    Its a huge problem said Barbi Jo Stim a geriatric care manager at Jewish Family and Childrens Services of the East Bay a social service agency in Berkeley Calif If older adults cant afford the dental work they need they cant chew they dont get the nutrition they need and that can affect their overall health For some adults with Medicare the online insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act may offer an alternative assuming they become functional in the near future  True the vast majority    But unless they are enrolled in a private Medicare Advantage managed care plan that already includes dental benefits Medicare beneficiaries are legally permitted to purchase dental plans on the exchanges   There is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits the sale to Medicare beneficiaries of standalone dental plans on the exchanges said Leslie Fried policy and programs director at the   in Washington DC  Still there are drawbacks The standalone dental plans for adults  can set annual dollar limits on coverage and dont have to comply with caps on outofpocket spending mandated by the ACA for health plans Insurance premium subsidies and assistance with outofpocket expenses are not available And in some states exchange dental plans can reject adult applicants because of preexisting conditions  The choices vary dramatically by state In the  states where the federal government is running exchanges dental coverage is available only to those who also buy health coverage said an official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the agency operating those exchanges That means someone with Medicare cannot purchase standalone dental coverage even though federal law allows the sale of these policies to Medicare beneficiaries The Maryland Health Connection offers  dentalonly policies that seniors who have Medicare can buy said Danielle Davis communications director for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange But Covered California that states insurance exchange offers standalone dental plans that cover only children Adult coverage may be added next year  New York officials announced in August that the states exchange would sell  dental plans but now say the policies are wrapped into health plans and are not offered Â  la carte   The need for separate adult dental policies was not raised during public forums about New Yorks exchange benefits package said Lisa Sbrana counsel to the    We would definitely consider it if New Yorkers expressed an interest in it  In the District of Columbia seniors in Medicare can choose from five standalone dental plans in DCHealthLink said Mila Kofman executive director of the District of Columbia Health Exchange Authority but all also include coverage for children  These plans cannot turn away applicants because of preexisting conditions but dental plans sold outside the exchange can said assistant insurance commissioner Philip Barlow Thats not true everywhere however So whats the bottom line  Medicare beneficiaries may be able buy standalone dental plans on certain state exchanges however they may not be much better than those available outside the exchanges  Many standalone exchange dental plans include coverage for children which seniors dont need and that can increase the premiums If your state exchange does sell dentalonly plans and you have Medicare dont expect financial assistance
