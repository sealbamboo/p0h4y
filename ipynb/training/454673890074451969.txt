
 For the next few weeks youll be hearing a lot from me about a conference I attended in March at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley Called Healthy Kitchens Healthy Lives this conference presented by the Culinary Institute of America the Harvard School of Public Health and the Samueli Institute brings together medical professionals with chefs and  nutrition researchers  to explore food and its relationship to health Now in its th year the conference has inspired hospitals  to install teaching kitchens Surgeons whose knowledge of knives had been limited to the scalpel have learned to wield a chefs knife as they participate in kitchen workshops run by chefs from the Culinary Institute  and chefs presenting at the conference Whole grains legumes nuts and vegetables were the focus of most of the cooking demonstrations by the likes of Joyce Goldstein Suvir Saran John Ash Iliana de la Vega Mollie Katzen Barton Seaver Patrick Clark Aaron Brown and the conference codirector Dr David Eisenberg of Harvard along with his very charming yearold daughter Naomi This of course was right up my alley and as always I came home with many new ideas One frequent message in the cooking demonstrations was that fresh herbs if you use them in quantity are as much a green vegetable as say broccoli This can be especially reassuring during the seasons when fresh green vegetables are in short supply I took this to heart with the salads Im presenting this week theyre packed with herbs At this time of year I can also include the enticing spring vegetables that are hitting the farmers markets so I roasted asparagus and artichokes and served them alongside the grains in two of this weeks salads and served another one on a bed of spinach All of the salads can be served as main dishes they are great keepers so make some over the weekend and use  them for  lunch throughout the week  This salad is inspired by one demonstrated at the Healthy Kitchen Healthy Lives conference in Napa Valley  This can be a maindish salad or a side enlivened with intensely delicious roasted asparagus  Quartering and roasting the artichokes instead of steaming them whole intensifies flavor and cuts down on preparation time for this salad  With a little advance preparation this spicy salad can be made in  minutes  The hues of this crunchy salad indicate that its an antioxidantrich dish
