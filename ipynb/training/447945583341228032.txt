Fraud is costing the NHS bn a year with a further bn lost to financial errors the former head of its antifraud section says  The amount lost to fraud alone could pay for nearly  new nurses a report seen by Panorama suggests The NHS must get on with tackling the problem said Jim Gee coauthor of the Portsmouth University study and exdirector of NHS Counter Fraud Services  The Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures The amount estimated by Mr Gee who led the NHS antifraud section for eight years until  is  times that recorded in the governments annual fraud indicator report It is based on worldwide figures which suggest average losses to fraud and error of just under  of healthcare budgets If the NHS is in line with the rest of the world it is losing bn Mr Gee who is currently Director of Counter Fraud Services at BDO LLP told BBC Breakfast He said the UKwide figures had to be extrapolated because the NHS in recent years has stopped measuring its own losses  only looking at those for dental and pharmaceutical services Key types of fraud include the nonpayment of prescription charges by patients medical professionals claiming for work they have not done and overcharging by contractors said Mr Gee We need to not be embarrassed or in denial about the possibility of fraud taking place in the NHS he told Panorama We need to get on with tackling the problem minimising its cost maximising resources available for proper patient care The bn cost of errors relate to when the NHS makes overpayments by mistake to suppliers or staff Although the NHS has a budget of about bn it is having to make significant savings and should prioritise fighting fraud said Mr Gee I think fraud is one of the last great unreduced healthcare costs And to me putting money into it makes absolute sense he said Its one of the least painful ways of cutting costs It makes absolute sense to cut the cost of fraud before you cut the quality or extent of patient services The Department of Health declined to be interviewed but in a statement said it did not recognise the figure or speculate on levels of losses Panorama also found that NHS Protect the national body that investigates fraud in England for the Department of Health has had its budget cut by around  since  The operating budget for NHS Protect in  is m the equivalent budget in  was  million NHS Protect has replaced NHS Counter Fraud Services in England A Freedom of Information request by the BBC shows that NHS Protect employs  counterfraud specialists with a further  investigators working at a local level  By contrast the Department for Work and Pensions employs six times the number of investigators  but if Mr Gees figures are accurate they face less than half the amount of fraud The Department of Health said NHS Protect had a significant budget and protects and safeguards frontline NHS services  NHS antifraud teams investigate cases ranging from hundreds to millions of pounds  Among their cases was that of dentist Joyce Trail from Birmingham who was one of the most prolific fraudsters in NHS history Trail charged the NHS for work she had never actually carried out  She visited care homes offering to check residents teeth and then used their personal details to claim payment from the NHS Trail even claimed payment for the false teeth for patients who had died She was jailed in  for m worth of fraud Other fraudsters investigators have prosecuted include NHS employees selling stolen products on eBay and dentists charging the NHS for gold crowns while fitting patients with cheaper ones One investigator Barry Hards said the lack of money for investigators means that now is a good time to be a fraudster in the NHS  How can you have confidence that theres a likelihood youll be found out when theres very few people looking at you he said I think its a genuinely held concern that some people in senior positions have just taken their eye off the ball on this
