A teens relationship  or lack of good relationship  with parents pals or teachers may have a lot to do with why most kids arent getting the nine to  hours of sleep that doctors recommend The hormonal disruptions of puberty likely also play a role Thats the word from   a sociologist and sleep researcher at the University of Cincinnati Maume recently analyzed federal health data from a survey of  teenagers who were questioned first when they were  years old and then again at age  His findings appear in the December issue of the  Teens who had very warm relationships with their parents  who said they felt supported for example and could talk to their folks  tended to sleep better Maume found Whereas families going through distressful times  divorce or remarriage  that tended to disrupt teen sleep he says Having problems or feeling unsafe at school also disturbed sleep though students who said they had good relationships with teachers tended to sleep better Teens who reported having strong friendships with peers who shared similar academic goals or who were involved in sports or other school activities also got a better nights sleep Kids it turns out arent so different from adults in this way If were happy and content Maume says were much more likely to sleep better than if were distressed and anxious and worried Of course teens are often more drawn to their computers and social networking than adults are But Maume found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime but also about limiting technology the kids slept better Its a finding that seems obvious Maume says But perhaps we need reminding that parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers The national data suggest that on average kids lose about an hour and a half of sleep a night between ages  and   dropping from about nine hours per night to a little less than eight Nudging that number back up to the recommended nine or  nightly hours seems impossible to Stacy Simera an Ohio mental health therapist who is also mother to yearold Graig As a mom my role is to set the right environment for my son Simera says He does not have caffeine He does not have TV in the bedroom and no cellphone or iPad in his room when hes supposed to be asleep Graigs good about all of that Simera says But even if he hits the sack at  pm shell often hear him tossing and turning until after  Dr   who heads the pediatric sleep and research center at St Louis University blames the shifting hormones of puberty for throwing a wrench into the internal clock of many teens Theyre not as sleepy as early as they used to be Paruthi says So in grade school they were easily going to sleep and getting sleepy at  but now theyre getting sleepy at   and for some kids it goes much further As with many hormonal changes some people are more affected than others But whatever the cause statistics suggest that kids who dont get the ideal nine or  hours total of shuteye each night are at higher risk for things like poor academic performance colds flu depression and  among teens old enough to drive  accidents on the road
