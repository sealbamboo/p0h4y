Sheer boredom has been cited as a motive in the murders of at least four people in recent years including Fridays fatal shooting of an Oklahoma college athlete and leading experts on teen violence say that reason may be quite real in the minds of some youthful killers A handful of young homicide suspects and convicted killers have in recent years told authorities they were pushed by boredom to willfully take a random life  and that state of listlessness may have ignited an urge for lethal excitement said juvenile homicide expert Phil Chalmers author of Inside the Mind of a Teen Killer  I dont think it was an excuse I think they are being honest about being bored said Chalmers who has interviewed more than  teen killers I would call the latest attack a gang killing by thrill killers he said Thrill killing is killing someone to experience the act of murder Just for fun  Christopher Lane a yearold Australian who was living in Oklahoma to play college baseball   as he jogged during a visit to his girlfriend in Duncan Okla One of three teenagers being held in the case told police the suspects were bored and didnt have anything to do so we decided to kill somebody Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford told The Associated Press  They saw Christopher go by and one of them said Theres our target Ford told the AP The boy who has talked to us said We were bored and didnt have anything to do so we decided to kill somebody On Tuesday James Francis Edwards  and Chancey Allen Luna  were charged with murder The third teenager Michael Dewayne Jones  was charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact and with firing a weapon All were charged as adults according to the Stephens County District Attorneys Office The possibility of a thrill killing is very conceivable agreed Dave Cullen who has done indepth research on the Columbine High School massacre but he cautioned that because the statement released by police seems to have come from only one of the three suspects it may not represent a true group decision Gangs of three killers are really uncommon he said It could be whoever the shooter was had vastly different motives of the other two said Cullen author of Columbine which explored the  mass shootings by two teenagers  Blaming boredom for the killing may also be masking a different motive Cullen suggested What I hear from that boredom statement is more like People mean nothing to me or I enjoyed this What I hear is an extreme lack of empathy an extreme callousness that people cant even conceive of and then explaining it away by slapping boredom on there Cullen said  After at least three other recent murders the killers blamed their acts on boredom  In  six teenagers fatally stabbed yearold pizza chef Mathew Chew in New London Conn  they did it because they were bored All six were convicted and sentenced to prison  In  yearold Jeromie Cancel suffocated Kevin Pravia a Pace University sophomore in the victims Manhattan apartment by wrapping a plastic bag and cord around his head   Cancel told them he murdered the college student because he was bored Cancel later was sentenced life in prison In  in the United Kingdom yearold Stuart Harling  fatally stabbed Cheryl Moss after the nurse took a break from her hospital job to smoke a cigarette Harling was sentenced to life in prison in   later testified that Harling had said hed committed the murder out of boredom While the Oklahoma police initially pointed out the statement about boredom a motivation which can make the shooting seem even more frightening due to its randomness there are hundreds of possible scenarios Cullen suggested  Maybe he couldnt really explain himself at all and wasnt really prepared to and so he thought he was going to at least act cool in the moment Cullen added Maybe he didnt know what the hell else to say so he just throws out something like that
