The sun has set in Liberias eastern border town of Ganta and the red dirt roads are humming with motorbikes and boomboxes As Ebola starts to lose ground in the West African country life is slowly returning to normal Liberias nightlife which stalled after officials declared a state of emergency in early August is gradually picking up And the hangouts where Liberians pay a small fee to watch soccer are once again packed with fans At Justinas a club in the center of Ganta about  young men have come to watch the Champions league matches Real Madrid is beating Ludogorets and Arsenal just put the ball past Galatasarys keeper Liberians call these places video clubs Theyre kind of like a sports bar only theres no beer served and no barstools Young men  and its almost all men  come here to support their squads The dimly lit hall is filled with rows of plastic chairs in front of mounted TVs People are passionate about soccer here Plus since so many are out of work watching games is a way to pass the time When the government announced a state of emergency everyone was afraid to come together says Alberto Fong whos standing outside Justinas during halftimeSitting here in these clubs is very dangerous so everyone was trying to observe the rules That means avoiding human contact staying away from large gatherings and washing your hands with diluted chlorine before entering public buildings Thats part of the way Liberia was able to cut the weekly number of new Ebola cases from around  down to under  Because of this trend the state of emergency was lifted a month ago But health officials say complacency could stop the progress So the government recommends taking precautions My ministry is telling people that if you want to go to video clubs you first need to observe safe measures we have put in place says Isaac Jackson Liberias deputy information minister Wash your hands After all Ganta sits right across the border from Guinea where the outbreak started But theres no chlorine bucket in front of this video club Fortunately Fong came with his own hand sanitizer Just in case I touch someone he says Not everyone is as prepared as Fong and these sticky sweaty video clubs are jammed with people Just down the street from Justinas is the Arsenal video club Its pretty lax inside Men sit shoulder to shoulder on wooden benches Most of them seem comfortable  but not everyone wants to go in Emmanuel Good Boy Gbormie is taking no chances so he sits outside Very very not safe its an interactive environment and theres no bucket to wash hands he says So for me personally I need to protect myself For Gbormie thats more important than cheering his team on in the video club He says hell wait for his friends to come outside and tell him whos won
