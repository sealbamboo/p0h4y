Childhood obesity expert Dr Joanna Dolgoff says parents of obese children would rather talk to their kids about anything  even sex or drugs  than weight But ignoring it could set a child up for a lifetime of health problems and emotional heartache she said The issue of childhood obesity and Dolgoffs work will get a national airing Sunday as the new season of the NBC reality weightloss show The Biggest Loser adds three kids  two yearolds and a yearold  to the cast The move is already generating plenty of controversy from critics who say it puts too much pressure on the youths in a bid to draw eyeballs But Dolgoff a New Yorkbased pediatrician who is serving as show consultant said the program handles the issue with great sensitivity and she defended it as necessary to start a national dialogue about childhood obesity Dolgoff also is author of Red Light Green Light Eat Right a book aimed at helping children navigate whats on their plate I think whats important is for parents to acknowledge the issue You know they did a study  parents would rather talk to their kids about sex or drugs or anything other than weight But really you do need to talk to your child because overweight children know theyre overweight And if the parents dont talk about it the kid feels ashamed Its obvious that its there and no ones talking about it  As parents sometimes we have to have tough conversations Thats our job Thats our role But you do it in the most loving way possible I call it portion distortion Because most parents dont know how much a child or teenager is supposed to eat and they give their children portions that are way too big And the studies are clear that when you give your child a larger portion of food they will eat more I advise parents to sit down at an emotionally neutral time to talk about it and to use the word we instead of you and to make it about health instead of weight or looks So We could be eating more healthy and Id love for us to learn as a family how to eat healthier so we can be at the healthiest weight for the healthiest hearts and the healthiest bodies Saying I want us to learn healthy eating habits as a family doesnt put the child on the defensive Studies seem to indicate if you treat an overweight child in a sensitive manner you decrease the risk of eating disorders Because as I said overweight children know that theyre overweight So if youre not discussing it with your child and youre not giving them the tools they need to get to a healthy weight then the kids are going to do their own thing  And those are the kids who are going to starve themselves And then they binge because they cant keep up the starving so then they purge And these are the kids that are really at risk for disordered eating So you have to address it Even I know parents dont want to but they have to And Im so glad The Biggest Loser is addressing it because we have to talk about this The silence is literally killing our children I keep it very simple for kids but parents get a lot out of it too Green light foods are nutritious Yellow light foods are eaten in moderation Red light foods  these are occasional treats You get two of these a week So it teaches kids and adults to balance things out If you are going to a birthday party this weekend and you want cake and ice cream thats when you are going to use your two red light foods So you are choosing not to have any of those during the week Its not about calories and weight and depriving ourselves Its about feeding ourselves nutritious foods and finding ways to fuel our bodies to do all the things we want to do It gives kids power and control and kids like that
