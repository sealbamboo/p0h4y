 Lets get one thing straight January Jones is not Betty Draper Francis the character she plays on AMCs drama   For one thing Betty is a bored housewife whose maid knows her kids better than she does Jones is a working actress raising a monthold son by herself And while Betty rarely ever ingests anything except cigarette smoke and vodka Jones sticks to a healthy diet of actual food Betty would never tea and    including some made from her own placenta Yes you read that right Jones recently revealed to   that after giving birth to her son Xander she had her placenta dehydrated ground up and then encapsulated in pill form by a doula Its something I was very hesitant about but were the only mammals who dont ingest our own placentas she explained to the magazine adding that she credits the pills with helping her bounce back and get back to work after her   Its not witchcrafty or anything I suggest it to all moms In fact placenta supplements are part of a growing trend of placentophagia or   Last summer   even published a piece about it called The Placenta Cookbook which detailed the history and practice of eating afterbirth both in pill form and in placentabased recipes One woman claimed she used a blender a banana and some coconut water to make a placenta smoothie another couple toasted their new family with pieces of placenta jerky So whats the deal Is afterbirth some kind of new culinary adventure Not quite According to the article placenta supplements are said to alleviate postpartum depression aid in breastmilk production and lactation act as a uterine tonic and replenish nutrients lost during pregnancy There is certainly a potential medicinal use ABC News quoted David Katz MD founder of the Yale Prevention Center as saying last year This is a timehonored cultural practice of eating the placenta It is nutrientrich and a source of hormones Indeed placenta has long been recognized in other societies for its potential healing powers and spiritual significance In traditional Chinese medicine for example dried placenta is mixed with herbs and then ingested to treat infertility and lactation issues among other things And in Indonesia Morocco and the Czech Republic some new moms believe that placentaeating guarantees future fertility Unfortunately theres no sound science to support any of these claims says Mark Kristal PhD a behavioral neuroscientist at the University of Buffalo who has been studying placentophagia for  years Its a New Age phenomenon Kristal told   Every ten or twenty years people say We should do this because its natural and animals do it But its not based on science Its a fad Thats not to say the health benefits of placenta couldnt be real however  just that they havent yet been proven In fact Kristal and colleagues just published a paper in the journal   calling for more research on the subject They point out that placenta ingestion by nonhuman mammals seems to increase motherinfant interaction and even facilitate caretaking behavior both of which could be medically relevant with regards to   As of now though no studies exist to prove these benefits in humans and until they do Kristal says theres no real scientific reason for new moms to ingest their own placentas  despite Jones ringing endorsement People will do anything Kristal said in a press release about the paper but we shouldnt read too much significance into reports of such exceptions even if they are accurate because they are neither reliable nor valid studies My own studies found no evidence of the routine practice of placentophagia in other cultures The more challenging anthropological question is Why dont humans engage in placentophagia as a biological imperative as so many other mammals apparently do he added Perhaps for humans there is a greater adaptive advantage to   eating the placenta
