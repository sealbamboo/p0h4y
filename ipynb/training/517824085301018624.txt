GP outofhours care in England is improving but weaknesses still exist in certain areas inspectors say The Care Quality Commission review of  services  covering a third of the population  highlighted problems with recruitment processes and medicines management However it concluded services on the whole were safe and wellled It comes after years of criticisms following the overhaul of the system a decade ago In  GPs were allowed to opt out of providing care leaving it to NHS and private providers to run night and weekend care In  there was a highly critical government review following the death two years previously of David Gray The yearold Cambridgeshire resident was given an overdose of painkiller by a German locum doctor working his first NHS shift This CQC said there had been significant improvements since then In particular the review noted there were fewer locum GPs covering shifts and services were active in encouraging feedback from patients But it found a fifth of services were not fully compliant on recruitment as they were not carrying out the required checks on staff applying for jobs Meanwhile nearly a quarter were warned over the way they stored and checked stocks of medicine However none of the problems was considered serious enough to warrant formal regulatory action Chief inspector Prof Steve Field said At the start of our inspections I did not have high hopes about the quality of outofhours care  However I am delighted that these inspections have shown that in most cases the care people receive is safe effective caring responsive and wellled Health Minister Lord Howe said the results were really positive Dr Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association agreed the the report was encouraging but said it only gave a partial picture of outofhours care as it did not include the new  telephone service where he believed there were problems The CQC will start inspecting this later in the autumn Patients Association chairman Dr Mike Smith said the positive findings were not supported by the calls to the groups helpline He said many patients still had no faith in the system
