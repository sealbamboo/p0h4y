Infusing stem cells into the brain may help boost recovery after a stroke according to a pilot study by Imperial College London  Scientists believe the cells encourage new blood vessels to grow in damaged areas of the brain They found most patients were able to walk and look after themselves independently by the end of the trial despite having suffered severe strokes Larger studies are needed to evaluate whether this could be used more widely In this early trial  designed primarily to look at the safety of this approach  researchers harvested stem cells from the bone marrow of five people who had recently had a stroke  They isolated particular types of stem cells  known as CD These have the ability to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels   They were infused directly into damaged sections of the brain via the major artery that supplies this area Scientists monitored the patients for six months charting their ability to carry out everyday activities independently  Four of the five patients had suffered particularly severe strokes  resulting in the loss of speech and marked paralysis down one side of the body  This type of stroke usually has a high fatality and disability rate But researchers found three of the four patients were able to walk and look after themselves independently at the end of the sixmonth period And with some help all five were mobile and could take part in everyday tasks  Though other   has shown promise as stroke therapy before this is the first UK study to investigate using this type of approach in the first week after a stroke  Scientists hope getting to patients early will improve chances of success   Dr Soma Banerjee who led the study told the BBC This is encouraging and exciting early research  Now we need to look at a larger group of patients and hope eventually to develop a treatment based on this approach But Dr Tim Chico from the University of Sheffield who was not involved in the study said It is important to understand this is only the very earliest step towards a possible new treatment for stroke and does not prove the stem cell treatment improved these patients recovery  A much larger trial will be needed to compare stem cell treatment with no stem cell treatment Anyone who has seen the suffering a stroke can cause will be encouraged that doctors and scientists are continually exploring new ways to treat this devastating disease The study is published in Stem Cell Translational Medicine
