When you're feeling ill, it's tempting to run to the computer in an effort to self-diagnose. Now Google is testing a program that will connect symptom-searching users with doctors via live video chat.. The pilot was revealed after Reddit user .  noticed an odd pop-up window after Googling the phrase "knee pain." He posted a screenshot of the window, which included both a short explanation of the program and a button to live chat with a doctor, on the social-news site on Friday. Google confirmed the program on Monday, and explained that it's a test available to only some users right now. "When you're searching for basic health information -- from conditions like insomnia or food poisoning -- our goal is [to] provide you with the most helpful information available. We're trying this new feature to see if it's useful to people," the company said in an emailed statement.
