Junior doctors who decide to work in Wales could get their student debts paid off under proposals unveiled by Plaid Cymru  The debts  about  on average  would be wiped in exchange for a commitment to work in Wales for a number of years The party said  extra doctors were needed to boost what it called a creaking Welsh health service Welsh Labour accused Plaid Cymru of playing fantasy politics Wiping debts is part of a series of health policy proposals for consultation by the party A Plaid Cymru government could also offer bursaries and set new quotas for Welshspeaking medical students to increase the number able to work bilingually As a shortterm solution about  doctors from abroad would be recruited to plug specific gaps  The party claimed that if enough new doctors were recruited there would be less need to centralise some hospital services This would result for example in every district general hospital being able to keep an accident and emergency department said Plaid The party has said previously it would fund more doctors by introducing a tax on sugary drinks  Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones told BBC Radio Wales it would be possible to implement their plans using the current health budget but it would be useful additional taxraising powers that Wales will have in the next  years She defended the proposal to tax sugary drinks saying Its a wellunderstood principle that substances that are harmful to individuals are taxed Sugary drinks are probably doing some harm and I think thats accepted now as we discuss the obesity crisis in Wales and the western world Sugary drinks are a significant contribution to that and we could look in Wales at lowering our dependence on them and raising revenue Some states of the USA already imposed such a tax she added Ms Jones said the proposals overall were about taking a longterm approach to NHS recruitment problems in Wales For decades governments at both ends of the M have treated problems in our NHS with a sticking plaster she said Unfortunately the shorttermism has now come home to roost which is why we are in such a difficult position in our hospitals she said The policies Plaid Cymru is now consulting on will look to secure firm foundations on which our NHS can survive and thrive for generations to come Responding to the new policy proposals Welsh Labours Pontypridd AM Mick Antoniw said Are the nationalists seriously suggesting that their discredited pop tax would mean that NHS modernisation and restructuring would no longer be necessary  At best this is economically illiterate gibberish at worst Plaid Cymru is trying to play a disgraceful con trick on people who work in and rely on our NHS in Wales  Plaid is infatuated with playing fantasy politics knowing full well its vacuous policies have no chance of seeing the light of day as the third party of Welsh politics
