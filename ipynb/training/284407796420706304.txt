About a month ago Declan Procaccinis yearold son woke him early in the morning in a fright He came into my bedroom and said Dad I had a horrible horrible dream  Procaccini says He was really shaken up I said Tell me about it and he told me hed had a dream that a teenager came into his classroom at his school and shot all the kids in front of him Procaccinis son is a sensitive kid frequently anxious so Procaccini did what he often does when his son crawls into his bed with a fear or anxiety He explained why the fear wasnt rational by simply laying out the math The chance of that happening here are  in a zillion Procaccini told his son and then continued with a lesson about probabilities and possibilities You know its  that Godzilla could right now come through the trees Yes But is it   No I think we both know that its not probable This discussion seemed to calm his son down a bit He shook off his dream and returned to life as usual That worked out for a little while Procaccini says And then Procaccinis community became the  in  in a zillion The day Adam Lanza shot his way through Sandy Hook Elementary School Procaccinis yearold daughter was in a reading room just down the hall from the principals office She had walked herself to her class early and was sitting there with two teachers when the three of them heard the sound of gunfire coming from outside They grabbed my daughter by the arm and threw her into the bathroom Procaccini says Theres a little bathroom off the reading room I think its a singleperson  and the three of them just sat in there quiet cause he came into the room Apparently Lanza didnt hear them because he left and everyone in the tiny bathroom survived In the days after the shootings though one of the teachers who had been at the school and knew Procaccini well reached out to him and his wife Lisa She wanted them to know just how terrifying their daughters experience had been You need to get your daughter help she told the family Procaccini recalls her saying I was literally in the same area as your daughter and I know what she saw and I know what she heard and Im going to need help for a long time You need to get her help But since the shootings Procaccinis daughter has barely talked about what happened barely registered any emotional distress at all I dont know if shes just disassociated I dont know if its her defense mechanism Or I dont know if she just doesnt get it I truly dont Procaccini says His yearold son however has been struggling Procaccinis son graduated from Sandy Hook Elementary last year and now attends Reed Intermediate School which went into lockdown during the shooting so the boy had no idea what was happening until Procaccini picked him up and told him about it Immediately Procaccini says his son started crying I mean he was crying like a little baby I havent seen him cry like that you know He was so scared And as soon as they got home Procaccini says his son made a decision no more school for him Im not going he insisted over and over again But when Procaccinis family went to see a therapist the next day one of the things the therapist made clear was that staying away from school was a bad idea The more school his son missed she told Procaccini the harder it would be to get him to go back And so on Tuesday of last week when Reed went back into session Procaccini tried to persuade his son to go I said Come on Ill walk you in Ill show you And he just snapped And it was crying and screaming Im not going Im not going Youre not leaving me  For the rest of the week Procaccini and his son simply drove to the school and walked together through the halls for hours Procaccinis car keys safely tucked into his sons coat pocket so that Procaccini couldnt drive away by himself This procedure was supposed to convince his son that school really was a safe place but his son doesnt seem to be buying it and Procaccini is worried about what will happen after the holiday break I dont have a plan really he says Since the shootings Procaccinis son hasnt had another dream but Procaccini is certain that if he does there will be at least one difference in the way that Procaccini responds Procaccini wont talk about probabilities and possibilities again That argument suddenly doesnt make any sense Zhihong Yang another parent of a Sandy Hook student lives two miles away Yang tells me to call her Jen and when I walk in theres a small pile of papers spread over the table in her kitchen handouts for Sandy Hook Elementary parents distributed at a conference the night before Yangs son Jerry is in the third grade and was at Sandy Hook during the shooting Unlike some of the other kids who were at the school he genuinely seems to be doing OK But for her part Yang finds herself thinking about things she had never considered before Yesterday I went to Costco and I cant help but think If there was a shooter here what do you do I went to the supermarket If something happened there what do you do she says This makes sense since death is all around Yang Take her drive to school Her usual sevenminute route is now lined with families affected by the tragedy At least four families that had victims in that accident she says and when I drive by I feel the pain and I do cry Yang is from China She says that in college there she studied math and then suddenly  totally without prompting  I find myself in another conversation about possibilities and probabilities Yang it turns out specialized in statistics and since the shooting has been thinking a lot about possibilities and probabilities reconsidering her original feelings about them Yang tells me that she had always assumed that she was safe because the chance of a shooting happening to her specifically was very small But since the shooting shes been focused on this one rule of statistics she learned in college which she calls the large number certainty theorem If the base is big enough she explains even though the probability is small things will happen with certainty By Yangs reckoning this is how the large number certainty theorem applies We know that many people have guns and we know that a certain number of people have disordered minds or bad intentions and we also know that this is a huge country In other words the base is big So you know mathematically something somewhere will happen with certainty she says And so though Yang previously depended on the idea that school shootings were so rare they would probably happen to someone else the shooting has taught her that we should not wait until it actually happens to us to take action Yang has decided to get more involved with fighting for gun control This to her seems like the logical thing to do Still the logic of many parts of all this are not clear to her at all You can safely predict that this will happen but why it particularly happened to that class To that teachers room That particular family she says This obviously is not a question that math can answer Math can tell us only that something   happen  not when not to whom And so Yang reasons morally she should not distinguish between its happening to someone else and its happening to her Probabilities just arent improbable enough for that
