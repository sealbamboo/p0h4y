Yes it is true that gardening requires patience But face it we live in an impatient world And gardeners everywhere were depressed by the brutal and endless winter True story The polar vortex killed my fall kale crop So we are understandably eager to get sowing And to see results by  well if not next Thursday then maybe midMay There are two ways to make this happen Some garden varieties naturally have a short germinatetoharvest cycle Then there are the hybrids developed at universities and seed companies They take two plants with great traits like early arrival or cold tolerance and forge an even hardier offspring For guidance on the world of speedy plottotable vegetables we turned to   a horticulturist and garden blogger in Longmont Colo and   a community and urban horticulturist for the Oregon State University Extension Service Start with   suggests Schmitt These are the tiny leaves less than  days old that some scientists believe pack a more nutritious punch than more mature greens Pea shoots sunflowers and beet greens are popular options Sow seeds  which can be regular seeds or designated microgreen seeds  in a sunny outdoor spot when the soil temperature is in the  to degree range or do it indoors in a tray with potting soil Sprouts should appear in three to six days After a few more days trim the microgreens with a scissors and consume To give the plants a little extra boost after that first harvest Miller adds a water soluble fertilizer like fish emulsion Then you should get two or three cuttings before the greens become too bitter or fibrous Arugula is another brisk green capable of morphing from seed to salad in three weeks To protect seedlings for this or any plant from an unexpected spring chill Schmitt covers them with black plastic or an overturned black container from a previous nursery purchase checking daily for signs of germination Mustard greens are nearly as fast as arugula Miller suggests the Osaka purple variety which takes  days to yield spicy saladworthy leaves Radishes are super superfast to grow Schmitt adds Cherry Belle is about  days Sprouting broccoli wins his endorsement as well  days to germinate at which point a little head starts to grow In about  to  days  pretty fast for broccoli  the head reaches   to  inches across Cut it off and side shoots will emerge to form copious side shoots the rest of the summer Sadly for gardeners chafing for a taste of homegrown tomato in the spring the day tomato does not exist But you can shave days even weeks off the  to day wait for fruit The appropriately named Glacier tomato is cold tolerant Schmitt says Itll set fruit when temperatures are only in the s But if you get a frost he warns game over If all goes well youll have  to inch tomatoes in  days  and a steady supply late into the season Sun Gold tomatoes are equally fast The bitesize orange fruits are ready to pick  days after a seedling is transplanted notes Miller and it just keeps kicking out the tomatoes To bolster your earlybird homegrown salad try the hybrid Yaya carrot Its very tasty and going to mature in about  days Miller says By contrast a typical carrot takes  days Maybe the best strategy for an early spring crop is to sow a year in advance The knobby and nuttytasting tuber known as the   is sold in farmers markets and some grocery stores right around now You can roast em saute em or toss em into rich soil warmed by eight hours of daily sunlight It doesnt even matter if the tubers are horizontal or vertical But location and sufficient space are important Put them where you want them to spread and persist says Miller since the plant is a perennial Sunflowers will grow from the tubers eating up the starchy root in the process In the fall the plant makes new tubers Dig them up all winter leaving a few behind for the next cycle And in spring  when other gardeners are just starting out youll still be dining on freshly harvested Jerusalem artichokes
