Somehow were squeezing  people into our apartment for Thanksgiving this year with relatives ranging in age from my yearold nephew to my yearold mother I love them all but in a way the one I know best is the middleaged man across the table whose blue eyes look just like mine my younger brother Paul Paul and I kind of irritated each other when we were kids I would take bites out of his precisely made sandwiches in just the spot I knew he didnt want me to and he would hang around the living room telling jokes when he knew I wanted to be alone with the boy on the couch But as adults weve always had each others backs especially when it comes to dealing with our mothers health crises which have become more frequent in the past few years Paul is the first person I want to talk to when theres something that worries me about Mom I know hell be worried too Theres probably a biological explanation for the intensity of the sibling bond Siblings share half their genes which evolutionary biologists say should be motivation enough for mutual devotion I would lay down my life British biologist JBS Haldane once said applying the arithmetic of   for two brothers or eight cousins Siblings are a crucial part of a childs development too teaching one another socialization skills and the rules of dominance and hierarchy all part of the eternal struggle for parental resources When psychologists study siblings they usually study children emphasizing sibling rivalry and the fact that brothers and sisters refine their social maneuvering skills on one another The adult sibling relationship has only sporadically been the subject of attention Yet were tethered to our brothers and sisters as adults far longer than we are as children our sibling relationships in fact are the longestlasting family ties we have Most such relationships are close  twothirds of people in one large   said a brother or sister was one of their best friends One thing that can scuttle closeness in adulthood is a parent who played favorites in childhood this sense of resentment can last a lifetime Jill Suitor a sociologist at Purdue University and her colleagues polled  families with  adult children ages  to  in  and   that the majority had good feelings toward their siblings Most didnt remember much favoritism when they were kids but those who did reported feeling less loved and cared for by their siblings It didnt matter whether they felt themselves to be the favored or the unfavored child The simple perception of parental favoritism was enough to undermine their relationship Thats one thing Paul and I have going for us Were pretty sure our parents treated us the same when we were growing up Yet were very different people Paul is gregarious while Im shy funny while Im not a terrific amateur saxophonist while I cant read music or carry a tune This isnt unusual In families with more than one child every sibling seems to get a label in contrast to every other sibling So if your kid sister is the queen bee in any social gathering you might get labeled the quiet one even if youre not especially quiet just quiet in comparison And if youre a bright child who always gets good grades you might not get much credit for that if your big brother is a brilliant child with straight As Theres only room for one smart one per family  youll have to come up with something else I was smart but Paul was smarter I ended up being the good one The very presence of siblings in the household can be an education When a new baby is born writes psychologist Victor Cicirelli in the  book   the older sibling gains in social skills in interacting with the younger and the younger sibling gains cognitively by imitating the older They learn from the friction between them too as they fight for their parents attention Mild conflict between brothers and sisters teaches them how to interact with peers coworkers and friends for the rest of their lives The benefits can carry into old age The literature on sibling relationships shows that during middle age and old age indicators of wellbeing  mood health morale stress depression loneliness life satisfaction  are tied to how you feel about your brothers and sisters In one Swedish   satisfaction with sibling contact in ones s was closely correlated with health and positive mood  more so than was satisfaction with friendships or relationships with adult children And loneliness was eased for older people in a supportive relationship with their siblings no matter whether they gave or got support Thats why its so sad when things between siblings fall apart This often happens when aging parents need care or die  old feelings of rivalry jealousy and grief erupt all over again masked as petty fights ostensibly over who takes Mom to the doctor or who calls the nursing home about Dad Many  families get through their parents illnesses just fine establishing networks where the workload is divided pretty much equally So far Paul and I have done fine too But about  percent of the time according to one   there is a single primary caregiver who feels like she and its almost always a she is not getting any help from her brothers and sisters which can lead to serious conflict And because of the particular intensity of sibling relationships such conflict cuts to the bone People grieve for the frayed ties to their siblings as though theyve lost a piece of themselves So let this all percolate as you sit down to turkey with your sometimescomplicated family And remember the immortal words of folksinger Loudon Wainwright III in a   called  Its about spending the holiday with a brother and a sister he rarely sees but still has intense feelings about
