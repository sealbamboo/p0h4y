 What are you  I am the ghost of general practice past  They passed through the wall and into the city They stopped at a GP surgery door I was a registrar here Fezziwig was my trainer  They went in A young man Scrooges former self sauntered in  No more work tonight Its Christmas Eve turn the phones off and put the shutters up Get home  Dr Fezziwig made his way home but knew that he couldnt have a drop of drink tonight as he was on call for his list of patients again He could be called out overnight again He even had a Santa hat in case he needed to cheer up a poor mite with suspected appendicitis Hopefully this year he would get to carve the turkey As he walked home patients in the street stopped to shake his hand and wish him a Merry Christmas  A small matter to make these patients so full of gratitude He has spent but a few minutes with each of them Is that so much that he deserves this praise  He has the power to render them happy or unhappy I cant believe that he could have got so much job satisfaction Its surely not possible Spirit Remove me from this place Haunt me no longer  I am the ghost of general practice present  The room and its contents all vanished and they stood in his city surgery Scrooge and the ghost passed on invisible straight to the receptionist as Mrs Cratchit came to the desk   I really would appreciate an appointment with Dr Scrooge for my Tiny Tim  Im afraid that is not possible have you considered the walkin centre  Yes but I do believe Dr Scrooge is his named GP  Is he at risk of an unavoidable admission  No weve managed to keep him out of hospital this last year despite   Is he on the learning disability register  No his problems are all physical Hes got this chesty cough you see  Does he need minor surgery Err no he doesnt I would just like to see   Look Im afraid Dr Scrooge doesnt have time to just see patients unless it helps him tick some box And whats more  Oi Give me back that Friends and Family leaflet  Do you have no idea how much pressure we are under  Mrs Crachit slowly goes back to Tiny Tim and his crutches waiting in the car  The GP surgery sprang up about them with a plethora of managers and insurance clerks The third spirit stopped near the kettle  I dont know much about it either way I only know it is dead  When did it die  Last election I believe  What will happen to the surgery  I havent heard Serco perhaps Dr Scrooge hadnt prepared for this Thats all I know Something tells me that were running out of time What has died  The Ghost of General Practice Future took him to a graveyard in the grounds of the Houses of Parliament The spirit pointed Scrooge crept forwards trembling as he went and read upon the stone of the neglected grave National   Service  No spirit Hear me Why show me this if we are past all hope Assure me that I may yet change these politicians Tell me spirit how I may wipe away the writing on this stone
