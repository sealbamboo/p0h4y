Having your teeth pulled is one thing Having them pulled because of a misdiagnosis is quite another But this is what happened to Ann Eastman who suffers from a rare condition which inflicts excruciating pain that mimics toothache but is in fact related to damaged nerves in the face At its worst the pain of trigeminal neuralgia  on the right hand side of her face from her temple to her lower jaw  seriously affected her life I was just standing there screaming and screaming the pain was unbelievable  My husband said Be quiet The neighbours will call the police Ann can laugh about it now but when she first experienced overwhelming facial pain she was petrified According to Professor Joanna Zakrzewska  Professor Zak to her patients  this is all too common a story  A frightened patient often misdiagnosed for months or even years in terrible and unremitting pain  At her clinic at the Eastman Dental hospital in London she sees patients and carries out research into this littleunderstood condition  Ann is  and the average age when trigeminal neuralgia starts is in the fifties or sixties  but it can affect teenagers and even children  The trigeminal nerve  we have one on each side of the face  is responsible for sensation in the face as well as movements like biting and chewing  It is thought that as we get older nearby blood vessels can squash it Compression of the nerve causes the myelin sheath  which is the protective cover of nerves of different types  to get worn away says Professor Zak and as a result of that you get crosstalk between strands of the nerve that transmit light touch and those that transmit sharp pain Ann Eastman saw her dentist He said come in straight away He looked at it and gave me xrays and he said I cant really see anything but youve got a crown there Ill remove the crown just in case theres something going on underneath the crown Days later and still in pain Ann returned to her dentist who suggested she see another specialist with a very powerful microscope His verdict after looking closely at her tooth that there was a problem with its nerves and the tooth needed to be extracted   I went back to the dentist and he took the remainder of the tooth out because it was like a stump underneath the crown  I went home and waited for the pain to wear off But the pain was still there  there was no tooth but it was still there in the exact spot Like many people in search of answers Ann turned to the internet I started googling It took me straight to trigeminal neuralgia I read this and I said to myself I have not got that because it said its incurable  After yet another painful episode over Christmas a new dentist extracted another tooth   Two teeth down and seven months after her first attack Anns dentist called her He said hed found an expert at the Eastman dental hospital  She saw one of Professor Zaks colleagues Just as I walked through the door I had the most terrible episode She was sitting there holding my hand saying Classic case classic case And I was put on anticonvulsants  a drug called carbamazepine This drug can have significant side effects so patients are advised to start with a low dose and increase it slowly When it controls the pain then you stay at that level says Ann When you feel it has suddenly stopped you still get little jabs particularly when you eat  Prior to that you cant eat just puree and shovel it in with a teaspoon at one side The chewing action just triggers the pain  Patients are advised to carry the medication with them even when on holiday so they can start taking it again straight away if the pain returns  Some patients notice a seasonal pattern for their pain Keith Ireland has only ever had trigeminal neuralgia attacks in winter So far this year he remains in remission There are a few triggers hot and cold food and drink and for me a powerful electric toothbrush I started using triggered a particularly bad episode I have switched back to the old one again  He too struggled to get a diagnosis for the pain that centred just in front of his ear but his symptoms were eventually controlled by the drug neurontin gabapentin When I found the effective dose it did control the pain considerably though never completely The surgical option is quite a serious undertaking according to Professor Zakrzewska The biggest operation which gives the longest pain relief is a big neurosurgical procedure that done in the right hands can render a patient painfree   of patients will be painfree  years later  if we get the diagnosis right and we find a vessel thats pressing on the nerve  Scans should also be done on the patient to rule out much more rare causes  like tumours  Other options include those which destroy the nerve  a better option for patients who cannot undergo a general anaesthetic for surgery according to Professor Zakrzewska These try and destroy that nerve transmitting information and hence stop the pain These are much smaller procedures they include  as I call it  cooking the nerve  whats called radiofrequency thermocoagulation bathing it in glycerol  or even now weve got the new gamma knife Pain relief normally lasts for up to  years after these procedures but they can be repeated Patients can experience a numbness or loss of sensation in the face  We really still are struggling with trying to find out what causes this dreadful condition says Professor Zakrzewska But there could be hope on the horizon she adds Im  doing a major international drug trial using a brand new sodium channel blocker that we hope will mean we can have a drug thats more effective in controlling this pain with fewer side effects  and so far initial things seem to suggest that it may be a breakthrough
