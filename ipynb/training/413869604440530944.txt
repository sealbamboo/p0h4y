GPs must start collecting anonymous data on patients who could be addicted to prescription drugs the Commons Home Affairs Committee of MPs has said That would be an important first step in tackling the problem of up to  million possible addicts they say The MPs also want to make sure more is done to stop patients visiting several doctors to feed their addiction Doctors leaders said identifying people addicted to prescription drugs was not straightforward Some types of painkillers and sleeping pills are among prescription drugs which can be addictive The MPs said more people may be addicted to prescription drugs than to illegal drugs They said the abuse of such drugs was taking place in the shadows and much better data was required Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the extent of the problem was still unquantified GPs are not collating data about how many people they suspect are abusing the system he told BBC Ones Breakfast programme If they start doing that and then report it amongst colleagues thats a very important first step in trying to prevent the abuse of prescription drugs The committee said the NHS must do more to tackle doctorshopping where an addict might visit multiple surgeries perhaps as a temporary patient to get more prescription drugs And it said authorities should be more prepared to prosecute  particularly in those cases where health professionals were supplying prescription drugs when there was no medical need Former prescription drug addict Barry Haslam chairman of support group Oldham Tranx said he had a complete breakdown at the age of  and was put on antidepressants and tranquillisers for  years According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists antidepressants are not addictive drugs like tranquillisers alcohol or nicotine but some users experience withdrawal symptoms Mr Haslam told BBC Radio s Today programme that because of the quantity I was being prescribed Ive got a complete year memory gap Im a quiet mild accountant and they made me extremely violent  they made me into a Jekyll and Hyde character into a real monster which wasnt me he added He said GPs who knew how addictive some tranquillisers were contravened guidelines by prescribing them for long periods of time But Richard Vautrey deputy chairman of the British Medical Associations BMA GP committee told Today all medical professionals are very aware of the implications of the medication that they prescribe and the consequences We need to be very careful about using terms like addicted when this is a complex issue he said There are a large number of people who are rightly taking medication that are controlling their symptoms controlling their chronic pain controlling their mental health problems They need to be taking their medication and they shouldnt be stopping their medication Mr Vautrey said it would be difficult for those people to stop without some signs of withdrawal and potentially they could be regarded as being addicted Thats very very different from the very small group of patients that the committee have identified who potentially go doctorshopping from practice to practice trying to get illicit drugs He said a system should be put in place to identify that very small group of people The GP committees chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul meanwhile said GPs already play a key role in treating patients in the community suffering from the impact of drug addiction He added The identification of individuals addicted to prescription drugs is not straightforward and whilst we should do all we can to support their withdrawal from such drugs we also need to ensure that patients are confident that their sensitive personal data will remain secure
