Women being screened for breast cancer in Germany may find themselves in the hands of a blind examiner The idea has been around for a few years and unpublished research suggests that it really works  that blind people can in fact detect tumours earlier than their sighted counterparts  Could blindness help detect breast cancer  This surprising yet simple idea came to a German doctor one morning while he was in the shower would blind women actually do his job a lot better than he does  Three minutes is all the time I have to do clinical breast examinations in my practice says Duisburgbased gynaecologist Dr Frank Hoffmann Thats not enough time to find small lumps in the breast tissue which is crucial to catching breast cancer early  People trained to read Braille have   so Hoffmann guessed that blind and visuallyimpaired women would be better qualified than anyone else to carry out breast examinations on his patients  The evidence is now unequivocal he says In an as yet unpublished study carried out with Essen University blind women are said to have detected nearly a third more lumps than regular gynaecologists  Women doing selfexaminations can feel tumours which are cm and larger Hoffmann says  Doctors usually find tumours between cm and cm whereas blind examiners find lumps between mm and mm That makes a real difference Thats the time it takes a tumour to spread its cells into the body In both Germany and the UK regular mammograms and screening programmes are only offered to women aged  and over  but in both countries it is the biggest killer of women between  and  and in Germany the age of the women affected is falling  Hoffmann says he founded his organisation Discovering Hands in order to save lives through early detection He devised a course to train blind women to become Medical Tactile Examiners or MTEs and there are now  working in practices across Germany One of them Filiz Demir sees about seven women a day performing examinations which can last up to  minutes which would be unheard of for a gynaecologist  Just over a year ago Demir was working in a travel agency but when she turned  her sight slowly deteriorated and it became harder and harder to do her job She quit retrained and learned Braille but found it impossible to even get invited for job interviews  Blindness was always my disability back then she says I could never work as fast as the others I was always behind Now my disability has become my strength Im not reliant on anyone and I can help others Its a great feeling Curious to know how Demir and her colleagues work I decided to have an examination myself  Using strips of tape marked with coordinates in Braille the MTE makes a grid on the breast She slowly feels her way along this grid so that wherever she finds a lump she can tell the doctor its exact location  Demir does an exhaustive examination but the  minutes fly past Its a calming relaxed atmosphere not at all uncomfortable and theres ample opportunity to ask questions  After seven months in this practice Demirs clearly relieved to have found mostly benign tumours Just a few weeks back she found the first malignant one which shook her a bit But its my turn to be taken aback when she removes the Braille strips and cautiously tells me shes found something  A lump on each side in fact  Had I been a regular patient in the practice I would have gone into the next room for an ultrasound Unfortunately I have to take this information back to my gynaecologist in Berlin where I get a referral for an ultrasound and mammogram  After a couple of weeks waiting for an appointment the ultrasound finally shows up nothing The radiologist tells me it doesnt make sense to do a mammogram  and unhelpfully suggests that the examiner probably just felt a bit of my ribs Hoffmanns advice in such a situation is to repeat the MTE check a few weeks later in the first half of the menstrual cycle If a lump can still be detected by palpitation a mammography makes sense he says Its exactly this cycle of checkups which can lead to false alarms angst and harmful unnecessary surgery according to Prof Gerd Gigerenzer director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development I know many women who have been frightened by false alarms Some have a biopsy done which showed nothing but they live their lives from one mammogram to the next Theres little consensus over the benefits of breast screening programmes and whether regular examinations actually save lives Gigerenzer explicitly warns against them and does not rejoice at the idea that its now possible to detect smaller lumps  The finer and more precise the diagnostic techniques are the more clinically irrelevant cancers will be detected he says  This can lead to unnecessary surgery or radiation therapy In this case early detection only harms The jury he says is out on the Discovering Hands method until the team can provide the necessary evidence proving whether their technique actually reduces mortality  A study on this is expected to be completed and published later this year  Meanwhile one of Hoffmanns patients Heike Gothe tells me she owes her life to one of these examiners Still grappling with the shock of her husbands untimely death from illness Gothe took up the helm of the family business a successful small company exporting internationally But it wasnt long before she received her own diagnosis  I had felt a lump on my right breast and went to see the doctor Gothe says  They confirmed what Id found and then detected a very small lump on the left just mm in size It didnt even show up on the ultrasound or mammogram it was just the blind MTE who felt it Finding this remarkably small tumour may well have saved her life Both tumours were diagnosed as malignant but with chemotherapy and radiotherapy she beat the cancer  Gothe is a fighter but she puts her energy and positivity down to these intensive examinations by an MTE every six months According to Gothe thats why she can sleep at night and how she gets out to run her business Fear rears its ugly head every now and then Gothe says And the only way I can deal with it is that I know Im in good hands A handful of German insurance companies are also convinced Six of them now cover the costs for their patients to have these clinical breast examinations  While new MTEs take up permanent positions in clinics across Germany and in Austria the founder of Discovering Hands Frank Hoffmann is in talks with Israel and Colombia He sees opportunities even further afield  Im convinced he says that especially in countries that arent technically so advanced as Germany  this model could improve the quality of medical standards very dramatically In  and  Gigerenzer gave a series of statistics workshops to gynaecologists and kicked off every session with the same question Gigerenzer then supplied the doctors with data about Western women of this age His figures were based on US studies from the s rounded up or down for simplicity    are slightly different In one session almost half the gynaecologists said the womans chance of having cancer was nine in  Only  said that the figure was one in   which is the correct answer
