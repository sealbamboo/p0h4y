Positive action on multiple fronts and the recovering economy are helping to reduce the growth in health-care costs to historically moderate levels. But there is no comprehensive national approach to controlling health-care costs. Further, there is little coordination of the disparate efforts across the country, and we can’t say for sure what is working and what is not.. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) .  released Wednesday showed that health-care spending per person grew 2.9% in 2013, in line with the .  seen in recent years. As the chart above shows, per capita health-care spending is growing unusually slowly by historical standards, but it is projected to pick up again as the economy improves, as more people are covered under the . , and as the population ages.
