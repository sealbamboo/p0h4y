You would have to be desperate to take a sample of your husbands excrement liquidise it in a kitchen blender and then insert it into your body with an offtheshelf enema kit This article contains images and descriptions which some might find shocking In April  Catherine Duff was ready to try anything She was wasting away with crippling abdominal pains nausea vomiting and diarrhoea so severe she was confined to the house At  in the US state of Indiana she had come down with her sixth Clostridium difficile infection in six years  My colorectal surgeon said The easiest thing would be to just take your colon out And my question was Easier for whom  Appalled at the idea of losing her large intestine Duffs family feverishly searched for alternative treatments on the internet One of them turned up an article about a doctor in Australia Thomas Borody who had been treating C diff with an unusual process known as faecal transplant or faecal microbiota transplantation FMT Clostridium difficile is an obnoxious microbe usually kept in check by other bacteria in our guts Problems arise when antibiotics remove some of these friendly bacteria allowing C diff to take over One doctor compares it to the hooligan on the bus who is prevented from doing any harm by the sheer number of people on board A course of antibiotics is equivalent to some of these people getting off at a stop allowing the hooligan to run wild About  of a persons faeces is bacteria and a faecal transplant is like a whole new busload of people  the friendly bacteria  being hustled on board  Its an emerging but not new treatment Chinese medicine has recommended swallowing small doses of faecal matter for some ailments for  years Its also a treatment option in veterinary medicine In  a Denver surgeon Ben Eiseman used faecal transplants to treat an inflammation of the colon He wrote the procedure up in a journal article which years later inspired Thomas Borody to try the radical treatment on patients with C diff Now the head of the Centre for Digestive Diseases in New South Wales Borody has recorded some striking successes  Duff showed the article about Borody to her gastroenterologist her infectious diseases consultant and her colorectal surgeon But none of them had performed a faecal transplant and none was willing to try When Duff said that she intended to administer the treatment herself with her husbands faeces the gastroenterologist agreed to send a sample away to be screened for disease After they received the allclear to use the stool it was Duffs husband John that donned plastic gloves and assiduously followed the instructions they found online He was no doctor but as a retired submarine commander Duff considered him equal to the task He was in the habit of spending months at a time in a metal tube with over  men Duff says As a result nothing grosses him out So he was the one that made the donation and then mixed it in a blender with saline and then he gave it to me in an enema My husband kissed me after I lay down and told me not to worry that everything was going to be OK and that it was going to work Then he threw away the blender Duff lay on her back with her legs in the air trying to hold the foreign material in her body  She lasted four hours before needing to go to the toilet They started the process at  in the afternoon By  that night she felt almost completely better And I had been literally dying the day before she says I was going into renal failure  I was dying Lots of people die from Clostridium difficile In the US the figure is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be  per year while in England and Wales  deaths from C diff were recorded in   Even though antibiotics cause the disease most patients are cured by more antibiotics But for some the problem returns after every course of drugs as it did for Catherine Duff There is growing recognition that faecal transplant is the best way to treat patients like these In the   published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year  of patients were cured by the treatment whereas a course of antibiotics cured just  The disparity was so huge that the researchers stopped the trial early on the grounds that it was unethical to deny the better cure to the cohort assigned antibiotics Dozens of other trials involving faecal transplants are either in progress or have recently been completed Dr Ilan Youngster was one of the authors of a pilot study published in April in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases which found that using frozen faecal samples administered topdown through a  tube in the nose was as effective as using fresh samples in a bottomup procedure  Youngster admits that even when frozen faeces have a slight smell Its not a very pleasant treatment especially from a psychological point of view he says But we have yet to encounter a sick person with C diff who has refused this treatment Its a horrible disease We had a patient with cancer that contracted C diff and he said If I could get rid of one of these two diseases please get rid of the C diff In the US the FDA Food and Drug Administration has puzzled over how to regulate faecal transplant but some doctors do offer the treatment usually by colonoscopy Catherine Duff who set up the patient advocacy group the Fecal Transplant Foundation at the beginning of  originally listed  providers on her website Now there are about   But she says thats nowhere near enough and people are dying because there is no provider close to their home Even if those doctors did nothing but faecal transplant  hours a day seven days a week they couldnt meet the need she says  Dr Alexander Khoruts at the University of Minnesota says clinics are concerned that offering faecal transplant could scare other patients away as the smell is unmistakeable Imagine blending stool in a clinic space  the aesthetic problems with that are not trivial When you click on the blend button and the surface area of that faecal material increases thousands of folds in a matter of seconds it is quite potent  The difficulty of getting to a clinic that offers faecal transplant and abundant availability of free faeces explains why many continue to opt for what Duff and her husband did in   a selfadministered transplant She estimates that for every procedure that takes place in a clinic scores more occur in bedrooms and bathrooms around the US A website The Power of Poop is full of tips and personal stories to help people with their first athome faecal transplant and a Facebook group under the name Sally Brown shares advice from patients who have immersed themselves in the science of gut microbiota  Alongside the science there is humour and Duffs Fecal Transplant Foundation is planning to bring out a range of merchandise including sweatshirts beverage holders baseball caps and bumper stickers with unique and possibly hysterically funny slogans alongside the foundations awarenessraising brown ribbon Most DIY faecal transplant patients are in fact not suffering from C diff but from a range of other diseases that they believe the procedure will help and which doctors are not willing or allowed to treat with faecal transplant They include conditions that would appear to have very little to do with gut bacteria  including MS autism and diabetes  but the most common ailments treated are the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohns and ulcerative colitis   The efficacy of faecal transplant on these diseases  which around  million people suffer from in the US  is uncertain Dr Elaine Petrof an infectious diseases specialist at Kingston General Hospital Ontario says that for C diff sufferers taking antibiotics is like throwing gasoline on a weedridden lawn What youve done is youve killed the weeds but youve also killed the grass So youre now left with a charred barren destroyed piece of land and you have to put seeds back on there to get stuff to grow again or the else the weeds will just come back She goes on With Crohns disease its different Now youre dealing with another garden full of weeds if you like So then youre trying to replace a bad ecosystem thats already taken hold with another ecosystem Thats got to be much trickier and more difficult to accomplish In  on the very day her husband died from lung cancer Sky Curtis found herself sitting with her yearold son in a doctors waiting room in Toronto He was curled up in a ball in pain with bloody diarrhoea a fever cankers in his mouth a rash on his face and boils on his legs He was later diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and informed that his colon would have to be removed Like Catherine Duff Curtis searched for alternative medicines and came across Thomas Borody in Australia She gave him a call He talked to me for hours at a time she says The man is a saint  Curtis found a local doctor who was willing to prescribe a series of drugs which Borody recommended Her son went into remission but later fell sick again with a new diagnosis of Crohns With her son wasting away in front of her eyes she called Borody again and he suggested a faecal transplant I decided after hemming and hawing and talking to my son that yes he would let me put poo up his bum to see if that would work she recalls She had a sample of her own stool screened and they performed their first transplant on Christmas Day  I kept thinking Im giving my kid a bag of faeces for Christmas It wasnt ideal but he was just so sick and I knew if I waited until after the Christmas holidays he would be dead  The first few transplants Curtis says sortof worked She then toyed with Borodys protocol and on the basis of personal research into her sons condition changed the frequency of the transplants and gave him painkillers antiinflammatory drugs sedatives and steroid creams Bit by bit he got better Curtis was left from this ordeal with material for a memoir and her own protocol developed through trialanderror experiments with her sons treatment This became a handbook that is now one of the key works in the DIY faecal transplant community  Curtiss story is an inspiration to many but the impact of faecal transplant on inflammatory bowel diseases is unpredictable and varies from patient to patient Unlike Curtiss son some find they have to continue performing transplants to sustain their health A team at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York hopes to start a study soon identifying the subgroups of patients that will potentially benefit from the treatment  We have to prove the science says Dr Ashish Atreja from the hospital Because if we cant prove the science really works then we are creating an optimism which is not genuine Curtis says she has had plenty of people thanking her for her book and so far no feedback from disappointed patients or criticism from doctors Advocates of faecal transplant insist that it is safe and point out that there are no published reports of anyone becoming ill as a result of the procedure Its about as dangerous as changing a babys diaper says Curtis  Dr Lawrence Brandt at Montefiore Medical Center in New York one of the first advocates of the procedure in the US agrees that the administration of stool in an enema is reasonably safe but he worries that some people may be doing it before other treatment options have been explored or after a faulty diagnosis  Ilan Youngster agrees We wouldnt want anyone out there getting a stool transplant just because they feel they would benefit from it he says A bigger concern is that they are using untested stool At Brandts clinic donors are screened for a long list of infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis and are subjected to a battery of questions about their lifestyle and habits Donors with allergies and heart disease are excluded as well those who have recently taken antibiotics  We had one woman who said Can I use my dogs stool says Brandt Im sure that there are some people out there who are saying Well I have a horse Hes pretty healthy and he has an adequate supply of stool  Ill use his stool But using animal stool is absolutely not recommended Curtis like all faecal transplant advocates agrees that it is vital to get stool samples tested but says that unfortunately only a few per cent of athome patients do this  For many patients the choice of donor is often about more than just choosing someone with healthy stool she says It is important that the donor feels psychologically right because their poo is going into the sick persons body In the online faecal transplant community patients occasionally refer to their donors as poop angels  In November  Edward Bondurant had a very strange conversation with a friend he had known since he was five I just said well you have something that you do every day that might change my life I knew this person better than my brother but I still felt odd asking  but he immediately said yes Bondurant has suffered with ulcerative colitis since  on and off When it flares up he says you need to be  steps from the bathroom  and sometimes thats two steps too many The drugs he takes for it are expensive  around   a dose  and have bad sideeffects  Bondurants first attempt at faecal transplant was a messy disaster but he is now something of a pro able to do his job as a financial adviser while adopting the best positions needed for the faecal matter to slip into his colon I have actually had long conversations doing large business deals for large sums of money while hanging upside down he says  Although Bondurant still takes drugs when his colitis flares up he does regular faecal transplants to keep the disease at bay  he has now done more than  He can adapt his schedule to his donors body clock He only lives five blocks away so Bondurant either swings by his house or his donor letting himself into Bondurants house with his own key drops off his droppings leaving them in Tupperware in his fridge But there is no medical reason why you need to be best friends with your faecal donor At the beginning of  two friends at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started OpenBiome a nonprofit making stool bank Deposits from three fullyscreened donors are kept in ml bottles at C before being shipped to hospitals for   each A frozen stool bank gets around the logistical problems of handling fresh faeces and the time delay involved in screening new donors So far  little bottles have been sent to  hospitals A recently proposed rule from the FDA that donors should be known to the patient or the doctor administering the faecal transplant threatens OpenBiomes business model but the owners are still feeling upbeat about the future Their latest venture is in capsules containing faeces Similar products have been trialled successfully by researchers at the University of Calgary and Ilan Youngster is currently working on a further study Thomas Borody also uses them  he calls them crapsules Taking faecal tablets although still revolting as a concept is less invasive than a colonoscopy or enema A different vision of the future of the treatment is a move away from faeces altogether Instead patients would receive a live bacterial culture targeted to fight Clostridium difficile  in effect a synthetic stool  Although it would be developed from faecal samples it would only need to contain a handful of strains of bacteria not the hundreds present in excrement which would make its impact on the human gut more reproducible and understandable  Trevor Lawley at the Sanger Institute in the UK is down to just  strains in his synthetic stool He is in the process of overcoming a series of technical problems such as how to grow these anaerobic organisms and prevent them from evolving before they can be used But he says the real challenge in the emerging field of live biotherapeutics is how to regulate it   Meanwhile in Canada Dr Petrof has already cured C diff in two patients using a synthetic solution containing  strains of bacteria grown inside a robogut an imitation colon  Faecal transplant she says works But Ill be the first to admit its crude Its essentially like pouring sewage into people Her synthetic stool on the other hand smells a lot less obnoxious and is a sterilelooking milky colour  Its still the same concept of using a microbial ecosystem or community of bacteria says Petrof But were just moving away from taking it out of the toilet Follow   on Twitter and
