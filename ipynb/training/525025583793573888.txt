Aerial drones are targeting a new enemy malaria Four hundred feet above a Malaysian forest a threefoot eBee drone hovers and takes pictures with a megapixel camera every  to  seconds But its not gathering images of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria Even todays best drones arent capable of such a photographic marvel Rather the drone is looking at a changing landscape that holds clues to the diseases spread The malaria drone mission described in a study published Oct  in   began in December  when UK scientists decided to track a rare strain of the mosquitoborne disease that has surged near Southeast Asian cities Understanding deforestation may be the key in seeing how this kind of malaria known as   is transmitted The mosquitoes that carry   are forest dwellers The insects breed in cool pools of water under the forest canopy and sap blood from macaque monkeys that harbor the malaria parasite In Sabah Malaysia human cases of this kind of malaria didnt surface until about  years ago says infectious disease specialist Kimberly Fornace of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine She is leading the drone study While cases of the most common malaria strains   during this time   has thrived Its now the numberone cause of malaria in the region Fornace and her team suspect that human intrusion into forested areas has created more opportunities for the disease to pass between primates and humans via mosquitoes The drone imagery theyve collected so far suggests there were occasions where land development forced macaques within closer proximity of humans who then developed malaria As part of a project called   the team tracks outbreaks by comparing the drones land surveillance with hospital records of malaria cases Meanwhile a local wildlife commission has fitted macaques with GPS collars which let scientists monitor the locations of monkey troops Together this information paints a public health map that explains how land development has influenced monkey movements  and transmission of malaria to humans In partnership with   an organization that builds drones for under  Fornace and her team plan to build a drone that snaps thermal images of macaques so the monkeys can someday be identified without GPS collars Drones provide a better surveillance picture than satellite images which are the current standard for mapping environmental changes But Google Earth images for example are only updated every few weeks or months says parasitologist Chris Drakeley of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who coauthored the   study with Fornace Drones he says can provide a more comprehensive continuous picture We avoid cloud cover and can see what the land use was like today next week and the week after The public health implications of drone use extend far beyond malaria says Harvard epidemiologist   Doctors have already used unmanned aircraft to carry medical supplies between rural clinics in   and   Humanitarian drones also tracked property damage and hunted for survivors after   And when a disease like Ebola surfaces a drone could scan for changes in bats habitats given that the winged mammals are proposed carriers of the hemorrhagic fever The prices of these   while their specs  flight performance and cameras    says Eagle All of which means in a few years a series of very inexpensive aerial vehicles will exist for wider use in public health research
