Ouch Youve heard about it on television and in movies  but can the penis actually be broken Though   is a rare occurrence for men it   a risk and certainly something men need to be careful about in the course of their sexual lives Men are not issued an owners manual for the penis says Drogo Montague MD the section head of urology at the Cleveland Clinic Many of them dont know that a penile fracture is even a possibility According to Dr Montague there are two ways your penis can break  through a penile fracture or through a penile fracture or because you have something called Peyronies disease Penile fracture is a relatively uncommon condition that occurs in young men he says If severe force is applied to a fully erect penis the erection may rupture  which is more likely to occur if the womans on top This often is accompanied by severe pain and an audible popping noise explains Montague The penis then swells and turns black and blue In about  percent of penile fracture cases the urethra or urinary channel also is injured Men experiencing penile fracture should immediately seek the attention of an urologist This is a surgical emergency warns Montague  if you dont seek immediate treatment penile fractures can lead to scarring deformity and even   The second cause of penis breaks Peyronies disease  an abnormal curvature of the penis caused by scarring of erectile tissue  is not quite as serious but it certainly shouldnt be ignored Peyronies disease is a relatively common disorder that occurs in least  percent of men explains Montague It tends to occur in midlife when erections while still suitable for sexual intercourse are less rigid than normal and more susceptible to bending injuries These injuries which harm the erection chambers are caused by less force than is needed for penile fractures and the site of the injury is usually farther out in the shaft of the penis Aggressive or risky   can play a role so you may want to think twice before having overthetop acrobatic sex Men should avoid any situation in which the erect penis is forcefully bent says Montague The force necessary to cause this injury may occur during sexual intercourse when the partner is on top and bends too far forward or backward Also if the penis slips out of the vagina and the man rapidly attempts to reinsert it and misses the penis may hit the partners pubic bone also creating this type of injury The good news is that if you break your penis the condition is highly treatable The bad news says Montague is that many men are too embarrassed to do anything about it Because of embarrassment men with penile fracture may not seek medical attention he says As a result they will recover slowly and the swelling and bruising of the penis will disappear as the body forms scar tissue to repair the injury The scar that forms however is likely to be larger than it would have been if the tear had been surgically repaired This large scar is usually palpable and most often is present on one side near the base of the penis Because the scar is not elastic the erect penis may bend toward the side that is scarred If you see a doctor about your injury it can usually be treated easily with surgery Prompt surgical repair is important for penile fracture because it results in more rapid recovery and it helps to maintain straight erections for the future says Montague During this procedure most often performed by a urologist a blood clot that has formed will be removed and the tear in the penis will be repaired  and if there is also an injury to the urethra this is repaired as well
