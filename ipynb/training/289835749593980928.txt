Breathalyzer tests are usually associated with getting stopped for drunk driving but similar tests may soon detect lifethreatening lung conditions according to a new  Researchers at the University of Vermont suspected that infected lungs may produce unique volatile organic compounds VOCs in the breath as a result of respiratory illness In a study of mice they have identified the chemical fingerprints of bacteria that are often present in respiratory conditions such as   The researchers infected one group of mice with strains of   and   two bacteria that are often present in acute and chronic lung infections After  hours they analyzed the exhaled breaths of the infected mice as well as those of a second group of healthy mice using a sophisticated method calledÂ breathprint SESIMS that can detect trace molecules of chemical compounds When the researchers compared the chemical profiles of infected and healthy mice they discovered significant statistical differences and in the infected mice they were able to identify specific species and strains of bacteria Based on their findings they believe analysis of exhaled breath could potentially help doctors quickly pinpoint specific types of lung infections We have strong evidence that we can distinguish between bacterial infections of the lung in mice very effectively using the breathprint SESIMS approach and I suspect that we will also be able to distinguish between bacterial viral and fungal   said   Currently lung infections such as   The lengthy medical history evaluation can involve a number of tests including chest Xrays skin tests and blood evaluations According to the World Health Organization WHO   with  million deaths While the majority of tuberculosis cases were found in developing countries in Asia and Africa wealthier nations are not immune The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported   The new study findings could pave the way for a fast and simple test to detect tuberculosis and other respiratory infections according to Dr Hill Breath analysis would reduce the timetodiagnosis to just minutes
