Waking up during a surgery would be a nightmare yet thats a regular problem for patients in lowincome countries Sketchy power grids mean the lights often go out and with them the anesthesia machine In other cases there are too few oxygen tanks for a surgery so its canceled Two decades ago Dr Paul Fenton faced those hurdles almost daily while working as an anesthesiologist at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre Malawi The hospital had plenty of anesthesia machines each provided by a wellintentioned western charity but none were practical for his clinic So I began tinkering with these old machines and took a few bits and pieces from each recounts Fenton The result was a prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine UAM which delivers anesthesia without oxygen tanks or the need of stable power grid The device sucks regular air from a room using a compressor and turns it into purified oxygen for a patients lungs The UAM uses electricity when its available but if the power goes off a healthcare worker can run the machine with a handpowered pump on top At the same time an electronic display which tracks the amount of oxygen the patient receives can switch to a tenhour backup battery So he ended up inventing a whole new kind of anesthesia machine He also wanted the machine to be easy to maintain When parts break in the UAM replacements can be purchased at a local auto shop Fentons invention took home the top health prize at the   on Nov  Hosted by Silicon Valleys Tech Museum of Innovation since  the awards salute ten innovations each year that tackle urgent humanitarian problems Global access to anesthesia definitely falls into that category Nearly   are performed each year without a proper supply of oxygen and anesthesia The hope is that the UAM will enable more people in the poorest parts of the world to get the surgeries they need Fenton partnered with   in  to scale up global distribution So far  have been distributed to  countries providing oxygen for over  surgeries Sierra Leone is one recipient and the doctors are grateful There is only one oxygen tankcompany in the country in the capital of Freetown This company often fails to meet demand in the city while clinics outside of Freetown may lack access completely says Dr John Sampson of Johns Hopkins University Sampson is training clinicians both in Sierra Leone and in the US on how to use UAM during emergency scenarios
