Along with Australia the UK can probably claim to be the toughest nation in the world when it comes to trying to stub out smoking Take a look at what has happened over the past decade There has been a ban on smoking in public places the introduction of graphic warnings on packs and a ban on shops displaying tobacco products  Now it appears standardised packaging is going to be introduced following hotonthe heels of the decision last month to ban smoking in cars when children are present Some areas are even looking at banning smoking in squares and parks  Only the home remains sacrosanct it seems  and smoking lobby group Forest has even wryly suggested that will be next on the hit list But do these measures work A quick glance at the smoking rate can give the impression they dont Lets look at what has happened over the past  years This is the period when governments have been particularly active In the mid s  of people smoked By  that had fallen to  By comparison the  years before that  the mid s to mid s  saw the rate fall from  What is more even this latest step is only likely to have a modest impact   the paediatrician who reviewed the evidence on standardised packaging for the government last year Does that mean that tough legislation doesnt work Not necessarily The proportion of smokers used to be so high that it was only natural as the evidence grew about the risks the numbers would fall relatively quickly What you are left with is the hardcore group of smokers This is the point we have reached now  hence the desire among health experts to keep pushing for ever tougher measures Action on Smoking and Healths chief executive Deborah Arnott says I think we should consider what has happened for the last decade or two a real success It gets harder as you go on but the figures are still falling  It impossible to prove exactly what impact each piece of legislation has had and you have to see it all in context of the health awareness campaigns that have been run too Whatever we are doing it is working Focussing solely on the numbers of smokers also misses an important element of what campaigners and ministers are trying to achieve with the legislation  Firstly some of it has been aimed at reducing exposure to secondhand smoke  something that the smoking ban in public places certainly achieved according to   Secondly as well as reducing the numbers of people who smoke the aim has been  to stop people taking it up in the first place Since the s the proportion of the population which has never smoked increased from  to  And in recent years the progress in discouraging children from taking up smoking has been particularly impressive  Between  and  the number of yearolds who regular smoked hovered between  and  according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre Since then it has dropped to  This is what ministers and health campaigners call denormalising smoking  and in trying to achieve that goal it could be said no stone is being left unturned Follow Nick on
