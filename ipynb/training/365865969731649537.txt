    DEXTER Ore  Its  am on a warm July Wednesday and the parade of patients is already lining up for Mary Fey a family nurse practitioner on the front lines of health reform in this rural community  miles south of Portland  Theres the yearold guy with a Hobo spider bite and high blood pressure the yearold with a sore shoulder from a tractor accident the yearold with allergies the yearold with dementia  They all come to Fey the sole primary care provider for nearly  miles in this region where doctors are in short supply  and the January launch of Obamacare is expected to make it worse  Im pushing  patients now and thats going to increase said Fey  who refers to the coming changes as the onslaught  Like nurse practitioners across the US Fey is girding for the onset of reforms put in place by the  Affordable Care Act which offers some  million Americans new access to health insurance  but no guarantee of access to care  It will be better but its painful to get to something better said Fey Experts estimate the US is already short more than  primary care physicians   to  by  according to the Association of American Medical Colleges  If newly insured Americans are going to get care under the federal health overhaul its Fey and her colleagues who will have to help fill the gap analysts say  To me nurse practitioners could be a huge huge solution to this problem of primary care shortage said Dr Thomas Bodenheimer a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine NPs as theyre sometimes known are registered nurses who hold graduate degrees and can perform virtually all of the functions of frontline family doctors  depending on the laws of the state theyre in They can do  to  percent of what the docs can do said Bodenheimer a medical doctor who practiced primary care himself for three decades  More patients are recognizing that Between  and  the number of Medicare patients treated by NPs increased fold to more than  people University of Texas Medical Branch researchers  But advocates say that many of the nations  nurse practitioners including about  who practice primary care are hamstrung by state laws that limit their authority  In at least  states including Oregon NPs practice independently without the supervision of physicians Fey for instance operated on her own for  years as the Lakeside Clinic in Dexter working from the same small building shes now in  In  she sold her practice to PeaceHealth Medical Group a Catholicrun health system whose mission included continuing the rural clinic said Mary Anne McMurren an administrator  But in most other states socalled scope of practice laws limit NPs ability to diagnose treat and prescribe medications without physician supervision  Some physician groups including the American Medical Association have opposed expanding scopeofpractice laws saying that close oversight of NPs helps guarantee patient safety and satisfaction  Nurses are critical to the health care team but there is no substitute for education and training Dr Rebecca J Patchin a member of the AMA board of trustees said in  setting off a stillrunning debate Physicians have seven or more years of postgraduate education and more than  hours of clinical experience Patchin noted NPs have two to three years of postgraduate education and less clinical experience  That argument bothers NPs like Fey who jokingly chides patients who refer to her as a physician and says she never wanted to be a doctor I wanted to be something different Repeated studies   and MDs show that patients of NPs do as well or better in terms of health outcomes and satisfaction  I think we can provide primary care services to most people most of the time Fey said  That will be more vital than ever in a country where more than  million Americans live in primary care shortage areas places where it can be difficult or impossible to obtain basic care from a doctor Bodenheimer said Its gotten worse in recent years as fewer medical students  less than  percent studies show  are choosing primary care opting instead for the higher pay enhanced prestige and better worklife balance of specialty medicine  Of the more than  doctors in the US who spend most of their time in direct patient care only about onethird or  are primary care specialists according to a  report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  No ones sure yet how the health overhaul will affect the demand for primary care services  except that there will be a need for more said Karen Daley president of the American Nurses Association or ANA  Its really about making sure that nurse practitioners are practicing to the full extent of their licensing and their training she said  But on this busy summer weekday Fey is leaving those larger issues to the politicians Shes got her hands full with a patient load thats growing by the hour  When I started I had eight patients for the day but now Ive had  for the morning said Fey Theres no hint of hurry though as she enters the rooms of patients like Garth Hiaasen  a local bartender who had a runin with a Hobo spider His left ankle is red hot and swollen to the size of a golf ball but his real problem is his blood pressure Its   and not for the first time  You do not need to be a yearold man with a heart attack or stroke Fey lectured giving him a prescription for medication  and a hug  Thats the same tough love Fey employs with all of her patients from Jef Jalof the yearold hurt in a tractor accident to yearold Willetta Ruth Cosby  friends call her Okie  who has severe dementia and a bladder infection that may be making it worse  She figures there are about  people in her coverage area including many with common chronic ailments diabetes obesity heart disease She anticipates that expanded access to insurance will spawn a flood of new patients who havent had health care in years They have  things wrong and they save it up she said Then they say Why cant you fix me Mary  Come January Feys practice could jump as much as  percent and her patients likely will face longer waits Instead of getting an appointment the next day they might have to wait a week she says  Thats a scenario that could be echoed across the country said Dr Atul Grover chief public policy officer for the AAMC which is tracking the doctor shortage He believes that nurse practitioners  and other health workers  must become part of a new kind of primary care team in that uses all types medical providers to furthest extent of their abilities  In the meantime itll be a bumpy road as the nation lurches toward health care reform Its going to take us a while to catch up Grover said  How long Thats the milliondollar question
