What does it mean to have a toilet We in the West dont spend much time pondering that question on or off the toilet Its something thats always in the background that keeps everything else moving says Sam Drabble of   WSUP a Londonbased nonprofit It allows us to live very busy lives and its not something we ever need to think about Others arent so fortunate Geeta has no toilet near her home in northern India she treks  miles in the dark to a field for privacy If Vanessas school had private bathrooms the yearold wouldnt have to miss class when shes having her period In Ecuador Reverside  wouldnt have to visit her brothers house to use his toilet which is shared by nine other people from different families These are some of the stories told and shown in a new exhibit called   put together by WSUP and the Panos Pictures photo agency to mark   The sixdaylong exhibit which opened Monday at the Royal Opera Arcade Gallery in London features images from  countries  Brazil to Kenya to the US Each subject poses next to what she uses as a toilet and tells her story of why a latrine matters Among the  billion people without access to a clean and proper toilet  more than a billion of whom defecate out in the open  women and girls are hit hardest Drabble says Thats often the case in lowerincome countries throughout South and Southeast Asia as well as subSaharan Africa Indeed the theme of World Toilet Day this year is how women suffer when they lack a proper toilet Without running water or plumbing many resort to unsafe and squalid alternatives A toilet may simply be a hole in the ground or a space in an open field In some parts of South Asia    bamboo huts with a hole cut out in the floor suspended  feet above a pond  are common The consequences of such precarious solutions go beyond health Drabble says Also at risk are education employment opportunities personal dignities your privacy and your security Geeta comes from the Indian village where two teenage girls were   over the summer while relieving themselves in a field In Africa   skips school during menstruation or completely drops out So while you may not have a deep connection with your toilet Drabble asks that you reconsider The exhibit is designed to give a sense of the global nature of this problem and the universality of the subject And then think how different Geetas life would be if she had a toilet in her home
