Alzheimers disease isnt what it used to be After  years of having doctors diagnose the disease by symptoms alone researchers and advocacy groups are calling for new diagnostic criteria that recognize changes in the brain as well as changes in behavior The goal is to eventually allow doctors to diagnose preclinical Alzheimers in patients who do not have problems with memory or thinking but who do have an abnormal brain scan or some other sign that the disease may be developing More than  million Americans fall within the existing diagnostic criteria for Alzheimers according to the latest   from the Alzheimers Association The current symptombased diagnosis is really a representation of a disease process thats been happening in the body for potentially  to  years says   vice president of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimers Association That process includes the accumulation of   or   in the brain and eventually the death of brain cells Its becoming possible to detect those signs of trouble using brain scans tests of spinal fluid or   and other socalled biomarkers Carrillo says These markers can tell us that underlying biology is really changing in the body before memory starts to change she says Biomarker tests are still costly or painful or unreliable But eventually they should make it possible to identify people at high risk for Alzheimers much the way cholesterol tests identify people at high risk for heart disease Carrillo says And that could make it easier to do something about Alzheimers We havent completely obliterated heart disease But weve reduced risk by about  percent Carrillo says We can do the same for Alzheimers disease At the moment there arent any treatments that slow down the disease But that could change because of something known as the   says   principal investigator of the study and researcher at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital The study will test whether or not we can slow the earliest cognitive changes that people experience years before they get to the stage of dementia says Sperling The A study which has just started enrollment   more than  sites around the country and about  patients The participants cant have symptoms of Alzheimers when they enter the study but must have brain scans showing a buildup of amyloid plaque Some of the participants will receive an experimental drug that helps clear amyloid from the brain This drug like several others failed to help people in the later stages of Alzheimers But the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in people who started taking it when they still had only mild symptoms If it does the same thing for people who havent developed symptoms Sperling says Wed make a huge dent in preventing dementia It will take about five years to know whether the drug is working In the meantime its important to begin identifying people with preclinical Alzheimers Sperling says That approach paid off in diseases like diabetes and HIV where screening tests came along well before good treatments were available she says With Alzheimers better biomarker tests and effective treatments may arrive at nearly the same time Its a race Sperling says We need to develop these screening tests and the biomarkers simultaneously with working on these clinical trials so that if we succeed were prepared for how we would go about screening individuals to receive those treatments Millions of people in the US could potentially benefit from a drug that prevents or delays Alzheimers About  percent of people older than  have amyloid plaque building up in their brains Sperling says
