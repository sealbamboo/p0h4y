Ofeibea QuistArcton has spent the past week covering the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone Shes seen a mix of emotions fear panic denial  and this past weekend a fervent belief in a rather unusual ritual I didnt use the word bizarre You did Maybe   It was on Saturday very early in the morning There was this buzz Everybody was talking Mothers were calling their grown children up at    oclock in the morning to pray over salt water and then bathe in it Some were told to drink a little People were being woken out of a deep sleep to perform this ritual literally in the middle of the night We were told there were instances of town criers going up and down the streets instructing people to bathe with hot salt water And it was Christians and Muslims It may be an indicator of how much Ebola is taking hold of peoples consciousness It just swept everybody away It was certainly widespread and not just in the capital The calls and texts and Whatsapp messages were spinning around the country My totally unscientific survey tells me that three people in Freetown did not bathe in hot salt water Ofeibeia QuistArcton a friend and a young student who said to me that he believes in Allah and not such rituals We were told that imams and pastors were instructing people to do this I dont know how much truth there is in that Take hot water add the salt say prayers over it and then bathe with it in a bathtub or sluice your body from a pail And it was babies being bathed with it elderly people everybody It was not a case of educated and not educated It was everyone I asked Is it the prayer part that is important You were told to do it but to what end And people said We need to pray this was an instruction And it has apparently spread to Nigeria as well One cynical friend said to me I bet you it was the salt sellers Apparently the price of salt shot up Another said with all this hot water salt bathing therell be no salt for cooking the rest of the weekend Yup Some people said they were told to drink a little and then bathe But not everybody did that Im not a doctor but I think youd have to drink bucketsfull for that to happen Its a mirror into Sierra Leones psyche at the moment  that so many people obeyed this directive that didnt come from the health ministry or aid agencies There are plenty of awareness posters around about what you should and should not do to prevent Ebola Hot salt water baths are not featured on them It stays with you Its such a massive story And West Africa is my home region Once you leave the area affected you cant just drop it The story will follow me around
