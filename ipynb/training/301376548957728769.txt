If you find yourself in the emergency department and the doctor says he wants to keep you at the hospital for observation take heed Depending on the hospital observation can mean very different things for both your medical care and your wallet At its best placing patients on observation allows hospital staff to closely monitor and intensively treat patients whose condition is unstable or unclear They might have chest pain for example or need a little time to recover from a migraine or an asthma attack before being sent home This type of outpatient care is sometimes provided in a special observation unit with a dedicated team that follows clearly defined treatment protocols About one third of hospitals have them Within  hours they   whether a patient needs to be admitted to the hospital or can be sent home But other times patients who are kept for observation dont get special care  they are simply sent to a regular hospital bed and treated no differently than someone whos been admitted In those cases observation may be no more than a billing designation that allows hospitals to move patients out of   and avoid potential insurance reimbursement problems for inappropriate admissions Those patients who are kept for observation sometimes find themselves with hefty bills according to a recent   in the   Thats because observation care is considered outpatient care and many insurance plans charge a la carte for every blood test Xray or scan In contrast patients   just a single copayment if theyre admitted to the hospital regardless of the specific services received If youre not in a dedicated unit you should be having your hand on your wallet and really pushing back hard if youre there longer than  hours says   a physician and senior researcher at Rand a public policy research organization So if the emergency department doctor says he wants to keep you around for observation it behooves you  or a family member  to ask a few questions A lot of the patients that are very angry about this are those that are getting bills months later with no communication says Christopher Baugh the medical director of the emergency department observation unit at Brigham and Womens hospital in Boston These discussions need to happen in real time
