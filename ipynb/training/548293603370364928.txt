With a revolutionary new therapy letting a man take his first steps after being paralysed and the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa it has been a year of incredible highs and devastating lows It has seen hints that HIV is getting milder as well as new vaginas and old wombs being transplanted for the first time  Heres a round up of the year in medical science Darek Fidyka is the    He was paralysed after being stabbed repeatedly in the back in an attack in  but he can now walk again after a pioneering therapy  The worldfirst treatment involved taking cells from his nasal cavity which constantly regenerate and placing them into his spinal cord Scientists believe the transplanted olfactory ensheathing cells enabled nerve fibres above and below the injury to reconnect It is early days and his steps are still tentative but when reserved scientists describe his progress as more impressive than man walking on the moon you know something significant just happened The Ebola outbreak   but nobody expected what followed  Before this year just  people had died from Ebola since the virus was first discovered in the s and most outbreaks had been rapidly contained  But in the current outbreak more than  cases and  deaths have been record This is not just the biggest Ebola outbreak in history it is bigger than all the others combined  In has seen an unprecedented response and a hunt for new treatments Vaccine and drugs trials which would normally take place on a timescale of years and decades    Yet the outbreak is still not under control  An unexpected story from the University of Oxford suggested HIV was evolving   They showed HIV was being forced to make damaging mutations to itself in order to survive the counteroffensive by our immune systems Scientists said the gradual watering down of HIV meant the virus was replicating more slowly and taking longer to cause Aids in Botswana the country where the study took place Meanwhile an outstanding feat of viral archaeology traced the origin of the Aids pandemic to   in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo It all happened in the era of black and white film and the tailend of the European empires when a perfect storm of population growth sex and railways allowed HIV to spread There was nothing short of a scandal in medical science this year  In January   promised to transform medicine By December the lead researcher   in shame  Along the way her supervisor   at his laboratory in an apparent suicide It was claimed that stem cells  those cells that can become any other and hold great promise in medicine  could be made cheaply and quickly by shocking normal cells in acid The development of STAP cells stimulustriggered acquisition of pluripotency was a frontpage story on newspapers around the world and provoked reactions such as my God thats a game changer from scientists  Yet it was simply too good to be true  Researchers coming together on message boards quickly became suspicious that the results had been faked Dr Obokata was found guilty of misconduct and no other research group in the world has been able to reproduce her findings  It was another medical first as  said hello to the   The yearold mother was born without a uterus but received the organ donation from a friend who had gone through the menopause The womb was transplanted for a year before doctors felt comfortable enough to attempt a pregnancy by implanting an embryo that had been produced through IVF A premature but healthy boy was born eight months later  The achievement at the University of Gothenburg raises hopes for other women left without a functioning womb after cancer treatment or because of birth defects  On a slightly different note   in the laboratory A biodegradable tubular scaffold was designed to be the right size and shape for each woman A small biopsy from the poorly developed vulva in each woman was used to grow a large batch of cells in the laboratory Muscle cells were attached to the outside of the scaffold and vaginallining cells to the inside All women reported normal levels of desire arousal lubrication orgasm satisfaction after the vaginas were implanted In two of the women the vagina was connected to the uterus giving them a chance of becoming pregnant Fat is the big bad guy in our diets right Maybe not Swapping butter for a sunflower spread may not lower chances of a heart attack after all according    Meanwhile there has been a sustained fight against sugar The World Health Organization has   saying recommended sugar intake should be fewer than  of total calorie intake a day but people should really be aiming for  The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in England   It would mean one ml can of fizzy pop would take a typical adult up to the proposed  daily allowance without factoring in sugar from any other source But at least a Mediterranean diet   according to research although if you want to cut your blood pressure it seems   is key Scientists from Oxford Cambridge Harvard Manchester and Surrey universities joined forces as part of the   to warn society had become supremely arrogant in ignoring the importance of sleep They said cancer heart disease type diabetes infections and obesity have all been linked to reduced sleep Yet people and governments were failing to take the problem seriously  Earlier in the year studies showed night shifts   The damaging effect of light in the evening has also been one of the themes of the year  A US study compared book and lightemitting ereaders to show that people using the latter   have less deep sleep and are more tired the next morning  And bedrooms light enough to see across were linked to an   A whole functioning organ was grown from scratch   by scientists  A group of cells were genetically reprogrammed to become thymus cells and were mixed with other supportrole cells and placed inside a mouse  Once inside the bunch of cells developed into a functional thymus and produced a component of the immune system called Tcells which fight infection The researchers said This is a very exciting advance and its also very tantalising in terms of the wider field of regenerative medicine In  science has shown And heres a New Years resolution for yougive up on handshakes after all
