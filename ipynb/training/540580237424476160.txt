The   opened at NYU Langone Medical Center in August Its different For starters an older patients first visit with cardiologist Dr John A Dodson the programs director takes a full hour Beyond taking a complete history Dr Dodson looks for frailty by measuring things like gait and grip strength and administers a short test of cognitive ability  things geriatricians routinely do and cardiologists mostly dont The No  difference is time he told me in an interview To be able to spend an hour with a new patient is a gift In January when a pharmacist joins the program Dr Dodson will start asking patients to bring in all their prescription drug bottles for review They may be taking redundant medications or the wrong medications he explained Where we can we will peel away whats not essential The conversation expands to include less medical topics too the patients goals the extent of family support endoflife preferences The NYU program is one of only a handful of geriatric cardiology programs that have sprouted up around the country including the first so far as we know at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in  and a similar program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center More are likely to follow At Vanderbilt I talk about living wills and health care proxies and why theyre important said Dr Susan Bell a cardiologist and geriatrician  the clinic director Is this the person who wants quality of life or the person who wants to push for longevity as much as possible This is mostly common sense   treating an individual rather than an organ  but it is particularly crucial for older adults Dr Dodsons patients at NYU are mostly in their s the oldest is  Whatever has gone wrong with their cardiovascular systems they are usually also coping with several other chronic conditions and disabilities from diabetes to hearing loss They take a raft of drugs They may not cope well with procedures and regimens effective for younger patients Medically age is not just a number We grasp this when it comes to children Because they arent merely smaller adults pediatrics has spawned multiple subspecialties pediatric cardiologists neurologists hematologistoncologists We understand that children respond differently to drugs and surgical procedures That is true for old people too  but geriatrics has only one recognized subspecialty geriatric psychiatry So most medical specialists who take care of yearolds also see growing numbers of yearolds as the population ages and often treat them similarly despite their differences Adopting  seems particularly sensible Cardiovascular disease remains Americas number one cause of death and illness Dr Bell pointed out and age is overwhelmingly one of the risk factors The majority of cardiology patients are already seniors Cardiologists are trained to treat everybody the same  use the evidence go by the guidelines Dr Dodson said But if I have someone whos  and hes fallen three times in the last month and is too impaired to remember what drugs hes taking  thats a different patient Though Dr Dodson is only following  patients so far in his new Wednesdayafternoon clinic he predicts more centers will open across the country along with fundamental change In  years its going to be commonplace to have geriatric hepatologists and geriatric endocrinologists His own research conducted with colleagues at Yale where he trained points out the pitfalls of medicine that is not adapted for older patients The study involved a cognitive test something cardiologists arent trained to do administered to   Nearly half were cognitively impaired the tests revealed About  percent had mild impairment and  percent moderate to severe impairment Its so common and so often unrecognized Dr Dodson said Indeed when the researchers reviewed these patients hospital discharge summaries fewer than a quarter contained any documentation of their cognitive status Those with undocumented cognitive impairment had a  percent higher likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital or dying within six months compared with those without impairment Yet when discharge records did include patients cognitive impairment there was no significant difference in readmissions or mortality Treating heart failure a demanding task involves considerable selfcare including multiple drugs so it figures that cognitive problems could interfere We expect people to weigh themselves every day to follow a lowsalt diet to take all these medications and to come in every few weeks Dr Dodson said If their doctors knew that memory and other cognitive issues would hinder that they could prescribe simpler drug regimens devise clearer discharge instructions prescribe programs to build strength and reduce falls enlist the help of family caregivers or home health services They might even make house calls  Dr Bell does this at Vanderbilt But doctors cant tailor their approaches if they dont notice the problem Over the next few years these neophyte geriatric cardiology clinics will compile data and attempt to demonstrate that they provide superior care But they may also find another benefit one that in our current climate will ensure that they spread beyond academic medical centers The way health care providers get compensated is changing Medicare has already begun penalizing revolvingdoor hospitals If you can prove that geriatric cardiology clinics reduces day readmissions Dr Dodson said everyones going to have one
