Republican Party leaders say opposition to the Affordable Care Act is their No  campaign issue for the midterm election Yet at the same time a growing number of Republican states are now embracing a major provision of the law  expanding Medicaid governmentfunded health benefits for the poor The Supreme Court made doing that optional for states in  and most Republicanled states said no But now some states like Pennsylvania Iowa and Michigan are trying to forge compromises with the White House to accept the large amount of federal money that comes with Medicaid expansion since the federal government covers nearly all of the costs To understand why this happened in Michigan drop in on the cavernous busy   in the heart of Detroit About   patients youll see being treated by the swarm of doctors nurses and techs is uninsured Its a higher rate than many other parts of Michigan or the rest of the country That means hospitals like this one end up providing a lot of health care for free Henry Ford Hospital CEO   says even as   in the last decade the amount of care the hospital provides for free has increased About seven or eight years ago we were at about  million a year Were now at  million a year in uncompensated care she says So when the Affordable Care Act offered Michigan the chance to give Medicaid benefits to   Schlichting lobbied hard for the state to say yes We were very active in advocacy she says We got all of our employees engaged We had over  emails that went to state legislators as they were debating the Medicaid expansion for the state of Michigan So you know we almost shamed people into it you know How can you turn your back on the people of this state who have lost jobs  But Republicans initially saw themselves as turning their backs on Obamacare not the people of Michigan   was one of them Pscholkas district is on the southeast shore of Lake Michigan He says its a solidly Republican area and Obamacare doesnt have a lot of fans here When people say Medicaid expansion I think to a lot of us that meant bigger government and it meant expanding a program that doesnt work very well he says Pscholka is a Republican Party leader in the Michigan House He was asked to look at ways to reform Medicaid But then Republican Gov Rick Snyder   of Medicaid expansion last year Snyder argued that if the state didnt expand the millions of dollars in Affordable Care Act taxes and fees Michigan would be paying would just go to other states and not come back home as new payments to hospitals and doctors Plus when Pscholka says he took a hard look at Medicaid he didnt find the broken bloated government program he was expecting When I understood how it worked and what we had done in Michigan in the late s that was actually pretty smart We really wanted to have a private sector system here So weve privatized a lot of that already which I think a lot of folks didnt understand says Pscholka Medicaid is a governmentfunded program but Michigan has long contracted with   to administer it The idea was to use private market incentives to increase efficiency Pscholka says that makes it easier for conservatives to stomach and he helped draft legislation to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars  with some conditions The bill passed by one vote in the state Senate This is not an easy thing to explain Pscholka says Its not an easy thing to get up at a my county GOP meeting and look at friends of mine whove been friends of mine for  years who are now shooting darts at me with their eyes and cant believe that I was even involved in this Not only that I voted for it but that I was somehow involved in crafting this legislation Pscholkas change of heart on Medicaid earned him a primary challenge from   But shes a longshot to beat him and those favoring expansion have some strong allies beyond Michigans   Hospitals doctors and the states   all rallied behind the idea Cynthia Kay owns   with eight employees in Grand Rapids She hopes putting more people on Medicaid will help keep the price of her companys health insurance plan down in the future If you think about it were paying for the cost of health care anyway Kay says Uncompensated cost of care is driving my premiums up every single year So whether I think Im paying for it or not Im paying for all the people who are using the emergency room as their primary care physician Advocates for the poor are thrilled so many uninsured Michigan residents will now be able to get Medicaid but worry about some significant details that have yet to be finalized Jan Hudson is with the Michigan League for Public Policy which advocates for low income people Among the compromises the White House made to win Republican support in Michigan are requirements for some Medicaid recipients to pay for at least part of their care like copays for doctors office visits and procedures Cost sharing is always a concern for low income people The research says that that can be a barrier to people receiving the care that they need   Still the White House is   in other states like Arkansas and Iowa Iowa recipients will pay extra if they overuse emergency rooms and Michigan will charge them more if they dont stick with wellness plans designed to keep them healthy Groups that favor Medicaid expansion nationwide point to those kinds of tweaks as evidence that the White House is willing to compromise and hope that will entice the   to take another look and work out special arrangements of their own
