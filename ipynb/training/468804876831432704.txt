Minnesota has become the nd state to loosen restrictions on use of marijuana with its legislature approving the sale and use of medical marijuana on May  Other states including Florida are considering similar measures These changes are happening fast and we were wondering how people feel about this seemingly inexorable push to decriminalize pot so we asked in the latest NPRTruven Health Analytics Health Poll Most people said that allowing use of marijuana for medical purposes is a good idea with  percent saying theyre in favor of that But they were much less positive about legalizing recreational marijuana as the states of Colorado and Washington have done Less than half of respondents  percent backed legalization The greater support for medical marijuana may reflect the emotional appeals of patients as detailed in this   on a successful effort to put medical marijuana on the fall ballot One of those stories involves  Charlotte Figi a Colorado girl whose parents lobbied the Florida legislature in January saying that a marijuana extract reduced the girls seizures from  a month to one or two But there are no randomized controlled trials testing the safety and effectiveness of the special form of marijuana being used to treat Charlotte Figi and other children and very few on any use of medical marijuana For instance Maine and several other states have approved medical marijuana for treating posttraumatic stress disorder But the only   showing that THC the active ingredient in pot reduces anxiety have been done in mice There are many more unknowns than knowns   a neurologist and head of New York Universitys Comprehensive Epilepsy Center told NPR And I think the focus of the community  lay and scientific and governmental  should be on getting good information That should be the real focus of what we need right now Some of the new state laws are trying to beef up the skimpy data Minnesotas   calls for a patient registry and an observational study of cannabis as treatment for a limited list of qualified conditions including cancer glaucoma HIVAIDS Tourette Syndrome Crohns Disease ALS and seizures In our survey  percent of respondents said that medical professionals should provide education to patients before they buy marijuana for medical use But given the lack of evidence its hard to know what the doctors will be able to tell them Theres also been very little research on the longterm health effects of   including effects on thinking the lungs and mental health That may be why the vast majority of the people we polled  percent said that states should put age restrictions on access to marijuana And half of our respondents also think that there also should be age restrictions on use of medical marijuana Its interesting isnt it Theres this implicit agreement  better be careful with kids says   director of the adolescent substance abuse program at Boston Childrens Hospital and chair of the committee on substance abuse for the American Academy of Pediatrics The reason that people are concerned is that they recognize that this is an addictive substance and some portion of the population that uses it will become addicted to it and have very bad outcomes Levy says As with all addictive products the risk is greatest in adolescence Given our countrys experience with alcohol and tobacco she fears that making marijuana more available to adults will inevitably lead to more use by adolescents I understand that people are saying that adults should be able to use these products but its not a fair playing field once you have a big and powerful industry that can manipulate the product make health claims and market to kids even though theyre saying theyre not Still people didnt have strong feelings about any one risk posed by the potential for increased use of marijuana Onefifth of our respondents said that impairment of the senses was their most significant concern Addiction and the possibility that marijuana could be a gateway to harder drugs were cited by  percent and  percent But  percent said they had no concerns From a medical perspective for recreational use we really dont know the long term side effects says Dr Mike Taylor chief medical officer for Truven Health Analytics Speaking not as a physician but as a father with three kids in their s I think theres a lot of casual marijuana use without any concern as to whether its safe or not The poll results represent responses from  people they were interviewed from March  through   The margin of error is plus or minus  percent You can find the complete list of questions and responses
