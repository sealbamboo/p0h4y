Its not just kids who are overdoing screen time Parents are often just as guilty of spending too much time checking smartphones and email  and the consequences for their children can be troubling Dr Jenny Radesky is a pediatrician specializing in child development When she worked at a clinic in a hightech savvy Seattle neighborhood Radesky started noticing how often parents ignored their kids in favor of a mobile device She remembers a mother placing her phone in the stroller between herself and the baby The baby was making faces and smiling at the mom Radesky says and the mom wasnt picking up any of it she was just watching a YouTube video Radesky was so concerned she decided to   the behavior After relocating to   she and two other researchers spent one summer observing  different groups of parents and young children eating at fast food restaurants Many of the caregivers pulled out a mobile device right away she says They looked at it scrolled on it and typed for most of the meal only putting it down intermittently This was not a scientific study Radesky is quick to point out It was more like anthropological observation complete with detailed field notes Forty of the  parents used a mobile device during the meal and many she says were more absorbed in the device than in the kids Radesky says thats a big mistake because facetoface interactions are the primary way children learn They learn language they learn about their own emotions they learn how to regulate them she says They learn by watching us how to have a conversation how to read other peoples facial expressions And if thats not happening children are missing out on important development milestones And perhaps not surprisingly when Radesky looked at the patterns in what she and the other researchers observed she found that kids with parents who were most absorbed in their devices were more likely to act out in an effort to get their parents attention She recalls one group of three boys and their father The father was on his cellphone and the boys were singing a song repetitively and acting silly When the boys got too loud the father looked up from his phone and shouted at them to stop But that only made the boys sing louder and act sillier Psychologist   wrote a book about parenting called   She sees lots of parents teens and younger kids in her clinical practice in Massachusetts The fathers reaction to his three silly boys might be expected she says because when youre texting or answering email the part of your brain that is engaged is the to do part where theres also a sense of urgency to get the task accomplished a sense of time pressure So were much more irritable when interrupted And when parents focus on their digital world first  ahead of their children  there can be deep emotional consequences for the child SteinerAdair says We are behaving in ways that certainly tell children they dont matter theyre not interesting to us theyre not as compelling as anybody anything any ping that may interrupt our time with them she says In research for her book SteinerAdair interviewed  children between the ages of  and  asking them about their parents use of mobile devices The language that came up over and over and over again she says was sad mad angry and lonely One yearold called his dads smartphone a stupid phone Others recalled joyfully throwing their parents phone into the toilet putting it in the oven or hiding it There was one girl who said I feel like Im just boring Im boring my dad because he will take any text any call anytime  even on the ski lift SteinerAdair says we dont know exactly how much these mini moments of disconnect between a parent and child affect the child in the long term But based on the stories she hears she suggests that parents think twice before picking up a mobile device when theyre with their kids
