Home Secretary Theresa Mays plan to expel foreign graduates from the UK has drawn strong criticism from scientists They say the plan would hamper recruitment of top researchers and harm the international reputation of UK universities  Mrs May has backed a proposal to make those on student visas return home immediately after graduating  The Home Office has said the brightest and best could still apply for UK jobs but must return home first The proposal backed by Mrs May would scrap the current fourmonth period that allows graduates to seek skilled work in the UK It sits at odds with commitments   in the governments Science and Innovation Strategy critics say The director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering CaSE Dr Sarah Main said I am dismayed that the Government seems intent on thwarting its commitment to make Britain the best place in the world to do science with immigration proposals that threaten to put off the exceptional scientists and engineers who wish to come here The Prime Minister and Chancellor have been unequivocal in their intent to make the UK a worldleading scientific nation That requires the worlds top talent to be attracted here Theresa Mays proposition directly undermines that goal Prof Stephen Curry from Imperial College London wrote   and told the BBC he was surprised and frustrated by the Home Secretarys stance It was kind of thoughtless said Prof Curry a structural biologist who has worked on science policy issues with both CaSE and the group Science is Vital of which he is vicechair He pointed out that the scientific community with some reservations had welcomed the governments strategy announcement last week It was all about trying to put the pieces in place and its a public document and theyd consulted widely on it beforehand  thats all healthy That was a good move As Prof Curry pointed out the strategy document makes specific mention of overseas students and their ability to stay and work  the very opportunity Mrs May wants to close down It was just depressing from someone so senior in government to be so offmessage he told BBC News adding that it causes reputational damage internationally Overseas students represent an important source of income for UK universities and the nation as a whole The Home Office has said that the brightest and best would still be able to apply for work in the UK after their studies but they would have to return home to do so  Dr Main said this was impractical and risked turning precisely those brightest and best students away  Forcing students to return home to apply for a work visa would put significant barriers of time and money in their way when they can least afford them she said Countries like the US Australia and Canada have a poststudy work visa of  months  already longer than the four months currently offered under UK policy Prof Martyn Poliakoff from the University of Nottingham told BBC News that international students contribute a lot to the UK if they are permitted to stay It seems to me that its reaping the benefits of the efforts that weve put into the training said Prof Poliakoff an eminent chemist who is foreign secretary and vicepresident of the Royal Society Certainly I think in the area of science and engineering allowing these bright young students who weve trained to participate in research for a few years is very beneficial to our country Prof Poliakoff said he was very much in agreement with former science minister David Willetts MP who   that Mays plan was meanspirited and inwardlooking Mr Willetts said he had been thanked by a former Australian minister because the UKs tightened rules for poststudy work visas had boosted Australias market share of international students Prof Poliakoff said the new proposal of even tighter restrictions was misguided and poorly timed Just raising this possibility may discourage students and its come at just the time of year when students will be deciding whether to apply to the UK or elsewhere he said The timing is unfortunate Follow Jonathan
