Much of the modern education reform movement has centered around the drive for data Standardized tests now gauge whether children are at grade level seemingly every few months Kids are observed measured and sorted almost constantly In Silicon Valley a  billion industry does much the same thing  but for a different purpose Video game design has become a   where games evolve depending on how they are played Now some game designers are hoping to take these new skills and apply them back to education But not in a classroom  they want to teach with a game on an iPad More than  years ago Trip Hawkins left Apple and founded Electronic Arts the company behind EA Sports The man who helped make Madden NFL a cultural icon now has a new vision for games He wants to teach For sports video games Hawkins brought game designers together with experts in the field  athletes and statisticians Now hes bringing counselors into the mix He wants to give those counselors data about what kids are actually doing in the games they play Analyzing data on how people play has become a huge part of the gaming industry Its incredibly important Hawkins says In the past you couldnt do it at all because the customer was playing a game in the basement on a machine thats not hooked up to the Internet Once you bring the Internet into the equation its much easier to figure out what your problem is and how to improve the product So now he says they can apply that to other new markets like education and social development Hawkins thinks a welldesigned video game can teach kids empathy  how to listen to each other and control negative emotions It could teach children basic skills that would ultimately help them get along better with each other and adults out in the real world Hawkins has gathered experts in social development and learning and theyre creating a new game called If In the game players visit an imaginary village called Greenberry Greenberry is a world in which there are cats and there are dogs and they dont get along well says Jessica Berlinski who helped design and write the games story So part of the challenge is to figure out why and then working to heal that As kids progress through the game they begin to rebuild the village of Greenberry And kind of like   they collect magical creatures who enhance their power Sometimes the creatures might die  but the game does something totally different It helps them work through it Theres a virtual counseling session with a community leader who teaches kids deep breathing exercises and has a dialogue about feelings of loss Berlinski a founder of the educational tech company If You Can says one goal of the game is to get kids to navigate interpersonal challenges and failures The messaging that kids get in real life and certainly in schools is not that failure is OK  but in game environments  percent of the time gamers are failing yet they are completely motivated to keep going she says So something is going on there that is very positive And we need to capitalize on that But Catherine SteinerAdair a clinical psychologist at Harvard and author of   is concerned that kids and their parents already spend too much time on devices Nothing  no new app no new game  can replace the old truth I think that children thrive that families thrive in the context of healthy reallife relationships she says Still SteinerAdair says a game that helps kids practice skills like listening and working through difficult emotions might be useful if its played in moderation I am cautious but I am guardedly optimistic that there could be some kind of computer game that could strengthen childrens social and emotional intelligence she says In the end even Hawkins is the first to admit that kids wont actually play this game or learn anything unless the game is fun And building a kind of virtual counseling session into a fun video game is a tough trick
