The cost of drugs is in the headlines following the decision by NHS watchdog NICE that a new cancer treatment should not be funded Its cost More than  per patient for an extra six months of life But how are such figures reached The drug  Kadcyla  was developed by Roche  And for commercial reasons it has so far not revealed the methods behind its pricing strategy But to really understand the cost of developing a new drug you have to go back to the very earliest stages of the process There are a number of important milestones in the journey  and at each point development can come to a halt if the treatment is found not to be viable Drug development essentially begins in the lab with research on animals such as mice Only one in  potential treatments in the lab actually reach the clinical trial stage on humans And from there only a fifth will make it through all three phases The most common reasons for discontinuation are the effect of the treatment being too weak the sideeffects too great or the market for the treatment too small Then comes the regulatory and marketing stage It is a process that takes at least a decade for most drugs  and is therefore a costly process The Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry estimates it costs bn on average to get a drug to market  That is in line with what most academics have estimated including the Office of Health Economics But its report   published in  warned that working out average costs should be treated with caution as they could vary greatly depending on where the treatment was targeted The study said costs in cancer and neurology tended to be the highest because of the lower success rates and longer development times Nonetheless the report said only about  of the overall cost was actually accounted for by the lab tests and clinical trials  the socalled research and development end A more important factor is the cost of capital  that is related to the fact that the money has to be found upfront many years before the pharmaceutical firm sees anything back And when it comes to pricing companies also have to take into account the anticipated market for the drugs The smaller the market the more they have to charge Covering the costs of treatments that have not made it this far is also important as the APBI admits A spokeswoman said For every one successful medicine there are thousands of unsuccessful medicines and this has to be taken into account when making pricing decisions Drug firms have also been complaining about the cost of the regulatory hoops they have to jump through to get their treatments licensed In the US that is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration and in Europe its the European Medicines Agency Once that has been achieved the drug has to be marketed and  in terms of the NHS  get through the appraisal process In England this is done by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  The group uses a method called qualityadjusted life years QALY for assessing the value of new drug treatments A similar system is used by the Scottish Medicines Consortium while officials in Wales and Nothern Ireland tend to rely heavily on NICE analyses The formula looks at the cost of using a drug for a year and weighs it against how much someones life can be extended and improved  Generally if a treatment costs more than  to  per QALY it would not be recommended as costeffective by NICE Although for endoflife treatments NICE will go to twice that amount As there has been with Kadcyla there can be a period of negotiation on price  While that appears not to have been successful this time it has worked in the past Two years ago NICE initially rejected prostate cancer drug abiraterone for not being costeffective   when the manufacturer offered a lower undisclosed price So after this complicated and complex process the final price is determined by some good oldfashioned horsetrading
