On a recent Sunday afternoon a yearold Philadelphia man with a   of over  degrees was unable to reach his doctor So his daughter took him to an emergency room where the two sat for hours until he was examined by a physician who found no reason for the fever and decided to admit him overnight The man was given oxygen a chest   a blood test and finally a urine test which revealed a   The problem was solved with a prescription for an   but at a cost of thousands of dollars to   Like so many other health issues seen in American emergency rooms the mans infection was a common problem easily diagnosed and treated at a fraction of the cost by a primary care physician  if patients could reach their doctors when needed Experts report that more than half the problems patients bring to emergency rooms either do not or would not require hospitalbased care if an alternative source were readily available As the Philadelphia patient who is a friend of mine found care in an emergency department for a routine medical problem can result in unnecessary hospitalization tests and procedures that may even complicate a patients medical problem I dont blame doctors in private practice for wanting to work reasonable hours and have evenings weekends and holidays to spend with family and friends But the medical profession has thus far failed to adequately fill in the gap left by doctors who no longer make house calls or answer the phone  The Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics reported in  that   more than half lacked weekend hours and nearly one quarter were unable to see patients for an urgent problem The problem has grown   Many doctors now work  to  or its equivalent but patients can  and often do  become acutely ill or injured between  pm and  am They turn to emergency rooms for help where rightly or wrongly they expect access to all manner of tests and medical specialists Emergency rooms are open  and every hospital that accepts Medicare and   is obliged by law to treat everyone who comes in regardless of citizenship legal status or ability to pay Contrary to what many think the rising use of emergency rooms for routine medical issues is not caused by poor people without insurance or a personal physician The biggest increase has involved insured middleclass patients and those with personal physicians who could not reach or see their own doctors when they needed care The overuse of emergency rooms is a growing and increasingly costly problem that results in overcrowding long waits overly stressed health professionals and compromised care for people with true emergencies In a research brief issued in  the New England Healthcare Institute reported that overuse of emergency rooms is   in the United States every year The institute estimated that avoidable visits to emergency rooms range as high as  percent of all visits In a study of emergency department use by patients with medical insurance the California HealthCare Foundation found that  percent of the problems could have been handled by a primary care physician but   Of course patients cant always know what is and what is not a true emergency Is that pounding   a   or portent of a stroke Is that pain in the arm a   or a symptom of a heart attack Is the bad   a case of indigestion or   Researching a symptom on the Internet sometimes exacerbates a patients fears with lists of serious even deadly diseases that the symptom might represent Those with chronic medical problems may lack a clear understanding of their disorders and may not know how to cope with changes in their conditions When patients in distress call their doctors they often cannot get appointments for that day or the next What used to be the proverbial advice to take two aspirin and call me in the morning has become a recorded message to go to an emergency room if they think the problem cant wait Many cities and towns now have urgent care or walkin clinics sometimes attached to hospitals where patients can be seen without appointments or long waits Very early one morning a friend took her yearold son to urgent care when he awoke with a fever and   on the day they were to fly to Puerto Rico A throat swab indicated that it was unlikely to be   and the child was given acetaminophen to reduce his fever and relieve his discomfort Many more such clinics are needed staffed perhaps by newly licensed doctors physician assistants and   Or as Dr Marvin Moser a professor of medicine at Yale suggested in an interview Parts of hospitals that are closing could be kept open as walkin clinics where costs are considerably less there are no fourhour waits and no automatic tendency to admit patients to the hospital Group practices can  and often do  rotate having a doctor on call during offhours weekends and holidays Virtually every doctor has a cellphone and those in solo practices should be asked to give patients the number or include it in the recorded message when the office is closed If you have a chronic medical problem such as a heart condition or   your doctor should devise a care plan that will reduce the chances of a crisis that requires emergency care Comprehensive patient education especially for those with chronic conditions can help to alleviate concerns when a symptom occurs If your doctor does not provide such information verbally or in print ask for it or educate yourself by researching your ailment on the Web Better yet get a new doctor who tells you what to expect and when to seek medical help Adding to problems with emergency room care are high and widely ranging outofpocket costs to patients for seemingly identical conditions Dr Moser said his yearold granddaughter who had a bad   received questionable tests at outrageous charges at an emergency room in California where the childs doctor had told the family to take her The bill included  for a routine blood count  for a blood analysis and  for a sonogram  not to mention  just for walking in the door In a new study   of the University of California San Francisco and coauthors found that among the  most common outpatient conditions seen in emergency rooms nationally    to  for
