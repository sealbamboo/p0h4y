Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves argues Dr Chris van Tulleken In November  a party of three men and  dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away  Three months later just one of the men returned His name was Douglas Mawson His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out He had lost almost half his body weight He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration  A month into their journey one of the team along with the tent most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse never to be seen again Mawson and the other surviving member Xavier Mertz started to return to base surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out He died incontinent and delirious a few days later  Mawson suffered similar symptoms With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases  At first sight Mawsons story seems to be another such tale  starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient In fact Mawsons description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose  probably from eating dog liver As little as g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose  Mawson lived to the decent age of  but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times  vitamins can be very bad for you  This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years  if you are healthy and you live in a country like the UK taking multivitamins and highdose antioxidants may shorten your life  For most of us for most of the time theyre unhealthy Argh I hear you say I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive Everything from my full head of hair to my sex life depends on them  I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly dont agree with me So why do we believe theyre useful and why do we take them  Vitamins are essential for life and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation but general unsupervised vitamin pillpopping is more than just a waste of money The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because firstly the tales of deficiency are so horrific secondly we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly a doubleNobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast vast doses  All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods  if a little is good then more must be better Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being vitamin and mineralenriched  And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe  So while you shouldnt eat dog liver in Antarctica vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems  So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances which is persuasive and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable blearyeyed early morning state hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catchall beneficial effect on our lives that will transform us into the healthy energetic beautiful peoplecartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box  These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins And then theres Linus Pauling  Whether or not youve heard of him Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture Its almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility He won two Nobel prizes and was by all accounts a genuinely good bloke He wrote a book in  saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu cancer cardiovascular disease infections and degenerative problems  He took immense quantities himself hundreds of times the required amount and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren He was the poster boy for megadosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable  But rather than taking one mans word for it however credible its worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time  Looking at any one individual study wont be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you Theyre densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot  For the answer you have to turn to what are called systematic review papers This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and reanalyse it to answer big questions  Heres what a couple of them say We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention of diseases of any kind Betacarotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality and so may higher doses of vitamin A Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing See references below  Just to be clear  increase mortality  that means theyre killing you These are powerfully bioactive compounds but theyre not regulated in the same way as drugs Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if theres data saying theyre bad for us The next question is  why are they bad for us Its very hard to pick apart the data partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals  Im going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins Theyre required in the diet not for energy but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the bodys metabolism  cell production tissue repair and other vital processes  Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so were not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact Antioxidants provide a nice example They soak up the very toxic chemicallyreactive byproducts of metabolism called free radicals These free radicals left unchecked can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer  Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better Right Keep those cancer causing radicals under control Well unfortunately your bodys immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but its easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections  Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function Longterm excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage And so on  And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet For example different minerals compete for absorption If you take large quantities of calcium you wont be able to absorb your iron If you take large quantities of iron you wont be able to absorb zinc If you take vitamin C youll reduce your copper level  So its not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you its that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out  So when are supplements recommended The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence NICE recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency including  Your GP may also recommend supplements if you   If you decide to take supplements stick to within the RDA unless youve had guidance from a stateregistered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose If youve got questions about dosage levels consult a stateregistered dietician or clinical nutritionist The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that its easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better  And if you read   on water youll see where this is going I could do this every week The same article Substitute water for vitaminsprobioticsantibiotics Dont trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and dont assume that if some is good more must be better  Its like beer Or coffee Or computer games Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right
