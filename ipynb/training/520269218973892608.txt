The UK is to begin screening some passengers who have travelled from Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea for signs of Ebola virus disease  Downing Street says passengers arriving at Gatwick Heathrow and on Eurostar will be asked a series of questions and have their temperature taken   The UK had earlier announced the move was unnecessary although the United States said it would screen travellers in five major airports But British officials now say screening will offer an additional level of protection to the UK Screening will involve taking peoples temperatures to check whether they have a fever This is one of the main symptoms of Ebola but is also a symptom of many other infections  As people go through screening they will also be asked questions to assess their risk including  Travellers will also be given advice on who to call and what to do if they become unwell at a later stage  The WHO already recommends that people are screened as they exit Ebolahit countries  Travellers leaving the three worst affected countries  Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia  have their temperatures taken and are asked a series of questions to uncover their risk of having the infection Blood tests can help identify the virus but they need to be analysed in laboratories and it can take hours to get a result  Airports do not currently have this capacity  Also some people who later go on to develop the infection will not be picked up as the incubation period  the time from exposure to the virus to a person showing symptoms  can vary from two to  days  Some health experts argue that by screening on exit anyone who is likely to be infectious will be identified and not allowed to fly  They say it is extremely unlikely that many people would develop symptoms during a flight so additional screening on entry would not pick up many cases  Ebola can be spread only through close contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has symptoms of the disease  During this outbreak there has been no evidence to suggest that anyone has picked up the virus on a plane  Even if someone does develop symptoms in order for fellow passengers to catch the disease they would have to be in contact with the passengers bodily fluids  Vomit blood and faeces harbour the most viral particles So the risks remain extremely low unless you are administering care for someone who is sick on the plane  Even if screening had already been in place in the US Thomas Eric Duncan the first man to be diagnosed in the current outbreak would not have been picked up  He only developed symptoms a week after he was back on US soil  The first case diagnosed in Europe in this outbreak of the Spanish nurse who was caring for patients from Liberia would not have been picked up by airport screening either as the healthcare worker was already in the country when she got the disease
