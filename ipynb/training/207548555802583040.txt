                  Despite the fact that its so commonthere are at least  million stomachflu cases in the US each yearmany people dont know much about it For one its not really the flu 
                   
                  Here are  things you need to know about viral gastroenteritis its true medical name starting with the fact that its caused by viruses that attack the stomach and intestines When people say the flu they mean influenza a virus that circulates the globe each year attacking the nose and throat as it spreads through communities in waves Flu shots protect against this virusnot ones that cause viral gastroenteritis 
                   
                  The confusion may be due to some symptom overlap such as body aches nausea and lowgrade fever says Gary Rogg MD an internist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City 
                   
                  But a flu shot wont protect against stomach bugs Theres no such thing as a stomachflu shot at least for grownups Stop blaming the flu and instead know the true name of your trouble Norovirus 
                   
                  This is a family of viruses most often to blame for adult gastroenteritis although others include adenovirus and astrovirus Rotavirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in babies and young children 
                   
                  Norovirus can spread like wildfire in any crowded place causing outbreaks in day care centers schools cruise ships hospitals and nursing homes Â  Stomach flu spreads via the fecaloral route which is just as gross as it sounds Basically viruses from infected feces or vomit find their way into our mouths Very diligent hand washing is your best defense according to Dr Rogg 
                   
                  Wash carefully if youre changing diapers or cleaning up after a sick child and grownups in the household should clean up after themselves if they can advises Ryan Madanick MD a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill NC Viral gasteroenteritis isnt exactly the same thing as food poisoning which refers to any illness caused by food contaminants including dangerous toxinproducing bacteria like salmonella But norovirus is the numberone cause of foodborne illness in the US 
                   
                  Viral gastroenteritis can be spread from person to person or by touching a contaminated surface but you can also get viral gastroenteritis from sewagecontaminated food or water or meals prepared or handled by an infected person Hence all those wash your hands signs in restaurant bathrooms Compared to other viruses noroviruses can be surprisingly hardy and live for days on household surfaces which is why they spread easily That and very few virus particles are needed to cause an infection 
                   
                  Wash your hands with soap and water which is more effective than hand sanitizers Avoid food prep if youre sick you can still be infectious for  days or more after symptoms wane and wash laundry carefully using gloves to handle soiled clothing and bedding if you can 
                   
                  Use a bleachbased cleaner to kill virus particles on hard surfaces Diarrhea vomiting and stomach pain dont hit you immediately after youre infected with a gastrointestinal virus but typically develop gradually over one or two days Dr Madanick explains 
                   
                  But other types of food poisoning can strike fast and hardwithin a few hours after youre exposed to the offending substanceand symptoms tend to be more dramatic such as explosive vomiting and diarrhea Both stomach flu and other types of food poisoning are what doctors call selflimiting meaning they play themselves out and rarely require medical treatment 
                   
                  While norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness germforgerm salmonella and other bugs are more likely to result in hospitalization or death 
                   
                  If youve got viral gastroenteritis you should start to feel better after two or three days While food poisoning due to other causes hits you harder and faster it goes away faster too you may be back to normal in a day or two It stands to reason that if youre losing lots of fluid through watery diarrhea and vomiting you need to replace that fluid But youre also losing sodium potassium and other minerals known as electrolytes and they also need to be replaced 
                   
                  You should drink Pedialyte or similar oral electrolyte solutions that contain salts and sugar as well as water if you have severe diarrhea Sports drinks arent a great choice because the mix of salts and sugars they contain isnt exactly right in terms of replacing fluid lost to diarrhea and vomiting Try to avoid drinking too much plain water or beverages like soda or juice that contain sugar but not enough of the right electrolytes says Dr Rogg The biggest mistake that people make is just trying to drink a lot of water he adds They understand that they have to prevent themselves from getting dehydrated but what theyre actually doing is wrong 
                   
                  Putting water into your body without adding electrolytes will dilute the electrolytes that still remain in your body Dr Rogg explains while taking in sugar without salt can make your diarrhea worse There is no treatment for viral gastroenteritis besides time and symptom relief Antibiotics are useless so dont be surprised if you dont get one from your doctor 
                   
                  Overthecounter remedies that contain bismuth subsalicylate like PeptoBismol may help for simple diarrhea 
                   
                  Antidiarrheal medications may also help ease cramps and diarrhea but you should avoid them if you have bloody diarrhea or a high fever as it can make the illness worse according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention If you see blood in your stool or vomit call your doctor right away Diarrhea on its own is not a cause for alarm but call your doctor if you also experience extreme lethargy confusion or otherwise altered mental status or a lack of urine or dark and concentrated urine which are signs of serious dehydration 
                   
                  Also get help if your symptoms arent getting better after three days you have prolonged vomiting that prevents liquid intake or if you spike an oral temperature over  degrees Fahrenheit Young childrens developing immune systems make it harder for them to fight off viral infections while their smaller bodies are also at greater risk of becoming dehydrated Elderly people are also more prone to coming down with viral gastroenteritis and take longer to recover afterwards Dr Rogg says 
                   
                  Anyone with a chronic illness such as heart disease asthma cancer or kidney disease or who has HIV or is taking medications that suppress the immune system should check with a doctor if they come down with the stomach flu When you stop vomiting and your diarrhea subsides youre probably going to feel pretty hungry But wait a few days before you celebrate with a feast Dr Rogg warns Dont eat as if you were well until youve felt fine for a couple of days he advises Eat smaller meals and drink in smaller volumes Basically youll want to avoid eating or drinking in a way that will distend the stomach Overloading the stomach too soon may make you feel sick all over again so skip fatty foods and stick to light easytodigest meals
