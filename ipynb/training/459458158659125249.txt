Go ahead and indulge in that extra cup of coffee New research suggests that an extra cup of coffee is associated with a lower risk of Type  diabetes Researchers examined  years worth of data on diet lifestyle medical conditions and chronic diseases from three large USbased observational studies and found that participants who said they increased their coffee consumption by more than a cup a day over a four year period had an  percent lower risk of Type  diabetes in the subsequent four years compared with those who made no changes in coffee consumption And it didnt seem to matter how much coffee people drank initially or what other changes in diet and lifestyle they made The results appear Thursday in the journal Diabetologia Previous studies have shown the protective effect of coffee but this is the first to look at how the risk of diabetes might change if people modify their consumption over a defined period of time Rachel Huxley an author of some of those previous studies and a researcher at the University of Queensland Australia told NBC News The lifetime risk for developing Type  diabetes is substantial  percent for men and  percent for women according to national surveys So even a small lowering of relative risk such as  percent will have important public health implications Shilpa Bhupathiraju the studys lead author and a research fellow at Harvard School of Public Health told NBC News The study doesnt prove changes in coffee consumption cause changes in the risk of diabetes a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar To do that researchers would have to conduct expensive difficult and longterm clinical trials But the researchers controlled for conditions that raise the risk of diabetes and could have altered the results such as high cholesterol and hypertension and the results held Researchers say theyre not sure why coffee would affect the risk of developing diabetes Coffee contains a multitude of compounds such as flavonoids and magnesium that may have a role but it is really guess work says Huxley Caffeine was not thought to be an important factor  even though decaf coffee drinkers and tea drinkers did not show the association Bhupathiraju says thats probably because decaf coffee and tea drinkers didnt drink much to begin with and made few changes in their consumption So we didnt have enough statistical power to detect associations she says Bhupathiraju says individuals who are at high risk of diabetes may want to consider having an additional cup of coffee a day but cautions that a cup of coffee means  ounces not a  ounce tall Starbucks drink or a  ounce grande And its not those big blended coffee drinks Were talking about black coffee maybe with a little milk and sugar says Bhupathiraju Both she and Huxley stress that exercise a nutritious diet and losing weight are the most important and proven ways to lower diabetes risk Says Huxley Coffee isnt a magic bullet
