MONROVIA, Liberia—President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf last week stepped from her sport-utility vehicle into a busy Ebola clinic to confront the epidemic’s latest challenge.. A nurse complained to the president that she was laid off from Monrovia’s Island Clinic in October as the number of new cases there dropped. But the virus has surfaced in isolated villages, where epidemiologists suspect the sick are infecting people in unknown numbers.
