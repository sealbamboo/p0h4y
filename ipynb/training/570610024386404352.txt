There is excited talk today that we have reached a game changing moment in controlling the HIV epidemic This is not a cure or vaccine but a highly effective way of preventing transmission of the virus  The idea is to give HIV drugs to gay men having unprotected sex while they are still uninfected It means the medicine is there waiting for the virus to arrive and kills it when it does The approach relies on one of the biggest breakthroughs in the field  antiretroviral drugs  HIV infection was a death sentence when it was first reported in the s it had gone largely unnoticed in Africa for decades before  Every patient would progress to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Aids and death was inevitable But just look at the impact effective medicines had when they were introduced in the late s Deaths from Aids dropped dramatically HIV infection has gone from guaranteed killer to lifelong infection at least in the west where the medicine is available  Those drugs have certainly had one gamechanger moment they may be about to have another in patients at risk of HIV  Having evergrowing numbers of people who are living with HIV does create a problem  a higher risk of the virus being spread Imagine one in eight of the sexual partners in your lifetime had HIV  Those are the odds faced by gay men in London the figure is closer to one in  for the rest of the UK Its why one man told me he feels at highrisk of HIV just by being in London and that it has a crippling effect on forming relationships  Many people would say use a condom They are an incredibly effective barrier to HIV transmission and recommended by every sexual health expert you can find  But like many health messages  dont smoke exercise more drink less  they are often ignored  One analysis found only  of men reported using a condom the last time they had sex with another man Some will be in longterm caring monogamous relations some are gambling with terrible odds  The result is the number of new HIV infections in gay men has been consistently above ayear for a decade and they remain the most atrisk group in the country The trial by the UKs Medical Research Council and Public Health England showed that giving HIV drugs while the men were still healthy led to a  fall in new infections Be in no doubt that is huge  If we were discussing a medicine that prevented  of cancers wed be calling it a miracle drug The study showed that one case of HIV would be prevented for every  men treated for a year One member of the research team gave an extreme example saying that if the drugs were given to all men and all were adherent then we could stop the epidemic These drugs are never going to be prescribed on that scale  But they have the potential to prevent hundreds of new infections where nothing else seems to work Thats why it has been described as a game changer
