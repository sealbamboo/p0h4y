When Telma Lopez could earn a modest living cleaning houses she got along without food stamps But now that shes  suffers from chronic back pain and relies on Social Security disability benefits everything is too much money at the supermarket she told me The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as the federal food stamp program is now known provides her with  a month the maximum benefit for a singleperson household Bernice Warren applied for food stamps in  My money was short and I had bills to pay and they really helped out recalled Ms Warren  Her benefit   this month  doesnt allow for much meat so she buys canned tuna and when its on sale chicken I make it last she said Diane Gonzalez who directs a counseling program at the Child Center of New York that helped both women apply for and receive benefits feels frustrated nonetheless She knows that other older adults in her Queens neighborhood unaware of or misinformed about SNAP are stretching meals or doing without Why do so few older people take advantage of SNAP Over all nearly  percent of people eligible for food stamps in  were using them   by Mathematica Policy Research But among those over  the participation rate was about half that  percent That means more than  million older people could be eating better  Some are too proud about taking handouts  thats the mindset Ms Gonzalez said she had found It sometimes requires multiple conversations to get her clients past the stigma of dependence It may help that SNAP now uses a reloadable plastic card that recipients can swipe like a debit or credit card instead of the coupons that told everyone in the supermarket line that you were on assistance In other cases the elderly feel that others like young children are more needy said Jackie Kauff a senior researcher at Mathematica But its also true that despite the governments steps to simplify the process applying for food stamps can still seem daunting Its very complicated Ms Kauff said Lots of seniors find it burdensome  Hence the push to enlist community organizations to help  like Ms Gonzalezs program Single Stop where a seniors application for food stamps can be completed in  minutes Families can step in here too especially to apply online for older adults who lack computer skills For SNAP purposes seniors are aged  or older They have to report and document their net income after deducting many outofpocket medical costs and certain expenses for shelter and assets excluding a home retirement accounts and in most states a vehicle As long as those assets dont top  applicants at the federal poverty level  in net monthly income for someone living alone or  for a twoperson household will qualify for help Because household size figures into the calculation people who live alone or with a spouse may get lower benefits than families My friend Mara Fitter who recently moved her yearold father from St Louis to a suburb near her in Orlando Fla  reported that the SNAP application wasnt hard to file online since her dad had documents handy from filing his income taxes The results were dispiriting though Mr Fitter qualified but only for the minimum benefit  a month Better than zero Ms Fitter said noting it might buy him a carton of Ensure The average benefit for someone over age  who lives alone is  a month and  for a twoperson household a Mathematica senior researcher Karen Cunnyngham has calculated We can argue whether those are adequate amounts for even careful shoppers trying to feed themselves We can debate whether Congress should have   to help balance the federal budget Ms Lopez whose monthly food stamp allotment fell to  from  said she ran out of food by the fourth week of the month and had to go to a  food pantry for rice and milk But we can probably agree that for economically marginal seniors SNAPs average monthly benefit is too much to walk away from The Agriculture Department which oversees SNAP    You can find numbers to call for information in each state   And the National Council on Agings   can help you determine whether a family member qualifies not only for food stamps but also for other forms of state and federal aid
