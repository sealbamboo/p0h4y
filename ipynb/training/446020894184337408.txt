Some young people seeking to buy health insurance are finding themselves falling into a subsidy gap that leaves them ineligible for financial assistance that was heavily advertised Subsidies in the health law were designed to lower insurance costs for people who make around  to  a year But for young people earning toward the higher end of that range its more complicated than that   shows that in major cities some young people fall in that salary range but dont actually qualify for government help to pay their insurance premiums And as the Affordable Care Act barrels toward its March  enrollment deadline insurers need people ages  to  to sign up Brian Loughnane is  and was making  a year when he looked for a policy on   in December There was something that said Youre eligible for a subsidy  But then the Philadelphia resident says After I put in the rest of my information it said it was zero dollars Thats because subsidies kick in only when a baseline health plan exceeds a certain percentage of a persons income The higher a persons income the more expensive premiums must be before subsidies kick in Thats the young persons subsidy gap What we found is that on average once you were above  you probably were not going to   for a subsidy says Kev Coleman with the health information technology company Healthpocket He looked at plans for young adults in eight major cities and all of them had these subsidy gaps This may mean there are enough lowcost insurance options being offered in those cities which dont cost more than  percent of a persons income But Coleman points out that depending on a persons age income and city premiums could be as much as  to  a month and make up nearly  percent of income Will young people perceive that as affordable When you combine these results with the fact that young people under the age of  are statistically healthier they probably place a lower priority on the need for health insurance  this may help explain why were seeing an underenrollment in the younger adults versus the targets originally set by the Obama administration Coleman says In Philadelphia the regions largest insurer doesnt seem too worried about this Were looking to get as many people as insured as possible to make sure theyre aware the deadline is coming says Koleen Cavanaugh a director of marketing for   one of two companies offering plans on Philadelphias exchange She says more than  people in the region across all ages have enrolled in their plans since Oct   the beginning of open enrollment Back in January if we looked at the numbers we had about  percent enrollment in the millennial population were now around  percent so weve seen a nice uptick in February and March enrollment numbers Cavanaugh says as she works in a tent near City Hall where agents are helping people sign up According to Cavanaugh the majority of those young adults have been eligible for subsidies An   found that about half of young adults nationwide are eligible for a basic plan that costs  a month or less But that does not include Loughnane who was aging out of his parents plan He works for a tech startup that doesnt offer insurance  I was a completely new entrant into the marketplace so I didnt really have an idea of what I would be paying he says Loughnane found a midlevel silver plan at full cost for  a month Analysts like Coleman worry that might be too much for some young people and will keep them from signing up for coverage For Loughnane its worth paying for it even though hes healthy He wants coverage in part because he saw how important insurance was for his girlfriend You know she had cancer and she beat it Loughnane says Thats a situation where without health insurance youre going to get into debt for the rest of your life The amonth plan was an easy sell Thats less than half of what I pay each month for groceries I have other expenses too but for my health Im absolutely willing to pay that He acknowledges other factors in his favor include Philadelphias relatively low cost of living and not having any major debts
