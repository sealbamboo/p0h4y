Boston brain surgeon   points to a tangle of delicate gray shadows on his computer screen Its an Xray of the blood vessels on the left side of yearold Maribel Ramos brain If we follow this blood vessel up here you see that right there it gets pinched off almost to nothing Smith explains and then this little puff of smoke right here which are these little narrow blood vessels that dont fill the rest of the brain as it normally should Maribels brain is starved for oxygen he says Those spidery blood vessels represent an effort by the girls body to compensate for the pinched section of her major cerebral artery In fact puff of smoke is the actual name of Maribels disorder    in Japanese  because the researchers who named it thought thats what it looked like on Xrays The disorder is just one of many conditions that can make a child more prone to strokes One in  kids will suffer a stroke causing disability or even death But surgeons can now prevent strokes in some of these children  children like Maribel Moyamoya is not Maribels only health condition She also suffers from   a much more common disorder that causes red blood cells to be spiky and misshapen  and prone to form blood clots in the dangerously narrow blood vessels of her brain Sickle cell disease is the   of strokes in children Smith who works at   in Boston says the combination gives Maribel a  percent chance of suffering a disabling or possibly fatal stroke In fact a few months ago she suffered a warning stroke My legs started to get numb and my tongue got numb and my hands were shaking a lot she says I did not know what was going on Fortunately that stroke didnt leave her with lasting damage But it heightened the urgency for   that Smith is preparing to do to stave off the almost inevitable Maribels father Luis Ramos says they didnt hesitate to have the surgery Smith proposes We just want to fix it he says We want to do whatever we can so it doesnt happen again Its very scary Smith aims to give Maribels brain a new blood supply Its an ingenious bit of surgery He plans to take a fat healthy blood vessel that now runs up the outside of Maribels skull and reroute it so its next to the section of her brain thats chronically starved for blood Once Maribel is asleep Smith shaves a section of scalp behind her left ear and takes up a pencillike wand It uses ultrasound waves to locate the blood vessel lying beneath skin and muscle that Smith plans to use He takes a marker and traces the vessels path on her scalp so he knows exactly where it runs from her ear to the top of her head Next Smith and surgeon Sarah Jernigan sit down next to Maribels head and peer through a big microscope Painstakingly they slice through scalp and muscle The pulsing artery comes into view Rare as moyamoya is Smith operates on a child with the disease about once a week And much more often doctors at Childrens and other major pediatric hospitals see children suffering strokes for different reasons other malformations of blood vessels in the brain too little oxygen during birth congenital heart defects infections like meningitis and chickenpox The cause is unknown in onethird of childhood strokes Pretty much every midsize town in America has at least one child who has suffered a stroke Smith says as he works on Maribel And the problem is growing One of the newer conditions unfortunately that we think is becoming increasingly a cause for stroke in kids is the same cause that affects adults  obesity he adds Kids are getting  diabetes blood pressure problems Finally the surgeons have freed up the blood vessel that will be redirected underneath Maribels skull to her oxygenstarved brain tissue It looks like a jump rope thats  inches long The ends are still attached and the middle part is free Thats the part were going to swing under a piece of bone to put it in contact with the brain Smith explains as he starts what he calls the construction work Kind of like digging a trough in the middle of downtown Boston he says as he removes a section of Maribels skull the diameter of a hockey puck It allows us to get this blood vessel where its needed The blood vessel needs to be in direct contact with the brain That involves removing the innermost protective layer a cobwebby membrane called the arachnoid When thats done there it is Maribels exposed brain Next Smith sews the blood vessel to the surface of the brain This is the real key to the operation Once the artery is in contact with the brain it will start putting down new blood vessels like roots from a tree Its remarkable how quickly the brain can respond favorably to this graft when it really needs one Smith says In a sense hes enabling Maribels body to cure her moyamoya disease Once the new blood vessel is sewn firmly in place the surgeons reverse course carefully replacing layers of tissue one by one Smith replaces the circle of bone using tiny screws to fix it in place He leaves two small holes so the rerouted artery can dive under Maribels skull and exit on the other side Finally the soft tissue is replaced and the incision neatly sutured up So guys were done he announces And a few minutes later Maribel is awake again  more or less Hey Maribel hey sweetie its Dr Smith he says Wiggle your toes sweet pea Thats a good girl A few weeks later I visit Maribel at home in Nashua NH Shes wearing an elaborate bow to hide the place where her hair hasnt grown in yet Her father says a recent MRI scan brought good news It was what two three weeks after surgery and you could already see the new veins growing into the brain Luis Ramos says Everything looks good And now instead of an almost  percent chance of a major stroke Smith says Maribels risk has been reduced drastically to around  percent
