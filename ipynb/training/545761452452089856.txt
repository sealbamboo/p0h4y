The precise part of the brain that gives people a sense of direction has been pinpointed by scientists People with stronger nerve signals in their internal compass tended to be better navigators The study published in the journal Current Biology suggested people get lost when their compass cannot keep up  The researchers in London hope the discovery will help explain why direction sense can deteriorate in conditions such as Alzheimers disease  Scientists have long believed that such a signal existed within the brain but until now it had been pure speculation Researchers at University College London UCL asked  volunteers to familiarise themselves with a simple virtual courtyard  They were then asked to navigate the area from memory alone while their brains were being scanned by an MRI machine  The scans revealed a part of the brain  known as the entorhinal region  fired up consistently during the tasks  The stronger the signal in the region the better the volunteers were at finding their way around correctly Dr Hugo Spiers who led the study said Studies on London cab drivers have shown that the first thing they do when they work out a route is calculate which direction they need to head in  We now know the entorhinal cortex is responsible for such calculations and the quality of the signals from this region seem to determine how good someones navigational skills will be Dr Martin Chadwick who was also involved in the study explained Our results provide evidence to support the idea that your internal compass readjusts as you move through the environment  For example if you turn left then your entorhinal region should process this to shift your facing direction and goal direction accordingly  If you get lost after taking too many turns this may be because your brain could not keep up and failed to adjust  Previous work by UCL researchers uncovered the role the entorhinal region plays in helping people understand what direction they are facing  This new work suggests the area also helps them decide which direction to move in when heading to a new location  Dr John Isaac from the Wellcome Trust which funded the study said Why some people are better navigators than others is intrinsically interesting but it also helps us explain the processes that go wrong in degenerative diseases such as dementia  leaving people feeling lost and confused
