Leading doctors in the   have accused the coalition government of a catalogue of broken promises funding cuts and destructive legislation which has left the health service weaker than ever before In a letter to the Guardian more than  senior doctors pass a damning judgment on the governments stewardship of the NHS which they say is under pressure because of unnecessary marketoriented changes  As medical and public health professionals our primary concern is for all patients We invite voters to consider carefully how the NHS has fared over the last five years and to use their vote to ensure that the NHS in England is reinstated they write The signatories to the letter include Dr Clare Gerada former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Prof John Ashton retired director of public health epidemiologist Prof Michael Coleman Simon Capewell professor of public health at the University of Liverpool Trisha Greenhalgh professor of primary care at Oxford Martin McKee professor of European public health and Raymond Tallis emeritus professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester The letter which the doctors have written in a private capacity challenges the government on its NHS record and deplores the current pressures facing the health service Entering the last election   assured voters that the NHS was safe in Conservative hands The doctors however say the NHS is withering away and if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had under the NHS and have to pay more for health services Privatisation not only threatens coordinated services but also jeopardises training of our future healthcare providers and medical research particularly that of public health Just a week ago  senior business leaders wrote to the Telegraph claiming a Labour government would threaten jobs and deter investment in the UK The NHS is a potentially difficult issue for the Tories and a strong suit for Labour Earlier on Tuesday the health secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would meet the funding challenge thrown down by the NHS chief executive Simon Stevens last year Stevens said in October that the health service faced a funding gap of bn by  of which bn could be met through efficiency savings Hunt told BBC Radio s World at One programme We will give whatever they need It might be more than bn it might be less Within hours of Hunts pledge an earlier draft of the doctors letter was leaked to the Daily Telegraph which claimed that Labour had orchestrated it Julian Smith the Tory candidate defending Skipton and Ripon told the paper This Labour stitchup is another desperate attempt to weaponise the NHS The truth is that only today Andy Burnham said he didnt support the NHSs own funding plan Under this government weve got more doctors more nurses and more patients being seen than ever before But Gerada who organised the letter denied that the Labour party was responsible It has not been orchestrated by Labour it has been put together by me and a few other medical leaders she told the Telegraph Im not doing this from a party political point of view My views on the health service and the   and Social Care Act go back and are well known This letter was drafted by me and some others I am a Labour party member now but Im not an activist in the Labour party This is a view of many doctors who have serious concerns about the state of the NHS as it is now A Labour spokesperson said Its little surprise that doctors have written this letter  they are deeply concerned about the direction of the NHS under David Cameron and the consequences for patients of another five years of Tory government The NHS needs Labours better plan for  more nurses and  more GPs paid for with a bn a year time to care fund and guaranteed GP appointments within  hours The letter attacks Andrew Lansleys NHS shakeup which was passed by parliament in  as the Health and Social Care Act It is already leading to the rapid and unwanted expansion of the role of commercial companies in the NHS Lansleys Act is denationalising healthcare because the abolition of the duty to provide a NHS throughout England abdicates government responsibility for universal services to ad hoc bodies such as clinical commissioning groups and competitive markets controlled by private sectordominated quangos the doctors write The squeeze is hitting patients they continue People may be unaware that under the coalition dozens of accident and emergency departments and maternity units have been closed or earmarked for closure or downgrading In addition  NHS walkin centres have been closed or downgraded in this time and more than  ambulance stations have shut and more than  general practices are at risk of closure Thousands of NHS beds have closed since  they say while mental health and primary care are in disarray and public health has been wrenched out of the NHS and is now the responsibility of local authorities The way forward is clear the doctors say Abolish all the damaging sections of the Health and Social Care Act  that fragment care and drive the NHS towards a marketdriven outfortender mentality where care is provided by the lowest bidder Reversing this costly and inefficient market bureaucracy alone will save significant sums Above all the duty on the secretary of state to provide a health service throughout England must be reinstated  it still exists in Scotland and Wales
