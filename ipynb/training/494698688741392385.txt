Susanna MillerPences teeth werent the problem her gums were When she smiled her upper lip stretched up so high that a ribbon of pinkish gum was exposed giving her a socalled gummy smile She hated it    The doctor explained that my gums were longer than my teeth so the dimensions werent right said Ms MillerPence  a psychoanalyst living in San Luis Obispo Calif   Fifteen years ago she had a gingivectomy an operation to remove some of the extra gum tissue A month later she was grinning broadly Now everyone comments on my smile she said   Gummy smiles occur for a variety of reasons most commonly a short upper lip excessive gum tissue or small teeth all of which are genetic According to Dr Stan Heifetz a cosmetic dentist in New York and White Plains whose office treated Ms MillerPence ideal smiles show up only to about two millimeters of gum Anything over three to four millimeters of gum showing starts to look gummy  he said Studies have been done with dentists plastic surgeons dermatologists and regular folk to assess smiles Most everyone agreed that two millimeters or less of gum tissue showing was the level where most participants thought the smile looked normal Participants started noticing the gum tissue at three to four millimeters and thinking that too much gum tissue was showing at more than four millimeters Dr Heifetz said  Doctors who specialize in cosmetic procedures estimate that about  percent of women and  percent of men have excessive gingival exposure when smiling  I believe the incidence is probably higher than we think but we specialists just see and count the ones we treat which are on the low side since not many people come to the doctor and ask about treatments for this said Dr Jessica Suber an attending physician in plastic and reconstructive surgery at Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth Its something a lot of patients arent aware of Its hard to know how many operations are done annually to correct a gummy smile many patients combine it with other medical and aesthetic treatments According to data from the American Dental Association Health Policy Institute  gingivectomies were performed in  the most recent years available   In the past surgery was the main treatment option but that is often costly and painful Doctors sever the muscles that elevate the upper lip so it can no longer rise as high or they do a crown lengthening procedure that cuts away gum tissue so the crown appears longer  In extreme cases they might perform orthognathic surgery which repositions the upper jaw if it sticks out too much But this can be complicated and can take up to two years to complete Dr Heifetz said Laser therapy is also sometimes used  Now people are going another route onabotulinumtoxinA otherwise known as Botox For the last few years dentists have been injecting Botox into the upper lip elevator muscles It paralyzes the muscles inhibiting contraction of the upper lip when smiling to prevent the gummy smile In contrast to  surgery  Botox is quick and easy doctors who do the procedure say  A   found that offlabel use of Botox was a safe and effective procedure for gummy smile albeit one that  lasts only three to four months for the average patient confirming the findings of an   The price is also more appealing than surgery Botox costs around  depending on the part of the country you are in and the doctor you see Ms MillerPence said she paid about  for surgery and crowns which was not covered by insurance Botox goes directly into the lip tissue so theres almost no risk of digesting it said Dr Peter Taub a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York Stephanie McCarrell a nurse anesthetist in Tampa Flasays she has received Botox three times for her gummy smile which has always bothered her  When I was a girl the other kids made fun of me said Ms McCarrell  It really bothered me I would smile without my teeth just a closemouthed smile A few days after her injection her upper lip had dropped and her gums were less visible she said  But Botox  works only if the problem is in the lips not the bone And doctors have to be careful not to overinject the muscles or they could create an unnatural look  As Dr Ariel Ostad a cosmetic dermatologist in New York said A little bit too much and you really inactivate those muscles and when you smile you smile crooked
