What is it with stem cell research? Despite solid science from many corners, the scandals never seem to stop. In this case, after a lofty international announcement in January, it only took about two months for the other shoe to drop.. A scientific committee in Japan .  Tuesday that the lead author of a recent "breakthrough study" fabricated data and is guilty of scientific misconduct.. The scientist under question, Haruko Obokata of the . , adamantly denied the fraud in a statement, Reuters . . She claims the errors were made innocently. She plans to appeal the judgement of the panel.. Back in January, Obokata and an international team from Japan and U.S. .  they had figured out a fast, easy way to make the most powerful cells in the world — embryonic stem cells — from just one blood cell.. The trick seemed remarkably simple: Put white blood cells from a baby mouse in a mild acid solution, the team .  in pair of papers in the journal . .. But the six-person panel set up by Riken, a top academic research facility in Japan said .  in the studies. Four were innocent mistakes, the panel said. But the other two were intentional and thus fraudulent, .  .  Tuesday.. For instance, the committee said that Obokata reused an image from her dissertation to demonstrate an unrelated experiment.. "Actions like this completely destroy data credibility," molecular biologist Shunsuke Ishii .  Tuesday at a press conference in Tokyo. Ishii chaired the committee investigating the case.. "There is no doubt that she [Obokata] was fully aware of this danger," Ishii added. "We've therefore concluded this was an act of research misconduct involving fabrication.". The journal .  said it is still investigating the studies, which have not been retracted. Scientists still don't know if the new way of making stem cells actually works.
