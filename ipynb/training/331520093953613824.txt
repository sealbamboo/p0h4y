The Food and Drug Administration on Monday proposed new regulations for tanning beds that would require their makers to affix labels warning young people not to use them  Nearly  million Americans use tanning beds every year according to the American Academy of Dermatology and about two million of those are teenagers  The FDA said the proposal was its first step toward potentially restricting minors access to the beds altogether Manufacturers would have to apply to the agency for approval of their tanning bed products before selling them including demonstrating that the electrical systems were safe and that the software was working properly They would not have to conduct the costly clinical trials that are required for new drugs  The agency will allow  days for public comments and then issue a final order which would give manufacturers a year to comply  The science is clear said Dr Mary E Maloney vice president of regulatory policy at the American Academy of Dermatology The risk of developing melanoma increases by  percent for individuals who have been exposed to ultraviolet radiation from indoor tanning
