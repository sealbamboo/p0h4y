At a news briefing Monday the CDC confirmed that samples it tested from children who had been hospitalized in Illinois and in Kansas City Missouri did show signs of the EVD virus meaning there is a possible regional outbreak  The Iowa Department of Public Health confirmed that EVD cases have been identified in Iowa Officials are hearing of illnesses across the state they say though there is not a firm count of how many people have been infected Dr Christine Nyquist medical director of infection control at Childrens Hospital Colorado said the hospital sent around  samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness Around  were confirmed to be EVD The hospital has seen a  to  increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year she said  Enteroviruses which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold arent unusual  Its important to remember that these infections are very common said   Schuchat is the assistant surgeon general for the US Public Health Service and the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases  When you have a bad summer cold often what you have is an enterovirus The CDC estimates there are  to  million viral infections each year in the United States The season often hits its peak in September This particular type of enterovirus  EVD  is uncommon but not new It was identified in the s and there have been fewer than  reported cases since that time But its possible that the relatively low number of reports might be because EVD is hard to identify  Its one that we dont know as much about as we would like Schuchat said EVD was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world Over the years   in Georgia Pennsylvania Arizona and various countries including the Philippines Japan and the Netherlands  The reason health officials are concerned this year is that there have been so many hospitalizations  Thats the scary part  the unpredictability I think Nyquist said  The virus has sent more than  children a day to a Kansas City Missouri hospital where about  of the youngsters were placed in intensive care officials said In Kansas City about  children were recently treated at Childrens Mercy Hospital and at least  of them received intensive hospitalization spokesman Jake Jacobson said Its worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care I would call it unprecedented Ive practiced for  years in pediatrics and Ive never seen anything quite like this said Dr Mary Anne Jackson the hospitals division director for infectious diseases Weve had to mobilize other providers doctors nurses Its big she said  The Kansas City hospital treats  of that areas ill children Staff members noticed an initial spike on August  Jackson said It could have taken off right after school started Our students start back around August  and I think it blew up at that point Jackson said Our peak appears to be between the st and the th of August Weve seen some leveling of cases at this point An analysis by the CDC   for EVD according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services  Vaccines for EVD arent currently available and there is no specific treatment for infections the Missouri agency said  Many infections will be mild and selflimited requiring only symptomatic treatment it said Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EVD may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy Some cases of the virus might contribute to death but none of the Missouri cases resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States the agency said Its not usually fatal thank God for that Schuchat said But Im not sure why its infecting so many kids as opposed to so many people Symptoms include coughing difficulty breathing and rash Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing  The majority of the children who have been hospitalized with the virus at least on the samples the CDC tested did have asthma to start with  The virus made their symptoms worse We want parents to know that its important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine Schuchat said  Jackson said physicians in other Midwest states reported cases with similar symptoms The full scope is yet to be known but it would appear its in the Midwest  In our community meticulous handwashing is not happening Its just the nature of kids Jackson said Denver also is seeing a spike in respiratory illnesses resembling the virus   said More than  children have gone to Childrens Hospital Colorado emergency and urgent care locations since August  for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses including enterovirus and viral infections hospital spokeswoman Melissa Vizcarra said Of those  have been sick enough to be admitted to the Aurora facility And Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children had five children in intensive care and  more in the pediatric unit KUSA said last week This is the worst Ive seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children   Were going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of Denver Will Cornejo  was among the children in intensive care at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children after he came down with a cold last weekend and then woke up Tuesday night with an asthma attack that couldnt be controlled with his medicine albuterol His mother Jennifer called  when her sons breathing became shallow and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital she told KUSA  Her son was put on a breathing tube for  hours It was like nothing weve ever seen Jennifer Cornejo told KUSA He was unresponsive He was laying on the couch He couldnt speak to me He was turning white and his lips turned blue Were having a hard time believing that it really happened she added Were much better now because he is breathing on his own Were on the mend In East Columbus Ohio Nationwide Childrens Hospital saw a  increase in patients with respiratory illnesses last weekend and Dr Dennis Cunningham said patient samples are being tested to determine whether EVD is behind the spike  Blessing Hospital in Quincy Illinois saw more than  children with respiratory issues last weekend and seven of them were admitted   The hospitals Dr Robert Merrick believes that the same virus that hit Kansas City is causing the rash of illnesses seen at the Quincy and Hannibal hospitals which both imposed restrictions this week on children visiting patients the affiliate said Mostly were concerned about them bringing it in to a vulnerable patient We dont feel that the hospital is more dangerous to any other person at this time Merrick told WGEM  Like other enteroviruses EVD appears to spread through close contact with infected people the agency said Unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness febrile rash illness or neurologic illness such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis EVD has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease the Missouri health agency said  Clusters of the virus have struck Asia Europe and the United States from  to  and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation the health agency said To reduce the risk of infection individuals should wash hands often with soap and water for  seconds especially after changing diapers avoid touching eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands avoid kissing hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs and stay home when feeling sick the Missouri agency said
