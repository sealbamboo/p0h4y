More than a third of adults are on the cusp of developing type diabetes figures for England show A report   highlights an extremely rapid rise in prediabetes since  The authors predict a surge in type diabetes in the coming years with consequences for life expectancy and disability  The charity Diabetes UK said the NHS was already spending onetenth of its budget on the condition People with prediabetes have no symptoms of ill health but their blood sugar levels are at the very high end of the normal range  on the cusp of diabetes  Between  and  of people with prediabetes go on to develop type diabetes each year the researchers said Their study looked at Health Survey for England data between  and  In   of adults surveyed had prediabetes but the figures trebled to  by  Three years ago yearold Helen Barker from Snaith in East Yorkshire was told she was following her brother and her dad on the path to type diabetes It was through a routine checkup at the doctors I was told my glucose tolerance was not at the right levels She was advised to change her lifestyle and went on to improve her diet exercise more and initially dropped five stone It worked to be completely honest I put some weight back on but Im in a lot different place now I was retested and Im back to normal  I dont want to be back in that category my dads got so many health problems because of diabetes  He cannot drive due to damage to his eyes and is about to start kidney dialysis  Helen said There are simple steps to turn things around if only hed known  years sooner that he could have prevented some of these things  Prof Richard Baker one of the reports authors from the University of Leicester told the BBC The level of increased diabetes risk has gone up quite steeply it has been rising in other countries but it has leapt up faster in England than in the US  its a big jump really A lot of people with type diabetes manage their condition very well but some are unlucky and get severe consequences quickly its not a nice disease to have  Fellow researcher Dr Arch Mainous from the University of Florida added I think the huge rise was surprising it was substantial People are going to transition from these highrisk states to diabetes and there will be a lot of implications for people being sick and healthcare costs  Prof Baker said the health service had some good things in place such as health checks for people over the age of  But he argued a broader approach either more regulation or getting the food industry to compete more on the healthiness of their products was needed   Around  million people in the UK have type diabetes and the charity Diabetes UK estimates that figure will rise to  million by  The condition is linked to risk factors which include being overweight Type  diabetes develops when the insulinproducing cells in the body are unable to produce enough insulin or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly  The charitys chief executive Barbara Young said Unless we make people aware of their risk of type diabetes and support them in changing their lifestyles we could see an even greater increase in the number of people with the condition than we are already expecting  A tenth of the NHS budget is already being spent on diabetes and unless we get much better at preventing type diabetes this spending will soon rise to unsustainable levels Up to  of cases of type diabetes could be avoided or delayed Programmes such as the NHS Health Check are already doing an important job in assessing peoples risk by measuring weight and waist as well as looking at family history and ethnicity  But at the moment not everyone who is eligible for this check is getting one and we need this to change
