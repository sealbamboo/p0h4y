Passport and tax records in hand Nela Barboza fiddled nervously with a plastic folding fan as she approached Jessie Orozcos desk Buenas tardes she said cordially Im here to sign up for Obamacare Orozco a benefits counselor at St Johns Well Child  Family Center in South Los Angeles was thrilled Around her neck she wore a badge certifying that she was a statetrained enrollment counselor for Californias new medical insurance marketplace  touted as one of the betterfunctioning parts of the Obama administrations healthcare overhaul With a picture of the president tacked to the wall behind her Orozco noted that Barboza could be the first person she would walk through the process of signing up Im going to celebrate when I get this lady approved The sense of anticipation quickly dissipated Orozco encountered problems with the state website created for counselors like her She couldnt find forms in Spanish the language Barboza best understands She had trouble estimating the costs Barboza would pay and confirming details of what would be covered Barboza became agitated complaining at one point that she and her husband would be better off if he didnt work because they would get governmentpaid medical care The state has struggled to put enough trained troops like Orozco on the front lines of the healthcare overhaul Officials say they are catching up and are poised to help millions of Californians reap the benefits of Obamacare From the vantage point of Orozcos desk that hope was tempered by the reality of continuing obstacles Computer glitches persisted misinformation and rumors were in the air and consumers procrastinated worried about the unknowns of choosing a health plan and what it could mean for their care and their pocketbooks Covered California the state marketplace got relatively high marks last week when officials released initial enrollment figures under the Affordable Care Act More than  Californians had selected insurance plans during the first month of signups and about the same number chose plans during the first  days of November An additional  used the exchange to find out they were probably eligible for expanded coverage under MediCal the states healthcare program for the poor Nationwide  people enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans during October far short of Obama administration goals The mix of patients at community clinics like St Johns underscores the complexity of matching people and medical insurance Many are undocumented and cant participate in the state insurance exchange or receive full MediCal coverage Another large group is already enrolled in MediCal or Healthy Way LA a lowincome county program that will be folded into MediCal on Jan  Orozco and her colleagues at the clinic had been successfully signing up people for those programs for months Another smaller group is made up of lowerincome workers who will be required to purchase insurance Those patients now can apply through the states online marketplace or via enrollment counselors like Orozco If they qualify they can obtain government assistance to help pay the premiums After a rocky first few days state officials said last week that  of patients using the public enrollment website at   reported the application was easy to complete Some were able to enroll in just  minutes the exchange reported On her first day as an enrollment advisor Orozco logged onto a separate website used by counselors  and the trouble began You can look but you cant use the website to do the income calculation Orozco told Barboza and her sister Rosa Aguirre who was along to apply for her own insurance The women waited patiently as Orozco struggled to estimate costs and get descriptions of coverage options The site froze up repeatedly Clicking on Spanishlanguage links led to English pages A dropdown menu asked how the women learned about Covered California But the answer options werent working they were all blank Barboza gradually grew distressed as Orozco sought to explain the insurance plans Shed hoped to sign up for MediCal Her sister whose only income is rent she collects from Barboza and other relatives who live in her South Gate home was likely to qualify for that program But Barbozas husband earns close to  a year  too much for the couple to qualify for MediCal Without access to a fully functioning website Orozco tried to describe how the insurance plans and pricing would work Barboza became alarmed when she saw the full unsubsidized cost of the plan she was considering several hundred dollars a month Orozco said the couple would receive government assistance with the premium According to the states public website they would probably pay between  and  per month Barboza and Aguirre didnt appear to understand Why did they have to pay a high premium Barboza wondered Why was Covered California looking at their gross income and not what remained after taxes and expenses Illnesses prevented her from holding a job Barboza said and her husbands employer would not provide fulltime hours or affordable medical benefits In the end Orozco printed out a paper application in English and wrote down a phone number for Barboza to call for a Spanishlanguage copy She didnt want to discuss the couples options further until they had a chance to review them in the language they understood The sisters gathered their things and left Orozco was certain they would be back But as days wore on and messages went unreturned her confidence flagged I really dont know if theyre coming back at all she wrote in an email six days after the womens initial visit Patients forget or simply procrastinate Reached by a reporter that day Aguirre said she had found a social worker who was helping her with her MediCal enrollment Barboza and her husband might go back to Orozco she said My sister has a problem she added They have to get insurance They think We eat or we pay for insurance Orozcos problems with the website for enrollment counselors continued Tiring of waiting online or on hold on the phone  and concerned that patients would not complete the process on their own  she took to printing out applications in English and helping patients many Spanish speaking to fill them out Friday afternoon she poked at her keyboard trying to access the websites chat function A popup box appeared  Its depressing its frustrating and its disrespectful she said Orozco printed out forms and helped three patients submit them for coverage through the state marketplace She still hadnt heard from Barboza
