A program of healthy eating exercise and stress reduction can not only reverse some diseases  it may actually slow down the aging process at the genetic level researchers reported Monday The lifestyle changes affected the telomeres  little caps on the end of the chromosomes that carry the DNA the team at the University of California San Francisco report The report published in Lancet Oncology is based on just a few men and prostate cancer patients at that But it shows surprising results Men who switched to a vegan diet added exercise and stress reduction had longer telomeres The men followed a program advocated by Dr Dean Ornish who has long researched the role of a very lowfat vegetarian diet in improving health Ornish a professor of medicine at UCSF worked with telomere expert Dr Elizabeth Blackburn who won the  Nobel Prize in Medicine for her discoveries Taken as a whole this is really the first study showing that any intervention may reduce cellular aging Ornish told NBC News I think these findings are almost certainly not restricted to men with prostate cancerÂ  Ornish and Blackburns team examined  prostate cancer patients who had chosen to try Ornishs program and compared them to  patients who had not They all had early stage prostate cancer that wasnt considered dangerous The program includes eating a diet high in whole foods fruits vegetables unrefined grains and keeping fat to  percent of calories The average American gets more than a third of calories from fat For the first three months volunteers got takehome meals They also exercised walking at least  minutes a day six days a week did yogabased stretching and breathing exercises practiced relaxation techniques and went to weekly onehour stressreduction group sessions And they gave blood samples  We found that telomerase increased by  percent in just three months Ornish said Telomerase is an enzyme that affects telomeres They also looked at gene activity Gene expression on  genes changed in every case in a beneficial way Ornish told NBC News Five years later the team took blood samples again The  men who followed the Ornish plan had significantly longer telomeres five years later  on average  percent longer The  men who had not followed the program had shorter telomeres   percent shorter on average The more people changed their lifestyles the more they improved Ornish said Ornishs diet plan has been shown to    diabetes and may help keep early prostate    Ornish was working with prostate cancer patients who had chosen not to get any treatment for their tumors Only a few men had given enough blood in the study to make it possible to test their stored samples so he thinks a larger study should now be conducted Ornish says the program is easy to follow Each of the  men had stuck with it for five years and longer  long past the time they were enrolled in the study We are getting  to  percent adherence to our program he said We are getting ridiculously high levels of adherence Ornish says thats because its pleasant and comprehensive And most people feel so much better they change their lifestyle he said  People often think that it has to be a new drug or a new laser something really hightech and expensive to be powerful What we are finding is the simple choices that we make every day are more powerful
