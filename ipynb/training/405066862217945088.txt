HRA Pharma scientists discovered Norlevo began losing its effectiveness when women reach about  kilograms or  pounds Gainer said and showed an absence of effectiveness at about  kilograms or about  pounds  We felt it was our ethical duty  to report those results to our health authorities here in Europe Gainer said  Norlevo is identical to the emergency contraceptive Plan B OneStep said Kelly Cleland a public health expert at Princeton University Both are LNG ECs or emergency contraceptives that include levonorgestrel a synthetic version of the hormone progestogen Emergency contraceptives are often called the morningafter pill because they work by interfering with ovulation preventing the fertilization of an egg Teva Pharmaceuticals which manufactures Plan B did not respond to CNNs request for comment  The Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing the available and related scientific information on this issue including the publication upon which the Norlevo labeling change was based said spokeswoman Erica Jefferson The agency will then determine what if any labeling changes to emergency contraceptives are warranted Plan B is available in the United States   Its generic versions Next Choice One Dose and My Way are also the same as Norlevo Cleland said  Under US federal law generic brands cannot change their labeling until the name brand product does Actavis Next Choice One Dose is approved by the FDA as a safe effective and therapeutically equivalent treatment option to its brand counterpart said Actavis spokesman David Belian Therefore should any update to the Plan B labeling take place we would make the appropriate change to our product as well  European health authorities approved the Norlevo label change a few weeks ago but it will take several months to implement in all the countries HRA Pharma supplies Gainer said The new packaging slip will say the emergency contraceptive is not recommended  if you weigh  pounds or more   which first reported the story   It is unclear why emergency contraceptives may be less effective for overweight women said Anna Glasier an expert in reproductive medicine at the University of Edinburgh Glasier   that analyzed the risk of pregnancy for women who had taken emergency contraception  Glasier and her colleagues found that obese women had three times the risk of getting pregnant after taking emergency contraception than those with a normal body weight The risk was greater for those who had taken levonorgestrel pills compared with those who had taken ulipristal acetate which is used in another emergency contraceptive called    There has been some evidence over the years that low doses of progestogenonly contraceptives have less efficacy in heavier women but we do not know why Glasier told CNN That said it is well recognized that body weight affects the way drugs are metabolized      has shown that women who weigh more than  pounds are at a higher risk of regular oral contraception failure These drugs take longer to reach normal concentration levels in the blood of obese women compared with normal weight women   That may be one reason emergency contraceptives are less effective  Glasier noted that the number of obese women in her study was small so its hard to make broad recommendations based on the research In the general population   levonorgestrel emergency contraception prevents about  of expected pregnancies  You are probably better to take LNGEC after unprotected sex than just to leave it to chance even if you are obese Glasier said  When faced with a choice  I dont think the findings are strong enough for us to tell women that they should not use LNGEC Cleland agreed Because PlanB One Step is now available overthecounter and is by far the easiest EC method to get this is the method that most women are familiar with Cleland recommends overweight women who are worried about the pills effectiveness use an emergency contraceptive with ulipristal acetate or a copper IUD IUDs or intrauterine devices can be inserted by a doctor up to five days after unprotected sex to help prevent pregnancy Its important to note that women shouldnt be relying solely on emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy The best way to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy among women who are sexually active is to use effective birth control correctly and consistently  Find the method that works best for you by talking to your doctor
