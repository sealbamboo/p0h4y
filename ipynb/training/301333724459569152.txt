 Chewing the green leaves of the khat plant for its amphetaminelike effect appears to raise the risk for both stroke and death among   according to a large new study from the Middle East The finding however could have relevance far beyond that region as emigration has increasingly brought khatchewing to the shores of both Europe and North America Consumed by an estimated  to  million people worldwide for centuries the naturally grown   shrub has been widely available and most popular across East Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula where some people munch on khat in pursuit of a euphoric or aroused state of mind We need to be careful about the risk of using herbs and natural substances and khat is an example although it is leaves which appear harmless said study coauthor Dr Jassim Al Suwaidi senior consultant cardiologist at Hamad General Hospital in Doha Qatar It has chemical constituents that are similar to harmful drugs Suwaidi noted such as cocaine and amphetamine and may cause heart attack as well as increase the risk of death and stroke from heart attack Suwaidi and his colleagues report their findings in the Dec  issue of   The principal active ingredients in khat are cathine and cathinone According to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA these chemicals are similar in structure to amphetamine and have similar although weaker stimulant effects The NIDA notes that the euphoria elation alertness and arousal from chewing khat typically last anywhere from  to three hours but can endure for a full day Blood pressure and heart rates may rise during that time followed by the shortterm onset of depression irritability and sleep problems Longterm chewing of khat can lead to tooth decay and gastrointestinal problems in addition to cardiovascular issues such as   Because cathinone is a Schedule I narcotic under US federal law khat is illegal and as with drugs such as heroin or mescaline cannot be used for medical or other purposes Although banned in Germany France and the Netherlands khat is currently legal in the United Kingdom Khat is legal and in widespread use throughout Yemen and Ethiopia and is currently permitted for sale in Israel To explore how khat might boost health risks among individuals with a history of heart disease between  and  the authors focused on roughly  men and women who were part of the nd Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events Gulf RACE Study All were being treated for acute coronary syndrome in one of  hospitals across Saudi Arabia Bahrain Yemen Qatar United Arab Emirates and Oman Of these participants about  percent were deemed to be regular khat chewers almost all  percent from Yemen They more likely to be older and male  percent were women but less likely to have heart health risk factors than nonKhat chewers While still being treated in hospital khat heart patients had about double the death rate due to cardiovascular illness compared to nonkhat heart patients  percent death rate vs  percent One month out the risk spread was even greater a  percent death rate among khat users vs  percent among nonusers And at one year the death rate was nearly  percent among khat users compared with just under  percent among nonusers Overall Suwaidi and associates determined that independent of other contributing factors khatusing heart patients were more likely to experience   heart failure heart attack or a stroke than nonkhatusing heart patients in addition to facing a higher risk for death regardless of gender The ease and rapidity of travel make khat available in distant places Suwaidi said And hence it is important to be aware of these practices he noted adding that prior research suggests that the elevated risk attributed to khat use among heart patients is very likely to also apply to otherwise healthy patients Dr Kirk Garratt clinical director of interventional cardiovascular research at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City commented on the study We know very well that when you have cardiovascular disease any exposure to any meaningful stimulant would be expected to increase heart risk by changing the vascular dynamic of the blood vessels that control the blood flow through the brain and heart he said We also know that these drugs can facilitate or trigger irregular heart rhythms which can be very problematic Cocaine for example can have a negative impact on people both with and without heart disease Garratt added And those with heart disease face an especially elevated risk So these findings are not really surprising
