For years health advocates have been telling us to move more But just how much more A multitude of activity tracking devices now promise to answer that question Generally these digital monitors which can be worn around the wrist on collars and belts even as jewelry record how and how much you move throughout the day Some aim to do a great deal more Makers of the devices have begun intensive campaigns aimed at convincing the large population of worried well consumers to get wired and start recording their every move How well do these work Curious about the benefits and limits Ive been testing as many different models as possible  wearing them day and night for six months  models in all sometimes four at once Ive learned a great deal about these gadgets And about myself Id thought I was a fairly active person I bike to work most days and hit the gym or get other   two or three times a week The trackers on the other hand showed that aside from those spates of exercise for the vast majority of each day I was completely sedentary But that may not be the whole story  typically combine a wearable device with a website or smartphone app to view data collected about your movements The goal is to measure not only your steps from the parking lot to your desk but also your sedentary down time at work or in front of a television bursts of intense exercise and even your sleep habits  all to create a complete picture of your most and least healthful behaviors Some models also offer tips and set goals based on your data The most popular models are made by     and   the gadgets typically cost  to  Most are made of rubber and plastic and come in a choice of colors with the notable exception of the Shine made of metal by In  activity trackers generated an estimated  million in American retail sales according to Ben Arnold an analyst at New Yorks NPD Group who says the market could double this year The sharp rise of trackers stems from advances in chip technology The devices all share a common sensor an accelerometer that can track movement in three dimensions up and down side to side and forward and back Accelerometers can now be made small enough and at a low enough cost that they can be embedded in almost anything While all activity trackers have an accelerometer some include additional sensors to pick up other signs of activity   makes an armband that measures perspiration and muscle heat for a more accurate assessment of activity level and calories burned   sells the B Band watch which measures heart rate perspiration and skin temperature   from Withings of France can measure resting heart rate Many trackers estimate the length and fitfulness of sleep by sensing how much you move throughout the night And Polar and Garmin both make trackers that can pair with chest straps to record heart rate during a workout But even the best tracker cant recognize all of your movements As I sit writing this my wrists are motionless but my leg is tapping to music My activity trackers dont seem to notice  fidgeting wont be reflected in the calorie counts they show me Thats too bad because theres an interesting body of research suggesting that a propensity to fidget is   More surprisingly perhaps only the trackers made by Basis and BodyMedia gave me credit for being active when riding my bike Most of the rest just sat on my wrist recording no activity  and true enough my wrist wasnt moving much as I pedaled through the city traffic All of them were more accurate when I was playing tennis Activity trackers usually dont measure exertion only motion Company officials say that intense exercise is just a small part of the average consumers day and that its more useful to capture the bigger fitness picture For highresistance lowmovement exercises none of these work really well including us said Sonny Vu chief executive of Misfit Wearables But its the other  and a half hours thats the most interesting Despite the occasional gaps I found tracking to be useful if I focused less on the precise numbers and more on daytoday variations in activity Comparing the  steps I take on some weekend days to the  or  on a typical workday made me work harder to move more on weekdays Can trackers really change behavior in people Last year Dr Rajani Larocca a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a sixweek lifestyle program for  patients with   ages  to  that included weekly sessions to encourage exercise and healthful eating each participant also was outfitted with a Fitbit Zip tracker Every single person increased their activity Dr Larocca said People felt more knowledgeable Eight months later about half the patients from the group still wear a tracker Researchers at the   in Boston have been giving activity trackers to subjects for six to nine months then studying changes in their behavior Dr Kamal Jethwani head of research at the center said he saw three distinct groups of people among study participants About  percent are quantified selfers with an affinity for this kind of feedback just by looking at the numbers they are motivated to be more active An additional  percent to  percent need some encouragement in addition to tracker data to effectively change their behavior But most of the subjects observed by Dr Jethwani dont understand the data and need help making sense of it For them he said social motivation from a friend or joining a team or workplace challenge may be more effective I figure Im in the second group the ones who need a little push One of my favorite features is the Jawbone UPs inactivity alert I set mine to vibrate on my wrist if I havent moved in the past hour And Jawbones smartphone app offers personalized tips that are actually interesting For instance When you go to bed  minutes later than average you tend to take  fewer steps the next day And after several late nights I was told Go to bed before  am Well OK Other trackers like Fitbits have tried to increase motivation by focusing on shortterm goals  making it to  steps each day for example The Basis tracker awards points for keeping to streaks of healthy activity like the number of days youre active for more than  minutes Of the trackers I tested Nikes FuelBand put the strongest emphasis on competition with friends But almost all the apps now have social features allowing you to share your activities offer encouragement and hold one another accountable for goals All the data youre recording is tied to a particular companys software so you cant take it along if you decide to switch tracking devices But many allow calorie data to be shared with other apps like   or   Having worn more of these trackers than any human should I have to admit I am less captivated than I once was Now I almost never look at the data that they collect But thats not necessarily a bad thing The goal should not be to make people wear the activity tracker for the whole year Dr Jethwani said Its to have them wear it when its meaningful  that is when better habits start to slip away These days Ive become keenly aware of how active I am and how active I need to be in order to feel healthy and energized I dont need a monitor anymore Im tracking me
