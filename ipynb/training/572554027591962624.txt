The big buzz at the annual Interbike show this month in Las Vegas was the ebike a bike with a stealthy electric motor hidden in the wheel hub or crankshaft that pedals like a normal bike but gives you a quiet boost when you want it By clicking a handlebar button you tell the motor how much or little pedalassist you want Diehard cyclists called it sacrilege but theyd better get used to it Ebikes are already huge in Europe and exploding here A second ride explains why The e is for exhilaration Ebikes let couples ride together  as slow or fast as they want  at the same pace They get college students to classes and commuters to work sweatfree Best of all they get everyone  young old skinny fat fit nonfit  over the thing that stops most regular folks from cycling in the first place the hills In that sense they are great starter bikes to shape up the outofshape  and might even lead them back to nonmotorized bikes Not cheap but nearly free once you own one no insurance is required since the electric assist cuts off at  mph the ebike eliminates all the negatives of cycling  and just leaves the fun The speed aluminumframed extralarge er hardtail mountain bike from a German company includes a centermounted watt motor which is unique in a market full of motors embedded in the hub of the rear wheel The XDuro like all others is a pedalassist meaning that the motor shuts off if you are not pedaling or if you top  mph  Smooth powerful speed and striking looks The pedalmotor interaction is instant and seamless  possibly a bit smoother than the rearhubmotor bikes although all the bikes worked fine Bosch claims that the hub motors are less efficient and have a slight lag between pedaling and the motor assist and that the crankmount position allows its engine to be smaller yet more powerful Handlings great due to the bikes rolloveranything er wheels and balanced weight distribution from the central locations of the framemounted battery and eggshaped motor The same Bosch system is also found on bikes from Irvinebased Felt and Canadas LaPierre The computer display includes odometer trip distance clock speed average speed and trip time Data bars tell you how much human power versus motor power is being put into the system and evaluate how much range you have left eliminating range anxiety The pushbutton controls next to the left grip let you click through four power modes from Eco to Turbo the latter allowing the thrill of climbing a steep hill at  mph that would normally have reduced me to a grunting zigzagging  mph  The display which is mounted over the stem can be damaged in an endoverend crash as my son proved on his first ride on a steep dirt trail Putting the display in a more shielded position might be a good idea   A Haibike fullsuspension
