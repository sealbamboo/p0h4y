The rate of circumcisions performed on newborn boys in US hospitals dropped  percentage points over the past three decades with an especially steep decline in Western states according to US government data released Thursday  The national rate declined to  percent in  from  percent in  according to the report from the National Center for Health Statistics The tally excludes many circumcisions including those performed in other places such as religious institutions and those performed later in life  Broadly rates fell during the s increased in the s and fell again in the early s During the period covered by the data male newborn circumcision was most common in  at  percent and least common in  at  percent  Circumcision is a ritual obligation for infant Jewish boys and is also a common rite among Muslims who account for the largest share of circumcised men worldwide  The wider US population adopted the practice due to potential health benefits such as reducing the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and cutting the risk of penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV  Still the practice has been the subject of heated debate including efforts to ban circumcision in San Francisco and Germany  The American Academy of Pediatrics said last August that the health benefits of infant circumcision outweigh the risks of the surgery  The National Center for Health Statistics offered little explanation in the report for the falling rates but said fluctuations over the years followed changes to the American Academy of Pediatrics assessment of the procedures medical value  The centers findings were based on annual discharge data of between  and  newborn boys at between  and  US shortstay nonfederal hospitals  In Western states the rate dropped to  percent in  from  percent in  the center said Rates in the Northeast were flat overall In the Midwest they mirrored national trends In the South they increased from  until  and then declined  A variety of factors could be at work  The federal Medicaid program for the poor has stopped paying for circumcisions in some  US states and some insurers have balked at paying for a procedure without a strong medical justification  Hospitalization lengths over the decades for mothers and newborns have come to be measured in hours rather than days prompting more circumcisions to be done in outpatient settings said Douglas Diekema a professor of pediatrics at Seattle Childrens Hospital  The margin of error varies across the data in the report The national rate for example has a relative standard error of roughly  percent to  percent
