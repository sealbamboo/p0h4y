Its a bit like probiotics for mosquitoes When scientists infect mosquitoes with a specific bacterium the insects become resistant to the malaria parasite Sounds like an easy way to stamp out malaria right Just introduce the infected mosquitoes into an area and let the bugs take over the natural population But theres been one big hitch The    called    doesnt stick around inside mosquitoes that carry malaria So scientists would have to continually release flocks of treated mosquitoes to keep malaria down Now entomologists have overcome this obstacle at least partially Theyve created a malariatransmitting mosquito that maintains the   infection for its entire lifetime and even passes it onto its offspring Groups have been trying to do this for more than  years microbiologist   from the Johns Hopkins Malaria Institute tells Shots So its a landmark achievement The findings   Thursday in the journal   raise the possibility of one day controlling malaria with the bacteria You could just release large number of infected females and establish   in a mosquito population Dimopoulos who coauthored the study with a team at Michigan State University says Gradually it would convert a malariaspreading population to a nonspreading one Specifically Dimopoulos and his colleagues got   to take up permanent residency inside   mosquito the major malaria transmitter in South Asia and the Middle East But theres still a long way to go before the bacteriainfected mosquitoes are even tested in the field The problem he says is that that   hurts the mosquitoes chances of reproducing  reducing the number of eggs that hatch by half Thats a big disadvantage for the malariaresistant mosquitoes out in the wild They wouldnt be able to compete with the bacteriafree bugs But Dimopoulos thinks they can tweak the system to fix the hatching problem The bacteria is very effective blocking the parasite in the mosquito he says But this is sort of a prototype The system needs to be optimized before it can be tested in the field Indeed Australian scientists have already started such testing for   another disease transmitted by mosquitoes A few years ago a   at Monash University in Melbourne figured out that   infection makes the   mosquito resistant to the dengue virus His team has released bacteriainfected mosquitoes into several small communities in northeastern Australia ONeill   NPRs Joe Palca last year Over a very short period of time the   was able to invade the wild mosquito population until close to  percent of all mosquitoes had the   infection  and so we presume greatly reduced ability to transmit dengue between people ONeill said This approach has several advantages over spraying pesticides for dengue and malaria control For starters it would be permanent because the system is selfpropagating And   already infects a large number of insects So many scientists think its ecologically sound  at least relative to chemicals
