 Low levels of vitamin D may confer a   but too much vitamin D may have the opposite effect according to a large crosssectional study The critical threshold appears to be a serum hydroxyvitamin D concentration of  ngmL  more than that level increases Creactive protein CRP a biomarker for cardiovascular disease but lower serum concentrations of hydroxyvitamin D lower CRP levels reported Muhammad Amer MD and Rehan Qayyum MD MHS from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Their findings were published online in the   A multivariate analysis that tracked hydroxyvitamin D concentrations as well as CRP in more than  healthy adults revealed that above the threshold for benefit CRP increased with each ngmL increase in hydroxyvitamin D In a univariate analysis CRP levels decreased as levels of hydroxyvitamin D increased up to the median of  ngmL The authors analyzed data from participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES Researchers combined three twoyear cycles of continuous NHANES surveys from  to  The mean age of participants was  and the median serum hydroxyvitamin D and CRP levels were  ngmL and  mgdL respectively The proportion of men to women was close  percent versus  percent with no significant difference in levels of hydroxyvitamin D between the two groups Whites had significantly higher baseline levels of   than nonwhites Significantly more people with a body mass index   had lower hydroxyvitamin D levels at baseline the same was true for smokers However the mean total cholesterol was significantly higher for those with higher levels of vitamin D at baseline From our results it appears that vitamin D supplementation among subjects with baseline vitamin D values of greater than  ngmL might have no additional effects on systemic inflammation as measured by changes in the serum CRP levels Amer and Qayyum concluded Researchers admitted they could not determine a temporal relation between hydroxyvitamin D and CRP Another limitation was the inability to adjust for geographic location or time of year
