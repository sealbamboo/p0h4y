One of the oldest known workplace dangers is breathing in tiny bits of silica which is basically sand Even the ancient Greeks knew that stone cutters got sick from breathing in dust And today nearly  million American workers are exposed to silica dust in jobs ranging from construction to manufacturing The legal limit on how much silica workers can inhale was set decades ago Workplace safety experts say that limit needs to be cut in half  because otherwise workers face an increased risk of lung cancer silicosis and other diseases And on Valentines Day in  it looked like a safety agency at the Department of Labor was getting ready to do that The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA sent a proposal for new silica rules to the White House Office of Management and Budget OMB The proposal   to get a day review But almost two years later its still under review There has been incredible delay inexcusable delay on protecting workers against silica exposures says Peg Seminario director of safety and health for the AFLCIO a group of  unions that represents more than  million workers She says the push for a new silica rule goes way back We had hoped back under the Bush administration it would move and it didnt And then we certainly hoped under the Obama administration that a silica standard would move forward says Seminario Unfortunately its been stuck over at OMB and the White House now for two years The governments own estimates show the impact of waiting she says Every year this rule is delayed another  workers will die says Seminario Thats deaths Thats not to even look at the numbers of workers who will become sick We still have thousands of new cases of silicosis every year in this country Tom Ward a yearold mason who lives and works in Michigan knows just how bad silicosis is When he was a kid his dad developed   after working as a sandblaster Ward remembers his father coming home one day and collapsing The last day he worked he came in and fell down and pretty much you know fell apart basically and said I cant do it no more  says Ward His father got the official diagnosis of silicosis at age  and died at age  So we watched him slowly suffocate for five years says Ward When Ward grew up and started working as a bricklayer and a mason he had no idea that the saws and grinders he used were spewing out dust that could expose him to silica  until one day he took a safety course When they went over the respiratory protection is when it really sunk in recalls Ward From that point on my view on how we cut things at work changed dramatically to say the least He now wonders if hell develop lung disease And he worries about the apprentices he teaches at a training center for the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers He says at construction sites you can see clouds of dust but workers arent going to speak up Theyre not going to go complain about anything right now especially with the economic conditions says Ward Everybody is really scared for their job And theyre not going to say a thing about safety Thats why he wants to see the government take action on silica  to release the proposed rules so they can be publicly debated and then hopefully finalized Last year he went with other worker advocates to talk with officials at the White House OMB which is doing the review Theyre not the only ones making their case to officials there A lot of people dont want to see silica exposure limits cut in half Opponents to the new rule include trade associations for the makers of brick steel and concrete as well as the producers of sand stone and gravel Theres also opposition from construction industry groups like road builders and general contractors The rule would cost manufacturers and the industry as a whole billions of dollars a year that is just not sustainable for manufacturing when employers are looking to hire and create new opportunities for job creation says Amanda Wood director of labor and employment policy at the National Association of Manufacturers In addition she points out that silicosis deaths have already dropped more than  percent compared wih decades ago So based on these two factors we do not believe that the rule is necessary says Wood Marc Freedman executive director of labor law policy at the US Chamber of Commerce also opposes OSHAs effort on silica I think this is an issue that is not appropriate for revision And while some have protested the lengthy OMB review Freedman says it serves as an important check To the extent that theres this final review that makes sure that OSHA has satisfied the requirements they have to satisfy thats a very valuable step in the process he says noting that once a proposed rule is published that very much casts the die in terms of what a final rule can look like He and others argue that instead of issuing a new rule the government should better enforce the existing one Inspections that check for silica frequently find employers that are breaking the law says Brian Turmail a spokesperson for the   Theyre finding that firms arent complying with the current limit about a third of a time says Turmail Were going to get a lot more improvement in workplace safety if we just can work together to make it so that everyone can comply with the current standard than were ever going to get out of changing the standard to a new and even more unattainable level I think we all want to achieve the same thing which is a safer workplace says Turmail who notes that the employers in his association care about their workers health Our concern is that OSHAs approach isnt going to be effective But the guy who runs the Department of Labors safety agency OSHA doesnt buy the arguments from industry David Michaels an epidemiologist who serves as director of OSHA says the current silica standard is not good enough Even if  percent of employers kept exposures at the current standard silicaexposed workers would still be at increased risk for lung cancer silicosis and chronic obstructive lung disease says Michaels Exposures have dropped compared with the terrible exposures decades ago says Michaels but still there are plenty of people exposed to dangerous levels and we cant ignore that And he says the changes his agency wants will not result in lost jobs There will be people who will say that our proposal will hurt employment in the United States and thats simply not true says Michaels Weve looked at the industry analyses and theyre wrong Michaels is well aware that some worker advocates are frustrated that the White House review has gone on for almost two years Look I sympathize with those advocates says Michaels The process that the law requires us to go through is a very long and complicated one He explains that OSHA has to do extensive studies to show that every industry can comply with the proposed rules without hurting their bottom lines And thats what weve been doing Weve now finished that process says Michaels And were confident that our proposal meets these requirements He expects the proposal to be made public this spring A spokesperson for OMB said it does not comment on rules under review
