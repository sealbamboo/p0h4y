Sitting in her San Francisco living room Kimberly Jeffrey is combing her son Noels hair He groans but she meets his energy with calm  and adoration Noels birth was not an easy time While Jeffrey was pregnant she served a sixmonth sentence for petty theft at a state prison When it came time to deliver Noel through a caesareansection Jeffrey was also confronted with the prospect of sterilization As I was laying on the operating table moments before I went into surgery medical staff had made a statement Jeffrey recalls Im not even quite sure if he was actually talking to me or if he was just making a general statement to all the medical staff  that OK were going to do this tubal ligation And I said Hey I dont want any procedures done outside of the Csection  Jeffrey refused the tubal ligation but a recent investigation from the   revealed that scores of female inmates underwent the procedure which is supposed to be prohibited for California prisoners between  and  When some of these sterilizations came to light this summer lawmakers demanded answers from prison health care officials In response prison officials released documents that revealed hundreds of female inmates have been sterilized since  They also produced a  memo directing tubal ligation in postpartum care Clark Kelso the federal receiver for prison health care in California spoke to lawmakers at a recent hearing about the memos directive We dont know why  its very long ago Kelso said We dont know why that particular decision was reached  but that was what doctors in the field were told After a federal court ruled human rights abuses were taking place under California state leadership it appointed the federal receiver to take control of the states prison health care But the sterilizations continued It seemed to me we had a real conflict of direction from headquarters Kelso said At the same legislative hearing Democratic state Sen Hannah Beth Jackson raised the specter of eugenics I think were all committed to getting to the bottom of this and making sure that these antiquated notions and almost barbaric concepts are no longer part of our lexicon she said Jackson is a member of the California Legislative Womens Caucus which requested the state audit She wants the investigation to reveal more about the circumstances of inmate consent We also want to find out who are the women who have been sterilized while in prison Lets break them down by race by economic situation by age by number of children they have she said Jackson is particularly concerned with the possibility of coercion in relation to the procedures One could argue almost by definition that being incarcerated takes away your ability to voluntarily consent California has a unique legacy of discouraging reproduction by people with less desirable characteristics Alexandra Minna Stern a professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan says a third of all involuntary sterilizations performed nationally under eugenics laws during the th century occurred in California Eugenics as much as it was about hereditary control it was also about social control Stern says So it sought to control those and then deprive the reproductive ability of those who are identified as problem people in society  so those who were identified as sexually deviant as you know a burden on the state as morons as feebleminded Californias eugenics law was repealed in  but Stern says the recent prison sterilizations have those overtones Prison officials say the medically unnecessary procedures stopped in   the same year Kimberly Jeffreys son Noel was born When you have a baby you just  start over life all over again Jeffrey says Because everything is new again The decision to have a child Jeffrey says should be every womans choice
