New details about the first person to be cured of HIV through drug therapy alone offer hope that others who are born with the virus may be able to beat it back and avoid a lifetime of treatment researchers reported Wednesday The formerly HIVpositive Mississippi girl drew widespread interest in March when doctors   in March at a medical meeting in Atlanta Now they have published a   of the girls treatment and recovery in New England Journal of Medicine The yearold girl has not taken any antiretroviral drugs for at least  months  yet tests find no detectable level of HIV RNA in her blood according to the report The only other person considered functionally cured of HIV is Timothy Ray BrownÂ  also known as the Berlin patient Browns cure was brought about by more radical means  a bone marrow transplant He needed the transplant because he had acute myeloid leukemia and his doctors used it as an opportunity to find a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that blocks HIV from entering cells But there are several reasons why this approach cant be extended to the estimated  million people worldwide who are HIVpositive For one bone marrow transplants are risky The risk of death is acceptable for patients with cancer but not for patients with HIV who can control their infection with drugs doctors say Also very few patients would be able to find a bone marrow donor who is a match for their immune system and who also has the genetic mutation that keeps HIV at bay Researchers are trying to introduce the rare mutation directly to patients   though more research is needed before clinical trials can begin The girls case is enticing because her cure came about through antiretroviral drug treatment or ART Experts suspect that the threedrug cocktail was so successful because it prevented HIV from establishing itself in the patients immune system Once the virus digs in it evades drugs and remains dormant until the opportunity arises to strike again Thanks to preventive treatments babies born with HIV are rare in the US  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that fewer than  infants were infected at birth in  But around the world about  babies are born with the virus every day experts estimate Those are the patients who stand to gain from the unintentional experiment involving the Mississippi girl according to the authors of the New England Journal of Medicine report The girls doctors didnt stop her treatment to see if she could get along without her drugs because a test like that would have been considered unethical Instead the mother stopped filling the girls prescriptions when she was  months old She also told doctors her daughter hadnt taken the ART drugs since she was  months old Five months later the girl came to a clinic for a checkup Her doctors expected to find that her viral load which had been undetectable since she was  days old had built back up But blood tests found no signs of the virus  a complete surprise The results were confirmed by additional blood tests No HIV antibodies were found in samples drawn when the girl was   and  months old according to the New England Journal of Medicine report A single copy of viral RNA was found in blood plasma drawn when the girl was  months old but ultrasensitive tests failed to detect any copies two months later At the age of  months at least  months after the cessation of ART the child has no detectable level of HIV RNA the authors wrote When the girls case was first announced some doctors wondered whether the child really had HIV in the first place The New England Journal of Medicine report offers much evidence that she was infected in utero A blood sample drawn  hours after birth contained HIV DNA Another sample drawn an hour later had enough HIV RNA   copies per milliliter of blood  to qualify for an HIVpositive diagnosis Doctors initially treated the baby with a threedrug cocktail that included zidovudine lamivudine and nevirapine Her first doses were administered when she was  hours old After one week doctors switched her from nevirapine to ritonavirboosted lopinavir As treatment continued her viral load declined in a manner similar to that described previously in HIV infected infants and adults receiving ART they wrote Back in March some experts also wondered whether the girl happened to have the rare mutation that makes people naturally immune to HIV She does not according to the study The doctors also noted that the girls growth and development have been normal The girls case supports the idea that starting antiretroviral therapy very soon after birth prevents the virus from getting any traction in the immune system the reports authors concluded Further studies already in the planning stages might be able to show that the strategy can spare infected infants from a lifetime of therapy they concluded    and like   on Facebook ALSO
