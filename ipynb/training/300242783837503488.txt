Think of the scorpion reach as one of your favorite hip-opening yoga moves on steroids. It's challenging, but it leaves you feeling strong and limber and ready for anything.. Fitness expert Mike Fitch uses it as a dynamic warm-up in his new Animal Flow body-weight resistance class at Equinox gyms.. The total body exercise stretches your hips, spine and legs as it strengthens your shoulders and tones your abdominal muscles.. Start in an elevated plank position with your body in one long straight line. Tilt your body forward slightly so your shoulders are in front of your wrists. Bring your right knee in, rotating your trunk, so it reaches the inside of your left wrist. Then, shoot the right leg out as you shift your weight back until the head is positioned evenly between the arms. When your head reaches this point, drop your leg 90 degrees in an arc over your body, keeping your standing leg soft and toe pointed out. Repeat the movement on the same leg.. Do five to eight repetitions. Switch sides and repeat.
