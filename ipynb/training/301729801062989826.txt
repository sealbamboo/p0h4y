After two seasons away from  during which time she became mom to a girl Lukensia and boy PhoenixJillian Michaels is back Shes not exactly a kinder gentler Jillian but motherhood has made it easier for her to relate to womens slimdown woes 
                   
                  The only time I put on weight recently was with the kids she says Her trick for losing it Reallife simple tactics Ive become the master of shortcuts Its still about eating less and moving more but theres a way to do it so you dont feel miserable This way the weight stays off Here are her top tips 
                   
                   
                    You know the kind says Jillian Everyones like Give up carbs Give up fat Wait no now Im taking pills None of them are manageable longtermand they wreak havoc with your metabolism Because youre either starving yourself or youre cutting out a major food group Then you go back into weightgain mode but its even worse because your body has adjusted to all that crazy fad crap Make  percent of the food you eat healthy and take  percent of your daily calories and make them fun Otherwise Jillian says youll feel deprivedand more tempted to go off the deep end 
                    When you tell yourself what you have to do or what you cant do the deprivation language makes you rebel But if you say Im not going to have thatI   its a choice and youre in control 
                    Sleep is a cornerstone of weight management because of the impact it has on your hormones that control how you burn fat how you store fat and how youre maintaining muscle The better your hormone balance the better your weight management I work my butt off to get eight hours a night but right now Im at sixthe show is murdering me Even if I go to bed early my son wakes up When you work multiple muscles at the same time youre getting your cardiovascular exercise in while you strengthtrain Youre not only saving time but youre burning more calories while youre doing it 
                    Order without looking at the menu Almost every restaurant has the basicsveggies grains and protein If you go in knowing what you want I guarantee youll be able to make a meal If youre too uncomfortable to ask for what you need tell a white lie Say youre allergic I know its controversial to suggest this but women in particular can really have trouble standing up for their own needs So if you want the broccoli soup pured without cream tell the waiter youre lactose intolerant Make a slim lunch options book of all the takeout places in your area where you know therell be healthy things to eat When I used to have an office job Id think OK theres the Italian place but I can get the antipasto salad with light cheese no salami dressing on the side 
                    Pack small meals you can make in a hotel room I bring oatmeal packets like Natures Path Hemp Plus because you can make it with a coffeemaker and snacks like a bag of almonds a  Days vegan hemp protein bar or Justins peanut butter or almond butter in packets 
                    Eat a filling healthy snack before you leave home And take a healthy dish so its like youre contributing but youve also covered your ass with something you can eat 
                      inhibits the production of cortisol a hormone that essentially tells your body Store fat Eat grapefruit slices with breakfast 
                    Lean protein helps you stay fuller for longer it has the amino acids that are the building blocks for muscle Chicken and fish are good too 
                    Hydration can curb hunger and boost your metabolism by up to  percent Drink water until your pee looks like lemonade 
                    Its got antioxidants I can get away with calling it a health food in moderation because honestly Id rather be dead than live without sweets 
                    Stand whenever you can Standing burns  times more calories than sitting Stand when youre at the doctors office when you watch TV even when you work at your computerI put mine on the kitchen counter Just stand 
                    Dump everything you have that contains     and highfructose corn syrup 
                    Put the healthiest things on display   on the countertop the healthiest things in the fridge at eye level and the best snacks at the front of your cupboard so youll see those first 
                    Dont buy more treat food than youre going to eat in one day Get just one caloriecontrolled allotment like a small bag of chips so you cant continue to go back for more 
                    I put it in perspective I think OK I feel squishy And its because I havent worked out So I think of something fun to incentivize myself Like Bobs her   cotrainer Bob Harpers spin class I love
