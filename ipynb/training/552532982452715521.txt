Belfast Health Trust has cancelled all nonurgent elective surgery up to and including Sunday  January due to pressures on emergency departments The rest of Northern Irelands five trusts have cancelled some nonurgent elective surgeries  It is one of a series of escalation measures put in place in order to tackle demands on the emergency system  The Southern Trust said it had cancelled less than  operations and was doing so on Tuesday only  The Belfast trust said This decision has not been taken lightly and will be kept under review throughout the remainder of the week   We would like to stress that cancer surgery and emergency cases are unaffected Minor healthcare issues can be dealt with at home by a pharmacist or by a GP Meanwhile the South Eastern Trust said all of its hospital emergency departments were under significant pressure on Tuesday evening It said the Ulster Hospital Dundonald was facing particular challenges It is not unheard of for hospitals to cancel non urgent operations in times of pressure  But it is unusual for all five health trusts to do it at the same time  It is an indication of just how much pressure Northern Irelands health service is under especially within emergency care  The BBC has been told that the measure is being reviewed daily and was introduced after all health trusts reported an extraordinarily busy weekend  The ED attendances for the period from  December last year to  January are  with  waiting longer than the  hour target Last year more than  people sought help at their emergency department when  people exceeded waiting  hours  A national target is in place where people should not have to wait more than four hours to be seen by a doctor in the emergency system  While a spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board said it was unacceptable that anyone should have to wait they stressed that Northern Irelands waiting time figures were improving  In  there were  hour breaches while last year that figure was slashed to      Antrim Area hospital is reported to be the busiest on Tuesday night  On a normal day it sees around  people in its emergency department but it is expected that figure will be exceeded on Tuesday night In a statement the South Eastern Health Trust said it was experiencing significant pressure at all of its emergency departments and increasing emergency admissions to all its hospitals   We are facing particular challenges at the Ulster Hospital emergency department and would like to remind people to only attend if they are a genuine emergency The trust warned patients that they may have to wait longer than usual because of the surge in attendances  Our staff have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure patients receive the highest quality of care under difficult circumstances and we would like to pay tribute to them for their hard work the trust said  On Tuesday night Health Minister Jim Wells paid tribute to health workers I am so grateful for the dedication and hard work of all the staff who are under huge pressure in our hospitals The Health and Social Care Board said As part of trusts normal escalation arrangements all trusts have had to cancel some nonurgent elective procedures to provide additional capacity to respond to the emergency pressures  This decision is not taken lightly and it is recognised that it causes inconvenience and frustration for patients  Patients requiring urgent treatment will continue to receive this The number of cancellations will vary across trusts and trusts are reviewing the position daily to minimise the impact on patients
