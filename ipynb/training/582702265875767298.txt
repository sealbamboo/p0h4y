As the number of patients in need of heart transplants has grown surgeons have gotten pickier about the organs theyre willing to use a new study finds In   of available hearts ultimately found their way into new bodies data from the   show By  that figure had dropped to  As of  it had rebounded somewhat to  according to the   published this week in the American Journal of Transplantation In those years the number of patients with endstage heart disease who were waiting for new hearts grew steadily the study authors noted Experts estimate that the demand for donor hearts tops  per year yet only  heart transplants were performed in the US in  Without nationwide standards for judging the suitability of donor hearts transplant surgeons have wide latitude in accepting or rejecting them on behalf of their patients And indeed the study authors found that some doctors were more accepting than others Surgeons in the United Network for Organ Sharings Region   which includes Maine New Hampshire eastern Vermont Massachusetts Rhode Island and Connecticut  were consistently above the nationwide average in accepting donor hearts On the flip side surgeons in Region   which includes western Vermont and New York state  were consistently below average in their donor heart acceptance rate This regional variability is probably a sign that in some parts of the country suitable organs went unused they wrote It also highlights the need for updated consensus guidelines on donor heart acceptance they added There may be some good explanations for why doctors on the whole have rejected so many donor hearts especially in more recent years The average age of potential donors rose from  years in  to  years in  the researchers found In addition the proportion of wouldbe donors with chronic diseases went up during the year study period For instance only  of them had diabetes in  by  that figure was  Similarly the prevalence of high blood pressure rose from  to  Hearts from women were less likely to be accepted by transplant doctors than hearts from men the study authors found Although the proportion of female wouldbe donors remained about the same doctors declined these hearts at increasing rates during the study period Changes in the donor pool werent the only possible factor the researchers noted The doctors who take care of patients on the transplant list have benefited from the invention of good alternatives which may have made surgeons feel less urgency to accept hearts they deemed of marginal quality Chief among them is the invention of the   LVAD and other machines that can take over much of the function of a failing heart The option of stabilizing a patient with mechanical support as a bridge to transplant may make donor hearts with one or more undesirable features less likely to be accepted for transplantation the researchers wrote But this probably isnt the whole story they said because the decline in transplant rates began before these devices entered wide use Another possibility is that increased scrutiny of transplant centers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has scared doctors away from using potentially problematic hearts according to the study authors If so this would be an unintended consequence of federal oversight they wrote If surgeons really are holding out for healthier donor hearts it would be reasonable to expect that the outcomes for transplant patients improved over the study period The researchers found a  increase in both day and oneyear survival but they couldnt say whether better organs deserved the credit Improvements in medical and surgical care between  and  probably played some role as well they wrote
