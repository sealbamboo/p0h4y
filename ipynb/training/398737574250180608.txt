Despite all the problems with HealthCaregov a few dozen Alaskans have managed to enroll in a health plan through the marketplace Lara Imler is one of them Imler a yearold hair stylist in Anchorage ditched her office job as an accountant in  She says she loves making people feel better about themselves and is a lot happier cutting hair than she was sitting in front of a computer But she does miss one big thing about her old job I had health insurance and it was wonderful Even without health insurance Imler spends a lot of time in doctors offices She has   a thyroid disorder The treatments and blood tests she needs are expensive but not as expensive as buying insurance in Alaskas individual market Being selfemployed getting my premium at anything reasonable wasnt happening she says I think my last quote was  a month for myself Imler was determined to find something better on the new Affordable Care Act marketplace She logged onto HealthCaregov a few days after it went live last month She tried four times that day and four more times the first week but kept running into messages that the site was unavailable So she decided to wait a few weeks On Oct  she logged back in and slowly slogged through the process Imlers degree is in computer programming and shes even built a few websites She thinks that experience helped her persevere through the trouble spots on HealthCaregov You get to a point where you finally get to pick what health insurance you want and all the buttons have to be doubleclicked If you dont know that or try that it doesnt go anywhere It just sits there says Imler This website is so not userfriendly You cant figure out what theyre trying to get you to do unless you accidentally get there About two hours after she started she landed on a screen that told her she had successfully enrolled She was pleasantly surprised by the price Imler qualified for subsidies and chose a midlevel plan that will cost her  a month The website sucks Im not going to lie she says But the idea that I might be able to afford health insurance is huge to me It will be a huge burden off my family The plan is a great deal for Imler though it may be a different story for her insurance company The claims from her chronic condition are likely to pile up quickly But insurance companies are braced for people like Imler especially during the first year Jeff Davis president of Premera Alaska says the company is prepared to lose money in  maybe even a lot of money But in the long run he thinks Premera can balance the mix with healthy people The first wave will be people who know they need coverage so thats a little scary Davis says So then the question and the challenge becomes how do we help inform others particularly those who are subsidy eligible that this is available to them and help them figure out how to get to it Imler is still waiting for enrollment confirmation from her new insurance company Shes optimistic that will come soon If it doesnt shell start all over with HealthCaregov
