I know I know  I was incredulous too But a new   published in the  finds that canned peaches yes from the grocery store canned aisle are as loaded with nutrients as fresh peaches And in some cases they pack more of a nutritional punch Take for instance vitamin C Researchers found almost four times more of it in canned than fresh peaches In addition canned had comparable levels of vitamin E and a lot more folate than fresh What explains this The reasons some of these nutrients are higher says   a food scientist at the University of California Davis is that the canning process opens the cell walls of the fruits flesh and it makes nutrients such as vitamin A more readily available to our body She says its the same reason there tends to be higher levels of lycopene in tomato sauce compared with fresh tomatoes Now it may be true that opening a tin can of fruit doesnt come close to the experience of picking up a fresh peach from a farm stand I can still recall childhood memories of peach juice dripping down my arm as I devoured the taste of summer But lets be real The peach season is short And fresh fruit can be expensive not to mention dry or tasteless when its not ripe So if homecanning isnt your   it may be worth giving canned peaches another try As the   points out theyre picked and packed at the peak of freshness Just be sure to buy peaches packed in their own juice not in syrup to avoid added sugar The study was partially funded by the California cling peach industry thats the type of peach used in canned peaches and the industry is not going to be shy about   But be assured says researcher Bob Durst of   the lead author of the research The peach growers had no say in how the test was carried out The experimental design was our own Durst told me by phone Its actually fairly common these days for industries to provide funding for studies carried out independently by university researchers And to guard against something scientists call publication bias  its a wellknown fact that favorable or positive findings are published at higher rates than negative findings  Durst says he made an agreement The agreement was that whatever the results were we would publish what we found Durst says And one more thing Cobbler season is coming up Will baking these peaches into cobbler decrease nutrients such as vitamin C It depends The heat of cooking can inactivate enzymes that degrade nutrient content So in this regard heat is a plus But on the other hand cooking also exposes the fruit to oxygen which can destroy the nutrients Durst says hed have to actually test a cobbler to know for sure Bottom line When it comes to peaches whether theyre fresh frozen or canned all these products contribute to a healthy diet says Bruhn who was not a researcher on the study So eat em up
