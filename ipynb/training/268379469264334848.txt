It was  or maybe early  when it happened A young French gentleman was out for a ride with his workers all of them on horseback when suddenly like a thunderbolt he felt something thick and fleshy slam him from behind It was an overzealous galloping assistant who couldnt stop in time Michel de Montaignes horse crumbled he went flying up then down he crashed to the ground Then things went black When he came to a minute or so later he says His assistants tried to lift him up to carry him back to his chateau but he was throwing up lumps of clotted blood and his hands were tearing at his chest as if to claw his way to air His family was rushing toward him he could see his wife stumbling across an uneven path and yet he was feeling no pain no commotion The fact is that I was not there at all he wrote later Montaigne says   had traveled far away The things he saw his writhing body his screams he called idle thoughts in the clouds set in motion by the sensations of the eyes and ears they did not come from within me He was looking down from a higher tranquil place from which he could painlessly slip away It was he wrote a feeling that people have who let themselves slide into sleep Michel de Montaigne recovered from his accident and lived another  years but says Sarah Bakewell he thought about that experience for the rest of his life He knew he hadnt faced down death He hadnt struggled or resisted or even really acknowledged at the time that he was about to die Instead he had floated up to it or it to him and at the moment when he was almost gone he learned he said that death could have a friendly face Thats what he wrote later that there is something in the grand scheme of things that will make the parting gentle What looks like suffering from the outside may not be the deep experience of the dying one And therefore he advised This idea that the final moment is not a wrench but a glide is not just Montaignes notion In his masterpiece on dying   Leo Tolstoy describes a wellknown Moscovite lawyer at the moment of his passing who feels the pains in his sore riddled body slipping away all dropping away at once from two sides from ten sides and from all sides leaving him suddenly free One hopes this is what happens but who is to say This isnt a question we can test in a scientific way There are people who have systematically analyzed neardeath experiences see below but people who  dont cant report back so all weve got is what we think we know when we witness their dying That isnt hard knowledge but its something One modern case particularly haunts me It comes from Mark Doty the poet who was with his friend Wally when he died of AIDS in  Wally didnt have an easy time of it and nothing Ive said here should suggest that being mortally ill is kind or gentle or anything but a downward spiral of desolation but when we approach the terminal point then says Montaigne says Tolstoy and now says Doty then nature may cut us some slack Doty has described Wallys death in several books This is from   Doty goes on to say that the moment of releasewhat happened to Wally whatever it was  is   Doty is a poet He chooses words carefully The italics are his I shock myself writing that he says I know that many deaths are anything but gentle I know people suffer terribly But over the years he has witnessed several deaths of people and of animals hes loved and he says   You may struggle you may try to hang on but in a good death at the end you let yourself go You are not in charge Heres Montaignes version via Bakewell Like Hamlet says to die to sleep Then its over
