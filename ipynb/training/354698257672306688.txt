Russia is confronting one of its most serious public health threats since the collapse of the Soviet Union The threat is tuberculosis but with a dangerous twist Strains of the bacteria are widely circulating that are resistant to ordinary antiTB drugs and far harder to cure In parts of Siberia nearly  percent of all tuberculosis cases arent treatable by two of the most potent medications the World Health Organization   last year One Siberian city is tackling the problem with an innovative health program called Sputnik affectionately named after the first manmade   launched by the Soviet Union in  The new Sputnik is a mobile clinic teams of nurses orbit like satellites around the sprawling city of   finding and treating patients with drugresistant TB The program is a joint effort between Russias Health Ministry and the American nonprofit   Its the first mobile TB clinic of its kind and it allows health workers to fight the disease among the people who are the hardest to reach  the homeless the mentally ill and drug addicts Its a job thats often uncomfortable and sometimes not completely safe My parents worry about me in this job says Yulia Safronova a nurse affiliated with   not so much because I might catch tuberculosis But I tell them what sort of patients I have to work with Maybe that worries them more Safronovas patients all have one thing in common They cant or wont go to the hospital Have you actually seen a hospital Olesia Tarazanova asks Theyve got drunks dope addicts excons crooks I dont even drink Why should I stay in a hospital with people like that Tarazanova  is a wisp of a woman with bleachedblond hair holding her nearly yearold son by the hand She meets the health team in their car on the street near her apartment gets into the back seat and takes a handful of pills that Safronova doles out from a black gym bag on her lap Tarazanova has been in treatment for TB for almost two years she says If all goes as planned shell complete it in a couple of months Safronova rides with driver Sergei Goryunov who left a safer job seven years ago to work for the Sputnik program Goryunov is a big man and capable of acting as a bodyguard for the nurses when he needs to I like talking with the patients he says grinning I like to play tricks on them joke with them Its interesting for me hanging out with alcoholics and drug addicts Members of the Sputnik crew spend a lot of their time bumping along rutted roads on the edges of this industrial town with its oil companies and petrochemical plant Drugresistant tuberculosis is a growing problem in Tomsk People with the infection often have to take as many as  pills daily  including some to relieve the side effects of TB medications which include psychosis severe nausea and hearing loss Some patients get fed up with their treatment before it is complete They resist they hide they lock their doors to avoid the Sputnik team But if the treatment is interrupted it can give the tuberculosis bacteria a chance to recover and develop more resistance Safronova and Goryunov often have to cajole people into taking the medication The next patient Sergei Gaptenko lives with his father in a weathered rundown house Hes a sometime electrician in his mids and an alcoholic He wants to know when scientists will invent something that will cure his multipledrugresistant TB in one go The nurse Safronova sets out a plateful of pills  just half of Gaptenkos daily dose Another nurse will come by in the afternoon with the rest Gaptenko says he has to stay home to take care of his father also an alcoholic Thats the main reason hes not in a TB hospital although he too insists that most patients in the state hospitals are criminals Both men are on pensions Safronova says When they get their money they drink it up and then Gaptenko becomes a difficult patient hard to find and uncooperative But because of Sputnik both Gaptenko and his father are getting treatment Sputnik is only one of many ways that the city is fighting drugresistant TB but its a crucial one says Alexander Barnashov a head physician at the Tomsk Health Department If this program didnt exist there would be a lot more people in Tomsk in Russia and even in America who could be walking around and infecting others with one of the most dangerous forms of tuberculosis The success of Sputnik has prompted other Russian cities to start programs of their own Barnashov says Delegations visit from other parts of the country and abroad to learn how it works But Sputnik could be in danger he says The Russian government recently imposed a law that requires nonprofits that receive funding from outside Russia to register as foreign agents That label is practically equivalent to the word spy in Russia Thousands of charities and other groups around the country have been raided by investigators demanding to see their records So far Partners in Health hasnt been affected And the Sputnik team continues rounds its throughout the city Safronova admits she might even like her job although it doesnt pay well You know what to expect from the patients what sort of people they are and you see them differently not the way an outsider would she explains And thats what Sputnik seems to be  an irregular orbit for patients who can be treated only by someone who takes the time to really see them
