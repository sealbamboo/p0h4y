 Eli Lilly & Co. said its fourth-quarter profit declined 12% as the drug maker entered a new round of patent expirations that will erode sales of top drugs throughout 2014.. The Indianapolis company lost U.S. patent protection for its No. 1 product, the antidepressant Cymbalta, in December, which triggered the introduction of competing low-cost generic copies. Lilly is due to lose patent protection for bone-building drug Evista in March, which will further contribute to sales and profit declines for 2014.
