Parents need to keep electronic cigarette refills away from young children because of the risk of poisoning doctors in Birmingham say They issued the warning in the medical journal Archives of Disease in Childhood after a twoyearold girl accidentally licked some of the liquid  The infant recovered but high doses of nicotine can be lethal Doctors said parents should treat nicotine refills like white spirit medicines and bleach   There has been a surge in popularity of ecigarettes with more than two million people in the UK thought to use them  However there has been a similar boom in nicotine poisonings The National Poisons Information Service part of Public Health England said it had had  enquiries about nicotine last year compared with  in  and only  in the previous five years combined   On some ecigarettes inhalation activates the batterypowered   Other types are manually switched on  A   inside the atomiser heats liquid nicotine contained in a cartridge  Liquid nicotine becomes   and is inhaled The smoke produced is largely water vapour Many ecigarettes have an LED light as a cosmetic feature to simulate traditional cigarette glow  In the case at Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham a twoyearold put the refill in her mouth and is thought to have licked a few drops of liquid before the mother could whip the bottle out  The infant vomited and was taken to hospital as a precaution where she recovered  Signs of poisoning include Dr Sanjay Gupta from the department of paediatrics at Good Hope Hospital told the BBC Everywhere you go theres ecigs and vapour bars more and more children are coming into contact with small bottles full of concentrated liquid nicotine  Parents ideally should stop smoking but as a minimum they should store bottles very careful like we store medicines or white spirit we should store them away from children this is not simply a harmless liquid About mg of nicotine is thought to be a lethal dose in adults Much smaller doses would be lethal in children  Dr John Thompson director of the Public Health England commissioned National Poisons Information Service Unit in Cardiff said While any cases of poisoning are of concern our previous research showed that fortunately fewer than one in  of patients developed symptoms of toxicity which lasted more than four hours and only two patients had long lasting symptoms  Ecigarette usage has increased significantly in recent years  The liquid found in ecigarettes can be very harmful and I would urge anyone who uses ecigarettes to make sure that the liquids are stored safely and in particular away from children In a statement the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association said current regulations were very robust but called for parents to be more aware We encourage consumers to inform themselves about the products they are purchasing to always read the labels and only use as directed  It is worth remembering that some ecig parts can be a potential choking hazard for small children Philip Le Shirley product safety adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said Nicotine is a toxic substance and poisonous to children This is why it is important to treat electric cigarettes and their components in the same way as you would household chemicals by storing them out of the sight and reach of children  If you believe that your child has ingested nicotine seek medical advice immediately
