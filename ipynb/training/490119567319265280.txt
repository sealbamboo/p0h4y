And so, another working week will soon draw to a close. Not a moment too soon, yes? This is, as you know, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans and we are still considering the possibilities. With any luck, the weather will be favorable so we can promenade with the official mascots and manicure the Pharmalot grounds. And of course, we hope to spend time with Mrs. Pharmalot and indulge the short people. But what about you? Vacation time is at hand, so perhaps this is an opportunity to plan a getaway. You could go to the beach or a park and curl up with a good e-book. Or simply catch up with someone special. Whatever you do, have a grand time, and be safe. Enjoy and see you soon….
