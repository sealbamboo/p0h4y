As a parent you probably have a picture in your head of the kid youd vote Most Likely To Bully Others Hes burly wears a letter or leather jacket and has been a senior longer than most students are in high school  But experts say the bullies tormenting students nowadays arent like the ones we see on the big screen Its not just a small group of jocks or the loner stoner pushing kids into lockers between periods It can be almost anyone at any time And the most likely targets of bullies The bullies themselves Sociologist Robert Faris calls it social combat He says the majority of bullying takes place in the middle of a schools social hierarchy where students are jostling with each other for higher status  Think of it like a giant game of   Each kid is struggling to make it to the top not afraid to step on others to get there The closer you get to being king the more vicious the competition gets between rivals  Bullying works Faris says simply When kids pick on other kids their status increases  Faris   in  to study bullying at a high school in Long Island New York Researchers asked more than  students about their friendship circles and bullying behaviors Faris has also completed similar studies in rural North Carolina  where the demographics were different but the results were the same  Faris found  of students surveyed were involved in aggression victimization or both at any given time The main motive behind a students bullying was to increase his or her popularity The higher a student rose on the social ladder the more likely they were to bully others  and to be bullied themselves  Theres always some tension in these friendship groups Faris says Whos closer to whom and whos hanging out together and I think thats whats driving a lot of these kids The same is true for middleschool students according to UCLA psychology professor Jaana Juvonen whos been studying bullying since the mids Juvonen and her team   more than  students through seventh and eighth grade to determine how physical aggression and the spreading of rumors played a part in social prominence   What weve learned about bullying during the last decade or so is that it takes many forms Juvonen says Some of these forms are extremely hard to detect Theyre covert  Administrators have cracked down on physical aggression in schools enforcing zero tolerance policies for fighting between students But Juvonen says that has led to subtler forms of bullying  Rumors  most often about a students sexuality or insulting family members  play a big role according to Juvonens research  Faris recalls he got his ass kicked regularly as a child Two brothers used hunt him down every day after school as he walked home from the bus stop  But he says a daily beating was much less painful than the isolation he felt when his family moved across the country and he couldnt seem to fit in That was much harder to deal with than a bloody nose he remembers In his later research Faris found friends often exclude each other from gossip sessions or parties to put down a rival and boost their own status Social media has also increased the prominence of this abstract form of bullying  The status competition is always there theres no break from it he says They go home and they get online and they see their friends doing things together and theyre not invited or worse people are harassing them  If the  movie   taught us anything its that girls are the queens of covert bullying no one could make you feel as badly about the way you look as the popular clique Juvonens study however found boys and girls spread rumors to boost their social status  and that both genders use physical aggression to assert power  Eva knows this firsthand She and her friends used to jump other girls pulling their hair or punching them just because they talked to the wrong guy    I look back and shake my head says Eva who asked CNN not to use her last name because she plans to apply for graduate school But when youre in elementary school and junior high theres nothing else We dont have responsibilities We dont have skills We buy candy and do homework  Part of the problem here is that kids are kind of stuck in a cage Faris agrees They dont have formal roles and responsibilities  They have to work status out for themselves  And if we put adults in a similar situation he says wed see the same behavior For that reason Faris advocates programs and activities that deemphasize social status and reemphasize the qualities of a good friend He hopes that one day students will leave high school with a small group of close friends rather than the  or  they know on Facebook  Juvonen says antibullying programs should focus on bystanders  teaching kids that watching is just as bad as doing the bullying yourself Studies in Canada have shown she says that if a child intervenes the bullying incident stops within seconds  Juvonen suggests parents use teachable moments on TV or in the news to show children right from wrong in a bullying situation They could be the ones pointing out to their kids that they have a lot of power as bystanders she says  Juvonen knows its unreasonable to expect a child to be brave on his or her own no one wants to become the next victim So she suggests teaching kids about the weight of a group  Bullying involves this imbalance of power where the bully has the high status and is using this status she says You can try to offset the power balance by telling kids to join one another as they try to intervene  Parents also need to be aware of how easy it is for children to get sucked in to this social combat Juvonen says They cant be in denial about incidents that are brought to their attention  Anyone in that situation should be asking Whats going on What is it about these situations that brings about this kind of behavior Parents should be having frequent conversations about whats happening at school know who their children are hanging out with and keep an eye out for warning signs that somethings not quite right she says The parents role is really to be there as a buffer be the one who listens Before she was a bully Eva was a victim she says Older kids would call her names or hold her down to show they were stronger Shes the baby in the family she says and her parents didnt have time to pay attention to what was going on  Bullying comes from home from family members she says We hear our cousins and uncles talking crap about someone We think its funny We think its cool  Eva never faced consequences for bullying other than her suspensions She believes that if someone had sat her down and told her that bullying was wrong she would have listened For years she worried that one of her former victims would invite her on the Maury Show for a facetoface showdown She still feels badly about the pain she inflicted  I cant take it back she says But if I could do it all over again I wouldnt do what I did
