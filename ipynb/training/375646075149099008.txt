
 Medical students disease refers to the phenomenon in which medical students notice something innocuous about their health and then attach to it exaggerated significance It often corresponds to a disease they have recently learned about in lectures or encountered on the wards We are at the start of a new academic year and close to  students are beginning medical school in the United States How did medical students disease get discovered And does it really exist It was around when I was in medical school in the s And in my own class we experienced a surprising twist Medical students disease  which has also been called nosophobia meaning fear of disease  first gained attention in the mids after the publication of two articles from prominent psychiatric departments Researchers at McGill University reviewed records from the student health service and reported that   complained of symptoms of various illnesses they had studied Typical was a student who decided he had schizophrenia during his psychiatry rotation but later changed his diagnosis to Menieres disease an inner ear disorder He had neither condition Meanwhile investigators at the University of Southern California School of Medicine interviewed  senior medical students finding that almost   of diseases ranging from cancer to tuberculosis The authors wrote that medical students disease was often met with jocularity and humor but that it could also be a signal of general emotional distress and conflict As we marched through our syllabus several of my classmates believed they had developed various diseases Most common were apparent brain tumors when we learned neurology and angina during our lectures on the heart Having been told that medical students were prone to hypochondriasis we generally responded with eyerolling But then something surprising happened Two of us turned out to be seriously ill One of my classmates Cam had actually started feeling unwell the summer before medical school noting that he could no longer lift as much weight as before In addition his vision was not quite right He saw a neuroopthalmologist a specialist in neurological diseases of the eye before leaving for school This doctor tentatively diagnosed myasthenia gravis a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness throughout the body especially the eyes and eyelids But when Cam visited a neurologist during the first month of medical school the doctor likely having seen many imaginary illnesses among students was according to Cam a little dismissive Cam thought his symptoms were real but also wondered if it might all be in his head Fortunately however the neurologist sent him to see another neuroophthalmologist who confirmed the original diagnosis To this day Cam experiences periodic low level eye weakness but it does not interfere with his ability to work as an infectious diseases specialist I was present the day during our second year when another of my classmates Mike first learned he might be ill We were in hematology laboratory and learning how to check our red blood cell counts also known as the hematocrit We almost all had normal levels ranging between  and  But Mikes reading was only  Assuming that Mike had done the test incorrectly our professor told him to repeat it and watched his technique which was fine It was  again Mike was severely anemic He remembers the teacher pulling him to the side and quietly advising him to go to student health In retrospect Mike an inveterate basketball player realized he had been getting short of breath  a sign of anemia Further tests revealed that Mike had irondeficiency anemia meaning he was losing blood most likely from his intestines Yet numerous tests did not reveal the source of the bleeding Mike began to wonder about other possible causes of his condition One classmate told him that the anemia was a result of Mikes propensity for junk food Seemingly sick but without a diagnosis Mike finished the semester But only barely He had developed a large mass in his abdomen When his doctors performed a colonoscopy the diagnosis became obvious Mike had a colon cancer that had caused his intestine to ball up The news was jarring to say the least  about as far from an imaginary diagnosis as any medical student could have Surgeons removed part of Mikes large intestine Fortunately the lymph nodes were negative and Mike survived Today he is a general internist Cam and Mike were truly sick but what about other medical students who only think they are Is medical students disease really such a problem borne from overly anxious and stressed future doctors A few more recent controlled studies  with better methodology than the older research  suggest that the answer is no For example medical students at Oxford University   comprised of nonmedical students and nonstudents A study of four medical schools concurred and even found that first and fourthyear medical students had   than other graduate students It appears then that while some medical students do falsely experience symptoms of diseases they have encountered they are no more hypochondriacal than other students So it is probably wrong to speak of a distinct entity known as medical students disease even if the concept amuses more senior physicians And when students like Cam and Mike really do not feel well we should take their complaints seriously
