Pressures in Englands AE units have hit record levels with the lowest percentage of patients seen within four hours since monitoring began in  Data showed just under  of patients were seen within four hours in the seven days up to December  Major units particularly struggled with just six out of  meeting the target to see  within four hours Performance in Wales and Northern Ireland is even worse while the picture in Scotland is unclear As England is the only part of the UK that produces weekly data how the NHS is performing there gives the best indication of the pressure the system is under Just over  patients visited AE in the week ending  December with  seen within four hours  As well as posting the worst performance against the fourhour target other measures also show the service is under strain There were over  emergency admissions to hospital   from AE units  which is an alltime high Trolley waits  that is waits of four hours or more for a bed once a decision to admit a patient into hospital from AE is made  topped  for the first time  That compares to under  for the same week last year Delays getting patients out of hospital once they are ready for discharge are also much higher than average Dr Barbara Hakin from NHS England said the pressures were continuing to increase significantly We have admitted more people to hospital this week to take care of them than in any previous week on record I want to pay tribute to the staff dealing with that  they are doing a brilliant job  While we are now below the extremely high waiting time standards that we set ourselves the service we provide remains robust  The NHSs waiting times for urgent treatment are among the best for any major country that measures them  As we come into the holiday period it is important people continue to look after themselves and nip problems in the bud  They should ensure they have proper medication get their flu jab if they have not done so and get advice from their pharmacist Megan Hill from London told the BBC about the contrasting experiences of both her grandmothers who fell and broke their hips within days of each other Two London paramedics were forced to sit with my grandmother on a trolley for over eight hours waiting for an available bed The first time she was offered food was  on Wednesday morning  she fell on Tuesday morning  In a horrible coincidence my other yearold grandmother also fell and broke her hip just  hours earlier  She was picked up immediately by North Wales paramedics seen and admitted the moment she arrived Suffice to say she was also offered food The level of patient care should not be postcode dependent Performance in England has hit an alltime low since weekly monitoring began in  But this looks like it will just be the start of what promises to be the most difficult winter for the NHS for a generation The fourhour target was introduced in  to combat the long waits patients faced for treatment Since then hospitals have performed remarkably well  During winter months it has tended to dip below the target level but not for long  That is in stark contrast to Wales and Northern Ireland which routinely miss their target This however is completely different The target has been met only once since August and now performance has dipped below  The scale of the drop is causing concern not only to the health service but to the government too with an election just around the corner As health is devolved data is published differently across the UK While England publishes weekly data the others release it monthly or quarterly In Wales the data from November shows just  of patients were seen in time Northern Ireland is performing even worse  just over  of patients were seen within four hours in November Scotland has a slightly tougher waiting time target   of patients should be seen in four hours  but in September  were Comparing the September figures for England and Scotland shows England was performing slightly better in that month It means according to latest data all parts of the UK are missing the AE waiting time target Each nation has set aside extra money for winter pressures  In England a record m has been set aside while earlier this week the Scottish government announced it was increasing its funding by m bringing the total pot to over m Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said We know the winter months may be challenging for our health boards British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said These figures confirm just how much pressure the NHS is under Staff are working flat out but the system is really struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door Or contact us here
