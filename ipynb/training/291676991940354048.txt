Skin cancer Theres an app for that But the same smartphone that brings you   might not be the best tool for diagnosing deadly melanoma Smartphone apps that evaluate moles for skin cancer risk missed threatening moles onethird of the time according to a study by dermatologists at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Those apps let users photograph a funky mole or other skin lesion Then the apps use mathematical formulas to look for asymmetry irregular border varied color or a diameter larger than a pencil eraser Those are the same things a dermatologist scans for during a checkup and the things were all supposed to be checking ourselves But for those of us who arent skin docs knowing when that asymmetry is no big deal or which color change demands a panicked call for an appointment can be a challenge even with the help of scary photos showing us   Surely an app could help with the anxiety right It seems so appealing says   a dermatologist and coauthor of the study which was published online in   Unfortunately our data suggest that maybe these apps arent quite there Ferris and her colleagues used photos of  moles  of which were confirmed as melanoma to test four findtheskincancer apps three that do instant inphone diagnosis and one that ships the mole mug shots to a real live dermatologist for review The dermatologists correctly identified the suspicious moles  percent of the time But the apps that relied on algorithms were much less reliable missing the melanoma  percent of the time One app would pick up a certain melanoma and it would be missed by another Ferris tells Shots And it wasnt like they were going out of their way to stump the app These are melanomas that I could show to an untrained person and theyd go That looks bad  Ferris and crew didnt name the apps they tested But a quick run through the iTunes store finds three that use algorithms to analyze moles for skin cancer risk All carry disclaimers that say that they arent offering a diagnosis or replacing medical advice The company behind   had its two staff dermatologists review about  images taken with the mobile app and also tested it on about  patients according to CEO Roel van Summeren That app analysis was accurate  percent of the time he says The firm is now working on a study with an academic medical center to compare the app with dermatologists analysis and pathology reports We dont want to replace the dermatologist we want to complement the dermatologist van Summeren tells Shots But these sorts of screening tools could give people a false sense of security Ferris says Melanoma is a very timesensitive diagnosis she says Melanoma caught early is curable she says But a lesion can grow deeper and spread to other organs within a matter of months We dont have good treatment for latestage melanoma she adds Apps she says are not good enough to trust your life with The Food and Drug Administration is grappling with how to regulate medical apps The agency said back in  that it might start regulating those that   but so far theres no definitive action on that front For now app users are pretty much on their own in figuring out whether a   is worth the download Ferris suggests sticking with skin cancer apps that just make the selfcheck process a little easier Some will send reminders that its time to take a look Others help organize and store photos of moles so that the moles owner can watch for changes then go to a dermatologist Just one example is   a free app from the University of Michigan The app helps track moles over time sends selfexam reminders and also provides a template for photos that should make it a little bit easier to play paparazzi with those random spots
