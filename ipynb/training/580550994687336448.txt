Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of stroke a large global study in the British Medical Journal suggests  Scientists say even shortterm spikes in pollution were mirrored by a rise in strokes  particularly in low and middleincome countries  The work builds on earlier studies linking pollution to cardiovascular risk UK experts say although pollution is lower in the developed world it may still pose a significant risk Parts of the   pollution limits set by the European Union in  And the UK government says some major cities may well continue to do so until at least   The European Environment Agency warns that air pollution can   and contribute to premature deaths  The latest study looked specifically at the risk of stroke Scientists from Edinburgh University scoured the results of  studies covering  countries across the world  They say the trends were consistent   a shortterm rise in pollution was associated with a rise in the number of people admitted to hospital for strokes and in stroke deaths    The link was the strongest in low and middleincome countries and on the day people were exposed to high pollution  The review looked at a range of possible pollutants  from gases such as sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide to fine soot particles known as PM   Dr Anoop Shah lead author of the study said This study now demonstrates that even shortterm exposure to air pollution can trigger disabling strokes or death from stroke One of the key differences between risk of stroke due to air pollution and other risk factors such as smoking or high blood pressure is that the whole general population is exposed  As such this increased risk of stroke is in the general population and not just those previously thought to be at high risk But Dr Shamim Quadir at the Stroke Association said more work was needed to establish how strong this link is and whether or not air pollution could be considered as a risk factor for stroke  The British Heart Foundation which funded the study says there is an urgent need for the UK government to meet pollution targets  It says failure to do so could be putting hundreds of thousands of people at risk  though further research is needed to confirm this estimate  The   people with heart conditions or lung disease should monitor air pollution where they live and work
