Its far from ready for use on humans but the new research offers new possibilities for Alzheimers therapy that involve neither drugs nor surgery The studys authors said the same technique might help in treating other diseases that involve the abnormal buildup of proteins in the brain In mice bred to develop Alzheimers disease stimulating the forebrain with scanning ultrasound over sixtoseven weeks appeared to activate specialized immune cells in the brain  called microglia  to sweep up and dispose of excess amyloid the new research found Compared with mice that did not get the ultrasound treatments those that did performed far better on a series of tests to assess spatial memory longterm memory and shortterm memory In a maze designed to test a mouses ability to navigate treated mice whose cognitive function had become degraded by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in their brains reverted to normal levels of navigational skill The   was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine Drug candidates aimed at altering Alzheimers inexorable course have been disappointing The study is the first to suggest that a safe noninvasive and wellunderstood diagnostic technology might jumpstart the brains laggard trashremoval system and halt or reverse the diseases course The potential for noninvasive treatment of Alzheimers disease is exciting said Dr Michael Wolfe an Alzheimers researcher at Brigham  Womens  Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the current study Wolfe echoed the studys authors however in cautioning against premature hope To test whether sonic waves could prove useful in treatment investigators repeatedly swept the energy of a scanning ultrasound beam across the entire forebrain of a mouse bred to develop the hallmark amyloid plaques of Alzheimers disease After six to seven weeks of such noninvasive treatments the cortical area taken up by the amyloid plaques was reduced  in those mice that got the treatment and the average density of amyloid plaques in their brains was roughly halved Aside from the question of whether a treatment that works in mice would be as effective in humans Wolfe said that the timing of such treatment in humans would be tricky The brains of the mice studied had significant proliferation of amyloid plaques already a condition that in many humans well precedes the appearance of dementia symptoms That means that if scanning ultrasound were to help humans it would need to be initiated long before a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease is being made now That ultrasound would also need to come before the disease had killed a significant number of brain cells as well The bottom line is that there is a long way to go before this noninvasive technique could be translated into a practical treatment for Alzheimers said Wolfe The authors of the study also found that scanning ultrasound  which is widely used to peer into soft tissue  might one day help to usher plaquebusting drugs into the brain In mice the sonic beam had the effect of temporarily opening the fine sieve that keeps most toxins circulating in the blood from entering the brain That socalled bloodbrain barrier is crucial in protecting the brain from everyday threats but it also makes the task of delivering drugs to the brain difficult Researchers demonstrated that sonic waves prompted the glial cells in the mouse brains to clear the accumulation of amyloid But they acknowledged it was equally possible that the bloodbrain barriers transient opening induced by the sound waves somehow acted to reduce deposition of new amyloid plaques Wolfe noted that a technique that opens the bloodbrain barrier  and that probably would need to be applied repeatedly  comes with dangers of its own Though the studys authors call the use of sonic waves noninvasive Wolfe said it is still disruptive because the brains natural barrier of defense is repeatedly disabled James Hendrix director of the Alzheimers Assns Global Sciences Initiative warned Alzheimers disease patients and their caregivers that they should not at this time ask their doctors about scanning ultrasound as a treatment We are still far away from knowing if this has potential as a therapy for people with the disease said Hendrix The effectiveness safety and cost of using this treatment on people with Alzheimers are important questions in moving this research forward Hendrix said This new data will help scientists determine the likelihood and viability of moving forward with additional testing
