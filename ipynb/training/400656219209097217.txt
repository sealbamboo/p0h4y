Changes to specific cells in the retina could help diagnose and track the progression of Alzheimers disease scientists say A team found genetically engineered mice with Alzheimers lost thickness in this layer of eye cells  As the retina is a direct extension of the brain they say the loss of retinal neurons could be related to the loss of brain cells in Alzheimers The findings were revealed at the US Society for Neuroscience conference  The team believes this work could one day lead to opticians being able to detect Alzheimers in a regular eye check if they had the right tools  Alterations in the same retinal cells could also help detect glaucoma  which causes blindness  and is now also viewed as a neurodegenerative disease similar to Alzheimers the researchers report  Scott Turner director of the memory disorders programme at Georgetown University Medical Center said The retina is an extension of the brain so it makes sense to see if the same pathologic processes found in an Alzheimers brain are also found in the eye Dr Turner and colleagues looked at the thickness of the retina in an area that had not previously been investigated This included the inner nuclear layer and the retinal ganglion cell layer  They found that a loss of thickness occurred only in mice with Alzheimers The retinal ganglion cell layer had almost halved in size and the inner nuclear layer had decreased by more than a third This suggests a new path forward in understanding the disease process in humans and could lead to new ways to diagnose or predict Alzheimers that could be as simple as looking into the eyes said Dr Turner Treatments developed for Alzheimers could therefore also be useful for treating glaucoma he added  But he also said that so far it was still speculation to say that retinal thinning may predict impending Alzheimers disease Were hoping that this translates to human patients and we suspect that retinal thinning just like cortical thinning happens long before anyone gets dementia Dr Scott told BBC News  Human studies are needed to test this idea as a diagnostic test Current leading biomarkers of Alzheimers disease are either very costly or invasive A retinal thickness scan  as measured by optical coherence tomography  would be both inexpensive and noninvasive Alzheimers is a neurodegenerative disease and is the most common type of dementia The cause is still unknown and there is currently no cure It often goes undetected for years until so many cells die that symptoms become increasingly prevalent  But treating the disease early is believed to be vital to prevent memory loss  Laura Phipps at Alzheimers Research UK said there was increasing evidence linking retinal cell loss to Alzheimers disease and that it was positive to see this line of research being followed up  This earlystage study which is yet to be published in full was carried out in mice and further research will be necessary to determine whether changes in the retina found here are also found in people with Alzheimers  Diagnosing Alzheimers with accuracy can be a difficult task which is why its vital to continue investing in research to improve diagnosis methods Dr Phipps added
