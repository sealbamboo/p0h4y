There was a clear difference of opinion between male and female justices at the US Supreme Court on Tuesday The issue was whether forprofit corporations citing religious objections may refuse to include contraception coverage in the basic health plan now mandated under the Affordable Care Act The female justices were clearly supportive of the contraception mandate while a majority of the male justices were more skeptical The lead challenger in the case is the Hobby Lobby corporation a chain of  arts and crafts stores that has  employees The owners object to two forms of contraception IUDs and morningafter pills which they view as a form of early abortion Hobby Lobby lawyer Paul Clement had barely begun his argument when he was pelted with a series of hypotheticals Justice Sonia Sotomayor led off What about employers who have religious objections to health plans that cover other basic medical procedures  blood transfusions immunizations medical products that include pork Clement replied that each would have to be evaluated by the courts to see if it is fully justified and accomplished by the least restrictive means Justice Elena Kagan observed that using that reasoning an employer might have a religious objection to complying with sex discrimination laws minimum wage laws family leave laws and child labor laws to name just a few Clement responded that just because claims are being brought doesnt mean that they will all win The courts he said can separate the sheep from the goats Have any of these claims ever been brought and have they succeeded asked Justice Samuel Alito Answer Very few With respect interjected Kagan I think that thats probably because until now this court has had a different understanding of how to interpret the constitutional and statutory law How asked Sotomayor does a forprofit corporation exercise religion Whose religion is it The shareholders The corporate officers How much of the business has to be dedicated to religion And once you go down that road arent you having to do something that the court has always resisted  measuring the depth of someones religious beliefs Kagan noted that the Obama health law doesnt require corporate employers to provide insurance The Hobby Lobby owners could have paid a fine which she observed is much less than the cost of insurance Its a choice she said I thought part of the religious commitment of the employers was to provide health insurance opined Chief Justice John Roberts Exactly replied lawyer Clement Justice Anthony Kennedy asked questions from a variety of perspectives The government sees this case as the employer putting its employees in a disadvantaged position he said Do the employers religious beliefs just trump those of the employees Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that in this case the employer is opposed to IUDs and morningafter pills But she said suppose an employer objected to all contraceptives as some employers have Clement conceded the point agreeing that all contraceptives could be excluded on religious grounds When the governments chief advocate Solicitor General Donald Verrilli stepped to the lectern he faced a different formulation from Kennedy Under your view a forprofit corporation could be forced in principle  to pay for abortions Verrilli responded that there is no law that would require forprofit corporations to provide abortions Isnt that what we are talking about interjected Roberts They have to pay for methods of contraception that they believe provide abortions We dont question their sincere belief replied Verrilli but IUDs and morningafter pills are legal contraception methods approved by the FDA Moreover he said federal laws that ban funding for abortions do not consider these methods to be abortion Kennedy raised another issue contending that the government had exempted a whole class of corporations from the provisions of this law The only exemptions are for churches explained Verrilli and special accommodations are made for religious nonprofits The special accommodation is that the insurance company pays for the contraception coverage to employees not the religious nonprofit itself Justice Stephen Breyer asked whether as lawyers for Hobby Lobby have suggested there is a method of providing contraception coverage for Hobby Lobby employees that is less restrictive of the owners rights Namely have the government pay for the coverage This isnt very expensive stuff chimed in Justice Antonin Scalia Verrilli replied that IUDs are the most expensive  between  and   and the most effective method of contraception Further he said even if the government agreed to pay when corporations invoked religious objections corporations would say that signing the forms attesting to their objections would make them complicit Indeed some nonprofits have made just that objection Alito focused on a different question Why forprofit corporations should be barred from making claims that their religious rights are being infringed You say they cant ever get their day in court Verrilli replied that the court has not ever recognized such a right He pointed repeatedly to the courts decision declaring that an Amish carpenter had to pay Social Security taxes for his employees even though paying such taxes violated his religious beliefs Alito however wasnt buying the argument Suppose Congress passed a law barring kosher slaughter methods because it considered them inhumane Would an incorporated slaughterhouse have no recourse whatsoever Verrilli replied that such a law could be challenged as targeted at a particular religion Roberts perhaps looking for a narrow way to rule in the case suggested that even if the court rules in favor of Hobby Lobby that would only affect closely held corporations not large publicly traded companies Within hours of the argument critics noted that some giant corporations like Dell and Heinz are closely held corporations
