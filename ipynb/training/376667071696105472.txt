We spend about onethird of our lives sleeping but much of that function remains a mystery   is asking some pretty fundamental yet complicated questions about why we do it and why we cant seem to get more of it Dr Matthew Walker says the question of why we sleep remains that archetypal mystery Walker the principal investigator at the sleep lab the University of California Berkeley works with patients who suffer from sleep abnormalities He says the complexity of sleep makes the research that much more fascinating There have been so many great discoveries within science based on the revolution of sort of genetics and molecular biology and sleep remains resistant to all of that in terms of an answer he tells   host Rachel Martin Walker says there have been several critical discoveries however illuminating how sleep helps us learn and retain information Researchers are also taking note of the negative side effects of not getting enough sleep Research on learning suggests sleep is critical at almost all stages of memory formation memory processing and longterm memory retention he says Science also backs up historical anecdotes about how sleep fosters creativity There seems to be some type of memory processing thats creative that starts to take pieces of information that weve learned recently and starts trying to test the connections between that recent information and all of the information youve got stored in your brain he says So its almost like memory pinball  youre bouncing that information around youre testing which connections to build So what happens if you dont sleep A whole constellation of different brain and body functions start to deteriorate he says Our brains are less effective at absorbing new information without sleep Plus our ability to retain recently learned information is impaired and you lose the chance to essentially hit the save button on that information Aside from memorization sleep deprivation makes it harder for the brain to regulate emotions From an evolutionary perspective sleep doesnt seem like a good idea survival instincts are on hold But Walker says the fact that sleep has stuck around so long shows its biological importance Sleep serves so many wonderful beneficial functions that far outweigh those potential downsides to it he says
