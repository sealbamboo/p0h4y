A South Asian strain of cholera that was introduced into Haiti three years ago this month has now spread to this continents mainland  is the fourth Western Hemisphere country to experience the cholera outbreak Its a disease thats very hard to stamp out once it gets into an area with poor water and sanitation Mexican health officials first picked up on the problem Sept  through routine surveillance of hospital cases of severe diarrhea Since then there have been  reported cases in Mexico City and states to the north and east One victim has died  deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization says it was all but inevitable that cholera would spread beyond the Caribbean It was always a major concern that it would be exported to other countries as has recently happened in Mexico he tells Shots Since it was introduced into Haiti  very likely by United Nations peacekeeping troops from Nepal who were billeted at a camp with poor sanitary facilities  cholera has   in Haiti and the Dominican Republic which share the island of Hispaniola and Cuba Nearly  have died Andrus fully expects it will spread further We are advocating throughout the region for countries to be on their guard he says Cholera is thought to have invaded Cuba via infected health personnel who work in Haiti and travel back and forth Cuba has reported nearly  cholera cases and three deaths although many are skeptical that that nation is fully reporting the extent of its outbreak Andrus says vacationers visiting Cuba  who probably got cholera from contaminated food  have exported the disease to Chile Venezuela Italy Germany and Holland So far those cases havent touched off outbreaks But as the Mexican epidemic shows it can easily happen if an imported case contaminates water or food in an area with poor sanitation You have those situations throughout Latin America he notes We are the region of the greatest disparities The last time the Americas saw a major cholera epidemic was  years ago It was allegedly brought by a ship that discharged its bilge water in a   The disease spread all the way up the continent sickening more than  million people and killing  or so until it hit the USMexican border There it was stopped by modern water and sewagetreatment facilities in the United States Andrus says PAHO is worried this latest epidemic will have a similar impact Its really for us a defining moment he says To what extent are we concerned about spread Well its really a regional threat and now a global threat to health It took Mexico more than  years to bring its last cholera epidemic under control This time sanitary conditions are better so it might not take that long But Andrus says it wont be easy to stamp out It wont be  years but it wont be days or weeks he says Dr Maureen Birmingham PAHOs representative in Mexico writes in an email to NPR that authorities there are monitoring the population for spread of cholera and focusing on prompt treatment of affected people along with providing clean water and sanitary facilities to vulnerable communities Birmingham says Mexico is not currently considering use of an oral cholera vaccine that was   last year by the World Health Organization for use in outbreaks The WHO has reportedly stockpiled about  million doses of the vaccine which costs  a dose and requires two doses In any case the cholera vaccine is a stopgap measure All public health authorities agree the only real solution is clean water and adequate sewage treatment And many of them hope the current outbreak will stimulate major efforts to bring clean water and sanitation to the hemispheres poorest communities Choleras one of those infections that catches attention in a way that few infections do  plague Ebola pandemic influenza cholera says   of the Massachusetts General Hospital Its one of those ones that everybody sort of sits up straight for It is one of the ones that tests the system But   of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti points out that the United Nations has found only  percent of the  billion it says it needs to rid Haiti and the Dominican Republic of cholera over the next  years Right now  percent of the funding is probably not enough even to get started Concannon tells Shots And so the UN needs to feel some serious pressure to do a more serious job of raising the money Concannons group is trying to do just that Earlier this month it   against the UN in US District Court for its alleged role in introducing cholera to Haiti Filed on behalf of cholera victims the action seeks among other things to force the UN to raise the money to stamp out cholera on Hispaniola
