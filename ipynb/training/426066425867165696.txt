The more we learn about sitting the more perilous it seems to be Flabby muscles fuzzy thinking and all manner of cardiovascular disease can get started or get worse when were hanging out on the couch stuck in traffic or just parked in a chair for too long Now theres evidence that    when your heart becomes too weak to pump enough blood through your arteries  can be brought on by a sedentary lifestyle and also more generally a lack of physical activity Researchers at   enrolled more than  men aged  and older about a decade ago in a study to see how the time they spent sitting and engaging in physical activity affected the odds they would develop heart failure Most were overweight like the rest of American men Nobody with existing heart failure was included in the study Over  years the researchers followed up on the health of the men who were insured by and received care from Kaiser Not engaging in much physical activity was more strongly associated with heart failure than just sitting a lot But each behavior was linked to an increased risk for heart failure Men with the lowest level of physical activity were more than twice as likely to develop heart failure than those in the most active group  heart failure cases per    compared with  cases The men who spent the most time sitting were also more than twice as likely to develop heart failure than those who sat the least  heart failure cases per  person years compared with  cases To assess activity the researchers used questionnaires The men said how often and for how long they engaged in physical activity Men also said how many hours a day they spent watching TV looking at a computer or reading The researchers didnt look at what men did on the job Were they working up a sweat or confined to cubes Instead they focused on the activities outside business hours And they found that your behavior beyond whatever youre doing to make a living appears to affect your chances of heart failure An interesting finding from our work was that when we separated out the people who had coronary heart disease from the people who didnt the relative risk of developing heart failure with low physical activity and high sedentary time was constant   one of the Kaiser researchers said in   on the health plans website It didnt matter if you had prevalent heart disease or not the impact of not being active was the same The study cant say definitively that being more sedentary or exercising less caused heart failure The activities and the heightened risk were associations Still the findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that sitting and a lack of activity arent good for your heart The message is when you can walk instead of stand walk Young said When you can stand instead of sit stand The   of the medical journal
