 Mans beloved fourlegged friends not only respond to the words and ministrations of humans dogs can understand and anticipate the   researchers are reporting In a new study dogs who were spoken to or who had direct eye contact with a person were more likely to follow that humans gaze as it moved across the room than if the person didnt make direct eye contact with them The skills are equivalent to what is seen in monthold human infants say researchers who published their findings online Jan  in   These results support the notion that dogs are sensitive to the cues signaling humans communicative intent in a way that is analogous to preverbal human infants said study author Jozsef Topal Dogs were domesticated for the purpose of working with people so its essential that the two species are able to communicate said Adam Goldfarb director of pet care issues at The Humane Society of the United States Even though most   have transitioned away from their work of herding or hunting theyve retained their communication tools More and more research is illuminating the uncanny humanlike qualities of   better known as the domestic dog One study in the July  issue of   found that domesticated dogs were more likely to beg food from a person looking at them as opposed to someone who wasnt paying attention And canineintelligence expert Stanley Coren has found that dogs have the developmental abilities of a human yearold with the average dog capable of learning the meanings of  words In the new study  pet dogs watched videos of female actors turning towards a plastic pot In the first experiment the actor gazed directly at the dog and said in a highpitched voice Hi dog In the second experiment the actor said Hi dog in a lowpitched voice but didnt make eye contact Using eyetracking techniques which are already commonly used to study   the researchers determined that the dogs were more likely to follow the human turning toward the pot when they had both been spoken to and received direct eye contact Saying Hi dog in a lowpitched voice without the direct gaze didnt cue the dogs in to the humans intent Eyetracking techniques are also likely to be useful in studying other aspects of dogs cognitive processing such as memory skills and reasoning abilities said Topal who is an associate professor in the Comparative Behavior Research Group at the Institute for Psychological Researches Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest The dogs gaze was only triggered when preceded by communicating intent It does seem to be that dogs do look at humans and follow gestures said Dr Nicholas Dodman director of the Animal Behavior Clinic at Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton Mass This is intuitive to anyone who owns a dog that dogs seem to be more in tune with us than some scientists believe This should reinforce that if we want our dogs attention we should be clear about it Goldfarb said For those people who talk to their dog in a babytalk voice they should keep it up Your dog knows that youre talking to him or her and will pay more attention Learn more in the Everyday Health
