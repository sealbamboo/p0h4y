                  However most bottled waters contain less fluoride than recommended for good oral health it will be listed as an ingredient on the label if it is an additive 
                   
                  Fluoride makes the entire tooth structure more resistant to decay and promotes remineralization which aids in repairing early decay before damage is even visible explains Academy of General Dentistry spokesperson Charles H Perle DMD FAGD Studies have confirmed that the most effective source of fluoride is water fluoridation Diabetes reduces the bodys resistance to infection so youre at a risk for gum disease Brushing flossing and monitoring your blood sugar can help 
                   
                  Diabetes is directly related to periodontal disease so seeing the dentist and having your triglycerides and cholesterol levels checked on a regular basis is also crucial stresses Perle 
                   
                  Perle also points out that research has shown that diabetics can reduce the amount of insulin they need to take by maintaining good gum health As you age youre more susceptible to decay near old fillings or root surfaces unprotected by receding gums But theres no reason you cant keep your teeth Oral diseasenot aging per seis the danger

                  Seniors who brush regularly with fluoride toothpaste or use fluoride rinses or gels regularly have fewer cavities adds Meinecke Because oral contraceptives mimic pregnancy they can also lead to gum inflammation and infections including gingivitis 
                   
                  Additionally some studies have shown that women who use birth control pills may have more trouble healing after tooth extractions and are twice as likely to develop painful dry sockets where the tooth used to be 
                   
                  If you use birth control pills its not a bad idea to discuss their effect with your dentist before major procedures It is not clear whether bleaching erodes tooth enamel but it can increase sensitivity especially when done too often 
                   
                  Even athome whitening treatments should be used with moderation as some whitening toothpastes and gels contain abrasive ingredients that can increase tooth sensitivity which can be painful 
                   
                  Plus as you get older whitening products can only do so much so after a certain point using more wont necessarily do anything for your smile Soft drinks are chockfull of sugar which puts you at a risk for cavities tooth decay and gum infections and dark colas can also stain your teeth leaving you with a lackluster smile

                  She also recommends waiting at least an hour before brushing
