The study found daily adolescent users were  times more likely to become dependent on marijuana seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times more likely to use other illegal drugs in the future  Researchers also found that while a causal link to depression and welfare dependence was unlikely heavy marijuana use increased the odds  Evidence was not sufficient according to the study authors to support a causal link between marijuana use and suicide The results provide very strong evidence for a more direct relationship between adolescence cannabis use and later harm said lead author   with the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales Australia The findings are particularly timely given the growing movement to decriminalize or legalize cannabis because this has raised the possibility the drug might become more accessible to young people The risks increased as the amount of marijuana used increased according to researchers They say those who used marijuana daily are at the greatest risk of poorer outcomes later in life However they admit these studies are limited in their ability to explain whats behind the associations  Mason Tvert communications director with the   said the study doesnt show using marijuana causes any of these problems it just underscores a link between individuals who use marijuana and those who experience these types of problems The article expressly states that there remains no evidence that using marijuana causes depression suicide or dropping out of school he said It simply shows that teens who are prone to developing these problems are more likely to have used marijuana  Nobody wants teens to use marijuana but its quite clear that it poses far less harm to the consumer and to others than the abuse of alcohol or prescription drugs The study authors said preventing or delaying cannabis use by teens is likely to have broad health and social benefits   Policy makers need to be aware that the early use of cannabis is associated with a range of negative outcomes for young adults that affect their health wellbeing and also their achievement Silins said The findings strongly suggest that any reforms to cannabis legislation should be carefully evaluated to make sure they reduce adolescence cannabis use and prevent potentially adverse effects on adolescent development According to the   done in the United States approximately  of high school seniors are daily or neardaily cannabis users  The annual study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse looks at behaviors and attitudes of eighth   and   graders  NIDA Director Dr Nora Volkow says she was not surprised by the studys conclusions This analysis is consistent with findings that show heavy marijuana users generally report lower life satisfaction poorer mental and physical health more relationship problems and less academic and career success compared to nonmarijuanausing peers  Volkow said The risk of addiction is also higher when use initiates as a teen It is important that we continue to discourage young people from using marijuana
