Sevenyearold Sam Evans siblings know he is different Fouryearold twins Jack and Ellie proudly tell people he has a wobbly brain Its their way of explaining his unsteadiness on his feet his coordination problems and the fact that he sometimes asks the same question over and over again Sam is a smiley sociable boy who goes to school and has onetoone teaching support  but his life will become progressively more difficult In a year he may not be able to talk and a year after that he may not be able to walk his mother Miriam says  Sams parents Will and Miriam who live in Leeds were told the devastating news that their firstborn had a rare inherited disease called NiemannPick type C when he was four months old They were also told he was unlikely to live past the age of two It was absolutely horrific I couldnt say the words without falling apart Awful though the diagnosis was Miriam says many families wait for years and years for a diagnosis  some up to  years or more  and this creates its own problems Because the disease is the result of two copies of a faulty gene being passed on to a child any subsequent children have a one in four chance of getting the disease  Also it means people can live for years without treatment or access to any support Now a campaign led by the International NiemannPick Disease Alliance INPDA wants to change all that  aims to cut diagnosis times by helping doctors unfamiliar with the disease to recognise its key signs and symptoms Speeding up diagnosis it says will help patients and their families manage a particularly horrible disease which can cause a number of wideranging symptoms  from progressive physical problems to psychiatric issues and learning difficulties akin to dementia And this is precisely what makes it so difficult to diagnose The symptoms can also develop at any time from childhood through to adulthood and vary in severity in each individual Symptoms of NiemannPick type C can include Jim Green president of INPDA says there are bound to be more people out there with undiagnosed NiemannPick type C  Perhaps the biggest cohort are adults because its a nonspecific condition Weve tried to highlight the three key symptoms and we encourage doctors to ask themselves if it could be NPC He explains that there are lots of ways that sufferers and their families can be supported And although there is no cure for the disease drugs are available to help stabilise symptoms and delay the progression of the disease Both of Jim Greens sons were diagnosed with NiemannPick type C after around three years of tests His younger son died at  and his elder son is now  and doing extremely well he says despite the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease Not being able to predict how the disease is going to progress is one of the more terrifying aspects of the condition he admits Children who develop neurological symptoms in early childhood are thought to have a more aggressive form of the disease and may not survive to adolescence Others can stay free of symptoms for many years Sams mum Miriam says one of the most obvious symptoms is an abnormality in eye movements which affects virtually everyone with the disease Sams eyes dont move around like everyone elses when hes walking about And if I am talk to him he cant flick his eyes up to look at me This is something called vertical supranuclear gaze palsy which is relatively simple to detect At present it is thought that one in  people have the disease but it could be closer to one in  Miriam says There are definitely more people out there than we know about The advantages of picking up these people are numerous Patients and families can be supported and researchers can also find out more about the disease The trials of three drugs which could be used to treat NiemannPick are in the pipeline and could make a difference to many lives And the more people with this rare disease who can be enrolled in trials the more useful the results will be
