Eat more when youre stressed Youre not alone More than a third of the participants in a  conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health said they change their diets during stressful times And many of us are quick to turn to either sugary foods or highly refined carbohydrates such as bagels or white pasta when the stress hits There can be a bit of a vicious cycle says   a professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Harvard University and a researcher at Boston Childrens Hospital When we feel stressed we seek foods that are going to comfort us immediately but often times those foods lead to surges and crashes in hormones and blood sugar that increase our susceptibility to new stresses Now of course we cant control lots of the events and circumstances that lead to stress But Ludwig says our body chemistry can very much affect how that stress gets to us He points to a   he and some colleagues published in the journal   several years back They gave teenage boys different types of breakfast meals One included proteinrich eggs while another meal included highfiber steelcut oats A third meal of instant oatmeal was highest on the   a measure of how quickly sugar is absorbed and how soon a food is likely to make you hungry again After the highly refined instant oatmeal blood sugar soared but then crashed a few hours later Ludwig says And when that happened the stress hormone adrenaline or epinephrine surged to very high levels Ludwig says the links between food and mood are complex And just as there are individual differences in susceptibility to diseases there are differences in response to food too Not all of us are equally sensitive to foods like instant oatmeal high on the glycemic index Given what we know about how different foods affect the risk of cardiovascular disease and Type  diabetes why should it be so surprising that the nature of the foods we eat can also affect our emotional and mental wellbeing Ludwig says So if eating lots of refined carbs and sugar may exacerbate our responses to stress are there other types of food that make us more resilient Researcher   of the National Institutes of Health believes the answer is yes I think theres a very strong connection between what you eat and your mood Hibbeln says He has spent the past two decades investigating links between the omega fatty acids found in fish and emotional health One of the most basic ways that omegas help to regulate mood is by quieting down the bodys response to inflammation Hibbeln says When you get walloped by something whether its a virus or an emotional stressor you want to bounce back as quickly as possible he notes You can either be good at weathering stress or you can be brittle And omegas make your stress system more flexible Hibbeln says He points to   showing that omegas can help protect neurons against the damage that can be done by chronic stress He also points to   that have found that omegas may help control depressive symptoms And a  of schoolchildren in England linked omegas to more prosocial behavior Hibbeln knows that some people shy away from fish due to the cost so he points to affordable options such as canned light tuna and sardines which are good sources of omegas There are also plantbased sources of omegas such as flaxseed and chia seeds Now clearly omegas arent the only food thats good for our emotional health  a psychiatrist at Columbia University and author of     says a nutrientrich diet is best for beating stress He points to his favorite stressbusting breakfast scrambled eggs mixed with kale or other greens and topped with pumpkin seeds With this meal youre covering all your bases Ramsey says The eggs are a good source of B vitamins and protein which can be more satiating than a carbbased breakfast The greens are incredibly nutrientdense and are a good source of vitamin A vitamin K and potassium And the pumpkin seeds are a good source of magnesium  which is thought to play a role in    and zinc which may help   For dessert go for dark chocolate which can have an acute affect on mood Ramsey says He points to a   that found cocoa flavanols can help boost mood and sustain clear thinking among adults who are engaged in intense mental efforts  like students cramming or journalists on deadline In addition dark chocolate has been shown to   by increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation The bottom line The foods we choose cant magic away stress But Ramsey says he believes there is a very very strong connection between food and mood
