January is the cruelest month at least for those with good intentions to get fit   many new exercise intenders will abandon their workout routines within two weeks of their New Years resolutions and about half will quit by June Even longtime exercisers feel the pull of physical entropy In any given year around a quarter of the people who had been working out dutifully will stop And about  percent of those who claim to have no intention of exercising actually start and continue baffling researchers and possibly the exercisers themselves Why we fail to realize our best exercise intentions is a complex interplay of psychology physiology and genetics Adult twins frequently have similar exercise patterns suggesting that some portion of exercise motivation is inherited Innate personality also plays a role   Being extroverted makes it easier to stick with exercise resolutions while being nice or agreeable in psychological terms does not But most quit exercising for more commonplace  and redressable  reasons For instance people make generic or unrealistic plans about where and when they will exercise making them essentially fairytale wishes says Ryan Rhodes a professor of behavioral medicine at the University of Victoria in British Columbia who has cowritten several recent reviews and conducted numerous exerciseintention experiments  Someone can plan to go to the gym Friday at  am before work he says but if he or she hates early rising or prebreakfast exertion those plans will evaporate What Dr Rhodes describes as a far more detailed strategy that concretely addresses specific obstacles Which bus runs at  am Gym bag packed and next to the door is more likely to motivate behavior Also gauge your daily fatigue and schedule exercise during times when you feel best he advises But the most important factor when it comes to sticking with exercise is so obvious that it frequently goes unheeded The appeals of physical fitness  good health pleasing appearance appropriate body weight  are vague and distant and the actual experience of exercise is not given much consideration Dr Rhodes says In other words we dont think about whether we like exercise before we embark on a regimen yet our feelings about exercise predict who translates their intentions into behavior as Dr Rhodes puts it So the first consideration is finding your exercise bliss Typically this includes variety novelty and competence People who feel ungainly in a Zumba class wont keep attending Rewards furthermore are of limited value Promise yourself an hour of television after  minutes of walking through the neighborhood and the walk can seem more pleasurable But naked greed is not much of a motivator    college freshmen agreed to visit their schools gym on a regular schedule Some were then paid at least  weekly if they complied After four months the forprofit exercisers had visited the facility more times in total than the other students but only  percent met the original agreedupon goals and everyones attendance had fallen off week by week Even for the notoriously impecunious cash cannot overcome lack of interest
