I pulled back the curtain ready to meet the next patient on my hospital rounds Why are you standing there she asked me Come have a seat lets talk Lenore could have been my grandmother She was  years old and all of  pounds What she lacked in girth she more than made up for in chutzpah She was one of the patients from intern year who Ill never forget After four years of medical school I could recite biochemical pathways genetic mutations and the ways all sorts of drugs work But all the cramming suppressed most of my common sense Perhaps manners too Lenore was offering me a refresher course How could I refuse her polite but firm invitation Id never been encouraged to sit at a patients bedside  to stop hurrying for even a moment Our medical teachers put a premium on accuracy and efficiency which became conflated with speed Everything had to be fast In  doctors still value speed and technical accuracy but we also do more to consider the quality of care we give and whether patients are satisfied with it Those goals arent just the right thing to do There are often   attached to getting them right Even so interns today dont sit much more often than they did back in my day In a recent   Johns Hopkins researchers followed two groups of medical interns for a month and found they sat down at the bedside only  percent of the time Sitting down which would seem like one of the simplest things to do is the least practiced of five communication skills for doctors that Lenore would have endorsed and that research has shown can make a big difference in patient satisfaction The others include introducing oneself to the patient and explaining your role in the patients care Touching the patient  whether its a handshake a gesture of comfort or part of a physical exam  makes a difference too And the old art of good conversation never goes out of style Ask openended questions like How are you feeling today Medical educators should be role models for these common courtesies says   the senior author of the study and director of an urban health residency program at Hopkins Trainees take their cues from us he tells Shots These behaviors are what constitute bedside manner  More than that he says sitting at the bedside projects body language that tells a patient Im here for you How can I be of service Feldman prizes these basic but often overlooked human interactions in his trainees He suggests simple solutions like making sure theres a chair available next to every hospital bed During my own intern refresher course with Lenore those many years ago I tried to sit in the chair next to her bed Shed have none of it Here she said patting the mattress and telling me where to park it Now how is   day going she asked An openended question What a pro she was
