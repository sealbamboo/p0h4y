The Department of Health and NHS England has been a happy place this month Confirmation that the AE system in England met its fourhour target for the January to March quarter brought a quiet sense of satisfaction After all it was only a few months ago that a winter crisis was being predicted But has all that effort come at a price The latest update on performance from the Kings Fund suggests it might It notes pressure on nonemergency operations such as hip and knee replacements has begun to creep up Treatment is meant to start within  weeks in  of cases This is being met but only just as  of patients were seen within the timeframe in January That is the lowest level for over two years If you measure it by average waiting time it is even worse It stands at  weeks the worst it has been since the target was introduced in  Dig deeper and the situation gets even more alarming Winter is the time of year the waiting lists for routine treatments tend to shrink But the numbers waiting rose by  from December to January  It means compared with January  there were an additional  people waiting for an operation This would be less of a problem if the NHS was increasing the number of operations to keep pace  something it has been very good at for the past decade But it isnt The time to clear the waiting list a measure of flows on to and off the list is more than  weeks  the highest since May  Richard Murray the Kings Funds director of policy says this is concerning Hospitals have had to put their time and resources into AE and with money so tight the concern is it might be difficult now to tackle this  New data for February published by NHS England showed that the proportion of patients being seen within  weeks had dropped to   breaching the  target It marks the first time it has been missed since early
