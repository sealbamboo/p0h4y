A scientists ambitious plan to create an early detection system for eye cancer using peoples home cameras is coming along Last fall we told you about Bryan Shaws   He believes parents cameras can reveal whether their baby has   a white glow coming from the pupil when you shine a light in their eyes This socalled white eye can be an early sign of   a rare form of eye cancer Children with the disease develop tumors on their retinas at the back of their eyeballs Shaw wants to make software that will recognize this leukocoria This isnt Shaws field Hes a chemist at   But he got involved with leukocoria detection when his newborn son was diagnosed with retinoblastoma in  He and his wife Elizabeth had seen leukocoria in baby pictures when Noah was  months old but at the time the photos were taken they hadnt realized what was going on Naturally enough after his sons diagnosis Shaws first thoughts were to do whatever it took to save his sons life But at some point during the months of chemotherapy radiation and ultimately surgery to remove his sons right eye to prevent the cancer from spreading to his brain Bryan started thinking more like the scientist he is He wondered what would have happened if the family camera had been programmed with software that could recognize leukocoria automatically If I would have had some software in it telling me Hey go get this checked out that would have sped up my sons diagnosis and the tumors would have been just a little bit smaller when we got to them There might have been fewer says Shaw And maybe Noahs eye could have been saved But there was no software Now for most of us that would have been that But Bryan Shaw the inorganic chemist figured what the heck Ill become a software designer I was trained in this funny lab at Harvard called the George   where we scoffed at specialization he says If you were just an inorganic chemist you werent cool You had to go make it in areas totally outside your field To design the software Shaw needed to find the earliest instance of that white reflection in baby Noahs eyes That would tell him how early you could catch a sign of the disease Luckily his wife Elizabeth was quite the shutterbug so there were thousands of pictures After poring over them for weeks Shaw found what he was looking for We had whiteeye showing up in pictures at  days old he says Months before the doctors diagnosed his cancer these photos showed the tumors were there and growing  when Noah was practically a newborn I mean he still had the nasty thing hanging from his belly button Shaw says Using the picture Shaw developed a scale for how much leukocoria there was in a particular picture He rounded up some computer science colleagues at Baylor including Greg Hamerly Ryan Henning Pablo Rivas Perea and Li Guo Together they came up with a   prototype Ultimately Shaw would like to see this software available anywhere theres a picture of a child I would like this application this software to be free and I would want it anywhere a picture of a kid is your laptop computer your Flickr account your Facebook account your phone your camera Shaw says I dont care where But getting the kind of distribution Shaw is hoping for is going to take awhile because perfecting the software and proving it works is going to be tough One thing hell definitely need is help from parents of children with retinoblastoma Theyll have to donate all of their baby pictures so he can test his software on those and see how it does finding their cancers And hell need pictures of healthy kids to prove the software wont accidentally say they have cancer when they dont False positives says Shaw Thats going to be the big problem is false positives Indeed Imagine thousands of terrified parents pounding on doctors doors because their camera told them their kid might have cancer My fear is that I spend a lot of time on this trash my career dont get tenure and it never comes to anything says Shaw But you know what Its such a good idea that I believe even if I dont do it if I just get the word out somebody else will do it Thats really all that matters
