Last November the week of my mothers th birthday her essay ran in this blog under the headline    She explained  somewhat humorously more than a little bitterly  that because of her very limited vision and her weakening aging body she was increasingly dependent on her children and that it made her feel like a burden to be cared for and tended even when the care came with love I am the oldest child the doctor daughter  My part of caring for her included a disproportionate amount of the medical stuff from going with her on medical visits to sorting her daily medications into pill boxes doling out the blood pressure medicine and the vitamins that she hoped would preserve what was left of her vision   When I last looked there were more than  comments on my mothers post They started coming in as soon as the essay was published and they have continued to appear more sporadically over the six months since it appeared  six months that unfortunately also encompassed the  death of the author   My mothers essay resonated with many readers reminded them of their aging parents or of themselves  The piece also made a lot of readers kind of angry and they wrote in to scold her to tell her she needed psychotherapy or medication  Im not sure that everyone is ready for certain kinds of honesty from people toward the end of life trapped in bodies that are progressively betraying them after decades of service facing the future with the daily reminders that come from losing friends and contemporaries perhaps picking up messages in the air on special frequencies not audible to the rest of us    The thing is my mother loved those comments  I think its possible she enjoyed the most negative and hostile comments the most How often is a legally blind  yearold writer told she deserves a spanking  Or reminded to be thankful because she could be legless in Calcutta   What she really relished of course was the sense of connection she was a writer all her adult life and I think everyone who knew her understood that though there were many strong strands to her identity  teacher New Yorker wife mother grandmother  the strongest throughline in the end was writer  And here at  on an Internet that she never understood and on a computer that she wrestled with in Luddite frustration every day of her life she found herself connecting   So many of the people who wrote in felt sorry for the caretaking children of the selfstyled ungrateful old lady  They worried that our feelings were being hurt by our mothers bad attitude that we were being pushed away left sad and lonely as our loveofferings were rejected or at best met with sourness and a certain amount of hostility  There were those who warned my mother that she might push us away and end up alone  There were those who read her words and thanked heaven that they had no children  So yes of course for the record she would thank me for sorting the pills over and over and for going with her to the various doctors  She wasnt ungrateful in that sense She always said by way of apology that she knew I was busy she knew I didnt have time for all this  But it was also perfectly true as she said in her essay that she resented the whole thing It made her feel like a burden it reminded her of how much ground she had lost to age and blindness and well she  wasnt happy to need me there   No she didnt necessarily make it easy  Taking care of my mother wasnt a new conversation  It was a continuation of all the conversations wed been having our whole lives through  the good ones and the bad ones  We were performing the caretaker and the caretaken as ourselves for better and for worse  We stayed in character   And my mothers character was fixed she was one of the most interesting people Ive ever known and one of the toughest  She was irreducibly and completely herself  indomitable admirable and intermittently irrational  And she would probably have said the same about me  We recognized each other and we argued and though I am younger and stronger and possessed of a medical degree that she regarded with all the awe that goes into that large repertoire of Jewish doctor jokes I didnt win most of the arguments Three years ago she lost most of what remained of her vision to a bad subretinal hemorrhage There was a terrible terrible summer when she was truly blind and then slowly she gained back enough vision to read very large fonts on a screen to grade papers with a superstrong magnifying glass  Her handwriting became unrecognizable big Sharpie letters straggling off the page huge printed notes to herself that she taped to the wall  And reading and writing the twin joys of her mind and heart and soul became a daily struggle dependent on the ambient light and the variable accommodation of her remaining bits of peripheral vision I bet I know what youre thinking  Set her up with Dragon software so she could talk to her computer instead of typing  Seek solace in audiobooks  maybe youre even imagining an old age spent listening to British actors reading Jane Austen or Charles Dickens  Ha been there done that   Even before that tragic hemorrhage my mothers eyesight had been bad for years and I had tried to talk her into audiobooks using the superficially logical argument that lots of people with perfectly good vision enjoy listening to what she called books on tape  She wouldnt do it  All I could get out of her was the deeply gloomy conditional promise Maybe when Im truly blind   So then she more or less did go blind and she let us set her up with some audiobooks  And the crazy thing was she really enjoyed them  She got involved in the stories she followed complicated plots  She listened to each one through to the end  But she never never never acquired a new one unless someone gave it to her and left to herself in her own house she would never start listening  She preferred to hold a newspaper up to the window angling it this way and that struggling for a combination of light and peripheral retinal cells and the possibility of reading newsprint  Maybe there would be a miracle As her daughter I understood some of this better than I wish I did  My general tone in caretaking just ask my children could probably be best described as somewhere between tough love and sarcasm  I would accompany my mother to the doctor and it would turn out surprise that there was a wait My mother would turn to me anxiously in the waiting room and say Perri do you have time for this  And I would say Actually no if they keep us here for another  minutes Im probably going to lose my job and my family will starve   We did a lot of this  Im sorry she would say as I filled the morning and evening medication boxes this is a lot of trouble for you  I cant believe that you would send me to medical school and then ask me to sort some pills every once in a while I would say  Good thing Im a saint  And then she would smile and say Youre very kind  But kindness as Mae West might have said had nothing to do with it  And neither did gratitude except maybe in the more cosmic sense  the gratitude I feel now and felt then for getting the chance to be there  Man I loved her  Man I loved taking care of her  I wish I had been able to do it better and I certainly wish I had been able to do it longer   And though I sometimes wanted to be listened to either as a daughter or a doctor when I was recommending a little comfort or a little ease I didnt want a different kind of gratitude or anything else that would have compromised her voice and changed the conversation   Burdens arent grateful any more than theyre graceful wrote my mother in her blog post  Needless to say I think she worried too much about being a burden and I think the whole project would have been easier on all concerned if she had been willing to accept a little more help and comfort But since I know I will hear her voice in my head all my life I am happy to hear it in all its characteristic and occasionally cranky tones  I honor the battles that she felt she had to fight and the spirit in which she inhabited her own indelible self and kept the battle fires going even as the world grew darker all around her
