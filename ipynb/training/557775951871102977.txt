Health spending has become a major political battleground in the runup to the general election as the parties compete to offer answers to the huge challenges facing the NHS in England Pressures on the NHS budget  bn in England in   are mounting A report published in October  warned that the health service in England could face a bn annual shortfall by  It said that bn of reforms could be made to make the service more efficient but the NHS would still need aboveinflation rises to plug the other bn of the estimated shortfall  Here is a guide to what we know so far about the main parties NHS spending plans for the next five years   The Conservatives have promised to ringfence and protect the NHS budget so spending would rise in line with inflation  In addition in the  Autumn Statement Chancellor George Osborne announced an extra bn a year  beginning in   for frontline health services across the UK which he described as a down payment on the highlighted bn annual shortfall Mr Osborne said Because of careful management we can afford to put underspend money into our National Health Service to cope with the pressures it faces  billion every year to the front line of the NHS Not money that busts our plans but extra money that is available because we have a plan That is a downpayment on the NHSs own plan proving definitively for anyone in any doubt that we cannot have a strong NHS without a strong economy But the Conservatives came under fire after it emerged the bn sum includes m of underspend which was already allocated to the NHS budget  Mr Osborne was accused of reallocating existing money  The extra bn a year is for the whole of the UK and includes m funding for the devolved nations to be allocated under the Barnett formula  The Tories have said the extra bn would be spent every year of the next parliament but havent specified where the money for the years beyond  would come from The party has specified that m of the bn will be spent each year for four years modernising GP surgeries across the UK paid for through fines imposed on banks after the Libor raterigging scandal  Labour has promised to keep the NHS ringfence and spend an extra bn a year  over and above the Conservative plans  across the UK by the end of the next Parliament paid for by a mixture of its mansion tax tax avoidance measures and a windfall tax on tobacco companies  The party was criticised after it became clear the promised bn would not be available in the first year of the new parliament Labour has clarified that it would take time to raise the new revenue and there are suggestions it would not be available until   The proposed tax avoidance clampdown involves stopping hedge funds avoiding hundreds of millions in tax on shares closing the Eurobonds loophole which is being exploited by some large firms to move profits out of the UK and stopping umbrella companies being used to avoid tax and national insurance The mansion tax would be levied progressively on properties over m with protections for people who do not have a high income but happen to live in an expensive property Labour estimates that the mansion tax would provide bn of the promised bn As with the Conservative pledge a proportion of the extra money would be allocated to the devolved nations under the Barnett formula Labours leader in Scotland Jim Murphy provoked a row by announcing that  extra Scottish nurses would be funded from Scotlands proportion of the money raised by the mansion tax Labour leader Ed Miliband told the partys  conference We will transform our NHS we need doctors nurses midwives care workers who are able to spend proper time with us not rushed off their feet So we will set aside resources so that we can have in our NHS  more midwives  more care workers  more GPs and  more nurses  And in order to pay for it we wont borrow an extra penny Or raise taxes on ordinary working families  Labour also says it wants to bring health and social care together but has not specified details of how it would do this when it might do this or what it might cost  The Liberal Democrats have promised to meet in full the bn extra the NHS managers say is needed by  The plan is broadly based on the economy recovering in line with current projections made by the  Office for Budget Responsibility and would go alongside continued efficiencies and reforms in the NHS Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said The big big difference between ourselves and Labour and the Conservatives is that we have said that once we have dealt with the structural deficit once we have dealt with it in  we will link the amount of money going into public services  including the NHS  to the growth of the economy In the shorter term the party has set out some commitments to extra spending  The Lib Dems are promising an extra bn a year above Conservative plans from   to be funded from reducing tax relief increasing tax rates on share dividends for high earners and repealing the Conservative policy of allowing businesses to offer shares to workers in return for giving up their employment rights Half of this bn would be spent on mental health services a Lib Dem priority The Lib Dems timeline involves The party also says it will ringfence the NHS budget and pool the health and social care budgets  UKIP is currently the only main party not pledging any extra cash to the NHS it is instead committed to reprioritising what the NHS does  The party has made no commitment to keep the NHS ringfence and has in fact hinted that they would get rid of it  UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said the idea of replacing the NHS with an insurancebased system is a debate that were all going to have to return to Specific policies include  The Green Party says health spending should be maintained at around the average in the European union  The party says an NHS tax earmarked to increase direct funding of the NHS would be introduced as part of general income and other taxation
