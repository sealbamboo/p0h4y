Heres some news for parents of the sippycup crowd The Food and Drug Administration has proposed a  partsperbillion threshold for levels of inorganic arsenic in apple juice This is the same level set by the EPA for arsenic in drinking water Right now there is no FDA standard for apple juice Now weve told you about the brouhaha over trace levels of arsenic commonly found in apple juice before Back in  after Dr Mehmet Oz released the results of an   that found that some of the nations bestknown brands contained arsenic he was criticized for needlessly worrying parents As we   back then Dr Richard Besser former acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took on Dr Oz in a   on   calling the report extremely irresponsible since the study only looked at total levels of arsenic In other words the study did not distinguish between organic arsenic which occurs in nature and passes quickly through the body and inorganic arsenic the carcinogenic form Since arsenic is present naturally in the environment lots of foods from rice to chicken include trace levels And past use of arseniccontaining pesticides has also led to concentrations of arsenic in soils Additionally much of the apple juice sold in the US is made with apples from China But Oz was not alone in raising alarm bells A few months after the controversy surrounding Ozs study Consumer Reports published the   of its own investigation that found roughly  percent of juice samples in its testing had total levels of arsenic that exceeded federal drinkingwater standards  and   In proposing the new arsenic threshold FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a release We have been studying this issue comprehensively and based on the agencys data and analytical work the FDA is confident in the overall safety of apple juice for children and adults The FDA has been monitoring levels of arsenic in apple juice for  years In its latest analysis released last year of  samples of apple juice the agency found that  percent of the samples fell below  ppb for inorganic arsenic Concerns have also been raised about the levels of arsenic found in   An FDA spokesperson told us by email that the administration is following the same process it used with apple juice to assess arsenic levels in rice Once we complete our analysis we will begin our risk assessment and determine the next steps Consumer Reports was quick to weigh in on the FDAs announcement We are pleased to see the Food and Drug Administration taking this action says   director of consumer safety and sustainability at Consumer Reports Proposing a  ppb guidance for apple juice  the same level set for water  is a reasonable first step in protecting consumers from unnecessary exposure to arsenic
