That one goes up to  pounds she said because they use it to weigh patients in wheelchairs  I knew all too well what the scale at the DU was capable of My mother who had been a dialysis patient had used that scale for six years before she passed away That a scale could not determine my weight was already embarrassing But to be told that I needed to use a scale in the Dialysis Unit was wakeup call of where I was heading if I didnt do anything about my weight A move to Utah in  gave me the second chance I needed I started almost immediately with a mostly vegetable and lean protein diet and added in walking and swimming In nine months I had dropped  pounds  This time the scale became my friend My best friend So much so that as soon as I woke up I would weigh myself  An hour or two later I would weigh myself again In a hour period I must have weighed myself at least a dozen times My selfesteem became wrapped up in the scale I would be elated when I dropped a pound or two and depressed when the scale didnt move Or even worse when I gained  One day of not seeing the scale move made me anxious A second and third and fourth day made me depressed and I would end up eating foods I knew were not good for me No matter how many compliments I received from people who hadnt seen me in a while my weight loss meant nothing because the scale didnt move   I wanted to find out if other people felt the same way and started Googling massive weight loss It was then that I came across   Reading about her struggles renewed my faith in my own struggle In fact I became so excited that I   with further weight loss as my main motivation But I have been surprised shocked even at the twists and turns of this part of my journey There are too many things happening to me right now that are far more exciting than losing or gaining weight For instance my insulin intake has dropped from  units to  units per day it used to be  units a day at  pounds After our initial meet up in Atlanta I started walking with friends daily at the park in the mornings and executing the training plan Coach April posted at the gym in the evenings Two weeks later however I had gained  pounds I was perplexed Wasnt I exercising daily Wasnt I eating all the right foods The good carbohydrates The good oils Nuts and lean meats Weight loss I have come to understand is not a simple graph with a continuous straight line down  Weight loss looks more like a river with bends and currents and even waterfalls  Rivers of course ultimately find their way to the sea And with that certainty in mind I have decided to no longer stress about the scale  In fact I threw out my bathroom scale two months ago and am no longer weighing myself There are too many things happening to me right now that are more exciting than losing or gaining weight  For instance I can run not only a mile but four Nonstop In under an hour I can swim  yards in  minutes I can perform three sets of  squats while holding a pound medicine ball OK I still cant do lunges in proper form but hey Im trying What Im discovering is that my new lifestyle means my selfesteem is no longer dependent on a scale but on the thrills of how far I can push myself daily
