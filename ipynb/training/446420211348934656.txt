Superfast ventilation  equivalent to  breaths per minute  is the best way to protect extremely premature babies lungs a study has concluded Most are currently supported with about  breaths per minute But a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates very rapid but shallower breaths led to better longterm lung function The researchers at Kings College London said the findings would provoke intense debate They followed  babies born before  weeks of gestation from birth to adolescence  The team compared what happened to the lungs of those given conventional ventilation within an hour of being born with those on highfrequency oscillatory ventilation HFOV  The small airways of the children were in better shape between the ages of  and  if they had had HFOV as a baby It is thought that the smaller volume of air being forced into the lungs caused less damage to the delicate organs than conventional therapy The difference did not appear to affect children in their daily lives Prof Anne Greenough from Kings College London said It is exciting that the differences are still there in adolescence She said worse lung function in people having conventional therapy could leave them more vulnerable to damaging effects of infection or smoking later in life About  babies are born very prematurely in the UK each year
