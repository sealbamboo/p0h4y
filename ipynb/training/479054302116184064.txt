The danger zones in Asia which are vulnerable to a deadly bird flu have been mapped by scientists  The virus called HN has infected  people mostly in China and has killed   The study   showed parts of Bangladesh India and Vietnam could easily sustain the virus The research group said those areas should monitor poultry to ensure any threat is detected  The HN virus spread from birds to people and was first detected in March  in China New viruses are always a concern because of their unknown potential to spread round the world as a deadly pandemic  Data from the HN outbreak was used to build a computer model of other atrisk areas in Asia It involved mapping  livepoultry markets and assessing how close together they needed to be to spread the infection  The map does not show where the virus will end up next just those areas where conditions are suitable to sustain the virus if it managed to get there   Bangladesh northern India the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam and isolated parts of Indonesia and Philippines were identified as atrisk areas Thailand was not a risk zone due to cultural differences which mean livepoultry markets are not common It is also noticeable that the whole of China is not equally at risk HN is not deadly in birds so there is no body count to help track the spread of the disease  Dr Tim Robinson a senior spatial analyst at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi told the BBC It is a risk map showing if the virus arrived to an area how likely it would be to spread and continue from there HN can spread very quietly throughout the poultry population The main use of the maps is to target surveillance I think these maps can show areas where theres a high chance of the disease flaring up if it arrives What is missing from the maps is how the virus is likely to spread  The researchers want to factor in data on how poultry are traded in Asia Dr Simon Hay from the University of Oxford said HN is confined to China at the moment and all the neighbouring countries are worried about when their chicken industry might be infected  The maps are a prediction if you dropped a new infection in that location would it stick and hold as a disease He said the tools developed could be quickly applied to other bird flus making the the jump to people in the future  Yet the great fear in novel avian influenza is that the virus starts to spread rapidly between people I think the maps become redundant at that point Dr Hay added  Its a very different disease process then if it does jump to humantohuman transmission then you would use a classical influenza model using the proximity of people volume of air flights and the amount of people moving between cities
