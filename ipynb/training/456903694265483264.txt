The workplace has become a more understanding place for pregnant women or new moms these days Many companies now have lactation rooms and offer more liberal maternity and paternity leave policies than in years past But for some women pregnancy can still be a career liability Heather Myers was fresh out of high school and working at a WalMart in Salina Kan in  when she found out she was pregnant She kept a water bottle with her on the sales floor as her doctor recommended Then her supervisor intervened She said Im sorry but we cant accept your doctors note because we have  the water fountains available to you  Myers says So Myers got a second doctors note but the supervisor rejected that too I was just a little shocked that this water bottle was kind of becoming this big deal and they were even scrutinizing my doctors notes she says Myers held firm I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listen to my doctor and to my body  and decided to keep the water bottle she says And one day that supervisor came up to me and she said Either the water bottle has to go or you have to go  Myers was fired She sued and later settled out of court In March WalMart under pressure from other women amended its policy saying it will take reasonable measures to accommodate temporary disability caused by pregnancy Thirtysix years after Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act there is still a debate about what employers are required to do for expectant mothers In recent months New Jersey West Virginia New York City and Philadelphia have passed laws explicitly requiring employers to reasonably accommodate pregnant workers And there are similar proposals in several other states and the US Congress Some in the business community support such measures But others like the Illinois Chamber of Commerce say such bills create legal confusion for businesses that must also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws Jeffrey Risch chairman of the employment law and litigation committee for the chamber says its going to be both costly and confusing  especially for small businesses he says Emily Martin general counsel for the National Womens Law Center disagrees Unfortunately a lot of employers dont understand that they have legal obligations she says Which is why she adds the law needs more clarity Martin says employers that dont comply are often in lowwage professions like retail and food service or in maledominated industries Truck driving or policing Those are also workplaces that are both physically demanding and that may have a culture of some hostility to women being on the job at all Martin says Take the case of Peggy Young She had an earlydelivery shift for UPS in Maryland when she got pregnant in  She says the staff nurse told her to get a doctors note saying that Young should avoid lifting objects heavier than  pounds But when I took the note in to the nurse she basically said Well we dont give alternative work or light duty to offwork incidents  Young says Im like Im pregnant Theres not an incident here  Young shared her story at an Olive Garden restaurant where she now waitresses She says she knew that UPS had reassigned some coworkers because of high blood pressure or drunkendriving offenses so she petitioned her manager to allow her to continue working And he pretty much said Youre too much of a liability in our building  dont come back until youre no longer pregnant I just kind of looked at him like Are you serious Like I cant work  His answer Young says was no Young sued UPS Two lower courts ruled against her so now shes petitioning the Supreme Court UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg says the lower court rulings show the companys policy is consistent with the law In cases of medical need the company accommodates workers  but pregnancy is not given special treatment The courts determined that UPS policy is pregnancy blind she says Young and her attorneys are waiting to see whether the high court will hear her case
