The first time my father was ever robbed decades ago he was vacationing in England with my mom A certified public accountant he had certain fiscal habits one of which was to count and order his money highest denomination bill to lowest all facing the same way in his wallet He did this constantly usually at home after work In England though he performed the rite in the hotel pub My mother was furious For good reason  That night while they slept someone broke into their room and stole his wallet The second time he was robbed earlier this year there was no breakin The thief according to the police was a staff member at my fathers assisted living facility on the Jersey Shore a regular presence in his room Financial elder abuse statistics are not easy to pin down Estimates have run as high as five million incidents annually but no one knows for sure Experts consider financial elder abuse grossly underreported in large part because the criminals are often also family members It took some time to recognize that someone was actually stealing from my father In fact the hardest part of nabbing this crook was ascertaining whether my dad was telling the truth  Because of the trove of medications he takes to treat Parkinsons disease and related conditions his thinking and words can become a tangle And when finances enter the picture his ability to process shrinks even further He called me in March to tell me that he had lost some money he had just gotten from the centers ATM  way too much cash for someone who rarely leaves his room He couldnt remember the details he just knew the money was gone  A week later he told me there was more money missing This time he was convinced someone had stolen it but he couldnt provide any evidence of that Next he claimed his ATM card was missing This is where my skepticism peaked The missing card was a replacement I had ordered just weeks before  one he didnt actually need it turned out because the original was right in his wallet but so difficult to find with those trembling hands I was headed down to visit in just a few days so I told him to hold on Surely I could sift through the mess that was his desk and find that card  But I was wrong The ATM card was gone So was his credit card Yet I still couldnt quite believe he had been robbed My father gets excellent care at his assisted living facility Everybody calls out Hey Jerry when he rolls by Staff members have told us dozens of times how funny and cheerful he is He is relatively healthy for a man with an incurable disease and I think the staff has a lot to do with it So it never occurred to me that someone might be taking advantage of him But when I called the bank to cancel the missing credit card the customer service representative asked if his most recent charge had been  at an autodetailing shop Uh  no The facility contacted the police The head of security wanting to get this lowlife off the assisted living campus also launched a sting Thats where things became complicated The security chief left a bank envelope  with several  bills peeking out  on a dresser in the direct view of a hidden motionactivated camera But only one person went near the cash my father Anytime he came back from the dining room or physical therapy he would count the cash He moved it around spilled water on it everything but leave it be as security had asked him to He became confused about how much money was in the envelope and to whom it belonged We spent a lot of time on the phone So we didnt catch the thief redhanded but the police did connect the dots through the credit card fraud Because of my fathers history of falls the facility requires him to have a home care aide in the room first thing in the morning and later at night The suspected thief who was not one of my fathers regular aides but a floater would have had plenty of time to riffle through things while my father was in the bathroom Like all staff at the facility he had passed a drug test and a criminal background check Seven months after his arrest he is about to go before Monmouth Countys grand jury on charges of theft and credit card theft Although the chance of a repeat incident was slim my sister and I had to make changes and protect Dad from practices that left him vulnerable The first step was easy less cash His lifelong habit of withdrawing  was reckless and given his lifestyle unnecessary He agreed to limit withdrawals to  per bank visit We also embraced technology getting statements and bills online to stop the paperwork piling up on his desk While he shuffled and analyzed and tabulated too many others could see his account information We also set up electronic transfers from his IRA to his checking account to prevent having checks lying around And we semiretired his credit card It lives at my sisters house now for safekeeping It is there if Dad needs it but it wont see much use  As his righthand financial guy I have become supervigilant I check his bank account and credit card records every week or so Nothing to report so far  with one exception  Despite our agreement Dad has bumped up his cash withdrawals to  Counting and reordering  every so often isnt much of a rite
