You already know your chronological age but do you know your fitness age A new study of fitness and lifespan suggests that a persons socalled fitness age  determined primarily by a measure of cardiovascular endurance  is a better predictor of longevity than chronological age The good news is that unlike your actual age your fitness age can decrease The concept of fitness age has been developed by researchers at the  Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim who have studied fitness and  how it relates to wellness for years Fitness age is  determined primarily by your VOmax which is a measure of your bodys ability to take in and utilize oxygen VOmax indicates your current cardiovascular endurance It also can be used to compare your fitness with that of other people of the same age providing you in the process with a personal fitness age If your VOmax is below average for your age group then your fitness age is older than your actual age But if you compare well you can actually turn back the clock to a younger fitness age That means a yearold man conceivably could have a fitness age between  and  depending on his VOmax Knowing your fitness age could be instructive and perhaps sobering  but it also necessitates knowing your VOmax first which few of us do Precise measurement of aerobic capacity requires hightech treadmill testing To work around that problem the Norwegian scientists decided several years ago to develop an easy method for estimating VOmax They recruited almost  Norwegians between the ages of  and  measured their aerobic capacity with treadmill testing and also checked a variety of health parameters including waist circumference heart rate and exercise habits They then determined that those parameters could if plugged into an algorithm provide a very close approximation of someones VOmax  But while fitness age may give you bragging rights about your youthful vigor the real question is whether it is a meaningful measurement in terms of longevity Will having a younger fitness age add years to your life Does an advanced fitness age mean you will die sooner The original Norwegian data did not show any direct correlation between fitness age and a longer life But in a   which was published in June in Medicine  Science in Sports  Exercise the scientists turned to a large trove of data about more than  Norwegian adults who had completed extensive health questionnaires beginning in the s The scientists used the volunteers answers to estimate each persons VOmax and fitness age Then they checked death records It turned out that people whose calculated VOmax was  percent or more below average for their age meaning that their fitness age was significantly above their chronological years  had an  percent higher risk of dying prematurely than those whose fitness age was the same as or more youthful than their actual age According to the studys authors the results suggest that fitness age may predict a persons risk of early death better than some traditional risk factors like being overweight having high cholesterol levels or blood pressure  and smoking Of perhaps even greater immediate interest the scientists used the data from this new study to refine and expand an online calculator for determining fitness age An updated version went live this month    including your age gender waist size and exercise routine before providing you with your current fitness age I discovered my own fitness age is  years younger than my chronological age  a good number but still not as low as I could wish Thankfully fitness age can be altered said Ulrik Wisloff professor at the KG Jebsen Center for Exercise in Medicine at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology who led the study His advice if your fitness age exceeds your chronological years or is not as low as you would like Just exercise Dr Wisloff and his colleagues offer free exercise suggestions    But he said almost any type and amount of exercise should help to increase your VOmax and lower your fitness age potentially increasing your lifespan In upcoming studies he added he and his colleagues will directly compare how well fitness age stacks up against other more established measures of mortality risk like the   which does not include exercise habits among its variables They also hope to expand their studies to include more types of participants since adult Norwegians may not be representative of all of the worlds population But even in advance of this additional data there is no harm in learning and lowering your fitness age Dr Wisloff advised There is a huge benefit he said larger than any known medical treatment in improving your fitness level to what is expected for your age group or even better to above it
