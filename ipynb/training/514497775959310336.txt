We pay our bills by phone We order our groceries by phone Some of us even have sex by phone A new study suggests that for the depressed getting psychotherapy by phone might make sense too The  published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn found that teletherapy encourages more depressed patients to get help for their mental affliction and a course of  sessions was just as effective at improving symptoms as seeing a therapist for the same number of sessions in his or her office But six months after the phone calls stopped the study found that patients who got their psychotherapy in person were doing better at keeping depressive symptoms at bay than were those who got teletherapy The study suggests that teletherapy  little studied but already widely practiced  may be a viable solution for certain depressed patients those for whom a trip to the therapist is either infeasible logistically challenging or so daunting a prospect that its not going to happen Among the studys  depressed subjects who were to receive  sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy by phone significantly fewer dropped out than was the case among the  who were to get therapy facetoface in a psychologists office In all  in the facetoface therapy group stopped coming to sessions while  in the teletherapy group discontinued their participation before  sessions were complete In particular the heavy attrition that psychotherapists tend to observe early in treatment was relatively rare in the group that got its therapy by phone  people dropped out of facetoface treatment in the first two weeks while only seven of those getting teletherapy did These effects may be due to the capacity of telephone delivery to overcome barriers and patient ambivalence toward treatment wrote the studys authors from Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine and the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Pennsylvania The authors appeared to downplay the poorer mental states of teletherapy subjects at six months Though those who got to facetoface appointments might have been more motivated patients sicker patients who are at greater risk for posttreatment deterioration may be the ones who are most likely to stick with teletherapy Clinical psychologist Mary Alvord of Bethesda Md is not so sure The relationship matters said Alvord In an office a therapist not only responds to her patients nonverbal cuesa strained voice a sudden lapse in hygeine an inability to make eye contact she said The therapist also communicates empathy and support in ways that may be hard to convey over the phone The result is the vaunted therapeutic alliance that is widely thought to be central to a patients ability to recast negative thinking and try out new responses to interpretations of lifes challenges You need to have a strong relationship so that people can face their fears said Alvord especially with patients who suffer from anxiety Alvord hailed teletherapy as a promising means to expand access to psychological care for patients who have considered it out of their reach At the same time she said she would prefer to have an established relationship with a person and then use telephone sessions to spread out the duration of therapy But if psychotherapybyphonestill not permitted by many states licensing boardsis to become routine on the American healthcare landscape what should it be called Psychoteletherapy or Telepsychotherapy
