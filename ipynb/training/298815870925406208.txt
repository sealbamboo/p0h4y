 Men who watch  hours of TV a week may have only   as men who watch very little TV a small study suggests On the plus side  hours a week of moderate to vigorous exercise may improve sperm count by as much as  percent the researchers report Guys turn off the TV and put on the running shoes said senior researcher Dr Jorge Chavarro an assistant professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health Adopting a less sedentary lifestyle may have a positive impact on  The report was published online Feb  in the   To measure TVs effect on sperm  young men aged  to  were asked about their TV watching and exercise habits They were also asked about other habits such as smoking and diet and whether they had any reproductive health condition or suffered from stress Men who sat in front of the TV for  hours or more a week had sperm counts  percent lower than men who   the researcher found Although sperm count was lower the sperm were healthy in terms of motility shape and sample volume the study authors noted Men who exercised  or more hours a week also had healthy sperm and more of them This however was only among men whose exercise routine was moderate to vigorous Light exercise didnt affect sperm count the researchers noted The reason why TV was associated with a lower sperm count is unclear and it may be that TV is a signal for other factors The associations of TV watching and physical activity with sperm counts were independent of each other Chavarro said What we cannot rule out entirely is that our finding for TV watching is specific to TV or sedentariness in general Its also not clear whether the TVloving men would have trouble fathering children the researchers said Men in this study had not attempted to have children before so we do not know how their own fertility is influenced by TV watching or physical activity Chavarro said We know from other studies that sperm counts are related to fertility  higher sperm counts are related to higher fertility Men with low sperm counts can still father children although they may have difficulties doing so he said One expert said there are too many factors to consider to say TV is responsible for a lower sperm count Theres an association but it isnt necessarily the cause said Dr Pravin Kumar Rao an assistant professor of urology and director of reproductive medicine and surgery at Johns Hopkins University The results are believable from a physiological standpoint but its difficult to conclude for sure that its TV that lowers sperm count he said Other factors could account for the finding such as whether the men who were TV watchers had other undiagnosed medical conditions that might also affect sperm count like diabetes or high blood pressure Rao said Exercise and a sedentary life style most likely have an effect on fertility but I am not sure if we can quantify how much is due to one factor versus another he said However Rao does have a takeaway message for men I tell my patients the testis prefers to have a very healthy and very stable environment to do its work the best he said which means staying active and eating healthfully Living a healthy lifestyle can help your sperm production Rao said
