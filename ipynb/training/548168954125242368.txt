                  . 
                  . This tempting classic may seem harmless. Still, lurking within each ball can be at least 400 calories of white bread, butter, heavy cream, and sodium-laden beef broth..

                  . 
                  . Step…away…from the eggnog. With ingredients like sugar, eggs, whipping cream, and bourbon, this is a nutritional bullet smart revelers will dodge. One cup has 343 calories, 150 milligrams of cholesterol, half of the USDA's suggested daily limit, and 21 grams of sugar, almost a day's worth. Instead, enjoy spiced cider. And if you're really craving a creamy glass of eggnog, our nog made with unsweetened cocoa powder lightens it up.. 
                  . 
                  . Baked potatoes are rich in vitamin C and fiber, but add in cheese, sour cream, and butter, and you've negated most of the health benefits.

                  . 
                  Lighten up your potatoes by using low-fat dairy products or adding low-cal veggies like onions and spinach. Or, you can roast sweet potatoes in the oven instead; each has less than half of the calories and only 2.4 grams of total fat..

                  .

One 3-ounce serving of traditional beef pot roast has 280 calories and 20 grams of total fat. But think about how many ounces you're actually adding to your plate, plus the calories from gravy.

                  . Don't let the name deceive you. Though this sweet treat contains fruit, it can also have plenty of butter, sugar, and corn syrup. One slice we tried clocks in at 410 calories and 13 grams of fat.. 
                  . 
                  You'd actually be better off enjoying a slice of pumpkin pie, which contains about 250 calories per slice as well as beta-carotene. Or, bake this lighter loaf with grits, bananas, and blueberries; it has only 145 calories per slice.. 
                  . 
                  . On their own pecans are a high-cal nut, but combine them with sugar, butter, and corn syrup, and you've got a potentially deadly dessert. A single slice will cost you more than 500 calories, 37 grams of fat, and 26 grams of sugar. Still, there's no reason to skip dessert—try baking something lighter instead. This apple pie has less than a quarter of the fat per slice. And you're getting additional fiber from the apples as a bonus..

                  . 
                  . Packed with vitamins and fiber, sweet potatoes are a superfood. However, candied yams are a different story. Though the savory starch is the main component of this side dish, common recipes tell you to add up to six cups of sugar before you start baking, racking up a total of 38 grams per serving. The American Heart Association suggests that added sugar intake be limited to 25 grams per day for women and 37 grams per day for men. The side also tacks on over 400 calories to your plate.. 
                  .

                  . Cranberries are a great source of vitamin E, K, and C, and dietary fiber. Still, pay close attention at the dinner table during the holidays.

                  .

                  . Any pudding that requires flour, salt, and melted beef fat can't be good for your health, but this old-school side dish has been around since the 1700s. It was originally created to make use of the fat that dropped into the dripping pan while meat roasted. One serving has about 625 calories and 37 grams of total fat, over half of your upper limit for the entire day.. 
                  . 
                  If you must include this battered pudding in your holiday dinner plans, our lighter version has only 131 calories and 4 grams of fat per serving.. 
                  . 
                  . The name of this popular appetizer can easily be misleading to the average partygoer. Spinach and artichokes alone are nutritious. However, generous amounts of mayonnaise, sour cream, and cream cheese overpower the vitamin-packed veggies. One popular restaurant's spinach and artichoke dip with tostada chips has 905 calories and 3,100 milligrams of sodium, over 1,000 more milligrams than the USDA recommends!. 
                  .

                  . Prime rib is a beloved cut of beef, especially during the holidays. Still, it happens to come from the fattest part of the cow. One piece of prime rib can house up to 750 calories and 45 grams of fat, without the added sauce or seasoning! Plus, 8 ounces has 450 milligrams of cholesterol, 100 mg more than the USDA recommends for men and women to consume per day.. 
                  . 
                  If you're a steak lover, there are other cuts to choose from that are just as appetizing if cooked properly. Beef tenderloin has one-fourth the calories. This dish is made with port-mushroom sauce; it has 22 grams of fat and only 93 mg of cholesterol.. 
                  . 
                  . Think twice before stuffing your face with this ominous mixture. It could be harboring a ton of unhealthy foods. One recipe uses a pound of sweet Italian sausage, a stick of butter, a cup of toasted pecans, and maple syrup. Generic sausage stuffing has 345 calories, 235 from fat, setting you back about 26 grams of fat altogether.. 
                  . 
                  But as with many holiday meals, there are healthy alternatives, such as our stuffing made with cornbread and cranberries, with only 9 grams of total fat..

                  . In general, turkey has more lean meat compared to other entree selections, but be careful when choosing which part of the bird you want to eat.

                  . 
                  Though dark meat contains more iron, you'll get about the same amount of protein. So ditch the skin and opt for white meat! Our recipe uses turkey breast and spinach-feta stuffing and is a healthy and festive alternative.. 
                  . 
                  . Green beans are a hearty vegetable, boasting dietary fiber and vitamins A and C. Still, this casserole is far from wholesome. Butter, cheese, salt, and fried onions take away from the health perks of the beans. One full batch has 785 calories and 4,128 milligrams of sodium. You probably won't take the entire dish for yourself, but it's still important to watch your portion size.. 
                  . 
                  For a comparable savor with fewer calories and less salt, make this casserole. Broccoli and water chestnuts give the dish a refreshing crunch.. 
                  . 
                  . They are so light and fluffy we think croissants are low in fat and calories—perfect for a holiday brunch! But what makes them so mouth-watering? Sugar, salt, and butter between each and every layer of flour dough. A butter croissant from Starbucks has 310 calories and 18 grams of total fat. This pastry isn't as bad as a box of donuts, but it has almost no nutritional value.. 
                  . 
                  When serving breakfast to houseguests during the holidays, offer healthier choices that are even tastier, like these pancakes made with maple yogurt. Ingredients like rolled oats, blueberries, and Greek yogurt supply fiber, antioxidants, and protein.. 
                  . 
                  . Even though potato pancakes are a well-liked holiday substitute for mashed potatoes, they're battered with egg, flour, and breadcrumbs, and then fried in oil. This method makes them crisp and golden brown, but also rather unhealthy. An average pancake has over 200 calories and 11 grams of fat, plus extra saturated fat from cooking oil. And who can stop with just one?. 
                  . 
                  To lighten up your cakes, use modest amounts of egg whites, breadcrumbs, and olive oil. Our potato cakes have only 80 calories and less than a gram of fat!.

                  . Sipping a warm cocktail by the fire on a cold winter evening sounds enticing. However, the calorie count may scare you away: One cup of hot buttered rum has over 300 calories and 13 grams of fat—not to mention tons of added melted butter and sugar. The dangerous concoction also has 40 milligrams of cholesterol, one-seventh of the USDA's recommended daily intake in just one drink!. 
                  . 
                  It's tough to reduce the count when rum is involved. Still, there are slightly healthier versions like our spicy rum punch. You're still taking in 200 calories, but no fat or cholesterol.. 
                  . 
                  . This classic entree is beyond decadent. Lobster is healthy seafood, but the sauce is the dish's downfall. Flour, butter, and milk create a thick and creamy puree that should be avoided at all costs. One small cup is worth 605 calories and 49 grams of fat. Nearly enough fat for an entire day, according to USDA recommendations.. 
                  . 
                  If you prepare lobster for your family during the holiday season, go for lighter recipes like this lobster panzanella made with fresh lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil.

                  . With primary ingredients like chocolate, heavy cream, butter, and sponge cake, a slice of Yule log can account for half a day's worth of calories.

One serving of Betty Crocker's Bûche de Noël boasts 420 calories and 47 grams of sugar—almost double the amount the American Heart Association's recommends eating per day.. 
                  . 
                  Looking for a lighter selection? Save over 100 calories by picking up a piece of this cranberry upside-down cake instead..

                  . 
                  Enjoy the same warmth and sweetness when drinking this hot chocolate—a lighter homemade version with only 194 calories and little added sugar.. 
                  . 
                  . Making caramel apples can be an entertaining holiday activity, and they are enjoyable to eat too. However, the caramel sauce is pure sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, melted with a bit of milk. Though apples are high in vitamins and dietary fiber, the treat packs about 320 calories, 16 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar (more than the AHA-recommended 25 grams per day).. 
                  . 
                  There's no healthy equivalent (because apple slices with peanut butter just isn't the same), but limit the amount of sauce on each apple and watch your portions. Or, forget the sauce and drizzle some fat-free caramel sundae syrup on top.. Gingerbread people and houses may look inviting with their smiles made of frosting and gumdrop decor, but don't be fooled! They're packing plenty of calories. Gingerbread cake is even worse, with large quantities of buttermilk, flour, and sugar. One small piece of cake has 260 calories, 36 carbs, and 12 grams of fat.. 
                  . 
                  Stick with small cookies—you can still shape them into people! And use light icing to decorate. Most gingerbread is rich in fiber too!.

                  . Santa's health may be in jeopardy if you feed him too many sugar cookies this Christmas. The classic recipe is pretty simple, but the amount of all-purpose flour, butter, and egg used is unnecessary. An average cookie can contain over 200 calories and 14 grams of sugar.. 
                  . 
                  For a healthier batch, use egg whites and less butter to keep saturated fat and cholesterol low, and a touch of whole-wheat flour to add fiber.. 
                  . 
                  . Often referred to as Christmas pudding, this dessert is dangerously heavy. Not only does the traditional recipe ask you to put molasses, brandy, and candied fruit in the batter, the concoction is also baked in a greased and sugared pudding mold. Recipes estimate that one serving of plum pudding contains about 360 calories, 15 grams of fat, and 30 grams of sugar (5 grams more than your daily upper limit).. 
                  .

                  . There's no way to avoid the fact that candy canes are pure sugar and vinegar. They're only 60 calories apiece but don't offer any nourishment. Rather than making them a mid-afternoon snack in the month of December, use the canes as Christmas-tree decorations..
