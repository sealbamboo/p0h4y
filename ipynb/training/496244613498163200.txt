The NHS in England has been ordered to prioritise patients who have endured long waits for routine treatment Ministers want to see more than  procedures carried out during the summer on those who have waited longer than  weeks  the official target There are nearly  in that situation   of which have been waiting for more than half a year and over  for more than a year Those who have waited longest will be prioritised for treatment But ministers conceded it may mean performance against the waiting time target slipping in what they said would be a managed breach  They said the patients who have waited the longest tend to be the most complex and difficult to treat The NHS is meant to see  of patients who need nonemergency operations such as knee and hip replacements within  weeks The target was missed marginally in February and March but has been met by and large since it was introduced in  However the Department of Health said it was likely to be missed for a few months while the patients with the longest waits were dealt with It said the situation would return to normal by the end of the year Those who have been waiting the longest are sometimes called the hidden list That is because as the NHS is judged against the week target there is less incentive to treat patients once the mark has been passed However the numbers facing long waits has been falling after it was first identified as an issue in  Those waiting more than  weeks topped  in May  but had dropped to  in May this year the latest month for which the data is available But now ministers want the NHS to make another push to treat those who have been waiting for a year  unless it is clinically necessary Hospitals have already been given an extra m earlier this year  and that will now be used to fund these extra procedures Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Noone  except in exceptional circumstances  should have to wait for more than a year We need targets that help patients get treatment when they need it  not targets followed blindly with no regard for the impact on individuals But Dr Mark Porter of the British Medical Association said It is right to prioritise patients who have had to wait the longest for treatment but this announcement tries to wash over the fact that more patients will have to wait longer for an operation because the government in effect is having to ration care  This is yet more evidence that the NHS is buckling under extreme pressure and that patient care is being compromised
