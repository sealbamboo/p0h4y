Traditional Chinese medicine is gaining acceptance in the US though still largely as a complementary treatment Mainstream doctors are mixed on its effectiveness Still as alternative treatments gain traction and the demand for Chinese herbs grows farmers in Appalachia are responding The Blue Ridge Center for Chinese Medicine in Pilot Va is surrounded by miles of mountains forests and farmland Outside the building small plots of Chinese medicinal herbs grow on terraced slopes A lot of these herbs we are going to let flower and be pollinated and grow for the seed because there is such a need for the seed says David Grimsley codirector of the Appalachian Medicinal Herb Growers Consortium a new project based at the center that teaches others how to grow native Chinese herbs in Appalachia At the Appalachian Medicinal Herb Growers Consortium the goal is to raise plants that meet the quality standards demanded by clinical practitioners In what looks like a wellorganized kitchen rows of shelves stack to the ceiling lined with neatly labeled glass canisters filled with dried roots leaves and flowers Grimsley pulls one down and opens the lid This is   he says We go by their Latin name as opposed to their Chinese Pinyin medicinal name because were farmers working with the herbs themselves and not the medicine This is a perennial melon And one wonderful thing about it is the skin is used the seeds are used the fruit is used and the root is used and theyre all for something different Practitioners must be certified by the state and not all states allow it But growers see an increase in demand The renowned Cleveland Clinic opened the Chinese Herbal Therapy Clinic in January one of the first herbal clinics inside a hospital in the country Director Jamie Starkey like most practitioners buys her herbs from China but she says shed like to see highquality medicinal herbs grown in the US If the United States farmers can tap into growing Chinese herbs but do it in a way where theres proper testing by third parties theyre able to identify the herbs properly theres no contamination no pesticides you know I think its such a great opportunity Starkey says Jean Giblette a longtime grower who has studied the market says  licensed practitioners work in the US She estimates the market to be  million to  million a year Thats a conservative estimate because once theyre presented with fresh domestically grown herbs I think its actually going to change practitioner behavior Giblette says Its going to encourage people who may be relying on manufactured products  to go back to the traditional agricultural products Many herbalists say the most effective way to use medicinal herbs is to boil them twice then discard them and drink the tea  a process known as decoction Its exactly the way people in Appalachia have taken wild indigenous herbs for decades This area of the Appalachians corresponds very nicely to the medicine belt in China where a lot of the Chinese herbs are endemic  they grow naturally in the wild  so were very excited to become a medicinal hub for Chinese herbs Giblette says Since the project began in the spring the Appalachian Medicinal Herb Growers Consortium has helped plant nine farms in the area Grimsley says  more are on the way
