This week in Seattle Bill and Melinda Gates are attending a meeting of the minds Five hundred of the worlds top innovators in global health have gathered for the   an annual event in which scientists engineers policymakers and activists work to develop new tools for fighting diseases Since the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation began in  the nonprofit has invested a lot of money in education in the US But even more money has gone toward ending diseases in developing countries Last year the foundation dedicated   to eradicate polio worldwide NPRs   host David Greene recently spoke with Gates about why he and his wife have chosen to focus their efforts abroad and less here at home  and whether he thinks the world is still on track for eradicating polio by  We note that the Gates Foundation supports NPR programming And the interview has been edited for length and clarity Our view on health is that we have a lot of interventions where were saving lives for less than  per life saved By making sure new vaccines are invented making sure they get out to all the kids on the planet were taking diarrheal deaths pneumonia deaths and bringing those down pretty dramatically Any country where we can save a life for a few thousand dollars well do it It turns out the place you can do that  really make dramatic reductions in the number of children who die  is the really poor countries I was stunned when I found out that malaria when we got started in  was killing a million children a year most of thats in Africa Way back in  we gave a  million grant and we became one of the largest funders in the area It was stunning to me that a problem of such magnitude wasnt getting huge focus  For Africa to move forward youve really got to get rid of malaria Those Nobel Prizes were given a long time ago The thing thats magical now is that were able to look at the malaria genetics and understand how its spreading  Its fair to say that there have been failures in the past The year I was born  the first big diseaseeradication program in the world was declared for malaria After about a decade of work they realized that at least in the tropical areas they did not have the tools to get it done Were going to have to be a lot smarter this time Were able to model the disease dynamics in a way that wasnt possible before We actually have a   now Its not a percenteffective vaccine But that looks like it will be a very helpful tool I dont think thats likely to happen We want to be realistic But people do care a lot about malaria They see their children dying They see the effects of cerebral malaria even on kids that survive So I dont think this is one where well run into much resistance too much apathy This is a big killer Development is a series of things If you could only pick one thing I think you would pick health because its so catalytic But then education good governance infrastructure  all of those things are part of the magic things that have allowed countries like China Brazil Thailand Mexico to become middleincome So now we can focus on the remaining countries the lowincome countries and have a goal that within  years the number of people living in extreme poverty could get close to zero Polio eradication is our top priority And things are looking pretty good in Nigeria Weve had only one case this year which is way down from last year We have an outbreak that started in   that has spread to some surrounding countries We think well be able to deal with that outbreak In Pakistan we still have an area that the Taliban is not letting in vaccinators and in fact violence against vaccinators continues there  Were still very committed to the eradication  still seems achievable But were going to have to get a bit of political change in Pakistan and were going to have to continue to do very good work in Nigeria
