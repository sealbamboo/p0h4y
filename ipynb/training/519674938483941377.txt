Business groups and Republicans lost their bid to get the Labor Department to suspend a rule that will extend minimum-wage and overtime pay to home health-care workers, but the agency said it won’t enforce the measure for the first six months after the Jan. 1 effective date.. Some worker-advocacy groups and Democrats applauded the department’s decision to move forward with the rule, calling it a balanced approach. Congressional Republicans and others who wanted a suspension said the department’s solution is unworkable.
