The discovery of an ancient bone at a burial site in Kenya puts the origin of human hand dexterity more than half a million years earlier than previously thought  In all ways the bone  a wellpreserved metacarpal that connects to the middle finger  resembles that of modern man   journal reports It is the earliest fossilised evidence of when humans developed a strong enough grip to start using tools   Apes lack the same anatomical features The  millionyearold metacarpal from an ancient hominin displays a styloid process a distinctively human morphological feature associated with enhanced hand function  Its discovery provides evidence for the evolution of the modern human hand more than  years earlier than previously documented and probably in the times of the genus   The styloid process helps the hand bone lock into the wrist bones allowing for greater amounts of pressure to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers Prof Carol Ward and her colleagues note that a lack of the styloid process created challenges for apes and earlier humans when they attempted to make and use tools  This lack of a styloid process may have increased the chances of having arthritis earlier Prof Ward professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the University of Missouri Columbia said The styloid process reflects an increased dexterity that allowed early human species to use powerful yet precise grips when manipulating objects  This was something that their predecessors couldnt do as well due to the lack of this styloid process and its associated anatomy With this discovery we are closing the gap on the evolutionary history of the human hand This may not be the first appearance of the modern human hand but we believe that it is close to the origin given that we do not see this anatomy in any human fossils older than  million years  Our specialised dexterous hands have been with us for most of the evolutionary history of our genus Homo They are  and have been for almost  million years  fundamental to our survival she said The bone was found at the Kaitio site in West Turkana near an area where the earliest Acheulian tools have appeared Acheulian tools are ancient shaped stone tools that include stone hand axes more than  million years old
