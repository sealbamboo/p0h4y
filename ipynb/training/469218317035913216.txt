Most women who get both breasts removed to prevent breast cancer dont need to do it and are often motivated by fear researchers reported Wednesday They found that  percent of women who had a healthy breast removed after getting cancer diagnosed in the other one had a very low risk of getting a tumor in that healthy breast And its not a matter of ignorance says Sarah Hawley of the University of Michigan Medical School Ann Arbor who led the study I think a lot of patients will say they did feel informed but that this was their choice Hawley told NBC News Its hard to live with fear or worry Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies by an estimated  percent in recent years experts say The surgeries have been touted by highprofile celebrities including   and Christina Applegate And surveys show women who opt for the procedure are happy with the decision But many doctors are puzzled because its major surgery it doesnt reduce the risk of cancer completely and women have other options from a onceaday pill to careful monitoring Women can take tamoxifen or one of several newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors and reduce their risk by as much as  percent And even if the cancer isnt prevented survival rates for breast cancer are  percent if its caught at the earliest stages and  percent at stage  Yet the rates continue to rise of women opting to go ahead and get both breasts removed at once Hawleys team studied  women who had been treated for breast cancer and who had not had it come back in the following four years Eight percent of the women had a double mastectomy and  percent had considered having one they reported in the Journal of the American Medical Associations JAMA Surgery The study is an update of preliminary resultsHawley released in  and supports the initial findings that most of the women did not need this extensive surgery More than twothirds   percent  of the women who had both breasts removed had no major genetic or family risk factors Hawley said Surgeons are not to blame Hawley says Surgeons are for the most part trying to discourage patients from having this procedure and patients are the ones requesting it Hawley said I have had surgeons tell me that patients will tell them if they are not going to do the procedure they will find a surgeon that will do it she added Every surgeon I have talked to has agreed I would much rather not be doing a double mastectomy in a patient who has no clinical indication Insurers may sometimes opt to pay for the extra surgery because it is part of the cancer diagnosis Hawley said But its hard to get a picture of how many insurance companies will pay for the surgery and how many women are paying out of pocket Women may want to feel in control of their treatment Hawley says And they may frankly be influenced by the highprofile celebrity announcements about having such surgery  even if the celebrities were good candidates for a bilateral mastectomy like Jolie who has an extremely high genetic risk for breast and ovarian cancer I cant imagine that it doesnt have an influence It is taking a procedure and making it seem really legitimate Hawley said Still patients should be more thoroughly educated argue Shoshana Rosenberg and Dr Ann Partridge of the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston Not only should pros and cons of different treatment options be communicated but there needs to be consideration of the patients personal circumstances and perceptions all the while addressing anxiety and concerns about breast cancer recurrence and new primary disease and the distinction between the two they wrote in a commentary Support groups may be the way to go Hawley suggests  perhaps helping women encourage one another to face the fear and go without the surgery
