Gout is traditionally associated with portquaffing Victorian gentlemen of excess and the obese Henry VIII But for those who bear no resemblance to either its no laughing matter Ah yes said the GP Its probably gout I almost burst out laughing Gout Isnt that something that affects ageing soaks  redfaced Dickensian gluttons paying the price for years of uncompromising excess Apparently not Well not always Certainly I can be redfaced at times and Ill never fit comfortably into Mick Jaggers trousers but I also go jogging on a fairly regular basis eat a fairly balanced diet dont smoke and indulge in alcohol much less than the average bloke bumping up to their sixth decade In fact I had gone to the doctor thinking that the cause of my discomfort was something much more glamorous  a stress fracture of the metatarsal caused by playing too much tennis Sometimes it is nothing to do with a poor lifestyle the GP continued It can just be down to a poor metabolism it can just be bad luck I wasnt convinced and got him to agree to send me for an Xray which revealed that I was wrong about the stress fracture But bad luck it was and extremely painful bad luck at that Gout has been described anecdotally at least as male childbirth Certainly the night before I went to my doctor was a long one  even the pressure of resting my foot on the bed sheets was too much to bear I tried every last sleeping position I could think of Finally I got some fitful sleep by sleeping halfway down the bed with my feet dangling in midair Being diagnosed with gout is  to judge by the responses of those who dont have it  one of the few bona fide comedy conditions that a human can still develop Most people dont make light of cancer or have a store of wisecracks about heart disease on the tip of their tongue Gout though is a different matter I received a rather thoughtful text from my boss after I sent in a message explaining my absence from work Sorry to hear about your medical problem it read Then a couple of painful twinges later a follow up Does it involve any amputations Back at work another colleague expressed amazement that I should have developed the condition Isnt that something that only affects old miserable blokes The thing is its not really very funny Apart from the obvious discomfort there are medical studies to suggest that gout alone is a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes The classic symptom of gout is pain and swelling in the joints It often affects the big toe but can affect larger joints such as the knee and is caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joint Uric acid is a waste product which is formed when the body breaks down chemicals in its cells known as purines It is usually removed from your system via the kidneys but people with gout cannot do this efficiently and thats when the crystals start to form Despite its th Century image gout is on the increase A study found that the number of hospital admissions for the condition increased  per year throughout the noughties It should be controllable with drugs and drinking water helps but apparently depression can be a risk for people with gout often because of the restricted movement they have during an attack More depressing for me was the list of goodies I ought to avoid thrown up by even the most cursory surf of the web  red meat asparagus spinach and mushrooms for a start And drowning my sorrows was out Beer and whisky were high on the proscribed list of banned treats Then there is the raised risk of kidney stones which I am told can also be as painful as giving birth  there seems to be a developing riff here For those of you still tempted to dismiss gout as a good reason to have a giggle Ill leave the final  somewhat jaundiced  word to a contributor who posted a comment at the bottom of an online newspaper article about the rise in cases Gout is the final metabolic warning that the hooded man with the sickle is coming to get you
