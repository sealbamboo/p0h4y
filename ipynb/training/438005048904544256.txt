The yearly pediatricians visit can seem like the same old thing height weight shots But the rules for well child visits are changing and the nations pediatricians want to make sure that parents and doctors are up to speed on the changes Children should get a cholesterol test between the ages of  and  according to   published Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics Teenagers should get tests for HIV the virus that causes AIDS between  and  And newborns need to have their blood oxygen levels checked before they leave the hospital to make sure they dont have a hidden heart defect that could cause big trouble later on To find out more about these and other changes we talked to   the chairman of the committee that wrote the new recommendations and a pediatrician at Nemours duPont Pediatrics in Wilmington Del Heres an edited version of our conversation Previously we looked at screening after age  if there was a family history or other risk factors but you had to ask those questions Back in  the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute put together these recommendations that every kid in the to age group regardless of risk should get their cholesterol done The goal is to identify risk factors early on so we reduce their heart disease risk as adults This reflects the current science and recommendations But people havent known this which means that kids arent being routinely checked It has nothing to do with whether your kids are obese or not Usually we recommend lifestyle changes and watching diet Theres a small percentage of kids whose cholesterol is just through the roof Its not that theyre overweight genetically they have this condition The threshold for putting kids on medication like statins is actually pretty high Were giving pediatricians tools for screening for substance abuse risk and for depression Instead of trying to fumble through an interview to see if a child is depressed heres a validated tool with questions to ask You can do it in  to  seconds and then focus on what the adolescent really needs instead of talking about baseball or how things are going at school You can cover whats really important for that patient right then and there We decided on the range of  to  based on where you are Because of local privacy laws sometimes you cant give results confidentially to patients under  Or the lab test shows up on the parents bill In some cases confidentiality may be really important to the patient Make sure your children have regular preventive visits Sometimes with the older kids its like Oh well well come in when they need a tetanus booster or when they need a form filled out for sports Theres really a lot more going on in a preventive visit The goal is to intervene before things get to a crisis point We found that for adults retail clinics are not a bad recourse but there wasnt data on outcomes for pediatric patients Whats concerning is that were seeing all these ads Get your sports physical done for  bucks  bucks Were finding that parents are using that instead of the visit when they get all the preventive services Its OK to go to Jiffy Lube to get your oil changed but you dont want to get your timing belt changed there Its not the same as a full tuneup Its not a replacement for the medical home We do think that children need access to care when theyre sick If the retail clinic is the best option and the least expensive thats much better than going to the emergency room Those visits should be communicated back to the pediatrician so if there are problems we can follow up We really want to have these groups reach out and be collaborative so were all operating in the best interests of the child
