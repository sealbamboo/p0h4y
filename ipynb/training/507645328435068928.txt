In the bestcase scenario it will take at least six to nine months to bring the current Ebola outbreak under control During those months at least  more people may be infected and half will likely die Thats the projection from   the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization If we are going to go to war with Ebola we do need resources Chan told NPRs David Greene during an   Thursday on   An empty war chest is not going to do it The organization is hoping to raise  million from donor countries to fight the outbreak in West Africa where the number of Ebola cases has already surpassed  and the death toll is inching toward  But the aid groups need more than just money They need what Chan calls medical troops and weapons And thats not just doctors and nurses but also more protective gear and burial teams to carry out safe and respectful burial of the dead From past experiences she says it takes  to  health care workers to take care of only  Ebola patients And aid organizations such as Doctors Without Borders are already   Were talking about recruiting thousands of health care workers she says So clearly we cannot expect to deploy them from the international community Most of them have to come from the local communities But Liberia and Sierra Leone where the outbreak is spiraling out of control only recently came out of civil wars So their health care systems are rudimentary at best Chan says Two doctors take care of  people she says This is the kind of situation were dealing with Plus health care workers who have already joined the fight havent been getting paid by their governments for the work theyve done prompting many to go on strike Money is a huge part of the problem says   who is leading the UNs efforts against the outbreak They have been promised additional hazard pay to enable them to keep working despite the dangers associated with Ebola and the money hasnt been getting through Nabarro is confident however that the work theyve been doing to find more funding and explore alternative ways to pay the workers will help overcome that problem Well see doctors and nurses working in the very very near future he says Addressing recent criticisms that WHO was slow to help with the outbreak Chan says that given the limits the organization has already acted faster than they normally would The unprecedented outbreak has caught everyone off guard she says and its still full of uncertainty We dont understand why the virus is spreading so quickly she says We all underestimated the complexity of the outbreak  how this would play out in a country where it has very little capacity But shes still optimistic the outbreak can be stopped I have learned  after over  years in managing crises Chan says you need to have a sense of hope and optimism  and take fast action
