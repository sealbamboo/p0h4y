Americans seem to think that every health problem can be solved with a pill And certainly many are especially infectious diseases that succumb to antibiotics antifungals and increasingly antivirals But that leaves a medical dictionary full of ailments that continue to plague people despite the best efforts of Big Pharma Most are chronic health problems related to how Americans live especially what we eat and drink and dont eat and drink and how we move or dont move In our aging society these ailments have pushed the annual cost of medical care into the trillions of dollars and threaten to break Medicare Osteoporosis is one of these increasingly prevalent and costly conditions Although there are drugs to stanch the loss of bone and the debilitating fractures that often result the remedies are costly difficult to administer and sometimes have side effects that can be worse than the disease they are meant to counter This makes prevention the preferred and more costeffective option But efforts to prevent bone disease have focused on a pill namely supplements of calcium the mineral responsible for creating bone in youth that must be maintained throughout adult life which now routinely extends to the s and s But as with many other pills once regarded as innocuous the safety and efficacy of calcium supplements in preventing bone loss is being called into question In February the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended that postmenopausal women refrain from taking supplemental calcium and vitamin D After reviewing more than  studies the task force said  Moreover several studies have linked calcium supplements to an increased risk of heart attacks and death from cardiovascular disease Others have found no effect depending on the population studied and when calcium supplementation was begun The resulting controversy has left countless people especially postmenopausal women wondering whether they should be taking calcium Given the conditional evidence currently available the answer is not likely to be greeted enthusiastically by anyone other than dairy farmers who supply the foods and drinks that are the countrys richest dietary sources of calcium The one indisputable fact is that the safest and probably the most effective source of calcium for strong bones and overall health is diet not supplements But few American adults and a decreasing proportion of children and teenagers consume enough dairy foods to get the recommended intakes of this essential mineral Milk consumption has taken a steady nosedive in the last four decades largely supplanted by sugared soft drinks that are now under fire as major contributors to obesity and Type  diabetes Beyond age  when bone loss can begin to overtake bone formation the typical man and woman in this country consumes less than one cup of milk a day Likewise for teenage girls who should be striving to maximize bone formation so that there is more in reserve when bone loss begins Yogurt which ounce for ounce is an even better source of calcium than fluid milk has achieved unprecedented popularity in recent years but few consume it more than once a day which doesnt come close to meeting dietary needs Frozen yogurt which threatens to supplant ice cream as the nations most popular frozen dessert has about half the amount of calcium as regular yogurt and only slightly more than ice cream Both are far more caloric than nonfat milk The only other   are tofu when prepared with calcium calciumfortified orange juice soy milk and rice milk canned salmon and sardines but only if you eat the bones almonds kale and broccoli But few people consume enough of these foods to obtain the calcium they need Calcium was long thought to protect the cardiovascular system It helps to lower blood pressure and the risk of hypertension a major contributor to heart disease The Iowa Womens Health Study linked higher calcium intakes in postmenopausal women to a reduced risk of heart disease deaths though other longterm studies did not find such an association Controversy over calcium supplements arose when a combined analysis of  studies by Dr Mark J Bolland of the University of Auckland found that when calcium was taken without vitamin D which enhances calcium absorption  Dr Bolland then reanalyzed data from the Womens Health Initiative and found a   In this case the increased risk occurred only among those women assigned to take supplemental calcium who had not already been taking it when the study began Yet last December in a report published online in Osteoporosis International a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle reported that among  postmenopausal women participating in the Womens Health Initiative those taking  milligram supplements of calcium and  international units of vitamin D experienced a   In February yet another study published online in JAMA Internal Medicine found that among  men and women initially aged  to  and followed for an average of  years supplemental calcium   by  percent among men  but not women The increased risk was observed only among smokers Adding to these confusing results is the fact that none of the studies was specifically designed to assess the effects of calcium supplements on the chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke This can cause unexpected aberrations in research findings One possible explanation for a link the JAMA researchers said is that a bolus of calcium that enters the blood stream through a supplement but not gradually through dietary sources can result in calcium deposits in arteries Indeed this is a known complication among patients with advanced kidney disease who take calcium supplements All the researchers agree that given the widespread use of supplemental calcium better studies are needed to clarify possible risks and benefits and to whom they may apply Until such information is available consumers seeking to preserve their bones would be wise to rely primarily on dietary sources of the mineral and to pursue regular weightbearing or strengthbuilding exercises or both Walking running weight lifting and working out on resistance machines is unquestionably effective and safe for most adults if done properly Furthermore the National Osteoporosis Foundation maintains that the findings of current studies and advice about supplements should not apply to women with osteoporosis or broken bones after age  or those with significant risk factors for fracture For them the benefits of calcium supplements are likely to far outweigh any risks
