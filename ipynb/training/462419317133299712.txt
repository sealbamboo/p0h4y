I love my health insurance company because it's full of fun surprises. In the most recent episode, it finally reimbursed me for a big claim I filed 14 months ago. Then, a week after I cashed the check, it sent a follow-up letter from the audit department demanding the money back. Then it sent another check. Then it sent another repayment demand. Then it sent a third check. Thenâ€”you guessed it. This is better than "Cats.". Never mind the squabbles over Obamacare, what health insurance companies really have a knack...
