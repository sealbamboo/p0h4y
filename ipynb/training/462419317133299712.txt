I love my health insurance company because its full of fun surprises In the most recent episode it finally reimbursed me for a big claim I filed  months ago Then a week after I cashed the check it sent a followup letter from the audit department demanding the money back Then it sent another check Then it sent another repayment demand Then it sent a third check Thenyou guessed it This is better than Cats Never mind the squabbles over Obamacare what health insurance companies really have a knack
