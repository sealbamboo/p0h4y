WASHINGTONÂ   Sarah Ball was a yearold high school sophomore at Hernando High School in Brooksville Fla when a friend posted on Facebook I hate Sarah Ball and I dont care who knows Then there was the Facebook group Hernando Haters asking to rate her attractiveness plus an anonymous email calling her a waste of space And this text arrived on her th birthday Wow youre still alive Impressive Well happy birthday anyway  It wasnt until Sarahs mom who had access to her daughters online passwords saw the messages that the girl told her everything  More young people are reaching out to family members after being harassed or taunted online and its helping A poll released Thursday by The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found incidents of digital abuse are still prevalent but declining somewhat It found a growing awareness among teenagers and young adults about harm from online meanness and cyberbullying as well as a slight increase among those willing to tell a parent or sibling  It was actually quite embarrassing to be honest remembers Ball now an yearold college freshman But really truly if it wasnt for my parents I dont think Id be where Im at today  The surveys findings come a week after two Florida girls ages  and  were arrested on felony charges for allegedly bullying online a yearold girl who later killed herself by jumping off a tower at an abandoned concrete plant  The APNORCMTV poll found that some  percent of young people ages  through  in the US said they have had at least one brush with some kind of electronic harassment down from about  percent in  Of those who have encountered an incident  percent went to a parent compared with  percent just two years ago And  percent  up from  percent in   asked a brother or sister for help  I feel like were making progress said Sameer Hinduja codirector of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor at Florida Atlantic University People should be encouraged  When asked what helped  percent of those encountering digital abuse responded that they changed their email address screen name or cell number and it helped while  percent who talked to a parent said it helped too Less than onethird of respondents who retaliated found that helpful while just as many said it had no effect and  percent said getting revenge actually made the problem worse  Girls were more likely than boys to be the targets of online meanness  but they also were more likely to talk to reach out for help  The poll also indicated that young people are becoming more aware of the impact of cyberbullying Some  percent up from  percent in  said online abuse was a problem that society should address Those who think it should be accepted as a part of life declined from  percent to  percent  Hinduja credits school programs that are making it cool to care about others and increased awareness among adults who can help teens talk through their options such as deactivating an account or going to school administrators for help in removing hurtful postings  That was the case for Ball whose parents encouraged her to fight back by speaking up They said this is my ticket to helping other people she said  With their help Ball sent copies of the abusive emails texts and Facebook pages to school authorities news outlets and politicians and organized an antibullying rally She still maintains a Facebook site called Hernando Unbreakable and she mentors local kids identified by the schools as victims of cyberbullying She said she thinks if other teens are reaching out more for help its as a last resort because so many kids fear making it worse That was one reason Jennifer Tinsley  said she didnt tell her parents in the eighth grade when another student used Facebook to threaten to stab and beat her I didnt want them to worry about me Tinsley now a college student in Fort Wayne Ind said of her family There was a lot of stress at that time  And I just didnt want the extra attention According to the Cyberbullying Research Center every state but Montana has enacted antibullying laws many of which address cyberbullying specifically Most state laws are focused on allowing school districts to punish offenders In Florida for example the state Legislature this year passed a provision allowing schools to discipline students harassing others off campus In Floridas recent cyberbullying case the police took the unusual step of   with thirddegree felony aggravated stalking Even if convicted however the girls were not expected to spend time in juvenile detention because they didnt have criminal histories The APNORC CenterMTV poll was conducted online Sept  through Oct  among a random national sample of  people between the ages of  and  Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus  percentage points Funding for the study was provided by MTV as part of its campaign to stop digital abuse A Thin Line  The survey was conducted by the GfK Group using KnowledgePanel a probabilitybased online panel Respondents were recruited randomly using traditional telephone and mail sampling methods People selected who had no Internet access were given it for free
