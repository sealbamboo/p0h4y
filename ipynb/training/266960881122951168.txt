With most Americans fat or fatter youd think wed be lightening up on the antifat attitudes Alas no Even doctors often think their overweight patients are weakwilled But changing negative attitudes about body size might be as simple as changing what you see When women in England were shown photos of plussized women in neutral gray leotards they became more tolerant When the women were shown photos of anorexic women attitudes became more positive there too Showing them thin bodies makes them like thin bodies more and showing them fat bodies makes them like fat bodies more says   a psychology researcher at Durham University in England who led the study She calls it a visual diet changing what your eyes eat Why the unflattering leotards Boothroyd and her colleagues wanted neutral clothing to sever the link between thinness and success thats so strong in Western cultures The researchers also tested photos of women in designer clothes and found the test subjects thought better of the welldressed women fat or thin The glamour effect existed independent of the change in perception caused by repeatedly seeing the leotardclad women All the study participants still preferred thinnerthanaverage bodies but their preferences did move up or down depending on what they saw Perhaps thats why were so obsessed with thinness even if most of the people around us are found to be larger Were constantly fed images of very slim actresses and models all beautifully dressed All you have to do is watch five minutes of TV and you see more thin bodies than you would all day on the street Boothroyd says Theres no question that culture affects not just attitudes about weight but body size itself When Zulu women move from South Africa to England their body size preference shifted from the full figures favored in Africa to a midway point between that and the thin ideal in the UK Boothroyd says Her work is   in the current issue of the online journal   But that shift clearly hasnt happened in doctors Another   in the same issue of  found that doctors are strongly biased against fat people even if they dont think they are This comes from a fascinating crowdsourced study   which is designed to tease out attitudes that people are unwilling or unable to articulate Led by psychologist   an associate professor at the University of Virginia the project offers dozens of free online tests that let you test your implicit biases  and contribute to science too Participants are shown photos of faces and are tested on their speed to identify them and associate them with positive and negative words More than  people took the projects Weight Implicit Association Test online and about  said they were doctors Even though physicians are constantly reminded about their need to work with patients to maintain a healthy weight they had the same strong antifat bias as the public We dont know if this affects how doctors behave clinically says   an assistant professor in bioinformatics and medical education that the University of Washington in Seattle who led the new study But other studies have shown that many doctors view obese patients as unattractive and difficult to work with and that obese women get inappropriate comments about their weight from their doctor Given that maybe its time to show doctors some plussized photos  of hefty physicians
