A judge has extended life support for a 13-year-old girl who was declared brain dead after complications from a tonsillectomy operation earlier this month.. The order, issued by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo, grants the family's eleventh-hour appeal to keep Jahi McMath on a ventilator at least until Jan. 7. Another judge had ruled that Children's Hospital of Oakland, where McMath has been a patient since the Dec. 9 surgery, could shut off the breathing machine after 5 p.m. ET on Monday.. The family of McMath, who suffered cardiac arrest after bleeding profusely following the operation, sought the restraining order to keep her on life support.. The family wants to stop the hospital, saying there is hope for recovery.. The Associated Press says:
