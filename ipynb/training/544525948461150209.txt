For two decades Atlanta restaurant owner Jim Dunn offered a group health plan to his managers and helped pay for it That ended Dec  after the Affordable Care Act made him an offer he couldnt refuse Subsidies under the health law for workers to buy their own coverage combined with years of rising costs in the company plan made dropping the plan an obvious  though not easy  choice I had a lot of regrets going into it Dunn who owns three Italian Oven restaurants in suburban Atlanta said of his decision I dont think I have as many now  only because Ive seen the affordability factor for my managers improve Dunn and five managers are now covered under individual plans bought on   How many other owners make the same decision will help set the future of smallbusiness health insurance Although the evidence so far is mixed brokers expect more firms to follow in the next few years Companies like Dunns  those with fewer than  workers  provide medical coverage to roughly   Unlike larger employers they have no obligation under the health law to offer a plan Now they often have good reason not to If employees qualify for government subsidies like the managers who switched from Italian Ovens corporate insurance to individual Obamacare coverage everybody can win Owners dont have to pay premiums meaning they can give workers raises invest in equipment or add to profits instead And employee takehome pay can rise if subsidies  available even to families with middleclass incomes  are worth more than what a company was contributing Whether to cancel a company plan and let workers buy insurance on HealthCaregov or another online exchange is something that I would say comes up in every conversation with a smallgroup employer said Adam Berkowitz a consultant with Caravus a benefits firm based in St Louis I just had another small business call in today and say You know we cant do it Were packing it in  said Roger Howell head of   in WilkesBarre Pa Anthem the largest seller of smallbusiness health insurance lost almost  members in such plans  many more than expected  in the first nine months of the year That was  percent of the enrollment Many of those consumers are presumably switching to individual plans sold through exchanges including those offered by Anthem   Its far from clear however that most companies will take the same steps as Italian Oven Many small employers see health coverage as an essential piece of compensation They note that premiums in companysponsored plans are taxdeductible  for workers as well as employers  while the tax advantages of individual plans are limited I feel like we have to have a medical plan in order to hire people and keep them employed said Dan Allen head of a worker engineering firm in Decatur Ill Allen Engineering renewed its Coventry Health Care plan for  even though the premiums rose  percent he said No other major insurer has reported cancellation of smallbusiness plans at the same rate as Anthem We didnt see that said Rick Allegretti vice president of marketing at Health Care Service Corp operator of Blue Cross plans in five states including Illinois and Texas We actually saw our smallgroup business grow slightly  mind you its probably a tenth of a percent Businesses shifting workers into the individual exchanges tend to be the very smallest employing a handful of people said Skip Woody a partner at Hill Chesson  Woody a North Carolina benefits firm Anything above  we havent had any dropping coverage he said Instead many small companies are taking advantage of rules letting them maintain insurance bought before the health law took effect President Obama who promised consumers they could keep coverage they liked allowed carriers to extend noncompliant plans after facing fierce criticism over their imminent extinction Most but not all states approved the adjustment Because older policies may lack features required by the health law and because their rates are often set according to employee health history not communitywide costs they can be less expensive than compliant plans say brokers and consultants I havent sold one of the new plans yet to a small employer said John Jaggi an Illinois broker and consultant Faced with price increases of as much as a third or more for new plans all  or so of his smallbusiness clients including Allen Engineering renewed older coverage for  he said Heavy renewal of old plans plus workers shifting to individual coverage help explain why the health laws online portal for new smallbusiness plans has   analysts say For some companies there is logic to ending coverage altogether For Italian Ovens Dunn it made sense to recommend that he drop coverage said Elena Merino CEO of the Meridian Group a benefits firm in Alpharetta Ga It hurts me But that was the responsible thing to tell him Italian Oven employs the equivalent of about  people  less than the worker threshold that would get it fined for not sponsoring insurance The company does not offer coverage to servers and kitchen staff but fulltime managers have always had a plan All are eligible for   to buy insurance on HealthCaregov said Dunn Next year the subsidies are available for individuals with income of up to  and families of four with income of up to  With subsidies factored in along with unrelated pay increases the managers are going to be saving money out of the deal while getting coverage comparable to what they had before Dunn said My managers actually got excited about it because theyre saving money on their health insurance Brokers expect more small businesses to make the same move especially after the ability to extend older noncompliant plans expires between now and the end of    Allen the engineering firm executive is concerned premiums could rise even higher next year than they did for the  renewal If its up in the  to percent increase range  Ive heard as high as   well just have to drop it he said Turn everybody loose
