The United States is facing a critical shortage of doctors that could seriously jeopardize the ability of a patient to get medical care in the coming years Or at least thats the message the medical community has been pushing for several years now And the media   have   without   But is the shortage real Not necessarily say a growing number of health economists and analysts The most widely publicized prediction of a looming crisis comes from the   which has said that by  the US will be short roughly  doctors Its not hard to see how the group makes that calculation Millions of people are getting health insurance for the first time under the federal   At the same time  baby boomers are qualifying for Medicare every day says   chief public policy officer of the AAMC And we know essentially with the doubling of the population over the age of  over the course of a couple of decades theyre driving the demand for services Grover says Others point out that the shortage isnt just about the absolute numbers of doctors needed The demographics of the physician workforce are important too says   who studies the primary care workforce for the Robert Graham Center a think tank created by the American Academy of Family Physicians And that means by their race and ethnicity Bazemore says by their age by their gender and backgrounds Do they actually look like and reflect the populations they are going to serve But while there may be agreement that the US needs more primary care providers its not clear to everyone considering the problem whether all of those people need to be doctors There are a lot of primary care services that can be provided by a lot of people other than primary care doctors says health economist   She and a colleague recently led an   that looked at the funding of advanced training for doctors Nonphysician primary care providers can include physician assistants nurse practitioners pharmacists and social workers for example  often working together in   with a medical doctor Teams are thought to provide   according to some health policy analysts And sa ys Wilensky more nonphysician health practitioners each providing a different set of services might lessen the need for more primary care doctors What will we allow nurses to do  work up to the limits of their license Wilensky asks Work up to the limits of their training What will we allow pharmacists to do Those together would determine how many physicians it would be useful to have around Wilensky also points out that past studies predicting shortages of doctors have been laughably wrong We havent even been directionally correct sometimes she says We thought we were going into a surplus and we ended up in a shortage  or vice versa Still Atul Grover of the medical school association thinks its better for society to err on the side that the shortage is real We dont think we should put patients at risk by saying Lets not train enough doctors just in case everything lines up perfectly and we dont need them  Grover said in a recent   But letting more people train to be doctors just in case strikes Wilensky and many other health economists as wasteful Are you really serious Wilensky asks Youre talking about somebody who is potentially  to  years posthigh school  to invest in a skill set that were not sure were going to need Training too many doctors could potentially jeopardize more than just the bank accounts of those being trained   a pediatrician and professor at George Washington University says every doctor added to the health care system also adds cost Training another doctor he says isnt cheap  isnt cheap for the individual doing the training isnt cheap for the institution providing the education and ultimately isnt cheap for the health system Because the more doctors we have the more activity there will be Why then do so many physician groups continue to press for more doctors to be trained Princeton health economist   says theres at least some selfinterest involved The business model of an interest group is to create a sense of crisis he says and then tell their constituents We can help you  There is one element of the debate that just about every expert agrees on  that the US has to stop paying physicians based on the number and type of treatments and procedures they do and instead base payment on how well they keep patients healthy That might or might not reduce the need for more medical doctors But it would almost certainly help close the payment gap between specialists and generalists The physicians are the team drivers of the system Wilensky says If you dont get that part right either in terms of how theyre trained or how theyre paid its hard to imagine how health reform happens
