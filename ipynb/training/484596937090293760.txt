Pediatrician Jennifer Halverson will never forget her th birthday The St Paul native was volunteering at a maternity clinic in PortauPrince Haiti She felt great  she went to her job that day and then out to dinner with friends But when she got home and went to sleep that night in May something didnt feel right Then I woke up at  in the morning she says and what struck me the most was that my shoulders were on fire It was like I was being stabbed in both shoulders The pain quickly spread to all of Halversons joints  her hips her knees and elbows Even her fingers and toes hurt Halverson also had a fever a rash and painful sores in her mouth When she flew home to Minnesota the doctors confirmed what she thought might be true   Though the rash and sores quickly faded and the illness is rarely fatal the joint pain it causes can last for months Halverson is still hurting  she says she still cant open jars A year ago chikungunya didnt even exist in the Western Hemisphere It was only found in Africa and Asia But in October the mosquitoborne illness cropped up on the island of St Martin Then it spread like wildfire The Pan American Health Organization reported Monday that over the past seven months chikungunya has sickened more than a quartermillion people in the Caribbean And the nasty virus has already started to trickle into the US So far  travelers have brought chikungunya to  states the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Tuesday The disease hasnt yet spread beyond those travelers But health officials think its only a matter of time Right now we are worried about chikungunya in the US says   of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In fact we expect that over the course of the next months or years  as this virus spreads through the American tropics and we see more travelers coming into the US  we will see local transmission Why Because many parts of the US have the key ingredient for spreading chikungunya a big blackandwhite striped mosquito called   Yeah thats the Asian tiger mosquito that people notice when its there because it bites during the daytime Nasci says Theyre very aggressive and very noticeable because populations can be large The Asian tiger mosquito is common in the eastern third of the US And its territory reaches as far north as Connecticut and New York City The  mosquito also transmits chikungunya But this species is found mostly on the southern edges of the US Theres no need to worry about chikungunya for this Fourth of July weekend Nasci says The risk for catching chikungunya in the US is still very low  even if a case or two   in your county But if youre still worried Nasci says theres an   to cut your risk further Get rid of standing water in your backyard These mosquitoes they live in the water in your flower pot reservoir the kids toy thats out back and collects rainwater  or that tire or bucket he says So if you eliminate those containers youre going to reduce the number of mosquitoes near your residency which is going to reduce your risk And if the virus does get a foothold or two here in the US Nasci thinks the outbreaks will likely be small and limited only to summer months Even in Florida mosquito populations go down during the winter Theres something else Americans have going for them when it comes to stopping chikungunya We love air conditioning he says So we spend a lot of time indoors where mosquitoes  and chikungunya  cant get us
