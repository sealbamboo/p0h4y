Sometimes it takes worm glue to fix the hole in a heart Inspired by creepy crawly creatures like the slug and the sandcastle worm a team of scientists has created a surgical adhesive that could safely seal up the hearts of babies born with congenital heart defects The bioinspired glue described in Science Translational Medicine could replace damaging staples weak or toxic glues and reduce the need for repeated surgeries said study coauthor Jeffrey Karp a bioengineer at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston When such young patients need closure devices implanted they come with complications Karp said These devices they dont grow with the patient  and these children have to come back multiple times to have devices removed and reimplanted Karp said Its highly invasive and has a lot of complications associated with it Sutures take time  Its difficult to tie knots in small spaces Karp said  and staples damage tissue as they have to be bent to stay in The glues that are used are often hydrogels that are weak in the bodys watery environment The stronger kind a sort of medicalgrade crazy glue is very toxic Karp said There are about  heart operations performed per year on children with congenital defects in the US study coauthor Dr Pedro del Nido chief of cardiac surgery at Boston Childrens Hospital said in an email So having a safe strong nontoxic minimally invasive glue could potentially help a lot of kidsÂ Thats in part why Del Nido teamed up with Karp who has made a practice of finding surgical solutions in the natural world Karp and his colleagues began thinking about how animals navigate watery environments Many of the medical glues are largely hydrophilic  that is their components prefer to dissolve in water But the secretions that animals use to stick to things or to stick other things together often contain agents that are hydrophobic  that repel water Theyre also very thick and viscous so when they attach to a surface they dont flow They stay put These two factors seem to be common practice with a number of gunkgenerating animals including the sandcastle worm which glues bits of sand together to make its shelter along California shorelines and slugs whose slime helps them climb walls even in wet weather The glue the researchers came up with using those two principles is thick like honey Unlike other surgical glues which chemically bond with a tissue surface this glue makes a mechanical connection  infiltrating spaces between the collagen fibers in the tissue and locking in Its a little like another bioinspired solution Karp recently came up with  a skin graft device based on the tenacious grip of the   Were kind of surrounded by solutions Karp said I truly believe that evolution is the best problemsolver This glue can be cured using ultraviolet light in five seconds flat  very handy if youre operating on a living heart in flowing blood  An earlier version of this post indicated that such natural secretions are often hydrophobic In fact they often contain hydrophobic agents but are not necessarily hydrophobic as a whole
