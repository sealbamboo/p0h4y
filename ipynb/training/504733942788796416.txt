The ALS   continues to bring in huge donations this summer for efforts to cure and treat whats commonly known as   As of today the viral campaign has raised more than  million for the ALS Association Thats compared with  million raised by the group during the same time last year Now the association faces a challenge of its own figuring out the best way to spend all that money Its amazing Its perhaps a little overwhelming says Barbara Newhouse the groups president and CEO She says its a huge responsibility handling more money than the group has ever had before Its sort of like the lottery winner that receives a lot of money and four years later is looking in the mirror saying What did I do with all that money Where did it go  she says We dont want to be that kind of lottery winner We want to take this money and very thoughtfully plan out exactly what were going to do with it Newhouse says the group has already begun consulting with clients volunteers and its  chapters across the country on how the money should be spent She says the focus is on expanding the work they already do  funding   providing care and counseling for ALS patients and their families and advocacy Proposals will be discussed at a board of trustees meeting in October And then she says decisions will be made  very carefully Its not about spending money quickly Its about spending money thoughtfully she says  agrees with a caveat Hes president and CEO of   which rates and analyzes US charities His group gives the ALS Association four stars its highest rating But Berger also says the ALS charity faces a tough balancing act  investing the money well but not sitting on it for too long He says most donors expect the money they give to be spent in a timely way Youll see situations where charities have stockpiled money when theyve gotten an influx like this and donors have gotten very upset about it Berger says Because their expectation is The problem is now the need is now the organization needs to step up and dramatically increase its services He and others recall how   donors were when the American Red Cross received hundreds of millions of dollars after the Sept  terrorist attacks and then diverted some of the funds to other needs Berger says no matter what it decides the ALS Association has to share its plans as soon as possible so people    associate dean at Indiana Universitys School of Philanthropy says he thinks most donors understand that curing a neurodegenerative disease such as ALS is   but he warns Everybody will be watching So a year from now people will say Where did that money go and whats the social return on that investment  Newhouse says shes well aware of all this and that she has already been inundated with advice Im getting emails everything from Spend the money this way to emails that say Take your time do it right to people who say Ive got the cure for ALS so just pay me and Ill give you the cure Im getting it all Newhouse says She admits though that for someone running a charity there are worse problems to have
