Agerelated macular degeneration is the   of blindness in older people and the culprit in more than half of all cases of blindness in the United States Theres no cure for the condition so scientists have been hard at work trying to come up with ways to hold it at bay Unfortunately in most cases taking the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin  commonly sold as overthecounter supplements for eye health  didnt slow the damage to the retina that causes vision loss according to a new study Neither did taking supplements of omega fatty acids There were reasons to think these supplements might help For example some earlier studies suggested that eating dark leafy greens and yellow orange and other colorful fruits and vegetables rich in lutein and zeaxanthin may reduce your risk for developing macular degeneration according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology And a    found that women who ate more fish a rich source of omegas were less likely to suffer agerelated macular degeneration This new study part of the  clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health was designed to nail down what combination of supplements would help the most Back in  the AREDS trial made big news when it found that taking the antioxidant vitamins C and E along with beta carotene and zinc slowed the diseases progression in people who have early signs of it reducing the risk of vision loss in advanced AMD by about  percent over five years As a result ophthalmologists now   that some people found to be at high risk take vitamins C E and zinc   to slow progression AMD destroys a part of the retina that makes it possible to see fine detail This more recent effort had  people at risk of AMD take the original AREDS formula along with various combinations of lutein zeaxanthin and omegas or a placebo The people ranged in age from  to  The researchers also gave people variations on the AREDS formula giving some people less zinc no beta carotene or both So interpreting the results is a bit complicated But by the end of five years it became clear that most of the people who took lutein and zeaxanthin or lutein and zeaxanthan plus omegas had no more protection against vision loss than did the people who took the original AREDS formula alone However people who werent eating much did seem to get some protection from lutein and zeaxanthin supplements perhaps because they werent getting those nutrients in their diet And taking prescribed those supplements might still be a good alternative for former and current smokers the researchers found Thats because beta carotene although known to help slow AMD progression is also associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in people who have ever smoked Theres clearly an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin says Emily Chew deputy director of epidemiology and clinical applications at the National Eye Institute and a coauthor of the study Beta carotene has always been troublesome The new   published online in the May  J  found that current and former smokers who took lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta carotene had a lower risk of AMD without boosting their lung cancer risk As a result Chew thinks that the AREDS formulation should be changed to include lutein rather than beta carotene Then it would be good for everybody But she says that people should talk to their doctors to figure out what supplements will work best for them
