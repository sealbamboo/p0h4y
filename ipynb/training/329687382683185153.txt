A large body of research has linked latelife depression to social isolation poorer health and an increased risk of death Now a new study finds that depression is associated with subsequent vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease conditions poised to expand dramatically with the aging population The report published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Psychiatry is a metaanalysis of  previous studies that followed nearly  older adults over a median of five years The researchers found that depressed older adults defined as those over age  were   than similarly aged people who werent depressed  We cant say that latelife depression causes dementia but we can say it likely contributes to it said Meryl Butters an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a coauthor of the paper We think depression is toxic to the brain and if youre walking around with some mild brain damage it will add to the degenerative process  In terms of absolute risk she said the data suggest that  of every  older adults with latelife depression may go on to develop vascular dementia while  of every  seniors with a history of depression may eventually be diagnosed with Alzheimers Previous research has shown that a history of depression is linked to a doubling of the risk that someone will end up with Alzheimers disease But this is the first analysis to demonstrate an even stronger association with vascular dementia a condition caused by strokes or other interruptions to blood flow in the brain  That does not mean a causal relationship between depression and dementia has been established it hasnt Nor is there any solid evidence yet that forestalling depression will prevent dementia About  percent of people with dementia in the United States  between  and  million adults  are thought to have the vascular form of this condition according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Over all up to  percent of adults aged  and older have clinical depression the numbers are higher among those who receive home health care or live in institutions What biological mechanisms might account for a relationship between depression and dementia Some evidence suggests that people who are depressed produce high levels of the hormone cortisol which in turn has an adverse effect on the hippocampus  a part of the brain responsible for new learning and shortterm memory We know that people who are depressed have elevated levels of cortisol a hormone related to the stress response and a smaller hippocampus a brain structure critically important for memory said Dr Raymond Ownby chair of psychiatry at Nova Southeastern Universitys College of Osteopathic Medicine in Fort Lauderdale Fla who studies the possible links between depression and dementia  Other evidence suggests that depression contributes to chronic inflammation that damages blood vessels and impedes blood flow in the brain leading to the deterioration of neural networks If chronic inflammatory changes are a common feature of depression that could predispose depressed patients to neurodegenerative changes in later life according to   Some experts have hypothesized that depression may share genetic underpinnings with dementia be an early signal of dementia or serve as an emotional reaction to impaired thinking and unreliable memory Alternately depression may deplete a persons cognitive reserves bringing encroaching dementia to light earlier than otherwise would be the case Whatever the underlying mechanism may be the implications for older adults are clear If someone in later life develops depression they should get early aggressive treatment and if they do so and recover they should try to prevent recurrence Dr Butters said  While there is no evidence that doing so will prevent dementia treating depression in older adults at least improves ones quality of life relieving suffering and reducing other health risks several other experts said    In the new analysis groups of older adults were surveyed for selfreported symptoms of depression in each of the  studies The fact that people with mild cognitive impairment werent excluded from this baseline group is a significant limitation some experts said  MCI is an independent risk factor for Alzheimers disease and people with MCI often have depression and anxiety said Dr David Loewenstein a professor of psychology and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine  The depression reported could have been a comorbid condition of underlying early stage disease Still previous metaanalyses by researchers in     and the   have suggested a link between depression and Alzheimers disease  That the association might extend also to vascular dementia isnt a surprise given a large body of research connecting depression with cerebrovascular disease experts said  Researchers are pursuing several related questions  most importantly whether identifying depression early and treating it adequately lower the risk of dementia said Deborah Barnes associate professor of psychiatry epidemiology and biostatics at the University of California San Francisco She is the author of a study of  members of Kaiser Permanente a Californiabased health maintenance organization published a year ago in JAMA Psychiatry that found that older adults were   starting in middle age and continuing on in later life Dr Barnes also wrote a  paper in The Lancet that estimated that almost  percent of Alzheimers disease cases in the United States are potentially attributable to depression and that a  percent reduction in depression might prevent  cases of dementia
