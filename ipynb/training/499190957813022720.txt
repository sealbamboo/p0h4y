Thats the problem with experimental drugs that have never been clinically tested in humans No one knows whether theyll work  and if they do in whom  This week the World Health Organization gathered a group of ethicists to decide whether unproven medications and vaccines should be used in the current Ebola outbreak As the death toll from the epidemic soared over  the WHO panel unanimously concluded that it is ethical to offer medications to fight the Ebola virus even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown  The large number of people affected by the  west Africa outbreak and the high casefatality rate have prompted calls to use investigational medical interventions to try to save the lives of patients and to curb the epidemic the  said Tuesday  WHO says it believes the virus has infected  people and killed  making this the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history The difference between this outbreak and other Ebola outbreaks is that traditional methods of stopping the virus from spreading  protective gear contact tracing etc  dont seem to be working fast enough said Dr MariePaule Kieny WHOs assistant directorgeneral The health care systems in the affected countries are also weak so resources are scarce If these treatments can save lives  should we not use them to save lives Kieny said the panel asked After the panels decision Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose announced Tuesday her government will donate between  and  doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO  A small supply will be kept at home in the unlikely event it is needed for compassionate use in Canada the Public Health Agency said in a news release The drug  called VSVEBOV  is Canadianmade and owned having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory  Its never been tested on humans but has shown promise in animal research the agency states A Canadian government ethics advisory group and the WHO panel of medical ethics experts both informed the decision to give out VSVEBOV despite its unknown efficacy and adverse effects  Will it work is just one of the key questions surrounding VSVEBOV As with ZMapp other questions include how and on whom it should be used  can torment its victims with high fevers internal and external bleeding vomiting and diarrhea It often afflicts multiple organ systems and can kill up to  of those infected The virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood saliva and urine Since the current Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea in March the disease has spread to Sierra Leone Liberia and Nigeria And the impact has spread around the world  Cynthia SangbaiKwennah a native of Liberia living in Minnesota has lost nine family members to Ebola in less than two months  Every time you pick up the phone and you receive a call  this family is dead this person is dead SangbaiKwennah told   First her father perished Then other relatives who had been taking care of him SangbaiKwennah even lost her younger sister who had just recently graduated from college  Your entire family die in a month and a half she said Its just so scary Im just so confused I dont even know what to do There are several experimental drugs and vaccines being created for Ebola Kieny said though none has been through the necessary human trials to prove safety and efficacy And none of them is currently available in unlimited supply This outbreak she said is an opportunity to right a wrong  The fact that there is no drug for Ebola is a market failure This is typically a disease of poor people in poor countries where there is no market  Desperation has pushed Liberias government to ask for the experimental serum used to treat the Americans and Spanish priest in order to treat two local doctors The US Food and Drug Administration approved Liberias request for access to ZMapp which was created by the San Diegobased biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc Sample doses of the medicine will be sent to Liberia this week to treat doctors who have contracted the virus the Liberian government said   Mapp Biopharmaceutical said Monday that its supply has been exhausted after fulfilling the request of a West African country It did not name the country Kentucky BioProcessing which manufactures a version of the drug is working to increase production of ZMapp but the process will take several months company spokesman David Howard said last week There are not adequate supplies of any of the investigational agents anywhere near ready for human use said Dr Jesse Goodman director of the Center on Medical Product Access Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University Medical Center referring to all drugs being developed to treat Ebola   Not adequate to treat all the patients in this outbreak even if we knew they worked  The gulf between developed and developing nations appeared to some to widen last week as reports emerged that the Ebola drug was being used to treat Westerners but not West Africans What if it had killed both of them Paul Root Wolpe director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University in Atlanta said about the two Americans first treated with ZMapp It is only because it worked seemingly very well that people are screaming How come people in Africa didnt get it  Wolpe said that considering the converse situation could provide some perspective  If the first people to receive doses of ZMapp would have been Liberian headlines would have screamed Experimental drug tested on poor Africans  Wolpe said   But the nagging question for some Was giving the serum to Africans even a consideration Should it have been Why didnt Dr Sheik Umar Khan the chief Sierra Leone physician who died while treating Ebola patients receive this medication Harriet Washington wrote in a recent   Because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here  the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a Westerner rather than a resident of the global South  WHO will convene a panel at the end of the month to discuss who should get priority access to the experimental drugs Kieny said WHO will not broker access she noted meaning it will not be responsible for doling out doses It will simply provide information about companies that have quantities available to people or government agencies that are asking More relevant than who got what and when experts say are questions about the safety of the current crop of experimental Ebola drugs For ZMapp and other Ebola drugs currently in the pipeline  like TKMEbola by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals  there are not good substantive data in humans to support their use  Usually you treat large numbers of sick people to be sure something isnt going to hurt them said Goodman former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration So while it seems at first glance that two individuals getting something promising in animals and then improving is convincing I dont think its yet convincing I think its hopeful  Wolpe Washington and Goodman agree that careful study should precede widespread dissemination of any Ebola drug and that Africans should be represented in those studies  If ZMapp turns out to be as effective as it seems to be and its possible to make much more of it then we end up with a situation where it becomes unethical to withhold treatment Wolpe said  We should do everything we can to nip this epidemic in the bud
