California is battling the worst whooping cough epidemic in  years Nearly  cases have been reported in the state   and babies are especially prone to hospitalization or even death Six of  infants who have become ill during the current outbreak are Latino Theres no conclusive explanation but there are a few theories that range from Latino cultural factors to a lack of health insurance Hispanics have larger household sizes and there may be cultural practices around visiting new infants that increase the number of contacts says Dr Gil Chavez deputy director of Californias department of public health Babies cant get their first dose of the vaccine until they are two months old Some adults may be infected and not know it The more siblings and extended family members that babies live or visit with the more exposure they may have to whooping cough Aunts uncles grandparents who may not have had a booster shot they may be passing it on that way says Michael Rodriguez a family physician at UCLA However he points out that several other ethnic groups have large family sizes or live together because financial resources are limited These factors alone cant explain why Latino babies are disproportionately affected he says It really speaks to the lack of access to health insurance thats particularly predominant within the Latino community says Sarah de Guia executive director of the California PanEthnic Health Network an advocacy group Latinos make up  percent of the uninsured she says either because they cant afford to pay for health insurance or because theyre afraid that signing up for coverage will expose family members who arent lawfully present in the US Many parents who entered the country illegally are afraid they will be discovered and deported if they enroll their children who are legal immigrants or citizens into government coverage such as Medicaid Thats the primary reason why people are not getting the preventive care that they need she says And then that impacts everyone Public health officials attribute the ongoing epidemic to several factors Whooping cough is cyclical in nature and tends to peak every three to five years The last outbreak of the disease in California was in  But doctors are discovering that immunity from the   on a similar timeline Medical recommendations suggest booster shots after eight years but doctors are seeing kids who received a booster three years ago getting sick Public health officials are considering an update to the recommendations to account for the dip in immunity seen after three years Plus many kids in some areas arent getting vaccinated at all The highest rates of whooping cough are found in the Bay Area counties of Sonoma Napa and Marin which also have some of the highest rates of parents who opt out of vaccinating their children Doctors believe these kids are the root of the current and recent epidemics We had a lot of unvaccinated children that acted as the kindling to start an outbreak said Dr Paul Katz a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael Those children were able to infect all the other children who were vaccinated but were too early for a booster  they became the rest of the wood to start the fire All of these factors combine to put babies at risk especially babies who are not old enough to be vaccinated And if Latino children and adults dont have health coverage they are less likely to be visiting the doctor regularly and getting their booster shots says Rodriguez Californias public health department has done some outreach to encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated in the third trimester in order to pass immunity on to the fetus But little outreach has been done in Spanish and most materials are distributed directly to doctors offices Latinos arent likely to see that information if they dont have insurance and arent going to the doctor Advocate Sarah de Guia says more work needs to be done so pregnant women  and adults  in Latino communities know they need to update their vaccinations Its important for public officials to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach to make sure people are getting the message in their language and in a way they will understand she says
