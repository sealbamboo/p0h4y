Doctors do make a difference when it comes to keeping children and teenagers from taking up tobacco This may sound like a nobrainer but until recently there wasnt strong evidence that antismoking efforts by pediatricians and other primary care doctors make a difference That evidence is now clear according to the US Preventive Services Task Force an independent group that today called for pediatricians and other primary care doctors to talk with children teenagers and parents about the harms of smoking The independent task force also endorsed doctors use of computer programs videos and print materials with antitobacco messages Parents ought to be looking for these conversations   dean of the college of public health at the University of Iowa tells Shots Shes a member of the task force and also researches antitobacco efforts Pediatricians have a long list of things theyre supposed to ask about during visits from diet and exercise to bike helmets So its easy to imagine how yet another preventive health effort might not make it on the list But tobacco intervention should be a high priority Curry says This is one of the most effective things that a provider can do to keep kids healthy over their life course she says They can make a big difference in a relatively short amount of time In  the American Academy of Pediatrics  that pediatricians urge their patients and parents to avoid tobacco and make homes and cars smokefree In  the USPSTF hadnt found enough evidence for a broad call for primary care interventions this recommendation now says there is Most adult smokers started as children or teens which explains the focus on trying to keep children and teenagers from taking up the habit It can take up to two years for a child to progress from experimenting with cigarettes to becoming addicted according to the report which was   in the journal   and  in   Each year about  people die from smokingrelated causes including cancer heart disease and lung diseases About  percent of middle schoolers say they smoke as do  percent of high school students according to  data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The interventions tested in the studies that the task force evaluated varied widely Some were simple conversations with a doctor or other health care provider Others involved sending home a minute video with a viewing guide with followup calls from a counselor The most intensive had a teenager and at least one parent participating in seven twohour group sessions with workbooks to complete at home But even just having doctors mail out material to a childs home had an impact  Most of the interventions focused on the participants attitudes beliefs and knowledge about smoking and its consequences They also addressed tobacco marketing and other social influences and gave tips on how to say no thanks when offered a cigarette by a peer Several interventions focused on parents including their attitudes about smoking and how they communicate with their children Thats probably a good thing since one of the biggest reasons that children and teens start smoking is because Mom or Dad do But what about that onequarter of high schoolers who say theyre already smoking The task force found only limited evidence on the effectiveness of schoolbased and communitybased programs in helping teen smokers quit But another   that focuses on community health efforts rather than medical professionals found that higher tobacco prices and   as well as mobile apps phone quit lines and local efforts to restrict underage sales work well to reduce tobacco use in both teens and adults The National Cancer Institute offers a long   of tested tools for quitting from exercise programs for women to a DIY getoffthesnuff manual
