Fifty years ago a revolution began in neonatal care that has preserved the physical and   and often the lives of thousands of babies screening of newborns for inherited and congenital disorders On Oct   the first law requiring that all newborns be screened for   or   took effect in Massachusetts PKU an inherited metabolic disorder afflicts one in  of the four million babies born each year in the United States Children with PKU are missing an enzyme that converts the amino acid   to tyrosine and unless they remain on a special proteinrestricted diet the resulting buildup of phenylketone damages the brain and causes   and physical disabilities Today every state tests babies at birth for PKU  and not just that There are now more than  disorders that can be picked up through screening  of which comprise the core conditions of the governments   Other conditions are likely to be added to the panel in the future All but two of them    and critical    can be detected by automated analysis of a few drops of dried blood from a heel stick done within a few days of birth Giana Swift a fifth grader in Sherman Oaks Calif was one of more than  babies who benefit from newborn screening each year The story of her birth in October  was   Through a pilot screening program Giana was found to have an inherited metabolic disorder called   methylcrotonylCoA carboxylase deficiency It afflicts about  babies a year rendering them unable to process the amino acid leucine As with PKU toxic byproducts of the unprocessed amino acid build up in the blood and damage the brain Because she was tested at birth Giana thrived first on a special leucinefree baby formula then on a diet nearly free of protein Her grateful father David Swift  recently described Giana as very bright precocious happy and a top athlete That test and the nurse who talked me into having it done saved my daughters life he told me Some protein is now being gradually introduced into Gianas diet to see how well her body handles it All concerned are on alert for symptoms related to MCC   weakness     and   Mr Swift and Giana who turns  on Saturday are also giving back by helping other children with worse problems through the March of Dimes and the MakeAWish Foundation he said In the decades before Giana was born the number and quality of newborn screening tests varied widely from state to state In  the   was adopted establishing national screening guidelines and financial help for every state to create a comprehensive screening program The law which also provides professional education parental support and a check on laboratory reliability is up for renewal Conditions that can be detected through newborn screening include hormonal disorders like thyroid and adrenal abnormalities blood disorders like sicklecell   severe immunodeficiencies and dozens of enzyme disorders that result in a wide range of serious and sometimes fatal conditions Each of these disorders is relatively rare but the effect of widespread screening has proved to be economical as well as lifesaving sparing countless children years of costly medical and educational services and institutional care The short life of Kaylin Peters is a testament to the need for these programs Kaylin was born last year in Syracuse NY with an initially undetected critical congenital heart disorder The defect afflicts  in every  newborns Although Kaylin seemed normal at birth a major heart defect was found weeks later when she failed to thrive bled abnormally and began to turn blue Despite surgery to repair the large hole in her heart Kaylin died in December at age  months Her mother Krystal Peters  is now working hard to make sure children with lifethreatening heart defects are diagnosed before its too late Ms Peters wants every newborn to have a   that can reveal a shortage of oxygen in the blood resulting from a heart defect As of last January the test was required and fully implemented in only six states including New York And because an oxygen deficiency may not be apparent within a few days of birth Ms Peters also wants every parent to go home from the hospital with a list of symptoms of critical congenital heart disorder which include excessive sleepiness sweating while nursing and skin with a bluish or purplish color Pulse oximetry checks the babys pulse and blood oxygen level through a sensor attached to a finger or foot Ideally babies with normal results in the hospital are tested again at the first visit to a doctor More than half of affected children require lifesaving surgery within the first months of life Ms Peters said in an interview I dont want what happened to Kaylin to happen to any other baby Each state decides which conditions to test for most now screen for at least  disorders But with more babies now born outside hospitals it often becomes the parents responsibility to get newborns screened before they are a week old An abnormal result on a screening test does not necessarily mean the baby has a problem additional diagnostic testing is required If a diagnosis is confirmed parents are told how best to care for the baby to maximize the chances of   If a newborn is found to have hearing loss for example a treatable cause may be responsible If the condition cannot be corrected speech therapy sign language or   may minimize its severity Dr Edward R B McCabe a pediatric geneticist and medical director for the   whose career has spanned the history of newborn screening envisions an exciting future for early detection and treatment of inherited and congenital disorders In an interview he said the   has awarded several research grants for DNA sequencing of newborn blood which could facilitate the earliest possible diagnosis of healththreatening problems
