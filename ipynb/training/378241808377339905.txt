The story ran more than three years ago in The New York Times Magazine but fairly often I come across people who remember it They usually cant retrieve the name of the daughter who wrote it Katy Butler and theyre hazy about the details of her fathers condition a stroke nearly seven years earlier followed by deepening dementia But the outline of   has stayed with them An incapacitated man deprived of nearly everything that gave his life meaning A wife shattered and exhausted from the relentless demands of caregiving A pacemaker  installed after the stroke without much thought to the consequences  that kept his heart beating while his mind and body collapsed His wife and daughter wanted the pacemaker deactivated a simple painless nonsurgical procedure that would allow him to die without further suffering Doctors and hospitals said no Ms Butler a journalist in San Francisco has spent much of the intervening years at work on the justpublished Knocking on Heavens Door The Path to a Better Way of Death She has learned and explains in this book a lot about pacemakers heart surgery ICUs medical marketing and the conveyor belt that American medicine can become She appends a useful list of books and Web sites and organizations At heart though her book remains a family saga Like so many families the Butlers story entwines love and anger gratitude and criticism estrangement and closeness A crisis brings all those tensions into sharp focus Early on the family hoped Jeffrey Butler a retired professor and a formerly vigorous yearold could recover from his stroke When after some improvement he instead began a long and steep decline his wife Valerie largely forsook her art her yoga classes and her friendships to care for him waving off acquaintances offers of assistance and her childrens pleas that she hire help Determined to handle everything alone she soon faced high blood pressure insomnia and depression Katy Butler more comfortable loving her parents from a distance joined what she calls the rollaboard generation  sons and daughters flying in from afar to try to fix what sometimes cannot be fixed On one of those visits home to Connecticut her mother then  put a hand on her arm and said Please help me get your fathers pacemaker turned off When a surgeon inserted the device four years earlier nobody had mentioned that it could be deactivated The Butlers fervently wished theyd made a different decision but they found it to be one of those medical interventions easy to agree to and difficult to undo In  the Heart Rhythm Society and the American Heart Association issued guidelines reinforcing the rights of patients or their legal surrogates to withdraw any medical treatment including   Deactivating a pacemaker the guidelines said was neither euthanasia nor assisted suicide and a doctor who felt morally unable to do it should find a colleague willing to help But that action came too late for the Butlers By the time Mr Butler died in hospice care in  both he in his earlier lucid moments and his family believed he had lived too long and suffered too greatly When is it time to say no to a doctor To say Enough Ms Butler asks The pacemaker had prolonged her fathers life as it was designed to do but in his familys view that proved no blessing In fact Ms Butler believes that her mothers death from heart disease the following year at  was hastened by the toll of caregiving When it came time for her own endoflife decisions Valerie Butler did say no  to stents grafts or other cardiac surgery She entered hospice care and died at home Though Katy Butler has been able to interview her parents physicians and quote from her mothers diary adding to our understanding and her own of how her father arrived at this point her mission goes beyond her familys particular quandary An advocate of the slow medicine approach to treating older adults she wants us to be more questioning more thoughtful more mindful that a longer life isnt always a better one In our striving culture love has long been defined as giving more  more presents faster cars more medical fixes she writes near the end of this compelling book The time may come when the most loving thing is to actively advocate for doing less
