Regular exercise including walking significantly reduces the chance that a frail older person will become physically disabled according to one of the largest and longestrunning studies of its kind to date  The results   reinforce the necessity of frequent physical activity for our aging parents grandparents and of course ourselves  While everyone knows that exercise is a good idea whatever your age the hard scientific evidence about its benefits in the old and infirm has been surprisingly limited  For the first time we have directly shown that exercise can effectively lessen or prevent the development of physical disability in a population of extremely vulnerable elderly people said Dr Marco Pahor the director of the Institute on Aging at the University of Florida in Gainesville and the lead author of the study Countless epidemiological studies have found a strong correlation between physical activity in advanced age and a longer healthier life But such studies cant prove that exercise improves older peoples health only that healthy older people exercise  Other smallscale randomized experiments have persuasively established a causal link between exercise and healthy aging But the scope of these experiments has generally been narrow showing for instance that older people can improve their muscle strength with weight training or their endurance capacity with walking  So for this latest study the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders or LIFE trial scientists at eight universities and research centers around the country began recruiting volunteers in  using an unusual set of selection criteria Unlike many exercise studies which tend to be filled with people in relatively robust health who can easily exercise this trial used volunteers who were sedentary and infirm and on the cusp of frailty  Ultimately they recruited  sedentary men and women aged  to  who scored below a nine on a point scale of physical functioning often used to assess older people Almost half scored an eight or lower but all were able to walk on their own for  meters or a quartermile the researchers cutoff point for being physically disabled  Then the men and women were randomly assigned to either an exercise or an education group  Those in the education assignment were asked to visit the research center once a month or so to learn about nutrition health care and other topics related to aging  The exercise group received information about aging but also started a program of walking and light lowerbody weight training with ankle weights going to the research center twice a week for supervised group walks on a track with the walks growing progressively longer They were also asked to complete three or four more exercise sessions at home aiming for a total of  minutes of walking and about three minute sessions of weighttraining exercises each week  Every six months researchers checked the physical functioning of all of the volunteers with particular attention to whether they could still walk  meters by themselves  The experiment continued for an average of  years which is far longer than most exercise studies  By the end of that time the exercising volunteers were about  percent less likely to have experienced any episode of physical disability during the experiment They were also about  percent less likely to have become persistently possibly permanently disabled defined as being unable to walk those  meters by themselves  Most of the volunteers tolerated the exercise program very well Dr Pahor said but the results did raise some flags More volunteers in the exercise group wound up hospitalized during the study than did the participants in the education group possibly because their vital signs were checked far more often the researchers say The exercise regimen may also have unmasked underlying medical conditions Dr Pahor said although he does not feel that the exercise itself led to hospital stays  A subtler concern involves the surprisingly small difference in absolute terms in the number of people who became disabled in the two groups About  percent of those in the education group had a period of physical disability during the study But so did  percent of those in the exercise group  At first glance those results are underwhelming said Dr Lewis Lipsitz a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston who was not involved with the study But then you have to look at the control group which wasnt really a control group at all Thats because in many cases the participants in the education group began to exercise study data shows although they were not asked to do so  It wouldnt have been ethical to keep them from exercise Dr Lipsitz continued But if the scientists in the LIFE study had been able to use a control group of completely sedentary older people with poor eating habits the differences between the groups would be much more pronounced he said Over all Dr Lipsitz said its an important study because it focuses on an important outcome which is the prevention of physical disability In the coming months Dr Pahor and his colleagues plan to mine their database of results for additional followup including a costbenefit analysis  The exercise intervention cost about  per participant per year Dr Pahor said including reimbursement for travel to the research centers But that figure is considerably less than the cost of fulltime nursing care after someone becomes physically disabled he said He and his colleagues hope that the study prompts Medicare to begin covering the costs of group exercise programs for older people Dr Pahor cautioned that the LIFE study is not meant to prompt elderly people to begin solo unsupervised exercise Medical supervision is important he said Talk with your doctor and try to find an exercise group he said adding  The social aspect is important  Mildred Johnston  a retired office worker in Gainesville who volunteered for the LIFE trial has kept up weekly walks with two of the other volunteers she met during the study  Exercising has changed my whole aspect on what aging means she said Its not about how much help you need from other people now Its more about what I can do for myself Besides she said gossiping during her group walks really keeps you engaged with life
