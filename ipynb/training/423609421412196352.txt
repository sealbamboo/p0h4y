It all started back in September   Landon then  was living with his mother Sierra Riddle in St George Utah when he developed a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes The emergency room doctor said it was a virus and sent him home  Two days later he went back His armpits were swollen   They thought it was either a virus or infection in the lymph nodes so they gave him some antibiotics Sierra Riddle says But on the fifth day his mother says she was changing his diaper and noticed his groin was also swollen as well as his abdomen and throat He was having trouble breathing That time she got a frightening diagnosis cancer Landon was flown to a childrens hospital in Salt Lake City   His whole chest was full of leukemia tumors which is why he couldnt breathe his mother says They started him on chemo but told us that he probably wasnt going to make it Landons cancer had quickly progressed leading doctors to give him an  chance of survival she says In general ALL is one of the most curable cancers  According to the American Cancer Society more than   diagnosed with the disease survive Chemotherapy is the standard treatment and Riddle says doctors put Landon on a fouryear treatment plan The first two months of chemo went fairly well but then Landon became extremely ill   Most days he couldnt get off the couch Riddle remembers He would just lay there and throw up and throw up Riddle says he also developed neuropathy  a symptom of nerve damage that can cause weakness numbness and pain  in his legs that left him barely able to walk  Around that time a friend set up a Facebook page called   and recommendations started streaming in including several endorsing cannabis  medical marijuana  as a treatment  Medical marijuana however isnt legal in Utah Still desperate for answers Sierra Riddle and her mother Wendy Riddle started looking into it  They considered going to California or Oregon Then their research led them to the Stanley brothers in Colorado The six brothers are one of that states biggest cannabis growers and dispensary owners   The Stanleys produce about  pounds of medical marijuana a year  At the time much of it was high in THC  tetrahydrocannabinol the psychoactive ingredient in pot that gets users high but also helps patients with an array of conditions including pain and nausea  But the Stanleys were also growing something quite revolutionary a plant crossbred to reduce the THC and increase another compound found in cannabis called cannabidiol or CBD Many researchers believe CBD is one of the compounds in marijuana that has medicinal benefits According to the   its thought to have significant analgesic antiinflammatory and antitumor activity without the psychoactive effect The Stanleys expect to produce over  pounds this year most of it the crossbred variety according to Joel Stanley Riddle herself a recovering heroin addict struggled with the idea of giving Landon marijuana I was telling my mom you know We really need to think about this  But says Riddle her son was already prescribed medications like OxyContin and morphine  medications with significant side effects  Landon suffered from stomach failure and the OxyContin made him so miserable when he had hair he would literally try to pull his hair out In the end she decided she had nothing else to lose and moved to Colorado She rented a room got Landons medical marijuana card and began giving him marijuana  THC for the pain and nausea but also CBD The dose was based on Landons weight He first took it in oil form but now takes a pill Once the doses started Landons red and white blood cell counts increased dramatically she says  Six months later encouraged by Landons progress she stopped his chemotherapy treatments completely Once I took the chemo out I see these amazing results And no more need for blood transfusion and platelet transfusions Riddle says I think that the chemo in combination with the cannabis did put him into remission and now the cannabis will keep him there But Landons doctor at the Childrens Hospital of Colorado was shocked  She told me with no uncertainty that if I refused chemo she would have no choice but to report me to the proper authorities Riddle says  So Riddle found a lawyer willing to take her case Nobody wants to hurt Landon here says attorney Warren Edson This is about making him better  We have no problem making sure hes monitored throughout this process  And again if theres any indication this is doing him harm I cant imagine Sierra doing anything other than the right thing Childrens Hospital Colorado in a statement says it is committed to protecting the wellbeing of our patients The hospital says it cannot discuss specific cases but provided information from Dr Stephen Hunger director of the hospitals Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders Hunger noted that childhood cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease among American children that about  of childhood cancers are ALL and that the survival rate for children with ALL treated by   research trials is over  attained with two to three years of chemotherapy Childrens Hospital Colorado is one of the largest centers in the country that treats children with ALL the statement says  The Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Childrens Hospital Colorado has always done its best to work closely with families to provide the most appropriate treatment for cancer while also seeking to minimize side effects and maximize quality of life  Today chemotherapy is a required part of therapy for children with leukemia Many supportive care medications are used in children and adults with cancer including those considered to be complementary and alternative medicine also referred to as integrative health Marijuana or a product derived from marijuana is often used to decrease side effects in adults with cancer the hospital says There are several FDAapproved and commercially available antinausea medicines derived from marijuana cannabinoids that are frequently used by adults and children with cancer and we often prescribe these medications In an effort to stave off a legal wrangle Riddle her mother and Edson met with the doctors in charge of Landons care in October   They said they were willing to work with us They said they were willing to alter the chemo plan and they did not Riddle says Child protective services  which Riddle says had already been notified and visited the familys home  was also at the meeting along with Dr Margaret Gedde who wrote Landons original prescription for marijuana and is monitoring his care  I could see a large gulf between the doctors who were making the point this is a fatal disease  You know he needs this treatment to survive and pretty much that was their stance says Gedde   The family wanted to discuss more alternative modes of treatment and really things that wouldnt make him so sick but again the doctors being convinced that really it had to be done the way that they were used to it being done  that just made it very much really a confrontation there of two different mindsets I felt sympathetic to both Child protection officials declined comment on the case  The American Cancer Society meanwhile cautions that cannabinoids have not been tested in humans to determine if they can lower cancer risk  There are many challenges with marijuana research as it relates to cancer the organization says in a statement While it shows promise for controlling cancer pain among some patients there is still concern that marijuana may cause toxic side effects in some people and that the benefits of THC must be carefully weighed against its potential risks There is no available scientific evidence from controlled studies in humans that cannabinoids can cure or treat cancer For now Landon is still in remission with no sign of recurrence Still Gedde is cautious and says she cant recommend cannabis over chemo When you look at children who go through that same course of treatment and compare Landon to them it seems like hes doing better than what would be expected she says Im very hopeful and very encouraged that the CBD is probably having a beneficial effect for him but I think were still looking to have the disease course play out and find out I think in cancer you dont really know until later Meanwhile Edson says child protection officials have not yet filed a case  We will continue to monitor Landons health make sure hes getting the proper blood tests and other checks to see whats going on with him healthwise he says In December Sierra Riddle notified Landons doctors that she plans to transfer his care Shes searching for a physician willing to work with her to reduce the amount of steroids and chemotherapy he takes  Wendy Riddle says they have no regrets and will continue to fight Its not just fighting for Landon Its not just about him its about all of the kids to come she says  When Landon is  years old and we talk about this I want Landon to know that we did everything in our power to be compassionate in his care and to protect him
