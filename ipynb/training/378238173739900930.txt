Then it was my turn I weighed  pounds  and no it wasnt because I like to eat I grew up as a fat kid and food was my coping mechanism  In September  I started walking By the end of the year I started making better food choices In January  I joined my local Y where I started taking water classes such as HO cardio and hydrorider  In June  I was down to  pounds One of my best friends Anje volunteered to help me lose even more weight She figured out quickly that I loved sports more than anything I wanted to be an athlete She came up with a plan for us to approach my weight loss in phases At the end of each phase I would do some athletic feat  At the end of phase one I would run a K without stopping Phase two was a half marathon She suggested a triathlon for phase three I laughed in her face and told her she was crazy Fate had another plan One morning I heard   on   recount the biggest lesson he had learned from being part of the   That lesson was In times of transition keep moving forward It doesnt matter how you do it as long as you keep going forward  That year was a time of transition for me and to keep moving forward I knew I had to be part of the  CNN Fit Nation team On Christmas Day  I got the best present ever a Facebook message from a producer saying CNN had to talk to me I knew this was going to be big  Surprise welcome and congratulations  I heard those words from Dr Sanjay Gupta and immediately screamed and started to cry I finally had a team and I was going to be a triathlete in nine months The biggest obstacle for me was cycling I had never clipped into a bike and I was terrified by the thought of it By the time we got to our   I was doing better but still hated it  With two words my trainer April Burkey made me a cyclist on that trip  and started to heal some emotional scars We were coming off a huge hill and she said     At that point she was talking about the brakes but we had been talking all day about my selfperception Like braking on a bike I was holding on too tightly to people words and situations that had hurt me and to worries about things over which I have absolutely no control When it came time for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon I had no fear I knew without a doubt I would finish I was so excited and thankful for this opportunity to live out a childhood dream of being on a team I had lost nearly  pounds and was healthier and happier than ever  As I was out on the course I would see my teammates and every time we would yell words of encouragement to each other It didnt matter who finished first as long as we finished I had a sense of finally belonging I never felt more free and confident in my life as I did when I threw my hands in the air as I crossed the finish line  I left all the words and actions that hurt and haunted me since childhood along with the unhealthy unhappy woman I used to be at the finish line in Malibu on September    I had finally let go  Now the only thing left to do is keep moving forward
