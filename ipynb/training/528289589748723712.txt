Time Magazine If you want the inside scoop about whats happening with the Ebola outbreak then just hang out at the Mamba Point Hotel in Monrovia Its packed with scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention international reporters and a bunch of guys and gals in camouflage from the US Army They all like to hang out at the bar during lunchtime Thats where I met   a top epidemiologist at the CDC We head off to a quiet room and he starts telling me about all of his trips to Monrovia When I was here in August not to sound like making this too colorful but I mean there were  literally dead people on the streets Montgomery says And the burial teams were picking up  to  bodies a day At that point the country had been on a devastating path Clinics were stretched way past capacity And even getting an Ebola test could take days or weeks if you lived in the jungle Samples had to be sent by a series of canoes and motorcycles to the only lab in the country The epidemic was doubling every few weeks Some computational biologists were predicting more than  cases by the end of October But officials are seeing a very different situation on the ground now The country has had about  cases New cases are on a decline   by about a  a week on average since early October Liberia has also beefed up its ability to deal with the virus The country has quadrupled its diagnostic labs And hundreds of new beds have been added in Ebola clinics It does feel much better than it did in August Ive got to tell you Montgomery says The pulse you know The people on the street It just feels different It feels more controlled now than it did So has the tide turned Its too early to say Montgomery says Because as soon as you say that youre going to be wrong The country is still reporting a large number of cases And the virus is still popping up in new parts of the country Montgomery notes But theres another positive sign that doesnt get much attention he says Liberians are taking the matter into their own hands I think a lot communities are now starting to get it and figure out how they can limit spread prevent infection and prevent transmission he says because this is not  rocket science That same day at that same bar I heard about a woman in Monrovia helping with a grassroots campaign in   one of the citys poorest neighborhoods The project sounded awesome So I emailed   the day after I returned to the States She called me on her cellphone from a market near West Point Nobody would want to eradicate Ebola from their own neighborhood more than those who live in the neighborhood Meyler says The mothers fathers and neighbors and sisters who want to protect their own children and protect their own families Meyler is the founder of   a small nonprofit that runs a free school for girls in West Point The school had to close when Ebola came So Meyler knew she needed to turn her attention to getting the virus out of West Point A few months ago she says leaders in West Point banded together and built their own Ebola task force They started going door to door to door first with information about what Ebola is and how to keep yourself safe Meyler says Then the team started training people to be nurses so the team could actively look for Ebola cases in West Point When the nurses find someone sick with what looks like Ebola the team calls an ambulance and gets the person out of the community All this hasnt cost much money Meyler says These guys just need boots because theyre like going door to door in flipflops looking for sick people she says They need transportation to get the sick out as soon as possible It doesnt have to be a billiondollar ambulance The shoestring operation is working well Cases in West Point have dropped And the government wants to expand the project to five other neighborhoods in Monrovia The way to reduce the cases Meyler says is to listen to people who live in the community
