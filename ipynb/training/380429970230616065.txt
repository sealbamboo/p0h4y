Is it ever too early for Botox A new article about the preventive use of cosmetic procedures to freeze the aging process may raise a few eyebrows  at least for those who havent had too many Botox shots The commentary published online Wednesday in JAMA Dermatology states that it is rarely too early to start the conservative and thoughtful use of neuromodulators ie Botox fillers and noninvasive energybased treatments Critics of the concept on the other hand point to the potentially exorbitant cost of starting such procedures in early adulthood Its been clearly shown for a long time that frown lines forehead furrows and crows feet are due to repetitive folding of skin from normal expressions says Dr Kenneth Arndt a Bostonarea dermatologist and coauthor of the piece Arndt says many people in their s s and s attempt to fix these wrinkles and folds once theyve developed But by injecting earlier people can keep them from ever happening If you slow down the use of these muscles beginning early in adult life the lines never develop he says Rather than going backward and fixing something thats there you can inhibit it from starting in the first place Arndt a dermatologist and an adjunct professor of surgery at Dartmouth Medical School points to a handful of studies to back this up particularly   one of whom used Botox regularly for  years and the other who did not The study shows pictures of them  to  years later and one has a smooth and attractive forehead and the other has the expression lines youd expect with someone with normal aging he says Could other extenuating circumstances be responsible for the disparity in the womens appearance A charmed life doesnt lead to a smooth face he says Arndt admits nipping things in the bud does have its limits Were not advocating treating infants children and people in their teens he says What I would suggest is at whatever point people begin to notice and are bothered by some of these things like frown lines or forehead lines  its reasonable to consider starting treatment with Botox Its easier and more effective to inhibit progression than come in  years later and take them away Weve termed it prejuvenation Devin Harper a yearold laser hair removal sales representative from Dallas says she started getting Botox injections at  specifically to stop wrinkles in their tracks I started to prevent wrinkles and avoid having to receive fillers later in life she says Ive seen women as they get older and their skin wrinkles and deteriorates A big part of it is because Im in sales in the cosmetic industry But honestly its also a fear of aging Harper says shes had five procedures so far one dermal filler the rest Botox and plans to continue on with the Botox Ive got one wrinkle and as soon as I got it I went in and got a filler but it was painful and made me have a headache she says Im not going to do the filler again But not everyone is hip to hipchecking wrinkles before they start Harper says her parents are unhappy with her early cosmetic treatments and shes even lost a relationship over it Some people just dont agree with you altering your body she says They feel God made you how youre supposed to be made But I feel God also made plastic surgeons And not all plastic surgeons are comfortable with the concept of prejuvenation For the average person to start using Botox in their twenties is overkill says Dr Arthur Perry a board certified plastic surgeon with offices in New York and New Jersey Theres a variability in the wrinkles and thinning of the skin so to do it before the late thirties is probably unnecessary in the vast majority of people Plus the procedures are pricey he adds Botox shots in three areas  the forehead the area between the eyebrows and the crows feet  would average between  and  per treatment says Perry Thats an average of  and the recommended interval is every four months he says So youre talking about  a year just for Botox just the upper part of the face You could buy a car with that money if you do it for like a decade Harper who got a discount for her procedures says shes seen cheapie places where you can get it for like  but the idea of patronizing one of those spots scares her If Im going to pay someone to put a needle in my skin that has a toxin Id rather pay more and know Ill be okay after she says As for prejuvenation Perry does agree that theres evidence cosmetic intervention can prevent wrinkles from developing but says the million dollar question is when do you start I think we can all get a little carried away with this and start way too early he says
