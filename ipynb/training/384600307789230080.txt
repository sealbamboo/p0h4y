The Mediterranean diet is a pattern of eating that lately has become a darling of medical researchers It includes vegetables and grains not so much meat and of course generous portions of olive oil Mary Flynn an associate professor of medicine at Brown University says the evidence that olive oil is good for your heart has never been more clear Olive oil is a very healthy food she says I consider it more medicine than food She points to a big   published earlier this year in the   where researchers in Spain had men and women in their s s and s who were at risk of heart disease follow one of three diets Some ate a lowfat diet another group ate a Mediterranean diet with nuts And a third group ate a Mediterranean diet that included almost four tablespoons of extravirgin olive oil per day So they could compare the three diets Was it nuts was it olive oil or was the lowfat diet beneficial says Flynn And   was that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by  percent The nut group which was consuming olive oil as well did well too The fact is there are a huge range of benefits of real extravirgin olive oil notes   who has spent the last six years investigating and writing about olive oil He says olive oil is good for two reasons Its mostly unsaturated fat and extravirgin oil which is the highestgrade and leastprocessed form of olive oil contains a whole range of other beneficial plant compounds called polyphenols But heres the catch Unfortunately it turns out that more than half of the extravirgin olive oil imported into the US has been shown to be substandard The fact is its quite often just very lowgrade oil that doesnt give you the taste of the health benefits that extra virgin should give you Mueller says In fact a   from the University of California Davis found that  percent of imports tested failed to meet a US Department of Agriculture quality standard And Mueller says in some cases the oil is just too old By the time imported olive oil reaches us it has often been shipped from place to place and sometimes not stored well Even if its not noticeably rancid many of the hearthealthy compounds have degraded and fizzled Extravirgin olive oil is freshsqueezed juice  its a fruit juice  therefore freshness is a critical question he says Mueller says the US Food and Drug Administration used to police olive oil imports to ensure producers were meeting quality and freshness standards But those efforts have fallen off So where does that leave those of us who want to get our hands on the healthy stuff Well for starters Mueller says look for brands that carry a harvest date on the bottle   which is sold in lots of chain supermarkets nationwide has a date clearly stamped on the back of the bottle Gregg Kelley of California Olive Ranch says every single bottle produced by his company includes the date that olives were harvested to produce the oil in the bottle And he says the olives were pressed very quickly so the oil is really fresh The most important thing for consumers to remember when theyre purchasing extravirgin olive oil is that it is not wine It does not get better with age Its never better than the day it was produced Kelley says Now as long as the olive oil is properly stored the freshness will hold in the bottle at least for a while Some bottles now carry an expiration date But as soon as you open the bottle and expose the oil to oxygen and light it will slowly start to degrade So Mueller says dont make the same mistake his family made I grew up with terrible oil I had a huge tin in my grandparents cabin and that was olive oil for me  it was moldy and fusty and there for years he says Experts say   determine how quickly an oil deteriorates everything from the variety of the olives to how the oil is produced and stored But generally speaking we usually see that oil is no longer good after four to six months after opening says   of the UCDavis Olive Center Oils with the highest levels of hearthealthy compounds tend to be pungent and peppery Mueller says if the oil stings the back of your throat a little that tells you the beneficial polyphenols really are there Once you have that taste you get used to the bitterness and pungency you never go back says Mueller Its a completely different experience And a healthy one too
