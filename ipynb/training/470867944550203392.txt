So far the frightening MERS virus has  in the United States  two who carried it from Saudi Arabia and a third who became infected by one of the travelers Public health experts noted immediately its another example of how any disease is just a plane ride away The biggest and best example is  It was never seen in the Western Hemisphere before  A few cases showed up in Queens and then the virus carried by mosquitoes quickly spread across the whole country It killed  people last year and made  people sick and its now here to stay But what else is circulating in other countries and just waiting to come set up shop in the United States Heres a list of the big five There are two flavors here  HN and HN HN first showed up in  and started circulating in earnest in  It kills off flocks of chickens but can quietly circulate in ducks so its hard to control Its  in  countries killing  of them So far HN remains hard to catch and people rarely infect other people  most cases have had contact with birds of some sort The  only showed up a year ago in China but its infected more than  people and killed more than  of them with four new cases reported this week Influenza scares health experts more than any other virus because it can spread so easily from person to person and has a high death rate when a new strain starts spreading Flu viruses are very prone to mutation and experts say any of the various bird flus could evolve into a strain that infects people easily causing a pandemic that could kill millions of people Measles is easily prevented with vaccination but poverty disasters and a recent move to question vaccine safety in rich countries had led to pockets of outbreaks around the world and   Although many people view measles as a fairly harmless childhood infection it once infected  to  million a year in the US killing up to  and permanently disabling  every year It is one of the most infectious viruses out there A single person can infect between  and  others with casual contact such as sitting next to them An ongoing measles outbreak in the Philippines has sickened more than  people and killed at least  and at least  measles cases from  states have been reported in the US in  so far We focus on two aspects of infectious agents when assessing the magnitude of threat to public health One is pathogenicity  whether infection results in serious illness or death The other transmissibility reflects the likelihood that exposure will result in infection said Dr Ian Lipkin an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University TB is one of the oldest scourges known to humankind and it spreads very easily settling in the lungs but sometimes in the brain or spine The bacteria that cause TB can float in the air for hours making it very hard to trace the source of infection and making it very hard to avoid  with antibiotics but drugresistant forms have emerged that resist most of the mainline drugs and that can take months or even years to get rid of The World Health Organization projects that  will get infected with multiple drug resistant TB MDRTB in  In  Atlanta lawyer Andrew Speaker made headlines when he sneaked back to the United States after flying abroad after he had been diagnosed with MDRTB and traveled anyway against CDC orders He was arrested and   Many of us in the field of infectious diseases are concerned about dengue virus an agent spread by mosquitoes says Lipkin Dengue has been seen in Texas and Florida  last October Dengue is the worlds  and WHO says it represents a pandemic threat It can cause a hemorrhagic fever  a fairly horrific   that include bleeding under and on the surface of the skin The good news is that only about  percent of people infected with dengue show any serious symptoms at all Chikungunya  out of Africa into the Indian Ocean region Asia and Europe in recent years So far more than  travelers have carried it into the US but it hasnt spread But its getting settled into the Caribbean The Pan American Health Organization reports more than  cases since December on several Caribbean islands Its carried by the same mosquitoes that carry dengue and West Nile and officials worry that warming weather will bring it to the US Its not especially deadly but its very painful and up to  percent of infected people feel sick This is one of the scariest viruses out there killing up to  percent of victims depending on the strain Its also a hemorraghic fever causing internal bleeding and patients die of shock An   in Guinea in West Africa has sickened  people and killed  of them and   in Sierra Leone The good news is that it makes people so sick they are unlikely to travel and spread it There are diseases like Ebola where mortality is high but the risk of infection is low unless one comes into direct contact with an infected person or an object such as clothing that has been contaminated with their body fluids says Lipkin Although an infected individual could carry the virus across the world to the US he or she would show signs of disease that should rapidly draw the attention of health care personnel and result in containment before there is opportunity for spread of infection
