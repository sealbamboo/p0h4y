 When a baby cries in the middle of the night it might be better to let her comfort herself to get back to sleep finds a new study published in  Temple University psychology professor Marsha Weinraub PhD and her colleagues measured patterns of nighttime awakenings in more than  infants ages  to  months They asked parents to report on how often their children awoke during the night at    and  months They found that by  months of age  percent of babies did not wake up during the night or awoke just once per week on average Thirtythree percent of the babies woke up seven nights per week at  months the number dropped to two nights per week by  months and one night per week at  months The Temple researchers found that when mothers were tuned in to nighttime awakenings and if babies regularly fell asleep during breastfeeding they may not be learning how to selfsoothe which is critical for developing regular sleep patterns The researchers also looked at the connection between depression in mothers and infant awakenings According to Dr Weinraub mothers who are depressed when their babies are  and  months old may have been depressed during pregnancy and prenatal depression could have affected their neural development which in turn could make it more likely that a baby will wake up during the night But its also possible that sleep deprivation in mothers of young infants exacerbates depression  Because the mothers in our study described infants with many awakenings per week as creating problems for themselves and other family members parents might be encouraged to establish more nuanced and carefully targeted routines to help babies with selfsoothing and to seek occasional respite Weinraub said in the release Her advice Put infants to bed at a regular time every night allow them to fall asleep on their own and resist the urge to respond right away to awakenings Other study findings Babies like adults have sleep cycles every oneandahalf to two hours in which they wake up and return to sleep Some babies cry out when they awaken and some do not Also the study found of all the babies who woke up regularly and cried out during the night the majority were boys They recommend that parents who see persistent sleep problems in their babies past  months seek advice from their doctors Confused about what your childs daytime cries mean   with this guide Also find out the
