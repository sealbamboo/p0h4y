A federal judge in Austin Texas will issue a decision in the next few days about whether clinics that perform abortions in the state must become outpatient surgery centers The Texas law is part of a national trend in which state legislatures seek to regulate doctors and their offices instead of women seeking abortions The laws are collectively known as TRAP laws for Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers They do just that says Rochelle Tafolla a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston They trap providers into very tight medically unnecessary restrictions The Texas law that passed in  requires doctors who perform abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within  miles Many clinics especially rural ones found it difficult to comply with that rule by the November deadline The number of Texas clinics that perform abortions has dropped from  to  Now the laws final rule requires doctors offices to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers including an array of rules that govern hallway widths the presence of showers and lockers and heating and cooling specifications The rules also require conformance with other construction codes that can cost millions of dollars The rule goes into effect on Labor Day unless federal Judge Lee Yeakel of the Western District in Austin issues an injunction to stop it He is expected to issue a decision by Friday If he stops the surgery center rule Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott could quickly appeal to reinstate it One Houston doctor who asked not to be identified because he fears being targeted by abortion protesters says he will have to stop providing abortions if the final rule goes into effect Abortions are a small but important part of his practice He delivers babies gives wellness exams performs gynecological surgery and even offers tummy tucks Abortion is part of what were trained to do as obstetriciansgynecologists Thats the medical point of it he says When the politicians get into the mix it becomes a completely different story Planned Parenthoods Tafolla says only eight clinics in Texas would meet the newest requirement and theyre all in the major cities two are in Houston including Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast two in San Antonio two in Dallas and one each in Fort Worth and Austin Women in East Texas the Rio Grande Valley and west of San Antonio would have to drive hundreds of miles for multiple visits because a  law put in place a hour waiting period following a mandatory ultrasound plus followup visits for women using the abortion pill So it isnt as simple as saying Oh theres that one place in Houston theres that one place in Austin or Dallas There simply isnt enough capacity there arent enough physicians Tafolla says The Guttmacher Institute a research organization that studies reproductive rights says TRAP laws really   in  Twentysix states now have them Groups that oppose abortion say the new laws make the practice safer and therefore protect women Melissa Conway spokeswoman for Houstonbased Texas Right to Life says if the number of abortions and the number of clinics drop in Texas thats something shes glad about but it wasnt the intent of the law She says the regulations are about making abortion safer so abortion providers should invest in the required upgrades The choice to have fewer clinics comes down to the abortion providers Conway says If they choose to have disregard for the health of women and the safety standards which are practical commonsense and best standards thats their choice But that points highly to the fact that they care more about their bottom line than they do their patient care The position of the   is that what those laws do is they limit womens access and expose women to increased risk by not enabling them to have a procedure near where they live says ACOG CEO Dr Hal Lawrence Lawrence says lowincome women cant afford to travel and may try to selfinduce an abortion or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term He adds that other outpatient procedures such as colonoscopy carry a fatality risk that is  times greater than firsttrimester abortion yet colonoscopy does not receive the same unwarranted scrutiny from lawmakers Tafolla says legislatures are passing TRAP laws because laws targeting demand for abortion were ineffectual Other demandfocused laws include mandatory ultrasounds a requirement that the patient listen to the fetal heartbeat and waiting periods before abortions Legislators who oppose abortions thought they could reduce abortion by focusing on women and shaming them she says Now theyre focusing on the providers and doing everything they can to shut them down
