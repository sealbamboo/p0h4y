Pregnancy and childbirth were very male experiences for me said a yearold respondent in a study reported Friday in   When I birthed my children I was born into fatherhood If this statement at first seems perplexing its less so when you realize the person talking is a transgender man  someone who has transitioned from a female identity to a male or masculine identity He is one of  participants in a   of how it feels to be male and pregnant a study the authors think may be the first of its kind Pregnancy as a transgender man is unlike any other kind  No one expects a man to be pregnant and the study participants said they were often greeted with doubletakes suspicion and even hostility from strangers and health care providers Child Protective Services was alerted to the fact that a tranny had a baby one participant reported There were plenty of insensitive comments and harsh experiences that troubled these men both in and out of the health care setting ranging from inappropriate use of pronouns about threequarters of the respondents preferred to be called he while a handful preferred she they ey or in one case no pronoun at all to actually turning them away and denying them prenatal care They just feel a lot of isolation from the health care community said   an assistant professor of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco and the senior author And we have some indication from our qualitative results that depression might be exacerbated for folks who are transgender both during pregnancy and after The study came about because a medical student working with Kerns Alexis Light found herself fielding questions from transgender male friends about whether theyd be able to conceive and what pregnancy would be like Light now a firstyear resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Washington Hospital Center in DC didnt know the answer and couldnt find it in the medical literature So she asked Kerns to help her design a research project to find out Kerns recognized it as a cuttingedge subject with a recent   from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists highlighting the need for highquality health care for transgender individuals With such a small survey its impossible draw any firm conclusions Kerns and Light both emphasize that more research is needed But one thing they did learn was that prior testosterone use didnt seem to affect pregnancy outcome Some transgender men use testosterone to look and  more masculine Twentyfive of the survey participants had taken testosterone before becoming pregnant  had not But the researchers found no difference in pregnancy delivery or birth outcomes between the two groups My friends were asking me be if they should delay starting testosterone if they had an interest in maintaining future fertility Light said Based on the experience of these  transgender men she can tell them theres no need to delay  though they will need to discontinue testosterone when they decide to conceive and stay off it throughout the pregnancy One complication unique to transgender male pregnancy is the reemergence of gender dysphoria the feeling that ones psychological gender identity is different from ones biological sex Heavy time having a baby not passing as male wrote a yearold respondent all the changes and a society telling me to just be happy The author of the new graphic memoir   a masculinelooking woman named by AK Summers said one of the worst parts of her pregnancy was that it exaggerated the most female aspects of her body enlarging her breasts and filling out her hips All of the things that I thought that made me feel attractive were lacking in the pregnancy Summers said recently on the public radio   The Longest Shortest Time She was most comfortable she said during the period early in pregnancy when she could just pass as a fat man But changes in gender dysphoria can work both ways the investigators found In some of the transgender men in the study gender dysphoria actually declined with pregnancy These people said they were for the first time in their lives pleased with their bodies which were finally helping them do something they valued that a typical male body could not do As one respondent put it it was relieving to feel comfortable in the body Id been born with More work is needed to find out how many transgender men get pregnant every year  it could easily be in the thousands Kerns guessed  and to see how many more might be trying to get pregnant and failing The men in this small study had little trouble conceiving  onethird hadnt even planned their pregnancies and just  percent said they took fertility drugs  and the majority were able to get pregnant using their own eggs and their partners sperm But its impossible to draw any inferences from that since the only people recruited for the study were transgender men who had successfully had at least one child One thing the study highlights is that as Light put it gender identity is a spectrum And that building rapport with patients anywhere along that spectrum begins with the simplest step with the physician finding out which pronoun the patient prefers and using it
