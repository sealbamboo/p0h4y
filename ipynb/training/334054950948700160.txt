Twentytwo months ago I interrupted my nonstop reporting about paths toward a sustainable future for our species to focus on sustaining myself The hiatus was not by choice but was    the outoftheblue variant the rare kind of   the term preferred by some neurologists that is most often seen in otherwise healthy youngish middleaged people Its Fourth of July weekend   a beautiful if hot morning for a run in the Hudson Valley woods with my son Daniel back from brief service in the Israeli army Im eager to be pushed hard Im not even a  middleaged athlete Im truly negligent when it comes to exercise Were jogging up a steep path and my breathing gets deeper and faster At a particularly tough turn I pause hands on knees Come on keep it up Dad Im panting but dont want to disappoint We press on But I stop again this time insisting that Daniel run ahead I rest in the mottled shade and sunlight of the woods until he returns Then I realize that through my left eye the world appears paisley  as if I were looking through a patterned curtain Something is really wrong We make it back to the car Daniel takes the wheel Back home I take a shower thinking that cooling off will help For the first time a thought flickers   Almost unconsciously I take half a dozen baby aspirin I know enough about aspirins bloodthinning properties to think this cant hurt I call my doctors office and the receptionist says I should go to the emergency room We head to the hospital Although its a designated stroke center there is no stroke neurologist around on this holiday weekend A CT scan shows nothing Vitals are normal But I realize something is still wrong when I get an eye test in a hallway I can see the letters on the eye chart but not the hand of the nurse pointing to a particular row Also my pupils are different sizes a condition that I later learn is called   and can presage a stroke Nonetheless the hospital plans to release me I push back recalling that months earlier my doctor as a midlife precaution had recommended ultrasound scans of my carotid arteries to be sure there wasnt any buildup of plaque Maybe they should try this Preparations are made for an ultrasound of my arteries But the technician holding a gelcovered probe against my neck has a puzzled look She cant find my left internal carotid artery She asks for a second opinion I vividly recall hearing the words Theres no flow in your carotid artery My first reaction  I would later learn that my left internal carotid artery had no flow because of what is known as a   The artery lining had peeled away and blocked the vessel This kind of injury can result from   for that soothing shampoo at a salon possibly a chiropractor visit   even a coughing fit Or evidently a tough run on a hot day In hindsight all I can think about is the doctors mantra about stroke Time is brain More accurately Time wasted is brain lost It seems to me the hospital staff ramped down their concern about my case just when they should have been swinging into high gear The ultrasound at least confirms there is a serious problem The doctors arrange a transfer to a bigger regional hospital My wife who had been at a job interview has caught up with me and we have an ambulanceandPrius parade to Westchester Medical Center I havent had a stroke yet stroke is loss of brain function But it is coming At the hospital there are more tests and tubes Finally I get intravenous heparin to prevent blood clots but probably too late Im sent to the neurology ward which is a deeply unsettling experience from the start The man in the bed next to mine an actor with an aneurysm alternates between saying hes dying and calling nurses to insist that he needs to leave to get to the set of Boardwalk Empire Late that night I fall asleep to the moaning and howling of an unseen old woman down the hall If you can avoid the neurology ward do so Sometime that night blood clots break away from the damaged artery lining and flow up the middle cerebral artery into my brain I awake to a bad headache a throbbing left eye socket and the realization that three fingers of my right hand arent working Now MRI scans do show damage Ive had a stroke I learn I have to remain in the hospital for a week as Im put on warfarin a blood thinner also used as rat poison A week in the hospital What to do Blog of course I hunt and peck writing a post for my blog   on the need to sustain your health if your broader goal is sustaining a thriving planet I also get focused on   Tapping on my laptop with unfamiliar fingers I learn that   Horner syndrome I find is often     have found the   with  percent of strokes in people younger than  Some stroke specialists who have studied misdiagnosis in stroke victims younger than  have proposed a push for   in staff in hospital emergency departments The American Academy of Neurology has   And I learn of a solution for hospitals like the one in my suburb when they have no stroke specialists on duty telemedicine Through something like Skype on steroids any stroke specialist could provide virtual care in any emergency room The technology is   where it connects big urban teaching hospitals to dispersed rural health care centers that will never have a stroke neurologist Most of the signs of stroke are visual meaning an expert diagnosis and swift application of the right medication are possible without laying on hands I interview Dr Yulun Wang twice first using his technology  with me at a Long Island hospital and Wang in Santa Barbara  and then when I visit his company InTouch Health a few months later Heres Dr Wang describing these tools and the hurdles to wider adoption of the technology The merits of telemedicine seem utterly obvious but I learn that Medicare and insurers dont reimburse for this sort of care with a few exceptions because the doctor is not physically at the bedside Well there was no living breathing stroke specialist at my bedside to bill in those first vital hours Give me a virtual doctor any day There are other impediments to whats called   technology including licensing roadblocks preventing doctors from practicing across state borders You can learn more about research showing the costeffectiveness of telemedicine for stroke and the hurdles to its adoption in   the director of the Mayo Clinic Telestroke Program in Arizona and an author of an important  paper on  After my week in the hospital I dive into my   and   therapy I also make lots of vows  I vow to write a hardhitting print article about stroke care  My wife gives me a card for a personal trainer I start working out  In the interest of not torturing my neck I vow no more redeye flights  Ive played guitar since I was  but never with much discipline I start doing scales So how am I doing Ive stuck with almost none of those commitments Runins with the reaper cut in two directions Part of you swears to slow down to smell the roses to get closer to loved ones But part of you  me anyway  says life is short and tenuous Get everything done now I posted  times to Dot Earth in  The flow of news on my beat pushed my stroke article to the far back burner My workout routine and guitar scales faded Ive taken several redeyes with more coming Im on the run in many ways more than ever But I am humbled by one thing that I learned I was pretty smug once I recovered about having scarfed down those aspirin early on Experts tell me that act probably did mitigate the effects of my stroke My fingers and vision are fine In my later research however I realized that if Id had a bleeding stroke the kind that almost killed Jill Bolte Taylor  the    the aspirin mightve killed me   are of the bleeding variety So yes this was my stroke of luck As it turns out luck played a bigger role in my being here today than Id like to admit
