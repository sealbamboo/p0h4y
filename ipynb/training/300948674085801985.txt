issue of the   The authors noted that antibiotic treatment of   infection does not induce a durable response in
approximately  percent to  percent of patients and that an effective
treatment against recurrent infection does not currently exist Their study compared duodenal infusion of donor feces following a
short course of vancomycin with standard vancomycin treatment with and without
bowel lavage in resolving diarrhea associated with   infection in a population of  patients ages  and older
with recurrent infection after at least one course of adequate antibiotic
therapy and at least  months life expectancy Participants were randomized to one of three treatment groups
 Participants were followed to resolution of infectionrelated diarrhea
without relapse at  weeks Donor feces were collected on the day of infusion and diluted with 
mL of sterile saline stirred strained and kept in a sterile bottle to be
administered through a nasoduodenal tube The tube was removed  minutes after
the infusion and patients were monitored for  hours following the
procedure Outcomes were recorded in participants stool diaries and through
interviews about stool frequency and consistency medication use and adverse
effects at days     and  Stool tests for the bacteria were
performed on the latter four days and on days when diarrhea occurred Of the  patients in the infusion group   percent were
cured after the first infusion of donor feces while an additional
two were treated with feces from a different donor at days   and  and
cured One patient left the study because of a rapid decrease in renal graft
function following the infusion One patient in the vancomycinonly group died of complications
unrelated to drug treatment Infusion therapy with shortterm vancomycin was considered superior to
week vancomycin treatment with and without lavage following the first infusion This
difference grew following the second
infusion Median time to recurrence in the vancomycinwithoutinfusion groups

vancomycin and lavage patients Most patients experienced diarrhea  percent after receiving the
infusion cramping  percent and belching  percent were seen in a
minority of patients Additionally three infusion patients reported
constipation at followup Patients treated with fecal infusion had significantly greater fecal
microbiota diversity after  weeks following treatment becoming undistinguishable from
the fecal microbiota diversity level of the donors The authors noted that the optimal protocol for fecal infusion is not
known but that infusion of a relatively large amount of feces  had an
acceptable adverseevent profile and was logistically
manageable They also noted that the study was limited by the fact that most
patients had had numerous relapses before inclusion in the study despite the
fact that the efficacy of antibiotics declines with subsequent recurrences
Thus they said the efficacy of vancomycin was considerably lower than
expected Source
