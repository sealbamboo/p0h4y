For years now a steady slew of headlines have warned about the dangers of methamphetamine   with many calling meth nicknamed ice crystal or crank the most dangerous drug in America However according to new research from Torontos Centre for Addiction and Mental Health CAMH when it comes to sheer deadliness theres an even bigger threat out there than meth opioids in the journal   the CAMH study compares the risk of death for people dependent on various drugs from meth and opioids to alcohol and marijuana Data was culled from records of  Californians hospitalized for drug addiction between  and  and then matched to state death records Researchers found that among opioid addicts the risk of death was  times higher compared to healthy Californians of the same age gender and race Meth addicts were the second likeliest to expireÂ  with a death rate  times higher than their healthy peers Rounding out the top five were those addicted to cannabis  higher alcohol  higher and cocaine  higher To be clear the CAMH numbers are not saying that   was the most common drug problem As youd probably expect researchers found   was by far the most prevalent substance responsible for hospitalizations But compared to any other drug addiction opioid dependence was associated with the highest number of deaths during the study time frame In this case opioids included both prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin So while meth has grabbed the spotlight opioid addiction especially to popular prescription painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin has quietly grown as a silent scourge The dangers of opioids should not be ignored As we noted in a   late last year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that narcotic pain relievers now cause more than  US deaths a   greater than that of heroin and cocaine combined And while the CAMH study did not examine subjects causes of death that is people may have eventually died as a result of reasons other than drugrelated problems it is yet another indication of the serious potential consequences of opioid addiction One of the more surprising results of the CAMH research perhaps was that cannabis abuse was linked to the thirdhighest likelihood of death At a time when even Pat Robertson is calling for legalization of pot and laws allowing medical use of marijuana are spreading should the CAMH research cause us to think twice about succumbing to reefer madness Not necessarily CAMH study leader Dr Russell Callaghan says in a press release that he too was surprised at the high death rate among cannabis addicts There could be many reasons he explains including the fact that they may have other chronic illnesses such as psychiatric illnesses or AIDS which can also increase the risk of death
