Educational opportunities abound in medicine But it turns out there is exactly nowhere to learn the single hardest skill of all I had been taking care of Shannon for a decade before it dawned on me that if I didnt get up to speed in this particular area fast I might actually kill her I looked in all the usual places I found nothing and no one to help me learn how to sit across from miserable suffering Shannon and do absolutely nothing at all That meant not treating her terrible sinus attacks not investigating her continuing   not medicating her headaches and her crampy hands not addressing her depression her itch her nausea I had I blush to say done all of this and much much more many times over to the tune of several hundred separate prescriptions scans and referrals And at the end of all that frenetic activity nothing much had changed Shannon and I were  years older she was weeping in distress and I was desperately looking up new nasal inhalers Suddenly I knew that it was time to stop doing anything for Shannon for a while but pass her the tissues Doing nothing is different from doing no harm that endlessly advertised professional goal You can do a lot of things and still do no harm  and often not much good either each effort accomplishing little enough that the sum total remains at zero Often by that time the leg or the back or the virus has taken care of itself Doing nothing is also different from handing out placebo medications an ethically complex activity featuring doctor as shaman To really do nothing all shamanic trappings must be abandoned stethoscope prescription pad weighty pronouncements the works And yet  and this is key  doing nothing is also quite different from saying Theres nothing I can do for you goodbye Most doctors are masters of this final nothing But keeping a therapeutic relationship afloat without the usual tools tricks or enticements  that is a rare achievement and surely harder than the hardest microsurgery There are no courses in the art of doing nothing no fellowships Who would sponsor them In fact one might hazard that doing nothing is the most subversive activity in all of modern medicine undermining as it does the agendas of all doctors all patients and all interested corporate parties Doing nothing has no billing code Among more than  million cataloged medical articles I found exactly one that seemed likely to help Published in The Rhode Island Journal of Medicine in  The Art of Doing Nothing  cannot be read online and took a week to arrive via interlibrary loan It proved to be well worth the wait Physicians have been trained to expect the worst of every symptom wrote the author Dr David F Wehlage an Indiana psychiatrist They  do everything to diagnose and treat it without regard for the destructive aspects of doing too much In fact Dr Wehlage pointed out even such simple bromides as take my advice and dont worry can be harmful casting patients in a passive dependent role that undermines their natural problemsolving capabilities The art of doing nothing is learning to help by not doing or advising he wrote The evaluation is the treatment The doctor should avoid asking What can I do The patient should leave the office emptyhanded Do not presuppose that people want something done Do not do something for people they can do themselves Do not presuppose there is something to offer Instead find out what is really going on Shannon was initially not too taken with donothing medical care Understandably she lost no time finding another source for her nasal inhalers and   And yet month after month she kept coming by Our discussions slowly moved away from the nose and the stomach I had grown to detest Doctors who feel they must do something predictably become discouraged confused and angry when their efforts fail Dr Wehlage wrote We talked about other things You know Shannon said after a few months I think I should see a psychiatrist Its not as if I hadnt tried to send to her to a psychiatrist half a dozen times She had broken every appointment This time though she kept the appointment and the next one and the one after that Each was a tiny step in a better direction I stopped feeling guilty when I billed donothing visits as if something had actually happened And then I called Dr Wehlage in Indianapolis to thank him He is retired now and was most surprised to hear from a new reader of the old article It turns out that a missing punctuation mark in the title still bothers him Its not doing nothing  he said Its doing nothing They left out the hyphen I wanted in there You do no tangible thing But you can still do a lot of something
