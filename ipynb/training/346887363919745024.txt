Youve likely heard about the link between  But fresh research ties another dietary pattern to increased risk of the disease too eating too much red meat Its not that we are trying to pick on meat Im a meateater in moderation but the recent studies linking carnivorous habits to health problems seem to be piling up Weve had  and   Now theres a   that links red meat consumption to an increased risk of Type  diabetes The researchers tracked what happens after people changed their meateating habits using data from the Health Professionals Followup Study and the Nurses Health Study which include about  people Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaires Some people in the study increased their red meat consumption and other people decreased their consumption says   of the Harvard School of Public Health one of the coauthors of the paper which appears in   The study found that among those who started eating more red meat about  servings more per week the risk of developing Type  diabetes during four years of followup increased by almost  percent which Hu describes as a really large increase As with previous studies linking red meat to health concerns the researchers found that processed red meats such as hot dogs and bacon were more strongly associated with the risk of diabetes Among those who starting eating less red meat the risk of developing diabetes dropped by about  percent during a year followup period Now to put this study in context its important to point out that the most significant driver of Type  diabetes is body weight People who are overweight and obese are much more likely to develop the condition Since red meat is typically high in calories and fat some experts say that its likely these factors that create the link between heavy red meat consumption and and increased risk of diabetes But in this study the link held up even after the researchers controlled for the role of weight gain And this suggests that theres an independent effect of red meat consumption increasing the risk of diabetes Its not clear whats happening in the body but there are a few theories Its possible that heavy red meat consumption can lead to iron overload which sets the stage for insulin resistance Its also possible that compounds called   play a role Our understanding is that especially when they occur in processed meats these nitrosamines can cause inflammation explains   who directs the diabetes center at Massachusetts General Hospital And theres also some evidence that nitrosamines can damage the cells in the pancreas that make insulin But experts say more research is needed to understand these connections In the meantime Nathan says his advice is to pay attention to the big picture If you like the occasional hot dog thats OK Its the overall pattern of eating and maintaining a healthy weight thats most important Red meat should be considered in the setting of a balanced diet says Nathan
