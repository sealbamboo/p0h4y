In common with many people diagnosed with HIV in the s Danny West thought he had just months to live  He became ill watched friends die and prepared for his own demise at the hands of what was then an unknown virus Nearly  years on Danny who is from London is one of the longestsurviving people in the world with HIV  He is part of a growing group of around  adults aged over  receiving care for human immunodeficiency virus in the UK many of them kept alive thanks to improvements in drug treatments Recently the UN called for the ageing of the HIV epidemic to be taken seriously It wants more services to be made available to this age group who are now facing old age But for many life with HIV has been an emotional and physical rollercoaster Danny says he never thought hed see  I was given a year at most I was  Id just got my social work qualification and my foot on the career ladder and it was all whipped away in one moment There was no treatment then Over the next two years after my diagnosis all of my peers died Everyone went down like cards My community was gone Danny has never been able to get a mortgage and does not have a pension Despite working in the public sector and for HIV charities for many years he has no idea what the future holds I havent prepared myself psychologically for growing older My body is ageing faster than a normal persons Ive got arthritis and osteoporosis and I live in constant physical pain But the real issue for me is poverty  I dont know how I will cope financially  A recent study of people over  living with HIV by the Terence Higgins Trust an HIV charity found that Dannys concerns were not unusual  showed that older people with HIV are financially disadvantaged compared with their peers and have serious worries about money poor health housing and social care Lisa Power policy director at THT says this is because many people became ill and had to give up work after their diagnosis Others sold up cashed in their pensions went round the world and waited to die As brilliant antiretroviral drugs started prolonging lives she says benefits were cut for people who hadnt made provision for their old age leaving many of the older HIV group living on a basic state pension We found huge poverty in our study particularly among those who thought they had a death sentence Now were coming round to understanding that people with HIV have a normal life expectancy For those diagnosed in recent years the treatment is straight forward and they can carry on working and raise a family But for those diagnosed back in the s the HIV journey has been considerably more traumatic Doctors still do not yet fully understand the impact of HIV on the ageing process Some health problems in older HIV patients may be related to the early treatments they received which had significant and sometimes toxic side effects rather than the virus itself But there is generally thought to be an increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart disease strokes and cancers in people with HIV Dr David Asboe a consultant in HIV medicine and sexual health at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and chairman of the British HIV Association says more than half of the HIV patients he sees are over the age of  and some are even in their s The earlier they are diagnosed the earlier we can get them into treatment and thats important If there is a delay then thats when the mortality risk increases The psychological effects of HIV on this group are all too obvious he says They should be able to work but there is a real loss of confidence and it can change the way people consider relationships with their family and wider society HIV charities say that healthcare professionals such as GPs need to understand more about HIV and home carers should be given more training Too often patients dont have the confidence to disclose their status to their doctor or talk about their problems Danny says that previously any health problems he had would have been dealt with by a specialist consultant but changes mean that he now has to see his GP first for everything which is unhelpful and frustrating According to Lisa Power there are still too many myths surrounding HIV and more public awareness is needed One group thinks there is a cure for it another thinks its a death sentence The reality is that people with HIV have a managed chronic condition  but they also have a life Danny has recently been forced to moved into damp cold social housing in an area where he knows noone where he is facing the future with HIV alone I dont have a picture of what I will be doing in the next  years There are lots of uncertainties and unknowns I live in fear of ill health poverty and isolation Thats what I lie in bed thinking and worrying about
