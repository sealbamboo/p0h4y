On American Indian reservations the traditional diet of wild plants and game for food is increasingly being replaced with a far less healthful diet of predominantly highcarb highsugar foods Along the way obesity and type  diabetes rates have soared At nearly  percent American Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest prevalence of diabetes among all US racial and ethnic groups   the American Diabetes Association While researchers have long suspected that the traditional plant foods consumed by Native American tribes in the Northern Plains were super nutritious no one had ever really studied it Thats what inspired a   published earlier this year in the   by a group of researchers at Virginia Tech and the US Department of Agriculture They analyzed the nutrients in  traditional wild food plants from three Native American reservations in North Dakota They found that reintroducing these plants  which include cattail broad leaf shoots chokecherries beaked hazelnuts lambsquarters plains prickly pear prairie turnips stinging nettles wild plums raspberries and rose hips  into the diet of the tribes of the region could improve nutrition and potentially prevent disease The superstar of the study was lambsquarters a wild green thats been consumed by huntergatherers from northern California all the way to Africa for food as well as medicine The study found that one serving of steamed lambsquarters contained more than  percent of the thiamin  percent of the vitamin B  percent of the calcium and  percent of the magnesium of the daily recommended intake Prickly pears prairie turnips and hazelnuts also performed well in the tests  with high levels of calcium and magnesium Will these foods make a comeback on reservations Thats unclear but the researchers say they shared their findings with tribal leaders on the reservations where they collected samples And Native Americans arent the only ones who may be feeling a twinge of nutritional nostalgia An appreciation for the health benefits of wild greens is part of whats driving   in cities and beyond As Jo Robinson argued in her  book   many wild plants are in many ways far more healthful than the stuff we buy today at farmers markets Take dandelions for example Compared to spinach one of our presentday superfoods dandelion leaves have eight times more antioxidants two times more calcium three times more vitamin A and five times more vitamin K and vitamin E Robinson writes Our modern superfoods would have been substandard fare for huntergatherers
