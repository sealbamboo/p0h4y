In November more than  million Los Angeles County voters passed the Safer Sex in the Adult Film Industry Act The new law orders porn actors to wear condoms during sex scenes The porn industry has been sending a very bad message by saying the only kind of sex thats hot is unsafe says Michael Weinstein CEO of the Los Angelesbased AIDS Healthcare Foundation which sponsored the measure Sitting in his office just over the hills from the nations porn film capital Weinstein says the new law was meant to protect both performers and those who watch the movies Ive been called a condom Nazi So be it Weinstein says The reality is the most effective method of preventing sexually transmitted disease is condoms This lowly piece of latex  its amazing its still so controversial he says Lawyers for the adult entertainment industry in Los Angeles are now challenging the measure Some porn producers plan to argue in District Court that the new law violates their First Amendment rights We do produce constitutionally protected material says Steven Hirsch who heads the production company Vivid Entertainment We just dont believe theres any compelling government interest to come in and take away our freedom of expression considering  that over the last eight years there have been over  adult scenes shot with not a single transmission of HIV Hirsch argues that viewers dont want to watch performers using condoms He says  years ago when he briefly made his company condommandatory sales dropped by  percent The performers dont want it the producers dont want it and   the fans dont want it Hirsch says Another plaintiff in the lawsuit adult star Kayden Kross says every performer she knows agrees that condoms are extremely irritating during shoots We have the right to use condoms she says I did my first scene in  with condoms and that was the last scene I did with condoms because it was so uncomfortable Like her coworkers Kross says she gets tested for sexually transmitted diseases regularly  in her case every  days Before every shoot actors show their test results to the producers and to each other Kross says they dont feel they need to be protected by a votermandated law Were the most tested population in the world We are more aware of our bodies than anyone else Kross says We eat organically and work out and we take care of ourselves and take care of ourselves and take care of ourselves And obviously as an extension of that we make sure that we are sexually free of diseases at all times While the new law goes through the courts LA County officials are struggling with how they might enforce it So far the county health department has sent letters asking producers to apply for special film permits Kross and Hirsch make fun of the idea of a condom unit policing every porn set lifting the covers to inspect Will we be required to wear hazmat suits they say The state of California has been working with adult film producers for the past few years on how to follow protocols They could do simulation so there wasnt any exposure or they can use condoms says Deborah Gold the deputy chief for health and engineering services for CalOSHA which regulates occupational safety and health for California They have to do some form of protection Its a requirement to use engineering and work practice controls to prevent this contact Gold says And where the contact still exists to use personal protective equipment Gold says her department will respond to complaints on porn shoots but there are no spot inspections We have to find the actual employer she explains So the name on the DVD box or the website  it may require substantial investigation on our part to get down to who is the employer Attorneys for the pornography industry expect to move the case to the courts within the next month Meanwhile Hirsch says production companies are not going to pay LA County for any special permits And Kross says producers will go underground or move out of California rather than comply with any condom laws Part of the culture of porn is Eh well see if they catch us  says Kross Which is terrible to say but also true Were kind of like the renegade We do what we want Were the Wild West  Everyones like Catch me if you can
