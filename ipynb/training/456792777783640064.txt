So I did just that I pushed forward I started a   in Saoirses honor helped my husband start a business called   to distribute products I had made for her when she was sick and gave birth to our second child Life seemed to be moving in the right direction I felt great and while there was always a little voice telling me remission wasnt a guarantee I thought that I had made all the necessary changes in my lifestyle to keep me cancerfree forever Then in one instant of excruciating pain that belief that everything was going to be OK was gone A kidney stone sent me to the ER When the doctor came back with the CT results I wasnt expecting the words that would come out of her mouth You have a millimeter kidney stone But you also have some swollen lymph nodes next to your aorta They were flagged by the radiologist because of your history The world went silent which is a feat considering I was sitting in a busy ER Im pretty sure I stared dumbfounded at the doctor for at least a minute unmoving Lymph nodes Swollen Those words stuck in my head While I did my best to believe that followup tests would be negative in the back of my mind I knew The cancer was back I was sent home to pass my kidney stone and to start the excruciating process of figuring out what the heck was going on inside my body First came the scans  CT and PET Then a biopsy Waiting for test results takes an extreme emotional toll With every day that passed I grew more anxious and more unfocused The news came at lunchtime on a Tuesday six weeks after that fateful ER trip They are calling it a Hodgkins lymphoma the doctor said All I could say was OK I was numb Then frustration set in quickly followed by extreme annoyance How could this be happening again I didnt have time to deal with cancer I had a foundation to run a business to help with and first and foremost an monthold to take care of When I set out to fix something I do it right I think this is why my cancer relapse hit me so hard It means I have to go back to the drawing board and start again Its a feeling of failure that is hard to overcome I have tried not to let my family and friends see my disappointment but it has been almost impossible to hide  This time cancer isnt the unknown beast it was the first time I was diagnosed This time cancer was the nagging neighbor who finally moved and put their house on the market and then decided to come back instead of paying closing costs Relapse is a fear of the known I know what chemo feels like I know the nausea the hair loss the numbness the fatigue the burning veins and the pain I know that chemo can take me from feeling great to feeling like crap in less than four hours I know what highdose chemo does to a patient whose only wish is to live a little bit longer Ive seen quality of life stripped away for a chance at a few more months and the everdiminishing chance of a cure With that knowledge came a major decision Should I give in and allow myself to be thrown back into the chaos of toxic therapy  or defy the fear and find a better way During the six weeks I waited for my test results I started to think about talk about and research different treatment options I wasnt comfortable doing chemotherapy again as I knew the treatment would be much more intense and toxic than what I had already been through When relapse was confirmed my general practitioner told me about   I did more research and made more phone calls It just felt right My doctors are on board especially since I have a slowgrowing disease While some may not understand my choice to forgo conventional treatment this time around Im determined not to be scared into toxic therapy This is a chance to take back control of my body Im determined to beat cancer and I know that I am strong enough to do so After all I did it once before
