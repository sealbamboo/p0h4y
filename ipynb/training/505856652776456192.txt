After  days in Liberia NPR producer Nicole Beemsterboer has just landed in London You dont realize how much has been hanging over your head until youre out she says Shes talking about Ebola the virus raging in Liberia as well as Sierra Leone and Guinea It was silent and invisible she says So youre always on edge always careful I got used to not touching anyone no handshakes And there are buckets of chlorine solution everywhere  outside every office building police station government office hotel store Everywhere I washed my hands dozens of times a day and was careful never to touch my face At government buildings officials watch you wash your hands and then take your temperature with an eargun thermometer They write your temperature on a piece of paper and actually staple it to your lapel so its visible to everyone inside You cant get in the building if you have a temperature and it sends a message Were being vigilant you need to be vigilant too Hold yourself and others accountable We were concerned that if anything was contaminated it was the bottom of our boots so we were constantly rinsing them in the chlorine solution I dont know that we started a trend but on the last day we were there our hotel added a shoe wash  a box with a big foam pad inside soaked in chlorine so you didnt have to soak your shoes but were getting enough chlorine on the soles to decontaminate them We started seeing this more and more at   and other places around the city Only minor ones and under the threat of Ebola they didnt bother me at all All my clothes are spattered with bleach I would dry my hands on my pants my pants have bleach stains all over them And it did smell like a pool everywhere you went For people in Monrovia if they do show symptoms there are still limited options for where they can go The   Doctors Without Borders facility is expanding but as soon as they have more beds they are immediately filled There simply isnt enough room for all the people who are sick and until there are people who get sick will stay home get sicker and put those around them at risk  started this job because it paid well and now they are complete converts to the fact that Ebola is real and that it is putting people at risk They know if the contaminated bodies arent removed they put other people at extreme risk and they are trying to spread the word Its become a passion for them These kids  the youngest is  the oldest   looked so alone and heartbroken and you could see they had no idea what they were going to do next Instead of anyone comforting them there were people from the body collector team saying If any of you touched your mom you need to go right now to be tested for Ebola It was as if they were being sentenced to death When we landed in Casablanca instead of someone taking your temperature with the ear gun they had us stand about  feet away from a staff person in nurses scrubs in front of an infrared camera If anyone does have a fever the airport staff doesnt have to be anywhere near you
