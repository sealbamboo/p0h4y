A new analysis of more than  million breast cancer patients in the US found that  of women who were eligible for breastconserving surgery wound up getting mastectomies in  the most recent year for which data were available Thats up from  in   an increase large enough to be statistically significant according to a   published Wednesday in JAMA Surgery Among the women who had mastectomies during the year study period  had total mastectomies  had modified radical mastectomies and  had radical mastectomies But most of the overall increase in mastectomies could be traced to the  who opted for bilateral mastectomies In  these procedures accounted for only  of all mastectomies by  that figure had risen to  In a bilateral mastectomy surgeons remove not only the breast with an earlystage tumor but the tumorfree breast as well This option also called contralateral prophylactic mastectomy or CPM has become increasingly popular in recent years and doctors are struggling to understand why Longterm tracking of breast cancer patients has shown that women diagnosed with earlystage tumors fare just as well with the more limited breastconserving surgery as they do with mastectomies For instance a   of California breast cancer patients published this year in JAMA found that the year survival rate for women who had breastconserving surgery  was essentially the same as for women who chose CPM  and slightly better than for women who had a single mastectomy  But most women dont seem to realize that they can save their breasts without putting their health at risk experts say In the California study the proportion of California women who picked CPM grew from  in  to  in  despite the favorable performance of breastconserving surgery Doctors from Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center and several Harvardaffiliated schools and hospitals developed a lengthy survey to understand the motivations of younger women between the ages of  and  who decided to treat their earlystage breast cancers by removing both breasts The   that  of the women felt it was extremely important or very important to eliminate the risk of developing a future cancer in their healthy breast  felt the procedure would give them peace of mind and  thought it would improve their odds for a a cure according to a  report in Annals of Internal Medicine The authors of the new report from Vanderbilt University in Nashville say the reasons for CPMs growing appeal remain unclear but their data offer some hints Among the  million women in their study those who had any kind of mastectomy instead of breastconserving surgery were more likely to have tumors that were larger or more invasive though all of the cancers were at an early stage The women were also more likely to be young to have other health problems to live in places where people had less education and to be from the South Although there is no ideal mastectomy rate for earlystage breast cancers the  rate of  may be too high the authors warn The   from the American College of Surgeons recommends that no more than  of patients with earlystage breast cancer have mastectomies while the recommended cap in Europe is only  Current US rates probably would not meet the European benchmark the researchers wrote
