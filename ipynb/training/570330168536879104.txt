Greater Manchester is to become the first English region to get full control of its health spending as part of an extension of devolved powers Chancellor George Osborne said the bn health and social care budget would be taken over by the regions councils and health groups Mr Osborne said it was a really exciting development A Labour spokesman said NHS workers would want to be persuaded of the case for a new layer of management The plan will come into force from April   Mr Osborne added This is what the NHS wants to see as part of its own future  And its also about giving people in Manchester greater control over their own affairs in that city which is central to our vision of the northern powerhouse so its a very exciting development The plan would see local leaders and ultimately   control how budgets are allocated The government hopes integrating health and social care services will ease pressure on hospitals and help to improve home care services for patients who need it A shadow Greater Manchester Health and Wellbeing board will be appointed which will work closely with existing clinical commissioning groups of GPs The board is expected to run from April before control of the budget is handed over a year later Manchester City Council confirmed  local authorities  clinical commissioning groups  NHS partners NHS England and the government are in discussions on a groundbreaking agreement for health and social care Reacting to the proposals Andy Burnham Labours shadow health secretary said This has to be a solution that works everywhere or that could be offered to everywhere If youre going to stick to the idea of a national health service you cant have a Swiss cheese NHS where some bits of the system are operating to different rules or have different powers and freedoms I am a bit worried what Im hearing because it does point to further breakup of the idea of the National Health Service  Sir Richard Leese leader of Manchesters Labourcontrolled council said I had a long conversation with Andy Burnham today and I think he raises a number of legitimate questions But I have to say that they are questions that we as local authorities and the clinical commissioning groups are asking as well Ever since the NHS was created in  it has remained separate from the councilrun care system that oversees help in the home with tasks such as washing and dressing and care home places But as the decades have gone by and health care has shifted from curing illnesses to helping people manage longterm conditions such as dementia and heart disease there has been an increasing sense that the two systems need to become more joined up All three main political parties have their own ideas of how this should be done  and NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens signalled his support for greater integration with the publication of his   last autumn But Greater Manchester has taken the bull by the horns and proposed a pooling of budgets At this stage and it must be said the details are still emerging it seems to mirror what is being rolled out in Scotland and what has happened in Northern Ireland since the s So will this catch on across the rest of England It could be argued it already has From April there will be small pooled budgets in all  local authority areas  including the  boroughs in Greater Manchester  as part of the governments Better Care Fund initiative They will be worth bn in total  That represents less than  of the combined spending on health and care nationally but is clearly a step towards full integration Richard Humphries assistant director of the Kings Fund think tank said a full transfer of responsibility would be a reform on a breathtaking scale but could pose serious risks Speaking on BBC Radio s Today programme he said Depending on the detail  and the detail is really crucial and we dont have that yet  you could either see this as a triumph for local democracy or creating real risks of yet another reorganisation of the NHS when its barely recovered from the last one Councillor Mike Connolly Labour leader of Bury Council said Those decisions need to be made in Greater Manchester and not Westminster and I welcome any form of devolution to the city region We are all agreed certainly in the Labour Party that health and social care must be integrated because its about providing that primary care  and it can only be good for healthcare across Greater Manchester In November Mr Osborne announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester to preside over regional issues  The move agreed with leaders of the regions councils will give local politicians greater control over billions of pounds of public money If the initial devolution deal for Greater Manchester was ground breaking then this development changes the shape of local government in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few months ago By taking control of the entire NHS budget the areas  councils and the  Clinical Commissioning Groups and then ultimately the elected mayor will be able to join up health and social care in a way thats never been possible before In addition to control of the bn of budgets agreed last year for skills and training transport and planning the bn that comes with this deal means local politicians will decide how more than a quarter of government money is spent in their area Local politicians describe the move as an incredible opportunity but it also comes with risks with just over a year to plan before the money and a huge amount of new responsibility is handed over Greater Manchester must ready itself to break more new ground as devolution picks up pace
