When the blood pressure drug Bystolic hit the market in  it faced a crowded field of cheap generics So its maker Forest Laboratories launched a promotional assault on the group in the best position to determine Bystolics success those in control of prescription pads It flooded the offices of health professionals with drug reps and it hired doctors to persuade their peers to choose Bystolic  even though the drug hadnt proved more effective than competitors The strategy worked In the  fiscal year sales of Bystolic reached  million almost double its total from two years earlier the company reported Now data obtained and analyzed by ProPublica suggest another factor in Bystolics rapid success Many of the drugs top prescribers have financial ties to Forest At least  of the top  Bystolic prescribers in   in  have been paid by Forest to deliver promotional talks In  they together received  for speeches and more than  in meals Nearly all those doctors were again among the highest prescribers in  the most recent year for which Medicare data are available Forest began disclosing its payments only last year the company didnt specify which drugs doctors spoke about Dr Bernard Lo who was chairman of a   in medicine said he doesnt believe the findings are coincidental When theres no evidence a drug is better You have to question Why are doctors prescribing this said Lo president of the   a New York City nonprofit that funds bioethics research What your evidence suggests is that there is a financial incentive for doctors who receive payments from drug companies for pitching their products Until now doctors prescribing habits have been secret from all but pharmaceutical companies which pay millions of dollars for such information from other firms that collect it ProPublicas analysis marks the first time anyone has matched payment data made public by drug companies with physician prescribing records from the Medicare drug program which covers about  out of every  prescriptions in the US Readers can search for Medicare prescribers in our   news app and for drug company payments to doctors and other health professionals in   Reporters identified the drugs that were most actively promoted to doctors in  and  using rankings from Cegedim Strategic Data a company that tracks marketing expenses The top prescribers of some of these drugs in addition to Bystolic also received speaking payments from the companies that made them As a group these heavily marketed drugs were new or had new uses were expensive and often showed little benefit over existing medications or generics For example nine of the top  prescribers of the Alzheimers drug   received money from Novartis the drugs maker Eight of the top  for Johnson  Johnson painkiller   were paid speakers as were six of the top  for Pfizers antidepressant   The same was true for seven of the  top prescribers of the asthma drug   made by GlaxoSmithKline One doctor made more than  from  to  Many of the physicians spoke for several drug companies If financial relationships influence physicians to choose pricier brandname drugs that have little benefit over generics everyone pays the cost  particularly taxpayers who spent  billion last year subsidizing Medicare Part D Ive never heard a doctor that said they were influenced but obviously the companies are interested in doing it because the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that doctors   influenced said Rita Redberg a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and editor of the journal   Companies are not doing it for any reason except it improves their bottom line she said A   in the   in  found that physicians with industry relationships said they were more likely to prescribe a brandname drug when a generic was available And federal whistleblower lawsuits against several pharmaceutical companies have alleged that payments are little more than thinly veiled kickbacks which are illegal Companies have paid billions of dollars to settle the cases Each of the top  prescribers of Bystolic wrote at least  prescriptions in Part D in  ProPublica attempted to contact all those who also received money from Forest Only a handful responded to phone calls emails and faxed letters requesting comment The No  prescriber of Bystolic Los Angeles cardiologist Gary Reznik said that if patients have blood pressure under control with another beta blocker he doesnt switch them But he believes Bystolic is more effective at lowering blood pressure and doesnt cause the slower heart rate and erectile dysfunction of other drugs in the class If you dont have to be on a beta blocker I would not start you on a beta blocker said Reznik who was paid  to give talks by Forest in  If you have to have a beta blocker Bystolic would be my choice Reznik prescribed the drug more than  times in  and more than  in  including refills dispensed Medicare records show I have never felt that there were any expectations or pressure on the part of the company that I would prescribe it more or at all he said Another top prescriber internist Mark Barats of West Hollywood Calif said he uses smaller doses of Bystolic to achieve the same effects as higher doses of generic medications It has much less side effects particularly much less side effects on the respiratory system he said Ive never seen anything that contradicts what Forest said about Bystolic said Barats who was paid  to speak for Forest in  Dr Henry Yee who was paid  by Forest said he chooses the drug for many of the same reasons as Reznik and Barats The cardiologist whose office is in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra said he learned about the drug from company sales reps and from reading studies He started prescribing it even before I started speaking for the company he added Yee said he believes drug companies ask him to speak for their products because he is an influential specialist in his community I think it is most likely because a lot of doctors listen to me he said Among the  top prescribers with Forest ties speaking payments ranged from  to  Seven doctors also received at least  in Forestpaid meals But several prominent cardiologists say no studies have proved that the benefits cited by Bystolics top prescribers are real Dr Steve Nissen chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic said he understands why doctors would like to believe that the beta blocker has additional benefits Wishing it to happen isnt the same as proving it he said In  the US Food and Drug Administration   claiming the drug was novel and superior to other products The FDA said the claim wasnt factual I dont see any purpose for Bystolic whatsoever said Eric Topol a cardiologist and chief academic officer of Scripps Health a San Diegobased health system Topol said he doesnt use the drug because it is expensive with no added benefit I have no idea how you could come up with a storyline for use of that drug Bystolic costs about  per month compared with less than  for a generic cousin according to Costcos pharmacy website Patient copays vary by drug plan In an email a Forest representative called Bystolic an important treatment option because it is effective and welltolerated but didnt assert that the drug was superior Forest also defended its spending on physician speakers The company believes that patients benefit from paid talks and other initiatives that enable health care professionals to stay abreast of the latest treatment options available a representative wrote Three years ago   to settle civil and criminal allegations about its marketing of drugs among other things In its lawsuit   that Forest made cash payments disguised as grants or consulting fees expensive meals and lavish entertainment and other valuable goods and services to doctors Forest denied those allegations despite settling the case More recently in a lawsuit   the US government alleged the companys own internal analyses showed that speaker programs had a high return on investment in terms of the additional prescriptions for its drugs written by the doctors who participated in the programs both as speakers and attendees with the highest return arising from payments to doctors as honoraria for speaking Novartis disputed the allegations In    and paid  million to settle allegations that it illegally promoted Trileptal an antiseizure drug and paid kickbacks for prescribing it and other drugs Trileptal isnt frequently used in the Medicare population Forest Novartis and other drugmakers said they choose speakers based on their expertise and credentials Pfizer explicitly prohibits the selection of speakers based on their prescribing behavior  any inference to the contrary is misleading a spokesman wrote in an email Glaxo and Johnson  Johnson also said they dont choose speakers based on prescribing The spending by pharmaceutical companies on speaking and consulting fluctuates based on whether they have new drugs or are marketing older ones for new uses To date only  companies have publicly reported their payments to physicians All companies will be required to report such payments next year under the   a part of the broader  health overhaul law Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals the maker of the blood thinner Pradaxa   Pradaxa introduced in  accounted for more spending on local promotional events than any other drug in  according to Cegedim Strategic Data Of the top  prescribers in  six received speaking fees in the first quarter of this year Boehringer said it doesnt pay speakers based on prescribing The physician prescription tallies in this story are from Medicare Part D records in  Recently obtained data for  show similar patterns however The prescription counts dont include drugs paid for by other parts of Medicare or for patients with private insurance on Medicaid or in the Veterans Health Administration system Some doctors say the drug company money can undermine patients trust Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic said I dont want the patient sitting opposite to me in the exam room to have to worry about whether I am prescribing a drug because I am being paid by the company that makes the drug
