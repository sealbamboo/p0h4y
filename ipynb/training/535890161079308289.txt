Walking is a simple thing that becomes really really important as we age Being able to get around on our feet for extended periods of time not only makes everyday life easier its   to fewer hospitalizations and greater longevity As we get older though the body takes about  to  percent more energy to cover the same terrain And that can be a problem says   a kinesiologist at Humboldt State University in Arcata Calif If people have more fatigue they have less desire to participate in walking he tells Shots Its easy to see how this becomes a downward spiral of feeling too tired while walking then not walking and getting even more out of shape Heres something that can prevent that slide running Older people who regularly ran for exercise had walking economy similar to much younger people according to a   by Ortega and colleagues at Humboldt State and the University of Colorado Boulder Older people who walked for exercise however while they were undoubtedly reaping the other benefits of walking had walking economy similar to older sedentary adults In other words the walking didnt beget more efficient walking while running did The   published Thursday in   took  men and  women with an average age of  who were already consistent runners or walkers Participants walked on special treadmills at three different speeds and had their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production measured during their sessions The runners consumed  to  percent less energy than the walkers Importantly there werent any apparent biomechanical differences between the groups such as differences in stride time or stride frequency that might account for the results If your car is using more gas to get down the road you check to see if your brakes are rubbing or if theres anything mechanical that might explain what were seeing explains Justus So the brakes arent rubbing The next question is What is it about the engine using the fuel he says One hypothesis is that the runners were more efficient at the cellular process that turns oxygen into ATP the chemical form of energy that fuels the muscle fibers to move Theres evidence to show that process is impaired with natural aging says Justus And research   that aerobic exercise can counteract that process Its not  percent clear thats whats going on here Another possible factor is muscle coactivation older adults tend to use more muscles to perform the same movement than do younger people perhaps to stabilize the joints Its quite possible that runners who are used to spending more time on one foot use fewer muscles to perform a given movement than the walkers That might contribute to their lower use of energy says Justus So the next step he says is to analyze their data to see how muscle coactivation might be a factor Other future experiments might look at other activities that are also more aerobically intense than regular walking such as cycling or even very fast walking to see if they might offer some protection Its really important to mention that this research cant prove that running actually caused the better walking economy Study subjects were already doing their preferred form of exercise before they entered the study and its possible that the runners had greater walking efficiency for some other reason And by no means should this turn anyone off walking says Ortega The   you reap from walking are enormous he says But older folks who run may be getting a leg up on at least one element of walking performance
