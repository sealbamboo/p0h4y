Unions have reacted with anger to news of a fresh round of belowinflation pay rises for NHS staff in England Ministers have announced a basic  pay rise but the  nurses and other staff receiving automatic progressioninjob increases typically worth over  will not get the  as well  The main health service unions in England said they would consult members on taking industrial action Members of the armed forces prison officers and judges are due  rises The Consumer Prices Index CPI measure of inflation is currently at  and the NHS pay review body had recommended that all NHS staff should get a  pay rise  whether they were also entitled to progression pay increases or not  The Scottish government has said it will adopt the NHS pay review bodys recommendations in full meaning that all NHS staff in Scotland will receive the  pay rise In addition NHS staff in Scotland earning under  a year will get a  rise  The devolved governments in Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet announced whether they will follow suit  But   implementing the pay bodys recommendations in England would be unaffordable and would risk the quality of patient care  He told BBC Radio s The World at One around  nursing job would have had to be cut if everyone in the NHS had got the  rise He said The whole progression pay system is mad I mean someone on a  salary will get a  progression pay rise whereas someone on  would only get a  progression pay rise It shouldnt just be about time served it should be about how well you look after patients Unisons Christina McAnea accused the government of mixing up annual pay rises with the increments designed to reflect the growing skills and experience of nurses and other healthcare workers They are not a substitute for the annual pay rise that is needed to meet the increasing cost of living she said   If the government is set on imposing this change it clearly doesnt understand how increments work  As it stands they save the NHS money but if this divisive plan goes ahead Unison will be arguing strongly that staff should be paid the full rate for the job from day one I am appalled that this coalition government can openly boast about the economic recovery and claim that we are all feeling the benefits and then treat health workers so shoddily But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander claimed that the progression pay increases were often worth  and were awarded simply because of time served in the job to more than half of NHS workers  He told the BBC The extra  should be confined to those who otherwise wouldnt see any pay rise at all  Thats what the country can afford  He conceded this was a very modest increase but said We had two years of a pay freeze where people who worked for the government didnt get any pay rise at all  except those who receive these increments who continued to get those even during the years of the pay freeze Pay restraint had to be a big part of resolving the huge financial problems we have as a country he added Rachel Maskell of Unite the union which represents  NHS workers told the BBC that the pay offer was the straw that breaks the camels back  a step too far  People have got a right to stand up for their terms and conditions and the government over the years have taken advantage of the fact that people are professional at their work they are predominantly women workers and have made a calculation that they can abuse their staff over their pay she said  Enough is enough and our members are saying they want consultation over industrial action  The government said the  pay offer for  which is to nonpensionable earnings would be followed up with a  pay offer for  also to nonpensionable earnings and also excluding those getting incremental increases  It urged unions to forgo progression pay increases for a year in  in exchange for applying the  rise across the board to the pensionable salary of NHS staff  Separately Mr Alexander has also announced that government departments were not contributing enough to their employees pension funds  A detailed review of NHS teachers and civil service pension schemes was not due to be published until later in the spring he said  But it is already clear that these will show the level of contributions paid by employers have not been sufficient to meet the full longterm costs of these schemes  If current rates were allowed to continue the shortfall would be nearly bn a year across the teachers civil service and NHS schemes The government is therefore taking corrective action and will introduce new higher employer contribution rates for these schemes from  This will ensure that the contributions paid by public service employers reflect the full costs of the schemes including the costs of the deficits that have arisen since previous valuations This will not have any impact on existing pensioners on member benefits or on the contributions paid by employees in those schemes Instead it will ensure that pension costs are properly met by employers and do not fall as an additional cost to the taxpayer  But Brian Strutton of the GMB union said the pensions announcement was a con trick to justify the harsh NHS pay announcement by suggesting that the cost of pensions had increased  But that is not the case There are no extra costs Lets not be fooled there is no justification for the NHS pay review body being overruled The government also said that GPs in England would see an increase of  to their income adding that there would also be movement in their expenses  The British Medical Associations Mark Porter predicted that GPs would be unfairly hit by the changes  Despite delivering substantial efficiency savings while at the same time facing ever increasing workload pressures and patient demand todays announcement will continue to see practice income eroded as practice expenses increase disproportionately to income he said  Mr Alexander said it would be left to individual departments in Whitehall to decide whether to offer senior civil servants the  pay rise  Police and crime commissioners who oversee the  police forces in England and Wales are not due to receive the  pay increase The pay offer for prison officers is also relevant to England and Wales only  Salaries for police officers council workers and teachers are determined in a separate process
