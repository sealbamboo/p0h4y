The Welsh NHS is paying for some cardiac patients to be treated at a private clinic in Bristol to reduce the waiting list it has emerged  It comes as surgeons in Wales say they are still waiting for answers over what is being done about heart patients dying while waiting for operations The Royal College of Surgeons RCS wrote to Health Inspectorate Wales HIW in July last year Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar AM has accused ministers of hypocrisy The Welsh government said it had agreed the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee WHSSC could buy cardiac surgery services from Spire Hospital Bristol and three NHS facilities in England until  September Health Minister Mark Drakeford has given his consent to a deal by the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee WHSSC hosted by Cwm Taf involving about  patients from south Wales WHSSC interim director Stephen Harrhy said We have commissioned extra capacity in England this financial year and in  to help reduce long waiting times for patients in south Wales Cardiologists are reviewing their patients to identify those most at risk and offer them the alternative option of treatment in Bristol Birmingham or London  Patients will also continue to be treated in south Wales We know the quality of cardiac surgery in south Wales is excellent and outcomes for patients are very good but we need to increase capacity to meet current and future demand  We have a mediumterm plan to increase both surgical and critical care capacity in south Wales and we are committed to a twoyear plan to reduce waiting times In  the Welsh government said local health boards should explore all possible ways of meeting targets including private clinics in the separate field of orthopaedic surgery But the then health minister Lesley Griffiths said the private sector should only be considered in the short term as a last option  Mr Millar said the cardiac surgery deal signed off by the current health minister was the height of cynicism and hypocrisy He said This is an admission that there are severe problems in meeting the demand for cardiac services in Wales and that the Royal College of Surgeons is right that patients are dying waiting too long for treatment The Royal College of Surgeons first raised these concerns six months ago and Labour ministers simply sat on their hands Yet on the very day that the Royal College of Surgeons raises further concerns in the media the Welsh Labour government slips out information about a contract with a private hospital in Bristol despite its previous ideological pledge to keep the independent sector out of the NHS News of the deal emerged as the RCS returned to its concerns saying it was still waiting for answers over what is being done HIW has said it will respond in due course The University Hospital of Wales UHW in Cardiff and Morriston Hospital in Swansea are the two centres in Wales where heart patients who need specialist treatment and cardiac surgery are referred A Welsh government spokesperson said The quality of cardiac surgery in south Wales is very good as are the outcomes for patients  However we also know there is not enough capacity to meet current demand which is why we have already put in place a number of immediate steps to speed up treatment including offering patients treatment at other cardiac centres and undertaking surgery at weekend  In the longer term we are further investing in increase capacity to Wales The concern over heart patients follows a row over   at Welsh hospitals in general
