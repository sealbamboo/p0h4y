Peanut allergy has become a nemesis for increasing numbers of children and parents in recent years forcing them to maintain nutfree households and prompting many schools to ban a childhood staple peanut butter from the lunchroom When a child is allergic to peanuts families must closely monitor everything the child eats both in and outside the home because accidental consumption of peanuts could prove fatal Many airlines no longer offer peanuts for fear that an allergic passenger might inhale peanut dust and suffer a lifethreatening reaction at  feet The prevalence of peanut allergy among children in the United States has risen more than threefold to  percent in  from  percent in  according to a   by food allergists at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City Many people with an allergy to peanuts are also allergic to one or more tree nuts like walnuts pecans or almonds To help protect such people from inadvertent exposure to nuts   often voluntarily state whether they were prepared in a facility that also processes nuts Some cities have nutfree bakeries that now sell products safe for allergic children who can bring their own special albeit expensive cake or cupcake to a party While experts doubt the necessity of some extreme measures taken to prevent indirect exposure to peanuts the danger to someone with a peanut allergy who eats them is unquestioned The potentially fatal reaction called   can occur with a childs first exposure to peanuts itchiness swelling of the tongue and throat constriction of the airway a precipitous drop in   rapid heart rate     Unless the reaction is stopped by an injection of   adrenaline   can kill In one infamous instance in  Katherine Brodsky  a freshman at Brown University with a known nut allergy died   There is no cure for nut   although several preliminary studies suggest that it may be possible to temper a reaction to peanuts with immunotherapy Like shots given for pollen allergies the approach starts with exposure under the tongue to a minuscule amount of the offending peanut protein followed by exposure to gradually increasing amounts under strict medical supervision The latest study conducted in Cambridge England and published in The Lancet last week found that after six months of oral immunotherapy up to  percent of children aged  to    far more than they could before the treatment About onefifth of treated children reacted to ingested peanuts but most reactions were mild usually an itchy mouth Only one child of the  studied had a serious reaction When immunotherapy works the research suggests the severity of the allergy is lessened enabling an allergic person to safely ingest small amounts of the offending protein It is not known how long protection lasts without continued immunotherapy however and the researchers warned that no one should try it on his own Further study is needed before the treatment can be used clinically probably years from now Meanwhile everyone with a peanut allergy is advised to carry an   for emergency treatment Ideally allergists would like to prevent the development of peanut allergy in the first place Experts had thought that one way would be to keep fetuses and breastfed babies from exposure to peanut protein by restricting consumption by pregnant and nursing women Various studies had suggested that early exposure to peanut protein by infants with allergic tendencies   In  pregnant and nursing women were advised to avoid eating peanuts especially if allergies ran in the family And new mothers were told not to give babies peanuts before age  when digestive systems are more fully developed But this advice did nothing to curb the steady climb in peanut allergies and it was abandoned in  Today the thinking is exactly the opposite Instead of restricting exposure to peanut protein by unborn or nursing babies the tiny amounts that may enter the babys circulation when a pregnant or nursing woman eats peanuts might actually induce tolerance not sensitization In a recent study of  children  of whom had allergies to nuts researchers found that children whose nonallergic mothers had the highest consumption of peanuts or tree nuts or both during     The risk was most reduced among the children of mothers who ate nuts five or more times a month The researchers led by Dr A Lindsay Frazier of DanaFarberChildrens Hospital Cancer Center in Boston wrote Our study supports the hypothesis that early allergen exposure increases the likelihood of tolerance and thereby lowers the risk of childhood   They added that their data support the recent decisions to rescind recommendations that all mothers avoid peanutstotal nuts during pregnancy and   The study was supported by   a nonprofit and published in December in JAMA Pediatrics According to   by   an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University some studies actually showed that avoiding peanuts during pregnancy increased the risk of a child developing peanut sensitization Further support comes from studies of other common food allergens In an Israeli study of  infants those who were exposed to cows milk protein as a breastmilk supplement in the first two weeks of life   than infants first given cows milk much later An Australian study of  babies found that those first introduced to egg at or near  year of age   than those first given egg at  to  months of age In her editorial Dr Gupta emphasized that further research was needed to understand how maternal diet affects the development of food allergies and why more and more children are developing food allergy and how we can prevent it But for now she said pregnant women should not eliminate nuts from their diet as peanuts are a good source of protein and also provide   which can help prevent neural tube defects
