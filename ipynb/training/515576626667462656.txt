Scientists discovered that xanthohumol a type of flavonoid found in beer seems to help cognitive function at least in young mice They tested this hypothesis in a study that ran in   this week Xanthohumol did not have the same impact on older mice  The dose they gave the mice was quite high  so high that if you were in this study youd actually have to drink  liters of beer a day to equal what the mice consumed So scientists dont suggest you run out and buy a sixpack before work   The research does suggest that this flavonoid and others should be studied closer The researchers believe it and others like the ones found in red wine blueberries and dark chocolate may play a role in helping you form memories     Theres a big debate over whether doctors should recommend that people try ecigarettes to help them quit smoking Ecigarettes contain nicotine but they dont have all the cancercausing additives that a regular cigarette has Studies earlier this year showed they are more effective than the patch or gum in helping quit  A new study published in the journal   disagrees Researchers concluded that ecigarette users were no more likely to quit smoking successfully than regular cigarette smokers   Of regular cigarette smokers enrolled in the study  resisted the temptation to smoke for seven days compared to  of ecigarette users The study looked at  patients who had cancer and who were enrolled in a smoking cessation program in a cancer treatment center Mirroring their growing popularity there was a threefold increase in the number of participants who switched to ecigarettes between  and    The study found that the ecigarette users actually were more dependent on nicotine than regular smokers The ecigarette users tried to quit more times than the regular smokers The scientists who did the study said they would like to try it with the general population to see if they found the same results  Scientists trying to understand what makes people so highly allergic to peanuts may now have an idea The research is in early stages but a study that ran in the   this week found that dryroasted peanuts caused a stronger allergic reaction in mice than raw peanuts   Scientists theorize that the dry roasting causes chemical changes in the nuts If a persons immune system is picking up on that change it may be getting the body ready for an allergic response Scientists suggest this may explain why so many people in the West where peanuts are often dry roasted show signs for peanut allergies when people who live in Asia dont In Asian countries peanuts are often served raw or boiled Next researchers will try to figure out what chemical changes are happening in the dry roasting process that trigger the attacks particularly in humans Scientists say you are lifting more than weights on the days you hit the gym  youre throwing back a few cocktails too    In a study that ran in the latest edition of Health Psychology the   researchers found that people typically exercise more on Thursdays and Sundays when theyre also drinking more The study looked at  people between the age of  and  Participants recorded their fitness activities as well as their alcohol use at the end of the day using their smartphones They did this for a period of  days at a time at three different times of the year  Scientists next want to study what the link is between exercise and drinking Maybe they should focus on the link between drinking and the weekend  Most heart attacks in men are preventable A new study suggests there are five behaviors that can help you lower your risk Eat a better diet exercise more stay fit avoid smoking and drink moderately The study ran in the  For the study scientists monitored  healthy men in Sweden who were between the ages of  and  in   They followed the mens health through  Only  of the men followed all five recommended healthy behaviors Of those  only three had heart attacks Some  didnt do any of the five and  had heart attacks Scientists concluded that clean living can prevent  of heart attacks
