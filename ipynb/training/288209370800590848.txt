Miranda Dale had her first breakdown during her freshman year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville It was  am on a Saturday and she hadnt left her dorm room in days I honestly didnt know what to do says Dale I heard rumors that at a big university youre just a number and youre not going to get through to anyone at the university counseling center But when she called the schools counseling line someone answered right away Dale got help getting a prescription for medication and she was booked for an appointment that Monday She was eventually diagnosed with   a mood disorder that usually requires medication Over the past decade colleges and universities across the country have   of students like Dale with mental health needs The stigma of mental illness has started to dissipate and more students are comfortable seeking help In addition teenagers with serious conditions are getting treatment earlier and so a population of students that previously didnt make it to college now arrives on campus each fall The average college counseling center   about  percent of the student body each year Some campuses are exploring new systems to help meet the growing demand At UVA for example the counseling center uses a triage system to make sure it is able to see as many students as possible When student first call the counseling line they are given a minute phone consultation with a therapist on their sleeping and eating habits attendance substance use and whether theyre having thoughts of selfharm Thats according to psychologist Russ Federman a former director at the UVA counseling center Students in crisis are seen immediately Another quarter of callers are referred to offcampus therapists right away Dale was seen only once at the counseling center After her initial appointment she was referred to a private therapist offcampus instead With the help of the triage system the UVA counseling center was able to accommodate  visits last year with only  fulltime therapists Overall schools are getting better at meeting the mental health needs of their students says Alison Malmon president and founder of   a mental health advocacy group with chapters on campuses across the country Not everything is great we would love all students to be able to get all of the unlimited visits they could get on campus Malmon says Recently   as the No  student complaint on college campuses according to a survey of college counseling centers Malmon says that has a lot to do with the current economy Meredith Was who heads up the Active Minds chapter at UVA says she started to feel the stress of getting a job after graduation during the first semester of her senior year Was saw a counselor for just seven sessions enough to help her deal with the uncertainty of graduation along with a painful breakup Between suicide prevention outreach free counseling sessions and the triage system UVA manages to mostly stay ahead of the demand for services We really want students to know its OK to reach out for help and theres no shame in having anxiety or depression or anything says Federman Its just part of the human condition Especially he adds during the college years
