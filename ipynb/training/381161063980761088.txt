It seems that every time researchers estimate how often a medical mistake contributes to a hospital patients death the numbers come out worse In  the Institute of Medicine published the famous To Err Is Human report which dropped a bombshell on the medical community by reporting that up to  people a year die because of mistakes in hospitals The number was initially disputed but is now widely accepted by doctors and hospital officials  and quoted ubiquitously in the media In  the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services said that bad hospital care contributed to the deaths of  patients in Medicare alone in a given year Now comes a   of the   that says the numbers may be much higher  between   each year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of preventable harm that contributes to their death That would make medical errors the   behind heart disease which is the first and cancer which is second The new estimates were developed by John T James a  s space center in Houston who runs an advocacy organization called   James has also   about the death of his yearold son after what James maintains was negligent hospital care Asked about the higher estimates a spokesman for the American Hospital Association said the group has more confidence in the IOMs estimate of  deaths ProPublica asked three prominent patient safety researchers to review James study however and all said his methods and findings were credible Whats the right number Nobody knows for sure Theres never been an actual count of how many patients experience preventable harm So were left with approximations which are imperfect in part because of inaccuracies in medical records and the reluctance of some providers to report mistakes Patient safety experts say measuring the problem is nonetheless important because estimates bring awareness and research dollars to a major public health problem that persists despite decades of improvement efforts We need to get a sense of the magnitude of this James said in an interview James based his estimates on the findings of four recent studies that identified preventable harm suffered by patients  known as adverse events in the medical vernacular  using use a screening method called the   which guides reviewers through medical records searching for signs of infection injury or error Medical records flagged during the initial screening are reviewed by a doctor who determines the extent of the harm In the four studies which examined records of more than  patients hospitalized between  and  researchers found serious adverse events in as many as  percent of cases reviewed and rates of lethal adverse events as high as  percent of cases By combining the findings and extrapolating across  million hospitalizations in  James concluded that preventable errors contribute to the   hospital patients annually That is the baseline The actual number more than doubles James reasoned because the trigger tool doesnt catch errors in which treatment should have been provided but wasnt because its known that medical records are missing some evidence of harm and because diagnostic errors arent captured An estimate of  deaths from care in hospitals is roughly onesixth of all deaths that occur in the United States each year James wrote in his study He also cited other research thats shown hospital reporting systems and peerreview capture only a fraction of patient harm or negligent care Perhaps it is time for a national patient bill of rights for hospitalized patients James wrote All evidence points to the need for much more patient involvement in identifying harmful events and participating in rigorous followup investigations to identify root causes Dr Lucian Leape a Harvard pediatrician who is referred to the   was on the committee that wrote the To Err Is Human report He told ProPublica that he has confidence in the four studies and the estimate by James Members of the Institute of Medicine committee knew at the time that their estimate of medical errors was low he said It was based on a rather crude method compared to what we do now Leape said Plus medicine has become much more complex in recent decades which leads to more mistakes he said Dr David Classen one of  of the Global Trigger Tool said the James study is a sound use of the tool and a great contribution He said its important to update the numbers from the To Err Is Human report because in addition to the obvious suffering preventable harm leads to enormous financial costs Dr Marty Makary a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital whose book   calls for greater transparency in health care said the James estimate shows that eliminating medical errors must become a national priority He said its also important to increase the awareness of the potential of unintended consequences when doctors perform procedure and tests The risk of harm needs to be factored into conversations with patients he said Leape Classen and Makary all said its time to stop citing the  number Still hospital association spokesman Akin Demehin said the group is sticking with the Institute of Medicines estimate Demehin said the IOM figure is based on a larger sampling of medical charts and that theres no consensus the Global Trigger Tool can be used to make a nationwide estimate He said the tool is better suited for use in individual hospitals The AHA is not attempting to come up with its own estimate Demehin said Dr David Mayer vice president of quality and safety at Marylandbased   said people can make arguments about how many patient deaths are hastened by poor hospital care but thats not really the point All the estimates even on the low end expose a crisis he said Way too many people are being harmed by unintentional medical error Mayer said and it needs to be corrected
