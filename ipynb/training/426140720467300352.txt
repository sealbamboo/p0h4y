Two of the topselling brands of jerky treats for pets will soon return to US store shelves a year after a nationwide recall and with government experts no closer to solving the mystery that has linked the products to hundreds of animal deaths and thousands of illnesses  Nestle Purina Pet Care officials say theyll reintroduce a line of Waggin Train treats for dogs starting next month including products made from a single supplier in China and new products sourced entirely in the United States  Weve worked hard to put in place the highest quality controls in the dog treat industry Waggin Train President Nina Leigh says in a promotional video And Del Monte Foods Corp officials said theyll resume selling Milos Kitchen Chicken Jerky Strips and Chicken Grillers Recipe treats in March using USsourced meat  Federal Food and Drug Administration officials told NBC News they know about Nestle Purinas plans and have reviewed them but they said the company doesnt need special permission known as premarket approval to reintroduce the treats And they said they couldnt discuss the review  As with all meetings that might include discussion of proprietary business information the content of these meetings is confidential spokeswoman Juli Ann Putnam said She couldnt comment about Del Monte Thats despite repeated FDA warnings that consumers should avoid jerky pet treats after the agency received reports that since    have died and  have been sickened after eating chicken duck and sweet potato products made in China That figure is up by  reports since October The move drew immediate criticism from veterinarians pet owners and animal advocates who said it wasnt clear exactly what changes if any the companies made to the products and that they were worried their return to market would only sicken more pets  We need to raise hell Too many unanswered questions said Robin Pierre of Pine Bush NY who has been protesting Waggin Train treats since  when she said her yearold pug Bella died after eating them Was it the antibiotics What did they find We want to know They have said nothing other than they enhanced their product What has changed Florida veterinarian Sofia Morales who has treated at least three cases of Fanconi syndrome a serious illness linked to the treats said she would want to see results of clinical trials in pets showing that the revamped products were safe  Right now what Im recommending to people is not to feed jerky she said Jerky makers have consistently said there is no proven link between their products and the pet poisonings FDA officials have not demanded recalls because they have no proof of contamination Nestle Purina officials said they have made significant enhancements to the Waggin Train production process including limiting meat sourcing to single suppliers and requiring that each batch of treats be tested for a range of contaminants including salmonella melamine diethylene glycol and antibiotics as well as heavy metals pesticides and mycotoxins or molds  It really means greater control said Keith Schopp a company spokesman adding We support FDA efforts to maintain a safe supply of products Nestle Purina and Del Monte the nations top two jerky treat suppliers pulled the products from market across the country a year ago after New York state agriculture officials said they detected low levels of unapproved antibiotics in the treats  The firms said the antibiotics werent linked to the reports of pet illnesses and deaths and that the drugs were approved in places outside of the US  After the recall however reports of pet deaths and illnesses continued to come in but at a much slower pace a trend FDA officials said was likely caused by simply having fewer products on the market  In October the FDA sent a letter to the nations veterinarians asking them to track and send detailed information  including physical samples  from any pets that appeared to be sickened by jerky treats  FDA scientists have conducted scores of tests since  to try to determine whats behind reports of gastrointestinal illness and kidney and urinary problems including at least  cases of Fanconi syndrome a dangerous type of kidney disease  all to no avail  Between January and November last year the FDA refused five lines of jerkystyle treats at the nations ports and detained another  The agency has not responded to NBC News public records requests for the details of those actions  Tony Corbo a lobbyist for the advocacy group Food  Water Watch has been an outspoken critic who says the FDA hasnt done enough to address the jerky treat problem They still havent figured out whats causing the illnesses he said What assurances do we really have that these products are safe Schopp the Nestle Purina spokesman said the firm has detailed the steps it took to enhance safety at a new   website He said theyre bringing products back to stores at customer request  Weve heard from thousands of consumers he said adding that its important to feed the treats as directed  Still one former jerky pet treat fan isnt convinced Ron Barnhard  of Parkland Fla nearly lost Zoe his yearold pit bull mix last year when she developed Fanconi syndrome her vet said was tied to eating jerky treats  I wouldnt use them he said It was a gigantic expense to get her cured Why would I switch nowÂ
