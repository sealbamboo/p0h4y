Exactly what would happen to the Affordable Care Act if the Supreme Court invalidates tax credits in three dozen states where the federal government runs the program Legal scholars say a decision like that would deal a potentially lethal blow to the law because it would undermine the governmentrun insurance marketplaces that are its backbone as well as the mandate requiring most Americans to carry coverage In  the laws challengers argue that Congress intended to limit federal tax credits to residents of states running their own insurance exchanges Currently only  states and the District of Columbia operate exchanges on their own another    with the federal government Federal officials run the rest Should the justices find that subsidies in federal exchanges are not allowed I dont think there are any rosy scenarios said Timothy Jost a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a supporter of the law Its a complete disaster The immediate impact would be that the Internal Revenue Service would stop paying subsidies to those in federally run exchanges In    people were getting those subsidies but the number is projected to grow to as many as  million by  Most of those who lose subsidies would no longer be required to have insurance because they would fall into an   for those who have to pay more than  percent of family income for premiums Since a lot of people cant afford insurance without the tax credits youre looking at a lot of people shedding coverage says Nicholas Bagley a law professor at the University of Michigan Those who hang onto their coverage and pay the premium without help are likely to be sicker on average than the people who shed their coverage because theyre the ones who need insurance the most he says Indeed the insurance industry argued in a   for a related case that elimination of the federal exchange subsidies could seriously undermine those markets creating an insurance death spiral A sicker pool of consumers results in higher premiums which causes an additional relatively healthy subset of participants to drop out which in turn results in a further increase in premiums the groups trade group Americas Health Insurance Plans said in its brief Eliminating subsidies also would undermine the socalled   that seeks to require larger firms to provide coverage Thats because it requires employers to pay a fine if their employees obtain subsidies on the exchange If there are no subsidies there are no employer fines and thus effectively no mandate So what could be done Some have argued that states that rely on the federal government to run their exchanges could establish their own marketplaces But legal experts believe thats problematic as well The practical obstacle is that creating an exchange is not childs play says Bagley Theyve got to be able to carry out a variety of functions including working with consumer assistance groups and overseeing plans compliance with the laws While some have suggested that states could create a virtual exchange on paper and then contract with the federal government to run it Bagley says the law on the subject is pretty explicit States would have to do more than just the bare minimum he said Timing and financing would also pose practical problems The final deadline for states to apply for   has passed And a Supreme Court decision is likely to come in late June of next year which is after another deadline June  for states to use their own funds to establish an exchange in time for the  open enrollment season The political obstacles are potentially even bigger In six states even if a governor wanted to establish an exchange   according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Georgia became   earlier this year That means state legislatures will have to get involved said Bagley And many are full of new members after the midterm elections who specifically campaigned against the ACA Still not everyone is convinced all this would spell the ACAs end Congress will step in predicts health economist Tom Miller of the conservative American Enterprise Institute Were going to have the kind of political give and take which was abbreviated and artificially truncated when the law was passed he said Its not a pretty process but thats why we have a government and we elect people
