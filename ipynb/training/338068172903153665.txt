This is one of those good news but medical stories New treatments for heart failure have made it much less likely that people with this chronic condition will die suddenly But an analysis by researchers at UCLA finds that the death rate for people with advanced heart failure remains stubbornly high with  percent of people dying within three years Theyre not dying suddenly but their disease is still progressing says   an assistant professor of medicine at UCLA and a coauthor of the study which was   in   Still thats a lot better than  years ago when heart failure patients were pretty much sent home to die   has many causes including heart attack diabetes high blood pressure and viral infections But the effect is the same a heart that doesnt move blood effectively About  million people in the United States have heart failure according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is the primary cause of  deaths a year In the past  years medical care for heart failure has changed radically with new medications and devices Horwich and her colleagues wanted to see if these advances were helping patients in the real world The people in this study were referred the UCLA center in their early s on average this is not a disease just for the old The study looked at  patients who had been treated at UCLA from  to  They found that three drugs  ACE inhibitors beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists  had been widely adopted for treatment of heart failure between  and  At the same time the number of people with  went from  percent to  percent The implanted defibrillators correct abnormal heart rhythms a big cause of sudden death Death rates were  percent lower for patients in the most recent treatment group between  and  than for the patients in the s That was largely due to a drop in sudden cardiac deaths But deaths from progressive heart failure remained high with  percent of patients dying in the latter part of the study compared to  percent in the s People could be coming to UCLA sicker than in years past Horwich speculates having survived heart attacks and other problems that would have killed them in the past But it could also be because those people are ending up on implantable ventricular assist pumps or getting heart transplants very expensive treatments that are difficult for many people to tolerate Were not curing the disease Horwich tells Shots Were delaying the inevitable And that means she says that we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us in finding ways to prevent and treat heart failure
