As a junior at Kent State University I felt like I was on top of the world I went to a great school I was doing exactly what I love journalism and then on September   I began to get unexplained illnesses one after another Eventually I landed in a hospital bed with an IV pumping a cocktail of drugs meant to cure a series of infections ravaging my body When I finally felt reasonable enough to go to class I couldnt remember things  My essays as one professor told me suddenly read like ramblings I wasnt me   That semester I ended up taking incompletes in all of my classes My doctors and professors declared I was overwhelmed with catching up in my classes and the anxiety of it all consumed me Little did I know that it would be a decade later before I would officially find out it was really systemic lupus erythematosus My diagnosis came as I was entering what I considered the magical part of my life I had married had a beautiful daughter and was working my dream job CNN and finally felt like I was walking in my purpose I began to have horrific migraines excruciating nerve pain down my left arm and bruises and rashes started to appear more and more often Initially I thought I was just tired and it was the allergies and the bruises I simply attributed it to being anemic  This was until my esophagus began to feel as if it was closing up I went to a physician and he said I had a tumor on the shoulder and that must be causing everything I was feeling  When I went to the surgical oncologist she said its not cancer and referred me to an amazing internist   I had already gone through the gamut of diagnoses leukemia thoracic outlet syndrome sarcoidosis I was completely over the diagnosis portion of the process My life had become work bed and repeat They ran multiple tests I remember the appointment like it was yesterday  When I came back in for my followup I was told I had lupus A disease that has no cure To me that diagnosis was not a death sentence but a sentence to feel the way that I felt at the moment for the rest of my life I felt pain I felt exhausted and I was not me Having lupus has been like having a horrific hangover while doing twoaday workouts  exhausting  No one knows what is wrong unless you tell them There is no escaping the pain and the only way out is to sleep or die Ive felt like lupus at times has sucked the life out of me Its shifted my priorities taken away many of the things I love because Im stuck in a holding pattern just treating the symptoms Never being cured Fighting this disease has been no easy ride  The disease has affected my brain GI system lungs and heart  I take twelve medications to get through the day   Those drugs include chemotherapy an antimalarial a betablocker an anticonvulsant chemotherapy and a monthly infusion of a biological drug Only one of these drugs is specifically meant to treat lupus  When people see me they always say You dont look sick  This has sort of been a gift and a curse for me On one hand I didnt want people to look at me as if I had a disability On the other I wanted people to know what Ive been able to accomplish in spite of the disease Its an invisible fight for me but now is my time to make some noise so we can find a cure If no one is aware of my struggle we cant get there  I want me back and Ive realized that every breath I take is blessed with a responsibility A responsibility to raise awareness about life with lupus and the need for a cure Every day this is what keeps me going  Lupus is one of Americas least recognized major diseases although  million Americans are living with it   Research is not keeping pace with the research for other diseases of similar scope and devastation  A study conducted by the Lupus Foundation of America found  of Americans from  to  those most at risk for lupus have either not heard about lupus or know nothing more than the name  In the past century only one drug has been developed and approved to treat the disease  With the ebbs and flows of the economy this disease has taken the backseat to research investment priorities The Lupus Foundation of America is the oldest and largest nonprofit organization focused on improving quality of life and finding a cure for lupus To find out more information about the disease or to make a contribution
