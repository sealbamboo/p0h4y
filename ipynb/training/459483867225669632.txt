The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first DNA test for human papillomavirus, or HPV, that could be used instead of the Pap test in a cervical-cancer screening program.. But the test isn't widely expected to take the place of the Pap—the standard screening for cervical cancer—anytime soon. That is partly because the leading physicians group on the topic, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommends that the new HPV screening be used along with the Pap test.
