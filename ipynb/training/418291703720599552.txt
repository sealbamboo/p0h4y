Knowing which diet advice to follow can be perplexing and frustrating Hardly a day goes by without news of a new scientific study Fad diets come and go Sales of highprotein shakes have surged in recent years but the scientific evidence suggests that most people are consuming too much protein Lowfat diets were once all the rage now they seem to have fallen out of favour People do get confused says Dr Lawrence Piro CEO and President of The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute a private medical facility in Los Angeles People receive mixed messages about what to eat Piro acknowledges Eat fish and dont eat red meat he says listing some of the medical advice hes seen doing the rounds in recent years But then dont eat farmraised fish because it may be too high in various minerals that are toxic So now dont eat any fish at all and switch to vegetables  be vegan The popularity of intermittent fasting has grown over the past year or so The  diet which involves dramatically reducing your calorific intake on certain days of the week is one example But more clinical data is needed to confirm the benefits of such regimes Doctors are generally reluctant to recommend them The UKs National Health Service questions   Curious about the scientific research that goes into devising a new diet I decided to volunteer as a subject in a fivemonth clinical trial at the University of Southern California USC As a human guinea pig I signed up to test a strict diet regime and subject myself to a battery of clinical tests to evaluate its effect on my body It involved surviving for five consecutive days on a narrow range of foods that contained as little as  calories per day  about a quarter of the average persons consumption There was to be no cheating no falling off the wagon and no treats It was an opportunity to be part of study that may help scientists unravel the complex relationship between food and the human body The clinical trial which is still ongoing is designed to investigate the feasibility safety potential benefits and psychological changes associated with a calorierestricted diet It is based on previous experiments at a number of institutions which have shown that mice live longer and healthier lives if their food intake is cut by up to  Research at USCs Longevity Institute has also shown in rodents that shortterm fasting before chemotherapy can prevent some of the toxic sideeffects of the treatment There is a growing body of opinion that fasting has a potent beneficial effect on organisms and that it is potentially extendable to humans But it is still unlikely that a doctor would put a patient on a restricted diet because of the potential risk of nutritional deficiencies  Also fasting regimes are tough to follow through for most of us at least This is why the current USC diet does not involve a complete fast and is designed to be repeated in short bursts over a number of months I dont think there is a solid datasupported study to show that cycles of lowcalorie diet will actually have a beneficial effect so thats what we are trying to achieve explains Dr Min Wei the studys lead investigator There was an enthusiastic response from members of the public when the university appealed for volunteers California people are especially conscious of diet exercise and health says Wei especially in the environment where obesity is a huge problem as well as diabetes and cancer Since fasting can be dangerous I sought the advice of my family doctor who confirmed that it was medically safe for me to participate The food during the period of the restricted diet was designed to be highly nutritious It consisted of plantbased soups kale chips a nutty bar a herbal tea and an energy drink The total number of calories in five days was about   a little more than the average person consumes in one day No additional food was allowed For the rest of the month we were allowed a normal diet The regime was repeated three times followed by a control period when we could eat anything During the test and control periods blood samples were taken body weight and composition bone density and body fat were measured using a Dexa dual Xray absorptiometry machine Brain activity was recorded during onehour MRI magnetic resonance imaging sessions to determine whether the diet had any impact on cognitive abilities The diet had unexpected consequences for everyone including extreme hunger in some cases  and an aversion to the limited amount of food in others On the positive side volunteers including myself reported a heightened feeling of mental wellbeing Our stomachs may have been grumbling but we experienced a surprising sense of alertness and sharpness of the mind
