Sometimes we drink with the sole purpose of relaxing or drowning the weeks worries But other times we just want to savor a special craft beer or vintage wine or make that good meal taste even better And as we get older were warier of that third or fourth glass The   of too much alcohol  the drowsiness the confusion and the wobbling  are a bigger hindrance And lets face it A hangover at  isnt the same as one at  So when we came across a tip in   for staving off intoxication we perked up You mean I might be able to have another glass of pinot noir or a third IPA without getting as loopy Tell me more  is a professional drinker As the founder and brewer of Sam Adams Koch tastes every batch of beer Boston Beer Co makes before it leaves the brewery This involves a lot of sipping sometimes well before noon To keep his mind sharp and taste buds savvy through all those lagers and ales Koch has a secret He mixes a teaspoon of bakers yeast with a small amount of food  usually yogurt  and gulps it down immediately before laying into a pint Ive been doing this for  years Koch tells The Salt I experimented with this in the beginning with portions until I got it down Yeast are microscopic singlecelled fungi and Kochs explanation is that they break down some of the alcohol in the stomach before it gets absorbed in the bloodstream It mitigates the effect of alcohol he says In other words it allows him to drink at  am and go right back to running his company Now Koch didnt make up this trick He learned it from biochemist and legendary brewer   who helped to develop lowcalorie light beers And it sounds like it might work Yeast has an enzyme just like our own livers and stomach linings that can break down alcohol Its called   for all you biochemistry boffins But we were dubious Yeast   alcohol from sugar If it were good at degrading it wouldnt it eat up all the ethanol in wine and beer Though theres plenty of research   that food in the stomach slows the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream we couldnt find anything on yeast doing the same thing And as science writer Adam Rogers notes in his new book   theres been little research in general devoted to the question of how to temper the effects of alcohol while drinking If ever there was an excuse for some pseudo science  not to mention some onthejob tippling  this was it We decided to test Kochs alcohol mitigation technique on ourselves one yearold female weighing  pounds one yearold male weighing  pounds and one yearold female weighing  pounds We broke the study into three separate tests Before each test we fasted for eight hours This ensured that our stomachs were empty and there would be no question of food interfering with the results For each round we drank two ounce beers Sierra Nevadas Torpedo IPA over  minutes followed by a Lagunitas IPA over  minutes At  to  percent alcohol by volume the beers are fairly typical servings of alcohol The goal To find out whether eating yeast mixed with yogurt or drinking extra water while drinking would suppress our BAC the only true measure of drunkenness since our sense of it varies so much physically  and psychologically  person to person To refresh you  is the BAC limit for driving though the National Transportation Safety Board   that it be lowered to  Driving can be impaired at levels as low as  the NTSB says We took BAC readings using a calibrated BACTrack S Pro Breathalyzer   the most reliable on the market  While as scientific as we could manage our tests involved just three people of average weight in their mids we dont claim to be a representative sample And even among the three of us youll see there was variation in how much alcohol we absorbed and how quickly it entered and left our bloodstreams But a few conclusions were clear Yeast in yogurt doesnt slow down the absorption of alcohol very much  perhaps only a tad But drinking a bunch of water before and between beers might have a slightly bigger effect on peak BAC than the yeastyogurt combo So whats going on Why didnt the yeast gobble up all the ethanol in the beer before we absorbed it Yeast can degrade ethanol says microbiologist   of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center But they love other sugars  glucose maltose  more When those sugars are around the cells turn off the genes needed for alcohol degradation Many beers contain some leftover sugars that dont get fermented Yogurt has sugars too So if Koch is eating the yeast with yogurt that offers the fungi something more tempting than alcohol Plus Tu says the yeast most likely wont have time to degrade the alcohol before our digestive tracts absorb it I think the exposure time of the alcohol to the yeast is too low he says Any effect of the yeast on BAC will be marginal Neurobiologist  who directs the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism agrees with Tus assessment  Kochs technique falls more in the urban legend category than into science Koob tells The Salt Basically we think that probably yeast  is delaying the absorption of alcohol because any foodstuff or anything you take that occupies the stomach lining is going to impede the absorption of alcohol To be fair Koch never claimed this is for everyone I cant say it works for everybody It works for me he tells us Koob thinks that Koch might just have a higher tolerance for alcohol meaning his liver can metabolize the alcohol more quickly As for our results with water we were able to show that drinking enough of it might lower your BAC below what it would normally be Why We think the explanation is simple The water dilutes the alcohol in your stomach Several studies have found that alcohol absorbs more quickly into the blood when the drinks are higher proof For instance a vodka tonic is likely to get you drunk faster and more quickly than a glass of wine And wine will be quicker than a beer one recent study   This is also why women generally are more likely to be more intoxicated from the same amount of alcohol as men of a similar weight According to Koob women have less water per pound than men and alcohol hangs out in the water part of our bodies But we wouldnt really recommend pounding  ounces of water with each drink  its unpleasant to put that much liquid in your body in such a short time not to mention potentially dangerous OK so we didnt learn the ultimate trick to drinking without getting drunk but we did enjoy monitoring our experience of intoxication For one thing having a Breathalyzer in your pocket makes you pretty popular at parties Of course youll get a lot of faulty BACs if you pass it around since you have to wait at least  minutes after drinking to get an accurate reading Another key finding is that theres a sweet spot in getting buzzed at about  BAC No shocker Its better to underdrink than overdrink The closer you get to  BAC the more likely you are to be impaired says Koob So if you want to keep away from that danger zone youll have to do it one of the oldfashioned ways passing on the next drink or drinking slowly with a meal Or why not try a   or a
