We learned that the situation wasnt going to be as simple or as controlled as we thought it would be and we immediately intensified our response to address the situation in Dallas he said He said his biggest surprise was the difficulty of Duncans care I think we didnt recognize how hard it would be to care for someone with Ebola who was desperately ill in the US and how much handson nursing care there would be and we didnt expect two nurses to get infected Frieden said During Duncans hospitalization Frieden repeatedly said in press conferences that any hospital in the United States should be able to treat Ebola  CNN asked Frieden if he regretted those statements considering that at Texas Presbyterian Hospital Duncan died and two nurses became infected but the other nine US Ebola patients who were treated at hospitals that were specially designated to treat the disease all lived In those cases no workers became infected  Clearly there are things that we wish wed done differently he said The bottom line is that Ebola is hard to treat and when the first patient ever with Ebola came to the United States we thought the guidelines would protect the health care workers When two health care workers became infected we recognized the guidelines didnt work So we changed them He added that one thing his agency would have done differently would have been to tell nurse Amber Vinson not to board an airplane from Cleveland to Dallas Vinson had taken care of Duncan and had reported a temperature of  degrees but was told she could fly because the CDCs threshold at that time for Ebola was  degrees Vinson later was diagnosed with Ebola  CNN also asked if he considered leaving his post when several Republican lawmakers called for his resignation  Im really just focused on stopping Ebola Im working around the clock to do that and I will continue to do that as long as Ebola is spreading as long as I have the opportunity to do that he said             I wish I had know then what we know now he added But thats not how the world works We live life forwards and we understand it backwards Looking back with  hindsight there are always things we would do differently
