Three years Thats the total amount of time we train to be oncologists  Its both a lot of time and not enough  When we enter our oncology fellowships most of us have spent four years in college four or five years in medical school and three years completing an internal medicine residency We donate our s  what are supposed to be our fabulous years  to studying how to be doctors Is it any wonder we emerge just a little bit socially awkward and behind the times And then we dedicate what seems like an eternity  another three years  to specialize in cancer Yet three years seems a trifle in the vast expanse of time it would take to understand all of oncology In that time we have to learn how to distinguish cancer from noncancerous conditions we live in fear of administering toxic treatments to somebody whose disease doesnt deserve them measure the extent of cancer and thus its stage identify therapies most successful in containing even eliminating specific cancers and escort our patients past the cabal of nasty chemotherapy toxicities anxiety of cancer returning and longterm cancer and treatment consequences that threaten to overthrow their return to wellbeing In the end we really only follow our new cancer patients for a short time and thus emerge from training unaware of how our patients lives play out beyond their immediate therapy In the fall of my third fellowship year I met an yearold patient in clinic She was on the cusp of adulthood and came to us suddenly because she was having trouble breathing and an Xray obtained by her pediatrician showed an enormous mass in her mediastinum the central part of her chest You guys better fix whatever is going on she told me and the attending physician who was supervising me her bravado masking what must have been a terrifying walk through the cancer centers doors She had a lot of piercings and her hair was dyed flaming red Half of her face was swollen because the tumor was compressing the vessels that drained that side of her head Her mother sat in a chair near the exam table hugging her jacket Thats the least we can do you came all this way my attending joked without smiling as he and I started examining her We were worried She was taking  breaths per minute her heart was racing and she looked extremely ill My residency had taught me to distinguish sick from nonsick and she was very sick  Well take good care of you he continued But we need to bring you into the hospital and figure out whats going on We admitted her and scheduled a surgical procedure  a mediastinoscopy  to obtain a biopsy of the mass This confirmed what we suspected Hodgkin lymphoma stage  and we started chemotherapy soon after Her tumor shrank her breathing returned to normal and her face was less swollen by the time we discharged her But she faced an intense six months of chemotherapy This chemotherapy regimen is notorious for causing what is called anticipatory nausea patients get nauseated at the sight sound or smell of anything that reminds them of their treatment A story circulated among the doctors in our hospital of a patient who had a chance encounter in the airport with her oncologist years after completing her therapy she immediately threw up on him My patient was no exception But she retained her spunk undaunted by our treatments  One day in clinic she told me she had a serious question to ask Now that my hair is growing back is there any medical reason I cant dye it  Behind her in the exam room her mother pantomimed   repeatedly to me I sighed It wont affect your chemotherapy or your cancer But I worry about your health because your mom will probably kill you if you do She returned to clinic a few weeks later with hair a shade of green to celebrate spring  Soon after I graduated from my fellowship and took a job in Cleveland I assumed all was well with my spirited young patient back in Boston and thought about her every time a new young patient came in But as I learned from the emails she sent me occasionally over the next decade and from the office notes copied to me by my former attending her life was much more complicated She had received radiation therapy to treat her chest mass and subsequently developed thyroid problems As radiation therapy put her at higher risk of developing breast cancer she started an intensive surveillance program and after several scares and biopsies of benign lumps over the years underwent a prophylactic double mastectomy  Psychologically she had her ups and downs at one point commenting that nobody she had met in the previous six years knew of her cancer and that she still found the cancer center a hard place to be Yet two years after that she participated in walks to benefit the center What a long strange trip this cancer journey can be For those of us who treat the patients we are kidding ourselves to think we understand the diseases impact beyond a few years of training or beyond the walls of our clinics I find myself repeatedly humbled by how much I have yet to learn about my patients experience
