On the twelfth day of Christmascould we be hitting the phones trying to get a GP appointment or turning up at our local surgeries    The question is worth asking because the muchreported pressures on the health service may be compounded over the festive period by the holiday closure of many surgeries and community care services   In Scotland practices will close for a total of eight days because of the way the bank holidays fall The NHS in Scotland is well aware of the calendar quirk which will see GP surgeries close for two blocks of four days each  Christmas Day Boxing Day followed by a weekend and then January st and nd  a bank holiday in Scotland and another weekend   It has of course happened before but this is a year when there has been a relentless rise across the UK in patient numbers and emergency admissions to hospitals   Lack of knowledge of GP opening hours perhaps even frustration about difficulties getting an appointment have been cited as contributory factors to increased attendances at AE units   Scottish health chiefs have been consistently putting out the message that patients should think about their needs such as cold and cough remedies and get repeat prescriptions organised   Pharmacists have been reminding people that they can give advice on a range of ailments and many have consulting rooms for private discussions with patients Most pharmacies will be closed on bank holidays though open on the two Saturdays after Christmas and New Year Each large town and city should have at least one pharmacy open on the public holidays AE units are already under strain and have been preparing for the holiday season with some trepidation Their concern is not so much with GP practice closures but with those elements of social care which close down over Christmas and New Year  They are worried that the elderly are more likely to need hospital treatment if community care is reduced to minimal levels on four successive days Prof Jason Leitch Clinical Director of the Scottish Governments Quality Unit emphasised the importance of visiting elderly relatives or neighbours to check on their condition  We are trying to stop them having to have a visit unnecessarily to some kind of healthcare  so if we can self manage that with family and friends and the patients themselves thats got to be better for them This echoes the message from NHS England about loneliness and isolation causing a spike in AE admissions over Christmas Advice over the phone via the  service will play a big part in handling the health needs of people in England and Scotland during the Christmas and New Year holiday period Management at the Scottish service run under the NHS  branding have been planning for some time for the two fourday periods when GP surgeries are closed   The normal call volume of  a day will rise to more than   January nd tends to be the busiest day Referring patients to out of hours GP services directing them to pharmacies which are open for emergency repeat prescriptions and suggesting remedies which do not involve a visit to AE will be an important part of their work GP practices will be closed as usual for several days in all parts of the UK   England Wales and Northern Ireland have the same four consecutive days of closures as Scotland over Christmas   Health chiefs are adamant that the NHS will provide a round the clock service for those who need it over the holiday season  But they probably could have done without the  calendar in a year when patient numbers have been at or close to record levels
