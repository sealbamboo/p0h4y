The baby with the runny nose the infant with a stubborn cough  respiratory infections in small children are a familiar family travail  Now scientists suspect that these ailments  and many others far more severe  may be linked in part to a toxic element common in drinking water  The element is naturally occurring arsenic which swirls in a dark metalloid shimmer in soil and rock across much of the United States and in many other countries It seeps into groundwater but because the contamination tends to be minor in this country for many years its presence was mostly noted and dismissed by public health researchers Theyve changed their minds Long famed for its homicidal toxicity at high doses a number of studies suggest that arsenic is an astonishingly versatile poison able to do damage even at low doses Chronic lowdose exposure has been implicated not only in respiratory problems in children and adults but in cardiovascular disease diabetes and cancers of the skin bladder and lung Trace amounts in the body interfere with tumorsuppressing glucocorticoid hormones studies show which is one reason that arsenic exposure has been linked to a range of malignancies Arsenic also interferes with the normal function of immune cells It damages lung cells and    Researchers first became aware of these problems in socalled hot spot countries like Bangladesh where arsenic levels in water can top  part per million Decades ago public health agencies there sought to replace microbecontaminated surface water with well water Only later did geological surveys reveal significant aquifer contamination from bedrock arsenic Scientists now report health risks at lower and lower levels of exposure in that country In July researchers at the University of Chicago found that residents of Bangladesh chronically exposed to arsenic at a mere  parts per billion showed signs of reduced lung function At levels of  ppb or higher their ability to take in oxygen    Bangladesh is unfortunately a living laboratory for the health effects of arsenic said Habibul Ahsan the lead author of the study and director of the Center for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention at the University of Chicago  Dr Ahsan a native of Bangladesh is one of the organizers of a longterm study of arsenic and health in that country which now has  people enrolled In  he reported that  percent of all deaths from chronic disease in his study population    We need to take arsenic exposure very seriously Dr Ahsan said That seems to be todays watchword Researchers have begun a widespread reevaluation of arsenic as a public health threat not only in water but in the food supply The Food and Drug Administration   and the agency is now evaluating the risks posed by   which tend to pick up arsenic from the soil At the request of the Environmental Protection Agency the National Academy of Sciences has begun an intensive review of arsenic risks  The academy study group is chaired by Joseph Graziano a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University who researches   Researchers also are taking a much closer look at drinking water from Southwestern states like Nevada where wells sometimes contain arsenic at more than  ppb to the upper Midwest and New England where a belt of arsenicinfused bedrock taints aquifers in stretches from the coast of Maine to a point midway through Massachusetts Water in parts of the Central Valley of California Americas breadbasket has been     While municipal water suppliers are required to meet the EPAs safety standard of  ppb for arsenic in drinking water   Nationwide researchers say about  million people get drinking water from private wells with arsenic levels above the federal standard  And studies here are beginning to show a  pattern of harm not unlike that seen in Bangladesh One study of private wells in Michigan tainted with arsenic in the  to  ppb range found increased mortality rates   Another focusing on cardiovascular disease in small communities is due to be published next week At Dartmouth College the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study is following women through pregnancy into parenthood comparing the health of children in families drinking from private wells with those who rely on municipal water supplies  In a study published in July in Environmental Research researchers measured arsenic exposure during pregnancy and then tracked respiratory infections in infants up to four months of age The higher the arsenic exposure in the mother the scientists found   especially ones that required a visit to the doctor or prescription medicine The results describe a pattern similar to that seen in Bangladesh where scientists have found   of mothers with high levels of arsenic compared with those with the least exposure  We were surprised to find the connection so visible at the lower exposures seen here said Margaret Karagas a Dartmouth epidemiologist and the senior author of the study The Dartmouth pregnancy cohort study has also found a link between     If people have private wells they need to have them tested for arsenic she said You want to know whats in your water Meanwhile Dr Karagas and other experts are looking at the ways that arsenic in the food supply might add to an individuals cumulative exposure  We need to start looking at all the sources Dr Ahsan said
