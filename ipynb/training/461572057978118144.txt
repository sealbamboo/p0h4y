Two top veterans groups filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against the US Department of Veterans Affairs claiming VA experts make it far tougher for   to prove their PTSD symptoms were caused by sex assaults suffered in the ranks According to the suit brought by the Service Womens Action Network SWAN and Vietnam Veterans of America VA officials consistently impose a higher burden on   than they do all other veterans when it comes to verifying their reports of posttraumatic stress disorder That disparity is a form of discrimination the advocates assert and violates the Fifth Amendment In an email to NBC News Ndidi Mojay a VA spokeswoman said the agency is unable to comment specifically on pending litigation involving the federal government But Mojay did address the claim more generally writing Meeting the needs of Veterans who have experienced Military Sexual Trauma is of the highest importance to the Department of Veterans Affairs VA The department is working very hard to ensure that these claims are adjudicated compassionately and fairly with sensitivity to the unique circumstances presented by each individual claim The lawsuit casts a hard focus on the VA office tasked with assessing whether disability claims have merit and are worthy of federal compensation The Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans are experiencing betrayal trauma said Anu Bhagwati executive director of SWAN who served as a Marine officer from  to  Theres the devastation that happens with the military from that   Theres another betrayal that often happens when their commander or your fellow service members dont believe you Bhagwati said And theres the third betrayal from the VA  The Veterans Benefits Administration is really where hope goes to die The suit was filed in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC SWAN and the Vietnam veterans group further allege that VA assessors   at a significantly higher rate than they do PTSD claims filed by veterans who say combat exposure triggered their stress symptoms From  to  according to statistics cited Wednesday by the plaintiffs VA officials authorized PTSD claims filed by the survivors of military sexual trauma as much as  percent less often when compared to other servicerelated PTSD claims In response Mojay said VA data for fiscal year  showed the grant rate for PTSD claims based on military sexual trauma was within  percentage points of the approval rate for all servicelinked PTSD claims
