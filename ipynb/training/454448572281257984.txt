The white stuff you sprinkle on your food is back in the headlines Whether its salt or sugar it seems many of us may be consuming too much So how easy is it to live without  processed food for a week Helen Briggs finds out The first day of my new regime involves rifling through kitchen cupboards to see what Im permitted to eat The definition of processed food varies but according to the US Food and Drug Administration it comprises So out with pasta oil tinned tomatoes and many other staples  Unlimited fruit and vegetables are an easy option along with the humble baked spud But what about protein I dont eat meat so that means soaking and cooking my own lentils and chickpeas rather than buying them tinned Its a work day so I have to pack an entire days supply of rations I cant rely on my usual soup or salad as its bound to contain something processed like stock cubes or mayonnaise So I load up with fruit  banana for breakfast apple and oranges for snacks Then horror of horror Im struck by qualms about coffee  does it count as processed Victoria Taylor senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation has agreed to help me with my quest so I ping off a panicky email Thankfully she grants me a concession  I can have coffee as long as I buy the coffee beans and grind them myself Another thing to add to my todo list then Tired this morning after an evening up late soaking chickpeas boiling lentils and grinding coffee beans My children are peering into dirty saucepans Whats all this burnt gooey stuff Mummy My rucksack is bulging with pots of things  homemade chickpea salad nuts bananas bunch of grapes and yet another variety of homemade salad I am starting to crave sugar and patrol hungrily around the canteen in search of anything nonprocessed A new routine this morning To analyse what Im eating Victoria has asked me to weigh all my food three days a week To add to the grinding soaking and boiling I now need to put everything on the scales On the plus side I  think my diet is having some effect  I feel healthy and full of energy Ive discovered that adding herbs to things is a good way to get flavour without using salt sugar or sauces Mint tea has become a speciality  fresh mint in the bottom of a mug topped up with hot water and youre good to go I am also saving a fortune on ditching takeout coffees although I have to confess to the occasional illicit non homeground Americano I like to think Im pretty good at checking food labels But a cursory glance before chucking it into the supermarket trolley is no longer good enough I am finding out that sugar or salt can be sneaked in to many things you wouldnt expect The unprocessed pistachio nuts complete with shells I pick up in the supermarket queue actually have added salt And sugar can be hard to spot on food labels listed as high fructose corn syrup dextrose malt syrup maltose and evaporated cane juice among other things  In the UK cooking food at home is becoming a thing of the past  In the last decade money spent on takeaways and eating out has gone up by almost a third I spend my Saturday the oldfashioned way  batchcooking meals that can be eaten over the course of the next few days A family birthday so eating out is unavoidable The waiter is starting to get impatient with my questions Is the risotto made with homemade stock Does it have any added sugarsaltartificial things Eating out is a minefield when youre forbidden from adding anything to your food Whether its a takeaway sandwich a morning cappuccino or a birthday celebration in a restaurant finding out exactly what is in your food is a nutritional nightmare The week has been enlightening  and its definitely something I will do again But without a lot of forward planning and preparation its impractical for many I could have opted for a more varied diet such as grilled fish and steamed vegetables but without my own personal chef or a job working from home that was beyond me So how did I do According to Victoria Taylor not too badly She says based on a comparison with my control week my salt and saturated fat intake were both reduced by half   The main reason for me  as a nonmeat eater  was giving up bread and cheese which while not conventional processed foods  can be relatively high in salt and saturated fat Although Helen wasnt feasting on foods we typically think of as processed like readymade meals pizzas or crisps her experiment does show how its often the everyday foods like cheese and bread that make a big difference to the amount of saturated fat and salt we are eating she says Processed foods arent always a bad thing but this does highlight the importance of clear food labels  Colour coded labels which give ataglance information are an easy way to work out if the food youre eating is the healthy choice
