Medicare spent  billion too much for office visits and other patient evaluations in  according to a   from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services But in its reply to the findings the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which runs Medicare said it doesnt plan to review the billings of doctors who almost always charge for the most expensive visits because it isnt costeffective to do so The inspector generals report released today estimates that overpayments account for  percent of the  billion spent on evaluation and management services in  The evaluation and management category includes office visits emergency room assessments and inpatient hospital evaluations This is the second time that the inspector general has singled out this area for more scrutiny In  the watchdog said physicians had increasingly billed Medicare for more intense  and more expensive  office visits over time But that didnt prove the claims were improper The natural question that comes out of this is Are these physicians billing appropriately said Dwayne Grant regional inspector general for evaluation and inspections in the Atlanta region who oversaw the new report We dont want to pay them too much but we dont want to pay them too little either For this review the inspector general gathered the medical records associated with  Medicare claims and asked professional coders to see whether the records justified the rates charged Overall more than half of the claims were billed at the wrong rate or lacked documentation to justify the service Sometimes physicians billed for a lowercost service than the one they delivered but more often they billed for a more expensive one The inspector general extrapolated from its sample to estimate the amount Medicare overpaid on all  evaluation and management claims We have to do a better job of curbing improper payments and protecting taxpayer dollars Sen Bill Nelson DFla chairman of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging said in a statement The inspector generals findings complement a   of data recently released by Medicare on payments to individual health professionals for services in its Part B program We found that in  more than  doctors and other health professionals almost exclusively billed Medicare for the most complicated and expensive office visits for their established patients Office visits are the most common services provided in the program While most providers had a tiny percentage of visits for which they charged the highest rate known as level  more than  billed exclusively at that level Another  did it more than  percent of the time About  health professionals billed only at the top two levels  and  Experts we consulted said that these billing patterns were highly implausible and could indicate fraud Some doctors however said that their patients were sicker than those of their peers and required more time and attention ProPublica also launched a new tool called   that lets users look up their doctors and see how they compare to peers on office visits and other measures In its report the inspector generals office recommended that CMS educate doctors about proper billing practices It also suggested that Medicare pursue doctors who consistently billed for higherlevel services than they actually delivered a practice known as upcoding While CMS agreed with the need for education it disagreed with the recommendation to review the physicians billings It said one of its contractors recently reviewed  medical claims of highcoding physicians and the process cost more money than it caught in overpayments CMS said a second phase of the reviewof  claimswas nearing completion Based on the results of this effort CMS will reassess the effectiveness of reviewing claims for highcoding physicians versus other efforts such as sending these doctors reports that compare their billings to their peers Grant of the inspector generals Atlanta office said that while the individual evaluation and management services dont cost much they add up  and that if CMS declares that it wont review outliers it could send the wrong message The challenge that CMS is trying to figure out is what is the best way to get at this Grant said We see the advantage of continuing to look at these high billers Not only are they billing high now it could have an impact on future billings  This is not just free rein to bill whatever you want
