We all know that exercise can make us fitter and reduce our risk for illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease But just how from start to finish a run or a bike ride might translate into a healthier life has remained baffling Now new research reports that the answer may lie in part in our DNA Exercise a new study finds changes the shape and functioning of our genes an important stop on the way to improved health and fitness The human genome is astonishingly complex and dynamic with genes constantly turning on or off depending on what biochemical signals they receive from the body When genes are turned on they express proteins that prompt physiological responses elsewhere in the body  Scientists know that certain genes become active or quieter as a result of exercise But they hadnt understood how those genes know how to respond to exercise 
 Enter epigenetics a process by which the operation of genes is changed but not the DNA itself Epigenetic changes occur on the outside of the gene mainly through a process called methylation In methylation clusters of atoms called methyl groups attach to the outside of a gene like microscopic mollusks and make the gene more or less able to receive and respond to biochemical signals from the body  Scientists know that methylation patterns change in response to lifestyle Eating certain diets or being exposed to pollutants for instance can change methylation patterns on some of the genes in our DNA and affect what proteins those genes express Depending on which genes are involved it may also affect our health and risk for disease Far less has been known about exercise and methylation A few small studies have found that a single bout of exercise leads to immediate changes in the methylation patterns of certain genes in muscle cells But whether longerterm regular physical training affects methylation or how it does has been unclear  So for a   scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm recruited  young and healthy men and women brought them to the lab for a series of physical performance and medical tests including a muscle biopsy and then asked them to exercise half of their lower bodies for three months  One of the obstacles in the past to precisely studying epigenetic changes has been that so many aspects of our lives affect our methylation patterns making it difficult to isolate the effects of exercise from those of diet or other behaviors  The Karolinska scientists overturned that obstacle by the simple expedient of having their volunteers bicycle using only one leg leaving the other unexercised In effect each person became his or her own control group Both legs would undergo methylation patterns influenced by his or her entire life but only the pedaling leg would show changes related to exercise  The volunteers pedaled onelegged at a moderate pace for  minutes four times per week for three months Then the scientists repeated the muscle biopsies and other tests with each volunteer  Not surprisingly the volunteers exercised leg was more powerful now than the other showing that the exercise had resulted in physical improvements  But the changes within the muscle cells DNA were more intriguing Using sophisticated genomic analysis the researchers determined that more than  sites on the genome of muscle cells from the exercised leg now featured new methylation patterns Some showed more methyl groups some fewer But the changes were significant and not found in the unexercised leg  Interestingly many of the methylation changes were on portions of the genome known as enhancers that can amplify the expression of proteins by genes And gene expression was noticeably increased or changed in thousands of the musclecell genes that the researchers studied  Most of the genes in question are known to play a role in energy metabolism insulin response and inflammation within muscles In other words they affect how healthy and fit our muscles  and bodies  become  They were not changed in the unexercised leg  The upshot is that scientists now better understand one more step in the complicated multifaceted processes that make exercise so good for us  Many mysteries still remain though said Malene Lindholm a graduate student at the Karolinska Institute who led the study Its unknown for example whether the genetic changes she and her colleagues observed would linger if someone quits exercising and how different amounts or different types of exercise might affect methylation patterns and gene expression She and her colleagues hope to examine those questions in future studies   But the message of this study is unambiguous Through endurance training  a lifestyle change that is easily available for most people and doesnt cost much money Ms Lindholm said we can induce changes that affect how we use our genes and through that get healthier and more functional muscles that ultimately improve our quality of life
