
 When Dr Nancy Swigonski a pediatrician who often talks with families about bullying saw a local high school coach yelling at players calling them stupid and lazy she tried to speak with her The coach went on the attack  She asked why I was in the gym All of a sudden it was about my behavior not the coachs said Dr Swigonski a professor of public health and pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine I was put on the defensive I realized that if I had such a hard time refocusing the conversation I couldnt imagine what most parents go through She declined to identify the sport and the school because her son recently graduated from there Because of that experience and because patients parents have long sought her advice about how to intervene in such situations Dr Swigonski and colleagues wrote a recent article in Pediatrics about   Coaches are supposed to be role models for our children she said Bullying is often defined as a sustained abuse of power Though most discussions have focused on bullying by school peers it occurs in many contexts Athletic coaches in particular wield enormous power and traditionally their toughness has been upheld  as a virtue  When do their demands cross a line While most coaches love teaching the sport as well as  teamwork and persistence studies show that   The impact on a childs emotional and physical wellbeing   Years after a coachs harangues students may still have headaches and anxiety Most coaches treat their athletes with respect but bullying is clearly a problem said Dr Kody Moffatt a pediatrician in Omaha who is on the executive committee of the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness for the American Academy of Pediatrics But it happens more at the elite levels of the game The biggest red flag for him Closed practices  Some coaches would rather deal with kids than parents said Dr Moffatt who coaches a youth hockey team But then theyll say What goes on in the locker room stays there  dont tell your friends and parents That may be innocent but as a pediatrician a parent and a coach I dont think any coach should tell an adolescent not to tell another adult something When and how should parents intervene In her journal article Dr Swigonski noted that while a coachs behavior can be subject to interpretation demeaning and insulting language is always unacceptable If parents are suspicious that it is occurring she suggested that they sit in on practices and games to observe the coach But it can be difficult to get a coach to acknowledge the behavior and change it Dr Swigonski and her colleagues identified four defensive postures that coaches may assume  Moral justification Coaches may try to normalize bullying behavior with statements like All coaches lose it once in a while or This is how weve always done things and we win games   Backhand apology  I got a little carried away but we really need to work on fundamentals if we are going to win  This response minimizes the coachs responsibility for bullying even as it implicitly blames the victims Dr Swigonski said  The itcouldhavebeenworse approach For example a coach might say I never push them around or lay a finger on them  Escalation In such scenarios Dr Swigonski and her colleagues wrote coaches try to intimidate parents If you dont like the way I do things your kid can quit the team If speaking with the coach is unsuccessful Dr Swigonski suggests that parents scrutinize the schools code of conduct talk to school officials and if necessary contact child protective services Dr Moffatt acknowledged that parents who pursue this path could be impeded by significant obstacles a childs preference for suffering bullying for example rather than being cut from the team by a vengeful coach Or shunning by teammates Or belittlement by a community that embraces victories thanks to the  coach  But the bottom line If an adult is hacking away at your childs selfworth you confront the bully and prepare to do the right thing said Dr Moffatt who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Creighton University School of Medicine Elizabeth a graduate student who  played volleyball at a powerhouse Indiana high school still fears the teams coach highly regarded for her victories and ability to wrest  college scholarships for favored players  She would call you stupid in a yelling screaming voice at practice recalled Elizabeth who declined to be fully identified because a relative now plays for the coach If you cried on the court shed kick you off She would blame certain players when we were losing A lot of girls couldnt take it and quit Then the coach would tell us They werent that good anyway It was a relationship of fear said Elizabeth Everyone stopped talking when she came into the room Dr Moffatt said that coaches who resort to punishment lack the skill to do it other ways They are less effective in teaching the life lessons that can be the true gift of youth athletics  We learn from winning but more from losing he said Namecalling may motivate players but as far as a legitimate coaching technique its wrong and its time has passed When addressing coaches parents should acknowledge that there may have been a misunderstanding Dr Moffatt said  If the coach is confronted after using disparaging language that may be enough to change the behavior But if  youre not comfortable with how your child is being treated he added you have to be prepared to pull him or her off the team No amount of winning or playing justifies that
