New research presented Friday at the .  suggests that a low-fat diet may extend the lives of some women with the disease.. The preliminary findings are based on data from early-stage breast cancer patients who volunteered for the . . All of the women had surgical treatments and were continuing with various combinations of hormone therapy, chemotherapy and radiation, depending on the characteristics of their tumors.. Before the study began, women in both groups were getting an average of 29.6% of their calories from fat. Six years later, the women in the low-fat diet group had reduced that figure to 23%, while their counterparts in the control group crept up to 31.4%. (The women who cut back on fat also lost about 6 pounds, on average.). The possible benefits of cutting back on fat were apparent after five years, the researchers reported. The mortality rate for women in the low-fat diet group was 6.6% – nearly 10% lower than the 7.3% mortality rate for women in the control group, researchers reported.. The longer the women were tracked, the more the gap grew. After a median of 8.1 years, the mortality rate for those eating less fat was 9.1% – 18% lower than the 11.1% mortality rate for those in the control group. And through 2013, the mortality rates for the two groups were 13.6% and 17%; that amounted to a 20% reduction for women eating less fat.. Then the researchers zeroed in on women whose cancers lacked receptors for both estrogen and progesterone. They found the mortality rate was 56% lower for women on the low-fat diet than for women in the control group.
