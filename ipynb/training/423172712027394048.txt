We did not know our calm would soon break As we would learn Ellie had been relocated to the hospitals neonatal intensive care unit because of a heart condition suspected by the pediatrician Her prognosis was encouraging but her immediate condition was tenuous  she needed supplemental oxygen and medication to help her heart and lungs work properly And we were told a geneticist would visit us to discuss an additional diagnosis That additional diagnosis was hardly the afterthought it sounded at the time Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of a third copy of the st chromosome It is the most common chromosomal condition affecting more than  Americans according to the National Down Syndrome Society Down syndrome is associated with delayed cognitive ability and physical growth I secretly hoped that it was all just a bad dream  But instead of awaking to relief each morning was greeted with pounding guilt for wishing that Ellie was any different than the miracle she was destined to be  We coped with the stress of her heart complication from which she recovered by the time she was  months old and we began to accept the challenges associated with Down syndrome that lay ahead But the visual painted by the geneticist of Ellie as an adult wearing a name tag and struggling to load a milk carton into a grocery bag was etched in our minds  That description of Ellies diminished outlook delivered as a foregone conclusion was difficult to accept Her promise stolen It was an injustice that took time to fully appreciate and gnaws at me even today Ellie now almost  has tackled life head on making friends and enjoying childhood while enduring endless hours of physical occupational and speech therapies to track milestones that come naturally for her older brother Ellie has braved twoadays her entire life showing up on time and ready to play   Never have I been more proud than witnessing Ellie walk for the first time Knees wobbly and body trembling she reached to the outstretched arms there to support her while shooting a look that signaled Ive got this In the nearly five years since Ellies birth weve experienced vast misunderstandings about the potential for individuals with Down syndrome Too often people look at Ellie and see disability They see cant Even highly educated clinicians are not immune to misconception electing to chart her against diminished benchmarks of success and suggest that Ellie should settle for less because thats just the way most kids with Downs are And yet weve met adults with Down syndrome who can check boxes for successful student accomplished athlete productive employee prom king or queen or husband or wife And while scientific breakthroughs and novel therapies should further advance the potential of Ellies generation in the longterm her daily accomplishments demand that we discount her disadvantages now They demand that we focus on her abilities and expect more from her The contradiction between Ellies accomplishments and the geneticists projection has shaped how we parent all three of our children Ellie now also has a younger brother We believe that children whether they have Down syndrome or not tend to perform to the level of expectations placed upon them  Expectations are often misconstrued as setting a floor on performance Rather we believe expectations serve as a ceiling so weve learned the trick is to set high expectations balanced with reassurances that it is OK to fail  And the only true failure is not testing the boundaries of our capabilities wherever that may be  From early on weve educated Ellies brothers about Down syndrome and what that means for her  Ellie can do everything you can do it just may take her longer or require extra help but shell get there eventually Her older brother then  retorted Can she go to the moon Yes we responded Maybe someday she can go to the moon   Of course its important to recognize challenges and provide resources to address them Its true Ellie needs support and lots of it But too often people focus on her disadvantages and lose sight of her strengths  Even school administrators try to classify her listing her deficits setting expectations low and building a case to separate her from her typically developing peers despite numerous studies that would suggest including her with her peers is mutually beneficial But pigeonholing her is the path of least resistance Low expectations are after all the easiest to meet The people closest to Ellie know the truth They know that she is capable of much more than what most expect of her That they shouldnt be fooled by her infectious smile capable of lighting up a room because behind that cute facade is a fiercely determined girl  Ellie proves that every Saturday during her rock climbing class  Sure she is intimidated by the foot walls struggles with the climb and rarely makes it all the way to the top But after a brief break shell look at me and say Again Daddy And equally importantly the people closest to Ellie also know she is just like most of the yearold girls in her preschool class She is a princess at heart who loves to host play dates and go swimming  She enjoys playing catch with her brothers and occasionally catches flak for teasing them Shes more alike than different Recently we asked Ellies older brother Do you remember what it means for Ellie to have Down syndrome Yes he answered It means she can go to the moon But its not fair why does Ellie get the extra chrome He was referring to Ellies extra copy of chromosome  the defining characteristic of Down syndrome If only our society could look through that same lens and focus on abilities rather than disabilities A prenatal screen pegged the odds of Ellie having Down syndrome at less than one in  so we like to think Ellie has defied expectations from the very beginning And we trust she will continue to do so from here on out Though we hope one day she wont have to We hope one day our expectations of her as a society are more limitless than they are limited Ellie has taught us many lessons about parental love but perhaps the most important of which is not letting societal expectations dictate all that a child can be  As we enter the new year we tend to make lots of resolutions  most of which are forgotten long before February  Im hoping Ellies story can help us make a more lasting resolution together to recalibrate our societal expectations   Lets recognize the disadvantage but not overcompensate for it by setting the bar too low  Lets for this new year and all that follow after see the can in those children affected by Down syndrome In fact lets do that for all our children  extra chromosome or not And as for Ellie shell see you on the moon
