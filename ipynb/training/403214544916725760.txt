Children around the world are less aerobically fit than their parents were as kids a decline that researchers say could be setting them up for serious health problems once theyre grown up Children today take  seconds longer to run a mile than kids did  years ago according to data from  countries Childrens aerobic fitness has declined by  percent since  Researchers at the University of South Australia used running speed as a simple proxy for aerobic fitness because it measures cardiovascular health and endurance Aerobically fit adults are much less likely to have heart attacks and strokes and children who are aerobically fit are more likely to be fit as adults The researchers analyzed  studies that included  million children ages  to  in the United States Europe Australia New Zealand and Asia Childrens speed started dropping in the s and kids have continued to become more snaillike ever since The only scintilla of light in the gloomy data is that starting in the s the decline in fitness seems to be less pronounced at least in Europe Australia New Zealand and perhaps the US Fitness is still plummeting in China The only country that hasnt seen a big decline is Japan where childrens aerobic fitness started out lower but hasnt slipped much Children around the world share the same reasons for being slower the researchers say Increased weight explains  to  percent of the declines in childrens aerobic fitness according to   an exercise physiologist who led the study He reported the results Tuesday at the American Heart Associations scientific meeting in Dallas Higher   may contribute to the decrease in the running performance of lateteenage girls observed recently Japanese scientists wrote in  in one of the studies used Lower levels of physical activity both in organized sports and at play account for a lot of the rest they say US health authorities say children should be getting  minutes of active play a day but only onethird are getting that Children are much less likely to walk bike or skate to school than they were in the s at least in the US Canada Australia and the United Kingdom Neighborhoods are increasingly suburban especially in Asia and people are driving more And from the s till now the number of global households with TVs VCRs computers Internet access and video games has soared Theres a lesson for parents in this too and not just that they need to push the kids off the couch Adults aerobic fitness has been falling at pretty much the same rate as childrens the researchers found And for grownups being aerobically fit is probably the best way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke
