The US Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a  law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in Americas second mostpopulous state In an unsigned order the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct  appeals court ruling A panel of the US th Circuit Court of Appeals had said Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospitallevel upgrades The court also put on hold a provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals The rule remains in effect elsewhere in Texas Justices Samuel Alito Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects The th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping law overwhelmingly passed by the GOPcontrolled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov Rick Perry last year
