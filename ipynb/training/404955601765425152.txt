One doctor told us straight up the first night that there was a  chance that he would be normal said Benjamin Miller a professional photographer We definitely prayed and prayed  Miller captured some of the key moments in Wards journey and stitched them together in a video running almost seven minutes long now hugely popular  Millers footage shows how Lyndsey Miller first held her son at  days old when Ward was covered in tubes and cords Hospital staff helped position the baby and the medical equipment so he could nestle against his mothers chest  In the video Wards mother looks straight at the camera and smiles gently stroking the baby then suddenly tilts her head down and covers her mouth with her hand in a flood of tearful emotion The early birth wasnt Wards only challenge At  days old a scan revealed blood in his brain tissue meaning blood had gotten in there at some point His father remembers crying and praying the whole way to the hospital that day And then you get there and you see him and hes laying there Hes still the same old self he said We just felt so bad He has no control over this Its not his fault  Over time the bleed didnt grow and the blood was slowly reabsorbed by the brain The problem has not persisted  Ward finally got to go home after spending more than  days in the NICU at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio HOME is displayed in large capital letters in the video When we finally brought him home it was amazing Miller said That was   day Everything was leading up to that day and to have him there was amazing It was how it was supposed to be from the getgo We had to wait  days before we could experience that so it was just amazing Miller had originally wanted to prepare a video for his sons first birthday but after that day went by he found the next best opportunity October  the anniversary of Wards homecoming and one day before Lyndseys birthday The video found a large audience online its been watched more than  million times  Its definitely spreading awareness about NICUs Wards dad said People have no idea  that there are these NICUs with these babies holding on and parents scared out of their wits and its going on every day all around the nation  The main comments Miller has been getting on the video are from other fathers who sharing their stories Miller is struck by how similar their tales are  Pretty much everyone is saying like That was me This video could have been me That is exactly what I went through  Miller said  Today Ward is technically  months old but since he wasnt supposed to be born until October   he seems just over a year old Miller said  All the doctors who meet him and we say he was  weeks early they just cant believe it Miller said He doesnt even look like he was a preemie  Its possible that the brain bleeding could result in problems later on Miller said but so far Ward doesnt need any speech or physical therapy He just had his month developmental assessment and hes right on track with his age group he said  The child has no major health issues except for one an inflammation in his throat He sometimes vomits once every two days which may be related to an allergy but the family isnt sure They have a great doctor helping though Miller said  Ward has seen the video on his mothers iPad and likes watching himself Miller said But yeah he doesnt understand it Miller said and its not going to be until hes probably    that it really sets in whats happened
