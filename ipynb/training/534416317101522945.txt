The wheels of drug research grind slowly but they can grind exceedingly fine Merck said Monday that its cholesterol drug Vytorin was vindicated by a nineyearlong clinical study that aimed to find out if adding a drug that blocked the absorption of cholesterol to a statin long the gold standard for cholesterol care would help patients at a high risk of heart attack and stroke Previous research had raised doubts about Vytorins effectiveness In a bit of a surprise the study known by the acronym   showed that the drug worked Still the effects were modest Researchers found that when people took Vytorin a combination of the statin   and ezetimibe the cholesterol blocker for seven years their risk of heart attack and stroke was about  percentage points lower than patients taking only simvastatin All told  percent of patients taking Vytorin experienced a heart attack or stroke compared with  percent of those taking simvastatin alone In relative terms Vytorin reduced the chances of a heart attack or stroke by  percent over seven years As for side effects they were about the same for both groups This is a reminder to everybody that all the stuff theyve heard about cholesterol is true   the principal investigator for the study told Shots in an interview Lowering the cholesterol to even lower levels than we had in the past looks to be beneficial he said The   were presented Monday in Chicago at a scientific meeting of the American Heart Association Vytorin and Zetia which is the brand name for ezetimibe alone have been on the market for years In approving them the Food and Drug Administration relied mainly on data that showed the drugs reduced bad cholesterol rather than on whether the drugs led to fewer heart attacks and strokes among people who took them Theres still some uncertainty but overall its good news Yale cardiologist Harlan Krumholz told Shots It means that theres another option for treatment that has some evidence behind it Using a laboratory measurement such as bad cholesterol as a   is common But a previous study that looked at thickening of the arteries that carry blood to the brain raised doubts about Vytorin and Zetia The extra drug didnt appear to reduce thickening compared with simvastatin alone Merck which bought Vytorins maker ScheringPlough in    last year to settle a suit brought by investors who claimed the companies had harmed them by withholding those unflattering data IMPROVEIT looked at patients at a high risk of heart attack and stroke Would Vytorin and Zetia help patients at lower risk Krumholz said that using the drugs for whats called primary prevention  stopping a first heart attack or stroke  remains an open question Doctors and patients also dont know for sure how effective Zetia is when added to more potent statins such as atorvastatin the generic form of Lipitor and Crestor Its unlikely that a study like this one will be extended to those other drugs The IMPROVEIT trial was huge  more than  patients And it was expensive The exact costs of a trial like IMPROVEIT are difficult to calculate but are on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars a Merck spokeswoman said in an email to Shots And speaking of cost Vytorin isnt cheap A day supply   at Costco Atorvastatin or generic Lipitor runs  or less depending on the dose
