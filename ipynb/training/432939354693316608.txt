When doctors rush a lung to a hospital for a transplant the precious cargo arrives in the operating room in a container that seems more appropriate for Bud Light  a cooler filled with ice Thats been the protocol for donated organs for decades Doctors drop them into a plastic bag and put them on ice But lungs soon stop breathing Hearts stop beating The organs essentially shut down and start to deteriorate This means doctors have only about   to get the lung from the donor into the recipient If the travel time is too long the organ cant be used and goes to waste Now a team of doctors and engineers in Massachusetts is trying to change that The company   in Andover has developed an experimental device that keeps hearts and lungs alive while theyre transported from the donor to the recipient Its essentially a lung in a box   transplant surgeon   in a video for the University of California Los Angeles Known as the   the device circulates blood through the lungs and pumps oxygen through the lobes So the lungs can breathe outside the body The machine isnt yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the US But eight hospitals around the country are   it out in a clinical trial TransMedics is also developing a similar machine for   It keeps a heart warm pumps blood through it and feeds it nutrients so the heart continues to beat outside the body And both devices are portable So they can hop on the medic helicopter along with the transplant crew For the first time the donor lungs can be maintained in a breathing warm nourished state during transport Ardehali   In a preliminary   the lung in a box successfully worked in  transplants Now doctors in the US Canada and Europe are performing a larger study with more than  patients to see whether the machine can outperform the iceandcooler mode of transportation The hope is that the lung in a box and its heart equivalent will one day increase the success rates of transplants Ardehali says by extending the life of an organ outside the body Then doctors could spend more time finding a perfect match for the lung or heart And the organs could be transported farther distances On an annual basis more than  or  hearts in Hawaii go unused Ardehali says Because of the distance these hearts cannot be transported to the mainland
