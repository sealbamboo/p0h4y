The Obama administration delivered on a longdelayed health care promise when it issued rules to ensure equal health insurance treatment for people who have problems with mental health or need treatment for substance abuse The rules   Friday require that most health insurance plans offer the same amount of coverage for mental health and substance abuse claims as they do for medical and surgical coverage That means insurers cant charge someone more for mental health services than for other services It used to be that plans could  and would  pay  percent of the charge for medical care but only  percent of the claim for mental health care But under these rules plans cant cover fewer inpatient hospital days for mental health or substance abuse treatment than they do for a physical illness The law creating whats called mental health parity actually passed in  Mental health advocates have been agitating for these rules ever since Thats because once the   barred insurance companies from imposing limits on the number of hospital days or copayments insurance companies started looking for other ways to limit mental health and substance abuse care like requiring preauthorizations that they dont demand for other types of medical care That wont be allowed anymore These rules also clarify coverage for rehabilitation or other intermediate types of care that dont fall neatly into inpatient or outpatient categories Until recently the mental health parity law only applied to people covered by    those with more than  workers That all changed when the Affordable Care Act was passed in  It expands   to include the health insurance plans of smaller groups as well as individual plans And it also requires that those plans cover treatment for mental health and substance abuse programs But that last requirement wasnt included in the  law and it still doesnt apply to larger plans under the Affordable Care Act The  law just says if the plan offers coverage that coverage has to be the same for mental health and substance abuse as it is for other medical care So more people are covered but there are still some people who are left out While   now has a mental health parity requirement Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program dont
