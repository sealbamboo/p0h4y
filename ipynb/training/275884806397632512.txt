Whats the largest tax break in the federal tax code If you said the mortgage interest deduction youd be wrong The break for charitable giving Nope How about capital gains or state and local taxes No and no Believe it or not dollar for dollar the   the federal government forgoes every year is from not taxing the value of health insurance that employers provide their workers Yet most people dont even realize that they dont pay taxes on the value of those health benefits Thats too bad says   because it represents a whole lot of money If we treated health insurance the same way we treat wages says Gruber we would raise about  billion per year more That not only makes the health insurance exclusion the federal governments largest tax break but its also the third largest health care program in the US after Medicare and Medicaid And just how much does  billion represent in health care terms If we ended the tax exclusion we could cover every uninsured American with health insurance twice over Gruber estimates But theres another thing about the health care deduction thats kind of surprising It came about largely by accident It was just a way to allow employers to evade the wage and price controls of World War II says Gruber And its sort of grown exponentially since and there really isnt a single health care expert who would design a system from scratch which would include this feature One big reason   dont much like the insurance tax exclusion is that its regressive That means those it helps the most are the richest people with the most generous health plans So if youre uninsured you get nothing says Ron Pollack of the consumer group   If youre a lowwage worker you get a very little tax break If you get a lousy health care plan you get a very little break out of this And giving people a tax break encourages them to consume their compensation in the form of health benefits rather than wages says Gruber In other words its a discount on health insurance Which leads to other bad things like health care inflation People are buying health insurance with cent dollars he says And as a result theyre buying too much of it Theyre buying too much health insurance and that leads to too much health care consumption So why hasnt the exclusion been taken away One large and obvious reason is that it would be seen by those who benefit from it as a tax increase And not all of those people are rich A large amount of this tax money would come right out of the pockets of working families says Tom Leibfried of the   The US House Ways and Means Committee staff looked at where the tax benefit goes for this tax break Eightyone percent of it goes to families making less than  a year But the biggest concern particularly in light of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is that taking away the tax break would prompt employers to stop offering coverage And that would push more people to   that will just be starting to find their footing This is a very delicate moment in the history of our health care system says Jim Klein president of the   which represents large employers And to now in addition to all the other change make changes to the tax treatment of employerprovided health care would seem to be very risky The federal health law actually does begin to make some changes to the tax treatment of health insurance It imposes   on very generous health plans starting in  Many people think that given the money involved however that tax could be expanded and sped up as part of the current negotiations
