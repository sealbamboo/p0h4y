Attention moviegoers interested in aging who thought   was too depressing   was too depressing and   was offthecharts depressing Ive got a tip for you Land Ho Part road movie part character study this quiet indie film follows two former brothersinlaw on an improvisatory vacation Mitch a bombastic divorced surgeon with a salty vocabulary thinks the more reserved Colin needs to reach down and grab a handful of guts to recover from widowhood and then a divorce So he books a flight to Iceland  why Iceland why not  and theyre off on a series of lowintensity adventures As they motor around the spectacular countryside and have rambling conversations what passes for a plot involves questions like whether their rented Hummer will make it through a pool of uncertain depth on a remote road or whether they will find their way back to the hotel after a latenight hike The story meanders and the growing friendship has its ups and downs but note this Nobody gets dementia Nobody dies In fact the movie never actually reveals how old these guys are though the actors playing them Earl Lynn Nelson actually an ocular plastic surgeon in Kentucky and Paul Eenhoorn are  and  respectively Age permeates their story  Were the oldest people in here by a lot Colin observes at a dance club in Reykjavik  but it surfaces wafts through their conversations often improvised then dissipates again One man refers glancingly to loneliness the other briefly wonders how to live after retirement Then theyre off to see the geysers or pick up women My one quibble Hooray for latelife lust but Mitchs relentless casual sexism is no more cute or endearing than in a younger man Land Ho opened last week in New York and Los Angeles and will open in other California cities and in Arizona this weekend and next It comes to Connecticut Colorado Washington and its suburbs and the New YorkNew Jersey suburbs in August It requires tolerance for an ambling pace you can read   here and the grumbly reactions that long treks in close quarters can provoke but its a gem And I suspect a number of New Old Age readers will want to cheer this exchange toward the end Colin muses that hell miss Iceland Dont get that Sunday afternoon attitude Mitch says Good times are still acomin
