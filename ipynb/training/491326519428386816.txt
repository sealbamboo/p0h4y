Many people are intensely interested in how publicly funded charter schools affect children and that includes not just their academic achievement but their health Researchers from UCLA and the Rand Corp wanted to know whether attending a highperforming charter school reduced the rates of risky health behaviors among lowincome minority teenagers They surveyed  ninth through thgrade students in Los Angeles who attended charter schools and  students who attended local neighborhood schools They asked students about their health behaviors focusing on risky behaviors like smoking cigarettes using marijuana or drinking and very risky behaviors like binge drinking or unprotected sex When it came to risky behaviors there was not much difference between the charter students and the noncharter students However the teens at academically better schools were less likely to indulge in highrisk behaviors They were significantly less likely to engage in sex without contraception indulge in binge drinking or hard drugs use drugs at school or participate in gang activity The   were published Monday in the journal   Its kind of a chickenoregg phenomenon says   an assistant professor of pediatrics at Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston who was not involved in the study In other words are the students doing better because theyre in a highachieving school or because they are the kind of students who were doing well before they came to the school What weve learned through previous studies that black and Hispanic students do better in school environments when teachers have higher expectations of them SpinksFranklin tells Shots That may carry over to health behaviors too The researchers speculate that as children develop better cognitive skills they may learn to make better health decisions or become more health literate But it could also be that being in a higherperforming school reduces their exposure to risky peers And it may be as simple as having more homework and less time to get in trouble the researchers note This wasnt a randomized controlled trial Even though the students were admitted to the charter schools by lottery parents and children chose which schools to apply for whether or not to enroll
