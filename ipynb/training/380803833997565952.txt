The federal LongTerm Care Commission   on Wednesday but it did little to change the perception that substantial relief for caregivers will be a long time coming The commission had   late last week prior to the release of the full report Among other measures the recommendations call for recognizing caregivers as members of care teams including information about caregivers in patient records assessing caregivers need for support and making services like respite care more widely available But this group of  experts couldnt agree on how to pay for longterm care services needed by frail older adults or people with disabilities The full report doesnt change that Currently only those who are impoverished and qualify for Medicaid get significant assistance from the government for longterm care  For the most part middleclass families are left to bear the burdensome expenses  an hour on average for homemaker services  an hour for home healthcare aids  a month for assisted living  a day for a private nursing home room according to     How to ease this financial burden was the most important issue facing the commission In the end the report proposed two alternatives some kind of government insurance program for longterm care or some kind of private insurance option Then commission members essentially threw up their hands admitting they couldnt agree   When my colleague Paula Span wrote about the commission earlier this year she asked   For many the answer is neither Even some commission members feel a sharp sense of frustration and disappointment One is Judy Feder a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who voted against the commissions final recommendations on the grounds that they didnt fulfill Congresss charge to come up with a comprehensive solution I asked her about a statement from six of her fellow commissioners insisting that any new longterm care program not enlarge public budgets The current system has a budgetary implication Dr Feder said  It sticks it to families Another disappointed member is Judith Stein  executive director of the   The vision in the majority report is not much more than we have now she said It is Plan understand think about savings and insurance and provide for those who are impoverished  That kind of approach doesnt meet our longterm care needs now and it wont meet them in the future While several of the commissions recommendations are welcome they will make a difference only around the margins Ms Stein said    Families will bear the consequences said Ms Stein and other experts  Elderly spouses will continue to struggle to care for each other and adult children will  strain  to balance jobs and the needs of frail parents and their own children  Untold numbers of aging Americans wont get enough care and caregivers will suffer from stress and depression endangering their own health If a public insurance program is unaffordable as several commission members claimed might the private market  supply a solution to the aging populations need for affordable longterm care  That seems unlikely Premiums for private longterm care insurance have been rising dramatically policies are becoming more restrictive insurers have been exiting the market and bureaucratic red tape makes it     Financially the only way to make private insurance work is to spread risk over a wide base of policy holders  But the cost of longterm care coverage makes it unlikely that millions of healthy people will purchase policies This was the economic calculus that doomed the Class Act the voluntary longterm care insurance program that was originally part of the    Is there a way forward  The longterm care commission recommended two options  convening a White House conference on aging to consider longterm care policies and establishing yet another advisory committee to continue its work  But said Dr Joanne Lynn a geriatrician who directs the   The administration has shown no interest in having that happen and here we are on the cusp of the largest generation in history growing old She believes that its a mistake to separate longterm care from broader reforms of Medicare and the health care delivery system  The two systems of caring for people with disabilities and older adults need to be much more tightly integrated Dr Lynn said  Savings from eliminating inappropriate medical care  by some estimates as much as onethird of all care  could be used to finance the expansion of longterm care services she suggested  As for another commission is there any reason to hope it will be more successful in tackling critical issues when advocates of smaller government are committed to standing against a new federal insurance program for longterm care that might rely at least in part on public financing I think this will be a hard discussion but it is one that we as a country will have to grapple with said Dr Bruce Chernof the commissions chairman and president of the   in California  He sees the seeds of a potential compromise embedded in the commissions report  The two primary financing options considered by the commission share some commonalities he said including agreement on the need for strong public programs and a role for the private sector   If you look carefully at these two perspectives you can begin to see a way forward
