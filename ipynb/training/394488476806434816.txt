Because of heightened awareness about the hazards of sportsrelated concussions many states have implemented standards determining   But only a few states have begun to address     On Sunday the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations for return to learn checklists to alert doctors school administrators and parents to potential cognitive and academic challenges to students who have suffered concussions Theyre student athletes and we have to worry about the student part first said Dr Mark E Halstead the lead author of   a clinical report in this weeks Pediatrics  For adolescents prone to risktaking behaviors concussions are not just the nasty byproducts of sports Dr Halstead an assistant professor in pediatric sports medicine at Washington University recently treated a yearold girl whose concussion came not from a soccer match but because she was running backwards in a school hallway and cracked heads with someone  The academy emphasized that research about recovery protocols and cognitive function is scant There is no established restuntilrecovered timeline The new recommendations are based on expert opinions and   in Denver Doctors generally recommend that a student with a concussion rest initially to give the brain time to heal  That may mean no texting video games computer use reading or television But theres a big question mark about the timing and duration of cognitive rest Experts have not identified at what point mental exertion impedes healing when it actually helps and when too much rest prolongs recovery Although many doctors are concerned that a hasty return to a full school day could be harmful this theory has not yet been confirmed by research The students pediatrician parents and teachers should communicate about the incident the recommendations said and be watchful for when academic tasks aggravate symptoms such as headaches dizziness sensitivity to light and difficulty concentrating The academy acknowledged that case management must be highly individualized Each concussion is unique and may encompass a different constellation and severity of symptoms   Most students have a full recovery within three weeks the article said But if the recovery seems protracted specialists should be consulted  Many school officials do not realize they can make simple accommodations to ease the students transition back to the classroom the academy said  To alleviate  a students headaches for example schedule rests in the school nurses office for dizziness allow extra time to get to class through crowded hallways for light sensitivity permit sunglasses to be worn indoors Students accustomed to minute classes might only be able to sit through  minutes at the outset or attend school for a halfday Parents need to follow up with schools and make sure plans are being followed Dr Halstead said Dr Robert C  Cantu a clinical professor in neurosurgery at the Boston University School of Medicine and a coauthor of Concussions and Our Kids said The overriding theme is not to exacerbate symptoms  Dr Matthew F  Grady a pediatric sports medicine specialist at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia who may see  patients with concussions a week during the fall sports season often suggests that before  students return to class they should first try modest amounts of school work at home to identify if and when symptoms recur  But that rampingup period will depend on the severity of the concussion and the cognitive demands on the student he said Dr Christopher C Giza a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles cautioned against what he calls cocoon therapy  keeping a student sequestered excessively  Being a hypedup anxious parent doesnt  help the kids recover he said Dont ask them every hour Do you have a headache That will cause them headaches Annual reports of concussions suffered by young people are routinely considered low Some researchers count only emergency room visits though many families see private physicians or do not even seek medical care  By one estimate  high school and college athletes a year   However neither middleschool athletes nor students who play on travel or town recreation teams are included in that figure Adolescents who suffer head injuries from reckless behavior like falling out of trees are also not represented in that figure Almost two years ago when Jack Moseley was  he jumped on his longboard a type of skateboard to head down the street to a convenience store in northwest Philadelphia He wasnt wearing a helmet nor was he bending his knees in a protective stance Suddenly the board flew up and he fell back cracking his head on asphalt Dr Grady confirmed that Jack had suffered a concussion For several days Jack slept between  and  hours at a stretch He had severe sensitivity to light and noise migraine headaches and as he put it my appetite was funky  He could only tolerate sitting in darkened rooms not even able to watch the flickering lights of a television Its like being a mushroom which is hard for a kid remarked his father Rick Moseley It took Jack nearly a month to recover He exercised his brain in increments piece puzzles then  minutes of homework then  The greatest stressor he recalled was being aware of his limitations even as he knew that rigorous schoolwork was piling up But in retrospect Jack said he is glad he took it slow He has seen fellow students with concussions who returned to school right away Their symptoms lingered far longer than his Now he said he feels academically strong and has not noticed any sustained effects of the concussion Although he has yet to get back on a longboard he has even resumed playing his favorite sport soccer But he added I avoid heading balls
