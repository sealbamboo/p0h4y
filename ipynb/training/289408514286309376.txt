If theres one thing we love more than talking about beef here at The Salt its visualizing the USs insatiable appetite for meat through infographics and charts So when we ran across Sarah Hallachers   project over at Fast Companys   our eyes lit up like the charcoal grill on Super Bowl Sunday An art graduate student at New York University   has brought into focus the top US beef producing states by creating stateshaped steaks and then packaging them in Styrofoam and shrinkwrap so they look just like those ribeyes and tenderloins you grab from your grocery refrigerator case Hallacher focused on the four top beef makers and scaled each steaks size to the total pounds shipped out each year So Nebraska  which produced a whooping  billion pounds of ground beef and Tbones in  is the biggest steak measuring over  inches from north to south Texas which ranks fourth in the country is the most petite steak in the series but its by far the most shapely Hallacher carefully sculpted its curvy edges with a thin layer of fat trimmed back to a healthy level And oh yeah the Beef Stakes are all made with modeling clay so you can hold and examine them without worry about catching a   bug Thats a primary goal of the project Hallacher says  for people to explore the data behind Americas beef industry through a handson tactile experience But the pieces are also visually appealing By swirling in white clay with the red Hallacher adeptly mimics fat marbling in the steaks just like you see in a prime cut of meat Last year my colleague Eliza Barclay also visualized Americas   for meat and what it takes to make   with more traditional D infographics I have complicated relationship with meat Hallacher tells The Salt I love cooking vegetarian food But I also feel like a need meat in my diet So Hallacher says shes very careful about where her beef comes from and how the cattle are raised Shes done a lot of research on the topic to figure it all out Theres so much information on the web about meat production  the number of cows that were slaughtered in each state the parts that were used she says I wanted to turn all that data into a tactile experience She chose the tradition Styrofoam package because its visually familiar to people But I also wanted to point out that the packaging really doesnt tell you anything about where the meat is coming from she says In contrast the labels on her Beef Stakes are rich with information They give the total pounds of beef produced annually in each state the cost to produce that much beef and how many pounds each resident in the state would need to consume to gobble up all that beef locally Right now the four Beef Stakes are only on display in Hallachers Brooklyn apartment But shed love to see them at a gallery eventually or better yet surreptitiously planted in a grocerys meat department Itd be interesting to see them nestled with real meat somewhere she says It might stir up conversations and debates
