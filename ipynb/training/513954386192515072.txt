Four years ago Angela Stimpson agreed to donate a kidney to a complete stranger The only thing I knew about my recipient was that she was a female and she lived in Bakersfield Calif Stimpson says It was a true act of altruism  Stimpson risked pain and suffering to help another So why did she do it It involved major surgery her donation was anonymous and she wasnt paid At that time in my life I was  years old I was single I had no children Stimpson says I loved my life but I would often question what my purpose is When she read about the desperate need for kidneys Stimpson a graphic artist who lives in Albany NY says she found her purpose She now   about her experience and encourages others to become donors People like Stimpson are extraordinary altruists according to   Shes an associate professor of psychology at Georgetown University and one of the countrys leading researchers into altruism Marsh herself was the beneficiary of extraordinary altruism when she was  She got into a freak highway accident and ended up stalled in the fast lane facing oncoming traffic A man dodged traffic to come to her aid and help get her car started He saved her life she says then disappeared before she could ask his name Marsh wanted to know more about this type of extraordinary altruism so she decided to study the brains of people who had donated a kidney to a stranger Of the  people who took part in the    of them including Angela Stimpson were kidney donors Marsh took structural images to measure the size of different parts of their brains and then asked the participants to run through a series of computer tests while their brains were being scanned using functional MRI In one test they were asked to look at pictures of different facial expressions including happiness fear anger sadness and surprise Most of the tests didnt find any differences between the brains of the altruistic donors and the people who had not been donors Except Marsh says for a significant difference in a part of the brain called the   an almondshaped cluster of nerves that is important in processing emotion The amygdala was significantly larger in the altruists compared to those who had never donated an organ Additionally the amygdala in the altruists was extremely sensitive to the pictures of people displaying fear or distress These findings are the polar opposite to   Marsh conducted on a group of psychopaths Using the same tests as with the altruists Marsh found that psychopaths have significantly smaller less active amygdalas More evidence that the amygdala may be the brains emotional compass supersensitive in altruists and blunted in psychopaths who seem unresponsive to someone elses distress or fear
