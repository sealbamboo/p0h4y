He cannot tell us if something hurts why he is upset or happy where he would like to go what happened at school today what he would like to do for his birthday what he would like Santa to bring him for Christmas Smith   The older he grew the worse Bobbys behavior was getting He would fly into rages which Smith believed were in part the result of his inability to effectively communicate his feelings and to understand what others were telling him Desperate for help in April  Smith found a behavioral therapist who would change their familys life Bobby turns  next month and is a totally different boy now she said She knew that Bobby had the ability to talk Smith said in a   She pushed Bobby like none of us had before  Wherever they fall on the spectrum people with autism often struggle with communication They can have trouble developing language skills or fail to understand nonverbal communication through things like eye contact and facial expressions Parents therapists and those with autism themselves described a gamut of communication techniques that have helped Besides working on actual talking some have found success with   or printed words others speak   or      works as a speechlanguage pathologist in Indianapolis bridging the communication gap Most of the children she works with have Autism Spectrum Disorder  like herself Muir was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome at age  when she was in graduate school and still not making friends  She was always adept at using words but was challenged by social communication It was particularly hard in junior high  Girls are expected to know instinctively how to be social and when they dont it is very obvious she said  For years she thought of a conversation as a contest to see who could say the most interesting thing She remembers one time when some girls were talking about Britney Spears she jumped in with her own contribution saying something like Planes in World War I had synchronized guns so the gunmen didnt shoot their own propellers off  No one cared And they told her so It got better when she moved to a big public high school where students seemed more tolerant of differences Now she reminds herself to talk about what other people like not just what she finds interesting She said it helps to find an activity that encourages communication but doesnt force it For her thats dance class Its reassuring to know that I will see familiar faces for an hour at the same time every week I may socialize by starting a conversation about favorite dance moves or I may exchange smiles with someone because were doing what we love The more structured a social interaction is the more comfortable it is  To those without autism said Muir Everyone with autism has something to say Learn to speak our language and we will learn to speak yours California speechlanguage pathologist   agrees As a certified autism specialist she advises parents to use their childs special interests  animals music technology or cars for instance  to build their language  Go into their world and slowly lead them to yours she said  With students who love animals Brady uses a potbellied pig named Buttercup to communicate She has found many children feel comfortable talking with an animal and some have said their first words to Buttercup  She tells the story of a junior high school student who desperately wanted friends She rehearsed a few answers to common pig questions such as What does he eat and How much does he weigh then sent the young man into the school hallway with Buttercup on a leash  It was not long before he was surrounded by other students mostly girls answering questions with a smile from ear to ear A couple of the students remained friends she said Bradys own son is on the autism spectrum He is now  years old goes to college and works with other special needs children When he was younger he and his mother would spend hours in the living room lining up toy cars I kept the cars in a large bucket and if he wanted one he had to ask for it Brady said Initially it was just car then blue car then shiny blue car building language one car at a time It has taken about two years for  s son Sammy to learn to use cards with pictures to communicate The yearold has severe autism and speaks about three to seven words a month He cant tell his mother when hes in pain and she would give anything to have a conversation with him But she celebrates that he is able to communicate about  food requests and  nonfood requests play go outside etc through pictures  I was tickled when Sammy realized he had no limit to the amount of times he could request cookies For the first time I felt like a normal mother because I had a child who was asking for something he wanted repeatedly and he was getting the same answer No Ferguson wrote in an email  It has been an amazing experience to see Sammy go from just crying to using pointing to giving others picture cards on sentence strips Ferguson prays Sammy will find the communication tools that work best for him and that he will be able to share his thoughts and emotions with those around him Until that day I want the world to understand that my child is worth respecting loving and cherishing Cheri Smiths son Bobby knew about  words by the time he was  but his main form of communication was taking his parents by the hand to what he wanted A behavioral therapist near their West Virginia home helped Smith understand that their son was physically capable of speaking more with practice  For the first six months therapist Sharon Holbert worked with Bobby on sitting properly in his seat keeping his hands folded on the table instead of hitting her and his feet in front of him instead of kicking her There was a close link between behavior and talking As he learned how to stay calm he was able to learn more as he became better at communicating he grew more relaxed Holbert said  If you have a student whos hitting and screaming and kicking you cant teach them anything Once you get them to a place where theyre ready to learn then bam you can do something said Holbert a boardcertified behavior analyst His ability to learn was there I think he figured out if I hit people they probably will leave me alone As they worked on identifying colors numbers or letters Holbert wouldnt acknowledge his response as correct unless he said it verbally  Smith copied the model at home If he wanted any food items if he wanted a particular TV show that he liked if he wanted to go outside he had to ask verbally or he didnt get his want Smith said Quickly it was just easier for him to say the word than it was to throw a fit   He can now verbally identify letters colors animals and some shapes count up to  and say about  vocabulary words He can answer simple questions and has gone from using single words to short sentences like I want rice cakes please or mostly complete sentences like I want swim at the beach We went from being a family where our child was physically aggressive and having constant meltdowns to one that is enjoying experiencing the world through Bobbys eyes He also has his own unique language which his parents have come to appreciate too  Bobby loves to go for car rides When he wants his mom to turn down a particular road he will put on his own turn signal He clicks his tongue and makes it sound exactly like a cars turn signal and that is how I have known where he wants to go
