Mammograms dont reduce the number of women dying from breast cancer according to a large and longterm Canadian study Its the latest chunk of data to raise questions in an increasingly partisan debate about the use of mammograms to screen for cancer Improvements in breast cancer treatment since the study began in  have reduced the importance of mammograms in saving lives according to the   which was published Tuesday in the British journal   The study involving almost  women found no difference in death rates between those who had mammograms and those who had annual physical exams performed by trained nurses Theres too much mammography declares an   accompanying the study by a Norwegian cancer researcher That editorial notes that most of the randomized controlled trials showing benefits for screening mammography were done in the s when women were much less aware of breast cancer risks and before the advent of tamoxifen and other treatments that have done a lot to reduce breast cancer mortality The study also suggested that breast cancer is being overdiagnosed with about  in  cancers that are found through screening mammography   that would have posed no lethal threat if the cases hadnt been found But because theres currently no way of knowing for sure which breast cancers will become lifethreatening all the cancers end up being treated Other studies have come up with similar estimates for overdiagnosis In technically advanced countries our results support the views of some commentators that the rationale for screening by mammography should be urgently reassessed by policy makers the study authors wrote But not everybody agrees that theres too much mammography thats for sure The American College of Radiology and Society for Breast Imaging   an incredibly misleading analysis based on a deeply flawed and widely discredited study They point to the fact that the Canadian study put women who had breast lumps or enlarged lymph nodes at the start of the study in the group to get mammograms violating a key tenet of a randomized controlled trial And many of the mammograms were of poor quality the radiologists say But this study has been used to craft mammography guidelines by key groups in the United States including the American Cancer Society and the   When the task force reviewed screening mammography in  we had eight studies for women in their s and this was one of those says   a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri School of Medicine and a member of the task force an independent panel that makes recommendations for medical practice guidelines in the United States People had speculated that even though the Canadian study didnt show a benefit for mammograms in earlier years it would prove their value in the long term This says well it wasnt that LeFevre told Shots LeFevre was part of that  panel It   that women in their s and s should get mammograms only every other year It also said that women in their s should decide whether or not they want a mammogram based on their personal risk That guideline sparked fierce criticism from breast cancer advocacy groups and the American Cancer Society which   that all women start annual mammograms at age  In  LeFevre says people were unwilling to question the hardwon belief that mammography is critically important Now he says more people are willing to look at it Because the Canadian study ran for  years it gives a much better sense of the longterm value of mammography and also of the true risks of overdiagnosis LeFevre says And though eight studies on screening mammography may sound like a skimpy basis for national guidelines there are even fewer studies on the risks and benefits for women in their s and s LeFevre notes After age  theres basically no data at all Thats unfortunate because breast cancer remains largely a disease of age The older a woman is the more likely she is to get breast cancer and to die from it LeFevre says he fears that women in their s will become less likely to get screened at a time when they really could benefit I worry that women are tired of screening by then Women should be getting some new perspective on the question soon Both the US task force and the American Cancer Society have launched reviews of the evidence to update their mammography guidelines with the societys panel expected to complete its review later this year The US Preventive Services Task Force review will take  to  months LeFevre says and should be completed in
