Our greatgreatgrandparents probably didnt have to think much about the way the hearts aortic valve slowly stiffens and narrows over decades a condition called aortic stenosis Most of them died before they could experience its distressing symptoms  shortness of breath chest pain fatigue fainting Now an estimated quarter of a million older adults get that diagnosis annually When the stenosis becomes severe they have to grapple with their medical options a decision becoming steadily more complicated Theres no real medical therapy for this  no drug that is  because its a mechanical problem said Dr Harlan Krumholz a professor of medicine at Yale University For decades the standard treatment has been aortic valve replacement surgery opening the chest and stopping the heart to replace the malfunctioning valve That used to be the only treatment that improved symptoms and survival said Dr Dae Hyun Kim a gerontologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston Once older people develop symptoms about half die within two years Surgery drastically reduces that risk Still it is such a big operation that about a third of elderly patients either decide to avoid it or are warned they wont survive it Dr Krumholz senior author of a recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looking at the surgerys   calls it a technique thats been around for decades thats getting better but that is traumatic Enter a newcomer transcatheter aortic valve replacement TAVR as it is known involves a catheter usually inserted through the groin that delivers a new valve without a big incision and sometimes without general anesthesia The Food and Drug Administration approved it in  for patients whose aortic stenosis is considered inoperable then in  for the larger group of patients deemed high risk an expansion skeptics call indication creep It sounded like a big step forward Here was this new sexysounding procedure that had a huge amount of press said Dr Torrey Simons a palliative care specialist at Stanford University who has been analyzing the operations costeffectiveness If you watch television in New York you might have seen ads for NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital in which lively older women testified to their happy experiences with TAVR No stitches no pain and in three days I was home an yearold announces Unbelievable She was particularly lucky perhaps Appearing in the same issue of JAMA with Dr Krumholzs article was a review of the   The study reported that the median hospital stay was six days two of them in intensive care Moreover patients who opt for the transcatheter procedure face complications that in some cases outweigh those of traditional surgery The most sobering is stroke Data from a subset of the registry shows that within  days  percent of TAVR patients median age  had had a stroke  percent needed to begin kidney dialysis and  percent had died about half of noncardiac causes After a year all those measures were higher Some TAVR patients need pacemakers or sustain blood vessel damage A minority see no meaningful improvement in their condition Its still a relatively new technique and theres still a learning curve Dr Krumholz said  Traditional aortic valve replacement surgery has a lower stroke risk and its day mortality rate   percent in  according to the JAMA study a review of  years of Medicare records  is lower than that reported to the TAVR registry But most patients require longer hospitalizations  a risk in itself to vulnerable older people which almost by definition these are  and longer recoveries In both cases the procedure corrects problems with a single organ Most patients in their s and s have multiple chronic diseases Fixing one abnormality out of many may not make a huge difference to a patient Dr Kim cautioned It doesnt necessarily translate to better longterm outcomes or a better life He and his colleagues recently reviewed  TAVR studies Many were small and of questionable quality the team found They concluded that while most patients with aortic stenosis had reduced symptoms and better physical functioning after the procedure   Moreover some medical centers  about  now offer TAVR  have better results than others Im very concerned that were subjecting a lot of people to a procedure that sounds like it makes so much sense before we have all the data Dr Simons said How are patients faced with these choices  assuming they are surgical candidates and have a choice  supposed to understand the tradeoffs If you or a family member has undergone treatment for aortic stenosis please tell us about it below Naftali Zvi Frankel knows firsthand how bewildering the decision can be His grandfather who received a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis last year was eligible to join a clinical trial at a New York hospital Mr Frankel declined to say which It would randomly assign him to receive conventional aortic valve surgery or TAVR The phrasing used was noninferior  Mr Frankel told me meaning that one option was no worse than the other Was that true Mr Frankel a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Talmudic Studies in New York told his grandfather he would find out For more than a month he researched online poring over medical journals He even submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the state Department of Health to try to learn which surgeons and hospitals had the best outcomes These facts should be available to the consumer Mr Frankel said  he noted that patients get an idealized vision of TAVR but not much information about its risks His grandfather eventually decided on conventional surgery recovered well and is living at home in Queens But how many people can undertake that depth of research Most will have to rely on carefully questioning their cardiologists and seeking second opinions Perhaps most important they will have to consider their own values as they approach the end of their lives There are no certainties Dr Krumholz said Each option involves risks  as does aortic stenosis itself of course This is medicine in the modern age he said
