When the sun rises over the Rio Grande Valley the cries of the    blackbirds  perched on the tops of palm trees swell to a noisy unavoidable cacophony That is also the strategy it could be said that local officials health care providers and frustrated valley residents are trying to use to persuade Gov Rick Perry and state Republican lawmakers to set aside their opposition and expand Medicaid a key provision of the federal health law The Rio Grande Valley has a load of troubles high unemployment lowpaying jobs warring Mexican cartels a meager tax base and legions of people without health insurance While many of those woes seem incurable expanding Medicaid to the regions uninsured is to   who runs several local health clinics a nobrainer I think if were not ready if Texas doesnt buy in in the next three months shame on us she says Texas has the highest rate of   residents in the nation   in  Texans has no health coverage  and the rate in the Rio Grande Valley is even higher Medicaid is closed to anyone earning more than  a month leaving many working adults ineligible and without coverage Under the health law the federal government would pay the entire cost of the expansion for the first three years then  percent in subsequent years As it stands Texas would have to spend about  billion a year over the next three years say Democrats to receive  billion in federal matching funds But Gov Perry says Texas can ill afford to expand Medicaid and he doesnt trust that the federal government will pay its promised share At a news conference last month he blasted Obamacares Medicaid provisions Seems to me an appropriate April Fools Day event makes it perfect to discuss something as foolish as Medicaid expansion and to remind everyone that Texas will not be held hostage by the Obama administrations attempt to force us into the fools errand of adding more than a million Texans to a broken system For now uninsured patients in the Rio Grande Valley pay what they can for basic medical care but specialty care  to follow up on a lump in the breast for example  is almost always out of reach without some type of insurance including Medicaid according to Dr Henry Imperial the Brownsville Community Health Centers medical director Once you diagnose a cancer then what How are you going to give me chemotherapy or surgery or radiation therapy he asks Hospitals in Texas end up with millions in unpaid bills and the counties by state law have to provide basic medical care to destitute residents That has led a number of counties in the Rio Grande Valley  and elsewhere  to pass resolutions supporting the Medicaid expansion For local Republicans that mild act of defiance against a powerful governor  who is opposed to every provision in the federal health law  can seem like political suicide Its not something theyre eager to draw attention to Its contrary to what the GOP leadership in Austin is recommending but we thought it was important enough to take a position says Republican Carlos Cascos the countys top elected official State Rep Eddie Lucio III a Democrat from Brownsville faces daunting odds in trying to persuade the conservative Republicans who control the Legislature to buck Perry and approve a bill to expand Medicaid in Texas Lucio says hes not sure what effect if any the resolutions by county officials including Republicans like Cascos are having There is ample pessimism here in Brownsville that lawmakers  miles away in Austin will ever understand life in the Valley But because there is no hard deadline for when Texas or any other state has to sign up for the Medicaid expansion health clinic director Paula Gomez is pressing on She says she still remembers fighting the state to get drinkable water in the Rio Grande Valley and shell patiently fight this war too
