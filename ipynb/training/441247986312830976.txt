Its National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day When it comes to figuring out whether the   are spoiled and need to be discarded its best to trust your gut Your eyes nose and fingers can tell you if food has spoiled according to Alton Brown host of the Food Networks Cutthroat Kitchen We all have the senses to know when food has gone bad Brown told TODAY in an earlier interview Smell it If it smells bad odds are you shouldnt eat it Touch it If its slimy or sticky dont eat it If you look at a piece of meat and its got splotches of green on it you shouldnt eat it Each year one in six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food The best way to avoid becoming one of those stats is to take care in how you store and handle your food  and trust your senses But many refrigerators arent as cold as they need to be even at the lowest setting Invest in a thermometer so you know it really is cold enough How you pack your foods in the fridge makes a difference too Stack it so youre keeping the foods that could be dangerous away from everything else Brown said Meats produce a lot of fluid and you dont want those juices to drip onto cooked foods or veggies and fruits contaminating them Beyond that in most refrigerators the lowest temperatures are in the bottom shelves Thats because fish goes bad faster than any other meat Eggs be stored in the meat compartments rather than on the shelves in the doorThe biggest danger in your refrigerator is from contamination This may sound odd but contaminated food will make you sick but spoiled foods wont necessarily make you sick Brown said When it comes to fruits and veggies its OK to store them in the plastic bags you packed them up in at the store When it comes to thawing meats whenever possible it should be done in the refrigerator Brown said And put them in a plastic container so they dont drip all over everything eIse If you need a quick thaw then put the meat in a plastic bag in the sink and run a thin stream of cold water over it Brown suggests using a solution of  teaspoon of bleach in a cup of water And when youre prepping fruits and veggies always rinse with cold water If the surface is bumpy then use a brush to get them clean
