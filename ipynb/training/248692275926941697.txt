An experimental drug that helps people who have Fragile X syndrome is raising hopes of a treatment for autism The drug called arbaclofen made people with   less likely to avoid social interactions   in  Researchers suspect it might do the same for people with autism Fragile X is a rare genetic syndrome that can cause intellectual and social problems that are very similar to autism The discovery that arbaclofen helps people with Fragile X might never have occurred without the efforts of Katie Clapp and Michael Tranfaglia a Massachusetts couple whose son was born with the syndrome more than  years ago When the couple learned that their son Andy had Fragile X they started a foundation called   Its goal was to fund research that would lead to a treatment for their son Clapp says that goal is now in sight Back in  we knew exactly what we were aiming for and its gotten closer and closer little by little she says Research funded in part by FRAXA led to the discovery that Fragile X disrupts a system that regulates connections in the brain That discovery eventually led to drugs with the potential to fix the problem  including arbaclofen The new study of the drug involved  children and adults with the syndrome and was conducted by a team from Rush University Medical Center and the   Becky Zorovic is a physician whose son Anders was in the trial and continues to take arbaclofen Before the treatment she says Anders was terrified by things like birthday parties He would have such a tantrum about not wanting to go that after  minutes or a halfhour of refusing to go and screaming and starting to hit and kick and bite we would say OK you dont have to go  she says But recently Anders agreed to at least take a look at a friends pool party Zorovic says After   minutes he was in the pool and stayed for two hours she says So he was able to overcome it to get to that point where he was able to have a good time Arbaclofen appears to work by tamping down overactive brain signals that can make it hard to navigate social interactions Theres a good chance it will help people with autism unrelated to Fragile X because they have similar problems with social interactions says Mark Bear a researcher at MIT and a cofounder of Seaside Therapeutics which makes arbaclofen It would be I think unrealistic to expect that this drug would be uniformly beneficial to all people that have an autism diagnosis Bear says But I think we can still be quite optimistic that it can be beneficial to a subset of those patients There are now several experimental drugs for Fragile X in trials including arbaclofen But so far that hasnt helped Clapps son He hasnt been accepted into any studies near their home which is about an hour from Boston Clapp says Andy is now  years old and we are so eager to get him started in one of these trials she says But Clapp says she has no regrets about the efforts she and her husband have made over the past  years Even though we still have to wait I feel just absolutely thrilled that this result is out and that the trials are proceeding she says Its made all the work worthwhile
