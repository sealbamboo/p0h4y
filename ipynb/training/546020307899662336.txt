A veritable jungle of organisms is helping keep each of us alive But weve been rather negligent hosts For starters we dont even know who has shown up for the party When I signed myself my husband our dog and my mother up for   to have our gut microbes analyzed last year I had no idea what the results would turn up And based on current research even   who helps run the project couldnt predict whether I would share more microbes with my mom or with my husband So we waited for results And waited And waited It turns out that being part of new research  no matter how wellplanned  is an experience that requires a lot of patience Months after dropping off our samples at the post office I got an email with a colorful graphic display of my very own gut microbial communities There were bar graphs scatter plots and lots of unfamiliar names So after  years  and a few extra months of waiting  it was finally time to meet my microbes My gut is full of different species of Firmicutes a whole phylum of bacteria These can be incredibly diverse and include those in the order Lactobacillales familiar to many from its member   one kind of the bacteria thats active in some yogurts I had many more of these bacteria than the average person which was surprising Theyve been linked to obesity and Ive always been lean The second most common were Bacteroidetes species primarily in the   genus which help us mammals digest food These guys indicate according to   that Knight coauthored that my diet is heavier on animal proteins and fats than on carbohydrates I didnt expect that because at the time I um collected the samples I was eating a mostly plantbased diet But perhaps the occasional pulledpork sandwich or milkshake was enough to sway my bacterial profile Although a different diet could change a persons microbe makeup within  hours even a week on a different diet didnt entirely alter the profiles from longterm dietary patterns the same study said So maybe my relative levels were due to my generally meatandpotatoes upbringing  or my birth by cesarean section Research   found that infants born by Csection had lower levels of   as I had than did babies born vaginally Even the researchers who have been practically swimming in gut samples couldnt yet tell me exactly what my sample said about me  or about my health We dont have a good handle on the bounds for what a healthy gut looks like in the larger population or how lifestyle and diet drive the gut says Daniel McDonald a graduate student working on the project and studying quantitative biology and computer science And what about the other guts in our family The sample from our pooch Raz is still yes still awaiting enough fellow pet entrants to be analyzed As for the humans the beasties living in my gut were not much of a match to those in my mothers  despite quite a bit of research hinting at mothers microbial influence She had about similar abundances of Bacteroides and Firmicutes as well as  rare species that didnt even register on my chart Even though my diet mirrored hers for the majority of my life in recent years it has shifted to a more vegetarian mix away from meat and dairy Maybe  years ago there would have been a more obvious overlap between Moms microbiome and mine And perhaps having been born via Csection sent my microbiome on its own trajectory Still when compared with the rest of the study population we clustered closer together than an average stranger most of whom had a majority of Firmicutes My gut microbes were much more similar to my husbands He and I both had higher Bacteroides and lower Firmicutes and four times the average of some genus called   As McDonald notes cohabitating is the likely driver of similarity But he cautions there is a large amount of daytoday variation within an individual And that means multiple samples are necessary to begin to assess if there is a significant similarity Thats probably not what my husband wanted to hear Once there are more samples gathered consecutively from the same people Knight says he and his team might be able to make predictions about how specific changes in the gut say an overabundance of Bacteroidetes or the presence of a little known species might affect health But as in the early days of the human genome we are still very much in the process of mapping this uncharted intestinal territory Researchers are just starting to gather enough points of microbial and human data to decide what a sea of Firmicutes for example might mean for health and whether or not people with particular disorders have similar microbial maps Some of these designations such as Firmicutes are as broad as an entire phylum which can contain organisms as far apart on the tree of life as humans and conger eels So to truly start to get an estimate on the closeness of two peoples microbes researchers must calculate the evolutionary distance between different samples adding yet another timeconsuming step And we also still dont have the concrete knowledge to translate microbiome analyses into advice for people to get healthier Thats why we started the study  to be able to make these recommendations Knight tells me For now however theyre just trying to find a few meaningful patterns in the vast microbial ocean of thousands of fecal samples The gut is just part of the picture Microbes live all over our skin in our nose and mouth on our pets in the soil and even in the air And until we know more about these mysterious microbes perhaps we should sit back and marvel at the jungles of life that we really are And do our best to keep our beneficial beasties happy
