The Scottish government has launched a competition aimed at improving standards of catering in the health service Chefs and catering teams will compete to provide meals for  people which are locally sourced and meet nutritional guidelines   The winning menu will be rolled out across the whole of NHS Scotland However critics of the Good Food Challenge  say it is a poor use of NHS finances Hospitals in Scotland and Wales are required to meet national nutritional standards However the last time the standard of catering was assessed in Scotland was in  when a report found that one in five hospitals failed to meet the nutritional needs of patients Since then the Scottish government says more has been done to improve patients nutrition   All patients are screened for malnutrition on admission and wards also operate protected mealtimes to make sure patients are not interrupted by medical procedures while eating their meals Last year Scotlands biggest health board NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde admitted that it spent an average of just over  a day per patient  Its catering budget had been cut by almost m in the previous year   Scotland has not seen the same level of dissatisfaction with hospital meals as England where the Campaign for Better Hospital Food has been launched by the charity Sustain   But BBC Scotland has been contacted by a mother who said the standard of food given to her son who is receiving longterm treatment at the Sick Kids Hospital in Edinburgh was terrible She claimed main meals were highly processed and usually cold while puddings were cake and custard  school dinner style and never appetising The woman added I find it pretty shocking that children with serious illnesses who need good nutrition get fed this junk food  Its hard enough caring for an ill child without having to fret at every meal time about what they will eat and whether you should go out of the hospital to get them something else I bet if a manager ate them for a week things would change Nick Taylor who spent six weeks in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after a motorbike accident in  said the biggest issue he experienced was food being either dried out or developing a skin across the top by the time it was served to patients Mr Taylor added I was lucky because due to my injuries I had to eat  plus calories per day so I was given an additional menu which included things like chips and baked potatoes So I was able to make the menus work for me a lot easier than other people on the ward Some of the food was actually OK Mr Taylor said the rest of the care he received on the word was phenomenal Health Minister Alex Neil launched the chefs competition during a visit to the catering department of St Johns hospital in Livingston where more than  meals are prepared every day   Mr Neil said Scotland is known as a land of food and drink with some of the best natural produce in the world Despite this Scotland still has one of the poorest dietrelated health records in the developed world  Whatever the reasons for our dietary habits the Scottish government is determined that our culture must change if we are to prosper as a nation  That is why we are taking a range of steps to help people make better food choices taking account of foods healthiness quality seasonality and freshness Mr Neil said huge progress had already been made in the Scottish NHS with a nutritional database helping health boards to analyse recipes and ensure meals are nutritionally balanced and match patients individual needs He added The NHS Good Food Challenge  is an excellent opportunity for our committed catering teams to show what they can deliver and to come up with new recipes that are tasty healthy and can be shared across the NHS Regional heats are expected to take place over the summer with the final towards the end of the year haveyoursaybbccouk    Or get in touch using the form below
