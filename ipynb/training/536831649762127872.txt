Theres a project in the neighborhood of Harlem in New York that has a throughthelookingglass quality An organization called City Health Works is trying to bring an African model of health care delivery to the United States Usually it works the other way around If City Health Works approach is successful it could help change the way chronic diseases are managed in povertystricken communities where people suffer disproportionately from HIVAIDS obesity and diabetes One of the people behind the experiment which builds on the publichealth technique of community outreach is   Kaur is a native New Yorker who grew up in Queens About a decade ago just after she graduated from college she spent time in Cape Town South Africa While there she worked with a community health group called   that tried to tackle some of the chronic health problems in the poor neighborhoods of Cape Town especially HIV infection and AIDS The organization had an interesting way of tackling those problems They hired people from the community as peer health educators she says These werent people with medical backgrounds They were just local residents  people who were willing to help out One of the people Kaur was most impressed by was a woman named Thandi What was most powerful was her ability to draw from the life experiences of people she worked with to help them make better informed decisions says Kaur No amount of training can help you do that when you dont have the same life experience of the people youre working with When she returned from Africa her thoughts kept straying back to Thandi and how effective she was in helping people with their medical issues Skip forward to  Now Kaur is married and living in Harlem another poor neighborhood where people have a lot of chronic health problems including HIV infection and diabetes Her husband was training to be a doctor As part of his training he worked at a clinic that treats people with diabetes As I watched my husband begin residency it just seemed to me he had an extremely short amount of time to talk to somebody she says She felt all he was really doing was telling his patients to take their pills and watch their diet and then sending them on their way I was slightly aghast at seeing this revolving door of people coming in and out of the clinics but then going back to the same neighborhoods that have the conditions that shape why they were sick in the first place says Kaur She thought maybe a system of peer educators like Thandi in Cape Town could help here in America Thats how the idea for City Health Works was born Kaurs husband Dr   partnered with Kaur to get the project off the ground The pair raised about a million dollars from three sources   also a supporter of NPR the   and   where Singh works Singh says a lot of the people he sees in his clinic at Mount Sinai are in really bad shape People youd expect to see in the hospital People you couldnt imagine are in such a late stage of illness he says Its this population that City Health Works really wants to help The idea is to get patients to the clinic before they get so sick and then help them stay out of the clinics going forward We really need an ambassador he says Somebody that really understands the clinical environment but is deeply embedded in the community City Health Works hires people like Norma Melendez to be those ambassadors Melendez does not have a medical background Shes what City Health Works calls a health coach Her job is to work with patients after theyve visited the clinic She goes to their homes makes sure they have the medicine makes sure they take it and shows them how to stay on a diet their doctor has ordered These may seem like easy tasks but they arent especially when you dont have a lot of money I live in this immediate neighborhood so I can relate to a lot of the people who live in my community says Melendez Ive faced many of the similar barriers once upon a time or someone I know has faced these similar barriers Hiring people like Melendez people deeply embedded in the community as Singh puts it is one of the things that sets City Health Works apart from other programs that use community health workers This is an opportunity for a much more intimate relationship much faster says Paul Tarini senior project officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Such relationships should yield better health outcomes On the day I met Melendez she was visiting a woman in one of the housing projects near the hospital We went along with the understanding that health privacy laws prevented our using any of her clients full names The woman we met that day introduced herself as Mrs T She was diagnosed with diabetes  years ago Now she lives alone and for a long time she wasnt doing a good job controlling her disease I was stupid she says Ive let myself go so much And I dont have anybody else Tears drip from Mrs Ts eyes as she describes all the people shes lost in recent years My mother died my exhusband died my sister died my brother died and my dog died And I buried everybody Im tired of burying people A doctor seeing Mrs T at a clinic cant know how Mrs Ts emotional distress makes it hard to do what she knows she should do to control her diabetes But a community health worker like Norma Melendez can see all this and can help Even a kind word can do the trick I see her sometimes in the street and Im like yay says Mrs T So its somebody whos here Its not somebody that I go to an office to see that lives in midManhattan And theres an economic reality at work here If City Health Works coaches can keep people like Mrs T healthy and out of the clinic that would dramatically reduce the cost of her care Dr Singh says theres another benefit to using health coaches He says they can help build ties between doctors and the local community  something that could be really important in dealing with a medical crisis like Ebola Coaches like Melendez who dont have any medical training wouldnt have any direct role in caring for sick patients but they have an important role in building trust between the community and the health care system if a situation does arise says Singh They have an extremely important role in identifying people that might not feel comfortable going to the health care system Just getting sick people to a clinic early could stop an outbreak in its tracks City Health Works doesnt intend to rely on foundation grants to keep operating It is gathering data in order to prove to health insurers that it has a costeffective method of solving some of the problems that plague health care for the poor in this country And if it works it would be ironic that a country with the most sophisticated medical care in the world could learn a thing or two from countries that get by on a shoestring
