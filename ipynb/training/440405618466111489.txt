The teenagers brain has a lot of developing to do It must transform from the brain of a child into the brain of an adult Some researchers worry how marijuana might affect that crucial process Actually in childhood our brain is larger says   director of the brain imaging and neuropsychology lab at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Then during the teenage years our brain is getting rid of those connections that werent really used and it prunes back It actually makes the brain faster and more efficient The streamlining process ultimately helps the brain make judgments think critically and remember what it has learned Lisdahl says its a mistake for teenagers to use cannabis Its the absolute worst time she says because the mindaltering drug can disrupt development Think of the teen years she says as the last golden opportunity to make the brain as healthy and smart as possible Lisdahl points to a growing number of   that show regular marijuana use  once a week or more  actually changes the structure of the teenage brain specifically in areas dealing with memory and problem solving That can affect cognition and academic performance she says And indeed we see if we look at actual grades that chronic marijuanausing teens do have on average one grade point lower than their matched peers that dont smoke pot Lisdahl says In one   researchers from Duke University analyzed data gathered over many years from people living in New Zealand They compared IQs in childhood through age  among marijuana users and nonusers We found that people who began using marijuana in their teenage years and then continued to use marijuana for many years lost about eight IQ points from childhood to adulthood says study author   now a professor at Arizona State University whereas those who never used marijuana did not lose any IQ points The amount people smoked also made a difference Those who smoked the most  at least every day  saw the greatest drop in IQ the full  points And the younger they were when they started using cannabis the greater the IQ decline It wasnt just IQ Adults who smoked marijuana as teenagers did worse in tests of memory and decisionmaking than adults who hadnt smoked pot But theres an important caveat here Those who used the most marijuana in the Meier study had lower IQs to begin with   a psychiatrist and drug abuse researcher at Columbia University says theres a chickenandegg dilemma with many marijuana studies including this one Its very possible that theres something very different to begin with among teenagers who tend to get into trouble with marijuana or who become heavy users Tau says They could have subtle emotional differences perhaps some cognitive functioning differences It may be hard for them to fit in with a peer group thats more achievementoriented These differences could predispose them to use pot Tau says more funding is needed for betterdesigned longterm studies Current research is inadequate to answer all of the questions about marijuana risk But he says some things are common sense Its not rocket science to think if you smoke weed when your brain is developing that it cant be good for you just like any toxic substance isnt good for you he says Such concern seems to be lost among teenagers themselves In a recent federally sponsored survey  percent of high school seniors say they think marijuana is safe and  percent say theyve used marijuana in the past month  more than those who used alcohol or smoked cigarettes Six percent of high school seniors say they use pot every day which is triple the rate over the past decade And the marijuana they smoke is much more potent than it was in the s with far higher levels of THC the main mindaltering ingredient The higher the THC levels the more brain changes there are and the more there is the risk for addiction the University of Wisconsins Lisdahl says She says more teens and young adults are smoking marijuana in states that have made the drug available for medical use She says thats worrisome because it might be a harbinger of things to come if pot is fully legalized
