WASHINGTON—Medtronic Inc., undeterred by a surprising and definitive clinical-trial failure, said it will continue to develop its medical device for high blood pressure in hopes of winning U.S. regulatory approval.. The company shocked doctors and industry rivals in January when it said that its device, used to singe nerves in the kidneys with low levels of radio-frequency energy, had failed in a large clinical trial to lower patients' blood pressure more effectively than a placebo, or sham, procedure.
