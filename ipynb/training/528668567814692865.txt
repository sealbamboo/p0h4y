In West Africa the Ebola virus has killed more than  people but there have been far fewer funerals The bodies of Ebola victims are so infectious that they can only be handled safely by special burial teams They wear headtotoe protective gear and use special body bags and chlorinated water to disinfect the area where the person died In Liberia many of those teams are organized by the aid group Global Communities Since March the group has been trying to spread awareness about the dangers of burying Ebola victims without proper protection The groups head of Liberian operations Piet deVries spoke with NPRs Arun Rath about the challenges families and communities still face when it comes to safely saying goodbye to the deceased Rath asked deVries about the news that the epidemic is slowing as well as the reasons why safe burial remains a challenge Yes I live in Liberia and have been there for a little over a year and a half so Im very familiar with the context We became involved in response to Ebola in March and it has increased significantly over the time period obviously but there has been a flattening off in some of the most highinfection areas and a significant decrease in areas where Ebola first came into the country in Lofa County The urban areas have their own challenges but in the rural environment the roads are terrible often You know there are places where there arent even roads There are places where we have walkin teams where a team leader will ride a motorcycle out as far as he can get where there is a trained burial team that will then walk five to seven hours to reach remote communities that have been infected by the disease and conduct safe burials there and then walk back out again Theres one area that we work in where people have to canoe across a river and then do a walkin So its very complicated logistics and we have a lot of dedicated people who are making an enormous effort In the early days of the response there was an enormous amount of fear and resistance actually to safe burial teams engaging with burial with taking deceased from families So we engaged community in a lot of dialogue and awareness and once thats happened people have opened up and engaged with the county health teams and with us to assist them with removing deceased So they have very much embraced our activity and we have then in turn turned around to them and invited them back into the process  not in a handson way but allowing them to be a part of the service at a distance so they feel a connection to the burial of their loved ones  They want to know where their loved ones are buried they want to feel a part of that process of saying goodbye and were trying to facilitate that and make them a part of it so theres greater acceptance of this safe burial procedure That is a huge current issue  there are people who have been avoiding cremation for their loved ones and theres been a lot of resistance We have been working actively with the Ministry of Health and other agencies within the Liberian government to find appropriate land for safe burial for Monrovia I would say we are within seven to  days of being able to make the shift from cremation to safe burial which is highly supported by the cultural and traditional leaders of Liberia And I think it will really curtail any illegal burials and undermining of the Ebola response effort
