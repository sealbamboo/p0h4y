A project in Denmark is encouraging homeless people to get off the streets and onto the football pitch  with dramatic results The coin is tossed In just a few seconds the game kicks off While running up and down the field trying to score a goal and defend their own Marco Glentvor and Peter Fromm sweat for their health  They say football has changed their lives In Denmark scientists have found that football can significantly improve the health of homeless and other socially disadvantaged groups If I hadnt started playing football I would either be dead or half dead says Marco Glentvor who admits that he used to live on the street and take all the drugs I could get My behaviour has improved says Peter Fromm On the street I could come out with some aggression But when Im playing a match my mood is fantastic Both men have been monitored closely by Prof Peter Krustrup a sports and health specialist from Copenhagen University  The most important finding is that street football is a feasible fun and social way to improve the physical capacity and health profile of homeless men says Prof Krustrup after watching a training session in a graffiti decorated hall in an former Copenhagen brewery  The strenuous physical nature of this game helps to start the process of purging narcotics from their bodies  Peer pressure of team sport generates the determination that they need to stay out of the streets and transform their lives with this programme After just  weeks of training the physical condition and capacity of yearold Marco had significantly improved He has reduced his level of LDL or bad cholesterol by  increased his muscle mass by kg lbs and has been assessed as having reduced his risk of developing a heart disease by at least  These statistics are important because the life of homeless male means they die  years before the average Danish male and are five times more likely to be hospitalised with traumatic injuries as the result of falls and fractures When I started on the football project I got a lot of energy It opened some doors and all of the sudden I thought I wanted to have goals in life recalls Marco  Now I just want to live I want to make it better for myself It was a hard struggle but Im here today He now has a steady job as a clerk in a Copenhagen church Peter Fromm a  is the goalkeeper of the Denmarks national homeless football team He claims that football cured his addiction and took him out of the streets when other traditional rehabilitation methods failed Theres a lot of social networking with people who are on the same road as me to stay away from substances It gives me some stability and helps me to build my selfesteem Theres no doubt in the mind of Thomas Hye founder of Ombold a street football association that organises games that this sport also has psychological benefits Currently  of Denmarks  homeless take part in his event Mr Hye says Its about joy and to be part of something together with other people And losing without losing your head and feeling happy because you score a goal and try to do better next time Some of our players have anger management problems they have a lot of conflicts with society  On the pitch they might think the referee is an idiot but in football they learn they can cope with things  Football helps people to more than they think they can do It helps people get off drugs because of the adrenaline in the body Mr Hye and Prof Krustrup belief that other countries should establish football leagues for people who live on the streets Society has got a responsibility towards the homeless and socially disadvantaged says Prof Krustrup And football is an easy solution All you need is a ball and two goals The effects are rapid and marked in relation to health profile and wellbeing Prof Krustrup has carried out similar studies on other social groups such as the elderly and has concluded that football is perhaps the best form of physical activity of all  His advice is to stop watching the game on television and to get out and play Another group who play regularly is a team of Greenlandic women who spend much of their days outside the Sundholm hostel in Copenhagens Amager district They spend no more than half an hour on the pitch But their joy for participating is transparent No incentives are required to induce them to put down the beer cans  At the end of the session they spontaneously break into a chant of Sundholm United  I love football says Katava as a smile breaks across her deeply lined face And then she catches the bus back home  Around  of all those who join Denmarks street football league drop out  The beautiful game doesnt always save but at least it gets some of the rebounds
