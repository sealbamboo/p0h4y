A medical mystery is deepening in California where state health officials now say reports of poliolike illnesses that have left as many as  children with paralyzed limbs dont appear to be connected Its not clear what may be behind the rash of acute infections  by researchers in a presentation for the American Academy of Neurologys annual meeting Tests of  of  cases submitted by doctors and researchers have come up empty according to Dr Gil Chavez state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health Thus far the department has not identified any common causes to suggest that the cases are linked he said in a statement The investigation is ongoing But that only heightened the resolve of the parents of yearold Sofia Jarvis who was the first to be identified as part of the series of unexplained cases of sudden paralysis in kids ages  to  She was barely a toddler two years ago when she was stricken with flulike symptoms and trouble breathing  and later realized she couldnt move her left arm An MRI later confirmed that she had a spinal cord lesion that was causing paralysis Id like to say that Sofia is still a healthy young girl whos thriving Sofias mother Jessica Tomei  said at a news conference Monday She goes to preschool She does dance We were very lucky that it only affected her left arm But its taken us a long time to get to that point to be OK with that Sofias parents joined doctors from Stanford Universitys Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital to discuss the very rare  but very frightening  infections This is a decision to let everyone know what happened to our daughter so that we can raise awareness and hopefully if there is anyone else out there this will help them in the future she said Early surveillance identified five children between August  and July  but as many as  more cases have been identified since last summer said Dr Keith Van Haren a pediatric neurologist at the hospital Were seeing them throughout California he said The farthest north is in the Bay Area and the farthest south is in San Diego Van Haren and colleagues from the University of California San Francisco suspect that the illnesses may be caused by a virus possibly a type of enterovirus the same family of virses as poliovirus Two of the children in the early reports showed signs of infection with human enterovirus which has previously been associated with poliolike symptoms HEV is a rare form of very common enteroviruses which cause between  million and  million infections in the US every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Other enteroviruses have been responsible for outbreaks elsewhere in the world including Australia and Asia Like polio infections most enterovirus cases cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms but a fraction of cases can result in serious illness  including paralysis At its peak in the s polio paralyzed up to  people a year in the US mostly children until a vaccine eradicated the disease in the US and virtually worldwide All of the children identified in the cases so far were immunized against polio Although they were treated recovery has been minimal at best doctors said Identifying a common cause for the illnesses will be difficult Van Haren conceded Spinal fluid samples would yield best results but only for a couple of days The virus could be detected in the nose and throat or in stool samples for longer but those tests are much less sensitive and could lead to high numbers of false results The tricky thing for this is the window of opportunity for detecting the virus is very limited Van Haren said Were talking about doing a sort of epidemiological math where the scientists have to factor in how specific this is Van Haren and other researchers say theyll work with state officials to collect and analyze information about new cases They say that if children show signs of sudden limb weakness with or without other illness parents should seek medical care He cautioned parents not to panic We want to temper the concern because at the moment it does not appear to represent a major epidemic Van Haren said The CDPH is taking these reports very seriously We hope our efforts will help us develop prevention and treatment strategies in the future
