When it comes to feeding little kids adults know best But some nutritionists now argue that children could also benefit from a bit of autonomy at mealtimes The US Department of Agriculture   that parents let kids as young as  years old serve themselves at home And in  the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advised that child care providers should serve meals familystyle  present kids with a few different dishes and allow them to take what they want Why Because theres now research showing that when kids are allowed to serve themselves theyre less likely to overeat They also tend to be more open to trying different kinds of foods Despite this guidance the majority of parents and most child care centers still make up plates for kids according to   who directs the Child Development Laboratory at the University of Illinois That means they may be missing an opportunity to help kids form good eating habits in the preschool and kindergarten years McBride tells The Salt If you serve preplated meals to children the adults are deciding how much to eat McBride says And adults tend to overestimate how much small children can eat A   by McBride and his colleagues found that most independent and governmentsupported child care centers didnt serve meals familystyle more than half of the time The exception was centers in the US Department of Health and Human Services   They were much better about allowing children to serve themselves  because the program requires teachers to follow the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics guidelines But McBride says that a lot of child care providers feel that serving food familystyle just isnt practical It takes more time requires a lot more cleanup and often results in some amount of food waste Still many teachers do manage to make it work McBride says Often adults dont trust children can do it says   a dietician and a professor emeritus of food and nutrition at the University of Idaho But they just need practice At child care centers Branen tells The Salt teachers can always supervise to make sure the kids arent licking the spoons or making a huge mess Allowing kids to serve themselves isnt the same as giving them free rein over their diets Branan says Adults need to explain what a serving is she says It means Take a spoonful and you can always have more  The strategy gets more complicated with kids who dont have access to regular meals at home These kids may not know when they can expect their next meal so they tend to binge whenever food is available Branen says And while these are the kids most at risk of childhood obesity meals at child care centers are also critical in preventing hunger she says Of course relinquishing control over serving size isnt easy for adults I know this is really really challenging for parents because you also want to make sure kids are eating a balanced diet says   a professor of human development at the University of Illinois Initially it can be hard to watch your child pass on the broccoli time after time Fiese tells The Salt But parents should take heart Kids have to be exposed to new foods  to  times before they learn to accept them Familystyle meals are good for kids development in other ways Fiese says When kids handle serving spoons and ladles theyre practicing their motor skills and coordination And the conversations that occur between the kids and adults during leisurely familystyle meals have major social and emotional benefits The days of loading up kids plates and then rewarding them for making it to the clean plate club Fiese says are long gone Thats at least as far as these scientists are concerned
