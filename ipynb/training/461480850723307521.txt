Resistance to antibiotics poses a major global threat to public health says a new report by the World Health Organization WHO  It analysed data from  countries and said resistance was happening now in every region of the world It described a postantibiotic era where people die from simple infections that have been treatable for decades  There were likely to be devastating implications unless significant action was taken urgently it added The report focused on seven different bacteria responsible for common serious diseases such as pneumonia diarrhoea and blood infections  It suggested two key antibiotics no longer work in more than half of people being treated in some countries  One of them  carbapenem  is a socalled lastresort drug used to treat people with lifethreatening infections such as pneumonia bloodstream infections and infections in newborns caused by the bacteria Kpneumoniae  Bacteria naturally mutate to eventually become immune to antibiotics but the misuse of these drugs  such as doctors overprescribing them and patients failing to finish courses   means it is happening much faster than expected  The WHO says more new antibiotics need to be developed while governments and individuals should take steps to slow the process of growing resistance In its report it said resistance to antibiotics for Ecoli urinary tract infections had increased from virtually zero in the s to being ineffective in more than half of cases today  In some countries it said resistance to antibiotics used to treat the bacteria would not work in more than half of people treated  Dr Keiji Fukuda assistant directorgeneral at WHO said Without urgent coordinated action by many stakeholders the world is headed for a postantibiotic era in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill He said effective antibiotics had been one of the pillars to help people live longer healthier lives and benefit from modern medicine  Unless we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections and also change how we produce prescribe and use antibiotics the world will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the implications will be devastating Dr Fukuda added The report also found lastresort treatment for gonorrhoea a sexuallytransmitted infection which can cause infertility had failed in the UK  It was the same in Austria Australia Canada France Japan Norway South Africa Slovenia and Sweden it said More than a million people are infected with gonorrhoea across the world every day the organisation said The report called for better hygiene access to clean water infection control in healthcare facilities and vaccination to reduce the need for antibiotics Last year the chief medical officer for England Prof Dame Sally Davies said the rise in drugresistant infections    Dr Jennifer Cohn medical director of Medecins sans Frontiers Access Campaign said We see horrendous rates of antibiotic resistance wherever we look in our field operations including children admitted to nutritional centres in Niger and people in our surgical and trauma units in Syria  Ultimately WHOs report should be a wakeup call to governments to introduce incentives for industry to develop new affordable antibiotics that do not rely patents and high prices and are adapted to the needs of developing countries  She added What we urgently need is a solid global plan of action which provides for the rational use of antibiotics so qualityassured antibiotics reach those who need them but are not overused or priced beyond reach Professor Nigel Brown president of the UK Society for General Microbiology said it was vital microbiologists and other researchers worked together to develop new approaches to tackle antimicrobial resistance  These approaches will include new antibiotics but should also include studies to develop new rapiddiagnostic devices fundamental research to understand how microbes become resistant to drugs and how human behaviour influences the spread of resistance
