The Supreme Courts opinion Monday holding that some forprofit firms dont have to provide women contraceptive coverage required under the Affordable Care Act if the companies have religious objections addressed only half of the continuing legal battle over the birth control mandate But those on both sides of the issue think the courts majority may have telegraphed which way it could rule should one of those other cases reach the justices Depending on   there are more than   still working their way toward the high court They were filed by nonprofit groups mostly religious educational and health organizations like universities and hospitals Unlike the forprofit companies which were required to provide the contraceptive coverage directly through their insurance plans religious nonprofits were given a special accommodation under   in  They only have to fill out a form saying they object to providing the benefit on religious grounds and send it to their insurer or in the case of organizations that selfinsure to the company that administers their health benefits Once that happens the insurance company or thirdparty administrator provides the contraceptive benefits at no cost to the employer or the employee For insurers providing contraceptives is considered less expensive than paying for pregnancy and childbirth Thirdparty administrators are indirectly being subsidized by the government in these cases But even   is too much for many of those organizations Signing the form triggers the provision of services said Daniel Blomberg legal counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which is representing many of the nonprofit plaintiffs in the cases For many of the organizations that makes them complicit in providing something they object to on religious grounds he said But that may not be how the Supreme Courts majority sees things The   written by Justice Samuel Alito said the administration could extend the offer it makes to nonprofits to forprofit firms with religious objections as well That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHS stated interests Alito wrote He also noted that we do not decide today whether an approach of this type complies with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for purposes of all religious claims But in his concurring opinion Justice Anthony Kennedy went even further There is an existing recognized workable and alreadyimplemented framework to provide coverage he wrote referring to the HHS regulation for nonprofit organizations Advocates for contraceptive coverage say that is a good sign for them  that at the very least Kennedy would likely join the courts four liberals to make a majority in upholding challenges to the regulations for the nonprofit groups If I were litigating one of the nonprofit cases I wouldnt say it bodes well for them said Julianna Gonen of the   There are some strong signals here that the accommodation the administration created for nonprofits does meet the governments burden under RFRA The Becket Funds Blomberg says there are signs the court would go the other way In particular he pointed to the courts finding Monday that providing the coverage represented a substantial burden to the forprofit companies in the case Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties We think thats going to be very helpful in the nonprofit cases as well he said And he noted that following the ruling in the forprofit case there have already been several actions in favor of nonprofits Citing the Hobby Lobby ruling specifically a US Appeals court in Atlanta   for the nonprofit religious broadcaster Eternal Word Television Network The Supreme Court itself   Monday against Wheaton College in Illinois with only Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissenting Meanwhile there are suggestions that a compromise could be in the offing In the muchpublicized case filed by the   which operates a chain of nursing homes the organization ultimately agreed   not to fill out the form that went to its insurance provider but to instead write a letter to the government with essentially the same information That letter gave them a temporary reprieve from having to provide coverage while the case is heard by a lower court When they say to the government We cant do this that triggers nothing at all said Blomberg So could nonprofits that object to sending forms to their insurance companies send them to the government instead Sara Rosenbaum a professor of health law and policy at   said that could be difficult Particularly in the case of organizations that are selfinsured and dont use an insurer she said nobody can direct the administrator but the employer But Rosenbaum said it might not be impossible It might however require yet another round of federal regulations
