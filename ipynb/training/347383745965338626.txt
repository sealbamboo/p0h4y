What exactly is a sociopath Many people might think of killers criminals the cruel and heartless Jack Nicholsons character in   Thats the common wisdom But its being challenged by a new memoir  Its written under the pen name of ME Thomas The author says most sociopaths are not incarcerated  and the silent majority of them live freely and anonymously Theyre your neighbors colleagues maybe even family members and lovers Thomas admits that sociopaths can be dangerous theyre hungry for power and they dont feel guilt or remorse But theyre not inherently evil and some are highly productive members of society Thomas herself is an attorney law professor and Sunday school teacher She founded the website   They can be very charismatic They dont really get nervous  They tend to fail to conform to social norms They might come off as a little bit of an independent thinker Or they might be committing crimes depending on who they are They have a facility with lying  well they lie frequently obviously to cover up certain aspects of themselves or things that would indicate that they are a sociopath Probably the biggest characteristic of a sociopath is their lack of empathy  They cant really imagine or feel the emotional worlds of other people Its very foreign to them And they dont have conscience Definitely fulfilling and I think loving we feel a love You know whatever it is that we feel affection for me its maybe  percent gratitude a little bit of adoration a little bit of  if its a romantic relationship  infatuation or sexual attraction I think a complex emotion like love is made up of all sorts of little emotions And our particular cocktail of love is going to look or feel different to us but its still there I think that there really has been so little research done about sociopaths And the common wisdom now is that they are untreatable And that you know sociopathy is basically synonymous with evil  You know statistically everybody has interacted with a sociopath at one point But the fact that most people cant identify who a sociopath is or remember those sorts of interactions suggests to me that it couldnt have been that bad of an interaction right Most people interact with sociopaths in positive ways and dont realize it Its only when we catch them and they are in prison and we have gone through this lengthy trial to point out all the bad things that theyve done that we start thinking that sociopaths are bad I had just lost a job I had just lost several relationships And it wasnt the first time that something like this had happened to me where my life seemed to just fall apart And I thought Well I cant keep doing this  every few years have my life just go kaput And so I thought What is the common denominator here Its me There must be something that Im doing thats causing this So I started going to therapy and therapy didnt really help that much  But I remembered through therapy a casual diagnosis that one of my coworkers had made years before And I explained to her how I viewed the world and my ethical principles and she said very nicely You might consider the fact that you are a sociopath So I looked it up and I saw the traits and it made sense And it made sense in a way that nothing really before had Theres a huge stigma against sociopaths and I wanted to protect my family a little bit as well I have little relatives who share my last name and theyve done nothing really to bring any sort of notoriety to themselves
