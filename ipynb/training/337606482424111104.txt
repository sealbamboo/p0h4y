Stress can be a bummer for your heart And it seems antidepressants may help some people with heart disease better weather that stress Thats the intriguing suggestion from a study that tested how people with heart disease reacted when faced with challenging mental and social tests People who were on an antidepressant while dealing with these stressful situations were less likely to have   a condition in which the heart gets less blood It can cause chest pain irregular heartbeat and in the most serious cases heart damage People are often given a treadmill test to diagnose heart disease They run or walk as fast as they can and doctors measure how well the heart handles the strain But in this study the stresses were mental and emotional Researchers at Duke University Medical Center asked people who had been diagnosed with myocardial ischemia to do challenging tasks math problems tracing a diagram while looking in a mirror and making a speech about a situation that sparked anger or sadness Of the  people in the randomized controlled trial half had been taking the antidepressant Lexapro for six weeks before they did the tasks Sixtysix percent of the people taking antidepressants experienced myocardial ischemia during the tasks compared to  percent of the people not taking antidepressants Thats hardly a slamdunk but it does suggest that the antidepressant could help some people control the mental stress before it starts affecting the body Weve long known that mental stress can cause myocardial ischemia but what do you do how do you treat it asks Dr Elizabeth Jackson assistant professor of medicine and director of the womens heart program at the University of Michigan Hospital and Health Systems She was not involved in the   which was published in     Patients mental stress isnt usually tested by cardiologists Jackson says This study suggests that if theyre under severe stress maybe we should be looking at that and treating it more aggressively than we do now Thats not to say that cardiologists should start handing out antidepressants Jackson told Shots Other options could help too including many that dont involve drugs One trial doesnt necessarily mean its the right thing for everybody But this study she says is a reminder that we cant just look at the heart separately We need to look at peoples emotional healthiness to keep them heart healthy
