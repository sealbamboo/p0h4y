Should you be able to place a video camera in your parents room at a nursing home Cindy King votes yes Her mother suffered a major stroke and when Ms King could no longer care for her at home she started looking for a decent facility I did a lot of research she told me in an interview I was under no illusion that there was a perfect place The home she chose in  was a short distance from her house in Chicago so she could visit two to three times a week She made a point of coming on days when her mother who no longer spoke much was given a shower It gave me a chance to look at her body said Ms King alert for bedsores or bruises So it came as a shock last year when her mother taken to an emergency room because of unusual blood test results began to talk haltingly about a mean aide who had elbowed her in the chest I hadnt heard her speak so much in over a year said Ms King  Apparently prompted by the sight of a police officer who happened to be in the ER her mother described the aide but didnt know her name or exactly when the assault had happened But she said I fought back  Ms King fought nausea She decided to buy an inexpensive video camera and install it in the room where her mother lives alone without a roommate She is less and less vocal less and less alert Ms King said of her mother whos  How can I protect her But the bylaws of the nursing home which fearing retaliation Ms King declines to name prohibited cameras saying they violated federal privacy laws under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Thats untrue if the families themselves own the cameras and the recordings several legal sources told me but invoking Hipaa has become   Ms King thinks nursing home residents should be able to give their families permission to monitor their care The Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan whom Ms King buttonholed at a luncheon this summer and whod been hearing similar complaints from other constituents agrees Her office has begun drafting legislation that would allow residents and their families to put cameras in their rooms in the states plus nursing homes The families would own and install the cameras facility administrators would not have access to them Ms Madigan a Democrat hopes the bill will be introduced in January she believes it will pass and be signed by the governor next year to take effect in  In Illinois cameras in residents rooms arent illegal but nursing homes can ban them But outside cameras are everywhere Ms Madigan noted You drop off your dog in a kennel and you can watch on your computer And the one place you cant have one is where your frail fragile loved one is That doesnt make sense To protect residents privacy they or their health care proxies will have to request the camera roommates would also have to consent Intimate acts  bathing dressing  take place in nursing home rooms after all The law would also require some sort of posted notification telling visitors and staff that they may be recorded Wouldnt that warn off possible abusers Thats the point  Were happy with prevention Ms Madigan said When people know theyre being watched most will behave properly For too long theres been nobody watching And if cameras dont deter abuse the recordings will be admissible in court Family members might also document inactivity staff failing to turn a bedbound patient every two hours to prevent bedsores for instance Ms King whose mother is losing weight and has trouble eating wonders whether the staff is taking enough time to handfeed her Four other states  Texas Oklahoma New Mexico and Washington  have laws or regulations explicitly permitting cameras in nursing home rooms Marylands guidelines allow facilities to agree or prohibit them Such surveillance raises complex questions including the rights of staff members as   last year Im interested in your responses Would you consider a camera in your relatives room or in your own If you work in a nursing home are you OK with being recorded You could argue that cameras represent a failure of sortsÂ  Are they really the best way to protect vulnerable nursing home residents Shouldnt a welltrained attentive staff with responsible administrators  the people on the scene entrusted with their care  be able to stop abuse But nursing homes remain chronically understaffed and Ms King wants a camera With three children still at home I stretch myself as much as I can but some weeks I cant be there three days Advocates at the National Consumer Voice for Quality LongTerm Care support such laws  cautiously They could be particularly valuable when residents have dementia or are otherwise unable to report mistreatment said Robyn Grant director of public policy and advocacy But cameras are no panacea she warned Not all abuse takes place in residents rooms And unless family members monitor hours of video recording an incident isnt the same as knowing about it I think theres a place for them Ms Grant said But no one should think of cameras as a substitute for being there communicating with the staff monitoring seeing things with your own eyes
