In a red brick rambler in a Maryland suburb of Washington DC Onether Lowery begins her daily shift as a caregiver She skillfully helps yearold Rosalie Lewis into her electric wheelchair holding her from the back then bending over to ease her down Its an impressive feat Lowery herself is  years old My mother she was  when she passed away Lowery says I took care of her and I just fell in love with older people I get along with them very well As America ages its  million home health workers are graying right along with the clients they care for And by all accounts these older workers are especially well suited to the job Lowery is proud of how she can patiently coax clients to eat  even when they dont feel like it  how her experience helps her sense what they need She used to care for Lewis sister as well At one point the sister needed extra help and Lowery says an agency sent younger caregivers Well she would always tell me when they wasnt around that they didnt do anything not unless she asked them to do it she says But me I see things and I do it As a whole home health aides are largely female and far older than women in the general workforce The Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute says more than a quarter of aides are  or older a share thats expected to rise to a third by  A number of our clients will ask for a more mature worker says Marla Lahat who heads Home Care Partners in Washington DC the agency that employs Lowery In this case mature means older Sometimes theyre a little bit afraid of the younger generation she says and they know that a worker thats closer to their age is somebody that they feel more comfortable with and more trusting And in an industry where turnover is high Lahat says its older workers who tend to stay in the job    I like to work with the older people cause they need you so much more says  Queen Cook a yearold caregiver whos been with Home Care Partners for nearly four decades She says shes careful to listen to clients  not talk too much  to figure out how theyre feeling I have a passion for what I do and Ive been doing it so long she says I pretty much know how to deal with personalities a little better than the younger generation would Thats the way I feel As they age some health aides do hit physical limits Lahat says shes happy to work around it finding a client without too many stairs or who doesnt weigh too much to cut down on heavy lifting So does Cook have any aches or pains Oh come on we all have arthritis now she laughs But you work with it Get your omega take your exercise and youre good to go In Maryland Lowery makes Lewis the same breakfast she does every day coffee toast a fruit cup and scrambled eggs Lewis says its wonderful that she and her caregiver are so close in age I feel like shes a member of the family she says And she can still move around like shes  years old But of course shes not Lowery says her grandkids have been after her to retire Yet even at  she keeps putting in  or more hours a week I dont have anything to do at home she says You know I cant stand looking at the four walls As long as she feels good Lowery says shell keep taking care of others
