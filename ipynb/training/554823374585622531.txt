Computers can be better at predicting our personality than our friends and family an experiment with tens of thousands of volunteers has indicated  By analysing likes on Facebook a computer model deduced a persons character on five key traits better than brothers mothers and even some partners  The Cambridge team acknowledge that personality is more complex than this  But they say the results show computers can outpace humans  And the findings in the journal   suggest some interesting associations  Facebook fans of Dr Who tend to be shy while fans of Big Brother are conservative or conventional The University of Cambridge and Stanford University researchers had already said that   including sexual orientation and political leaning  In this study they wanted to go a step further and pit man against machine to see which would perform better at making judgements about human character and personality  Dr Youyou Wu and her colleagues ran the data of  willing Facebook users through their computer system which linked likes to five core personality traits The Facebook users completed a personality questionnaire and were asked to get their colleagues friends and family to act as character witnesses by filling out a survey  The researchers then compared all the results to see how the computer model fared in summing up a persons selfreported character Given enough likes the computers came closer to a persons selfreported personality than even their closest allies  By looking at just  Facebook likes the computer was able to outperform a work colleague  Analysing  likes let the machine rival a friend or flatmate  Using  likes it trumped a family member but not a partner  it took  likes to match or outdo their deductive power  Given that the average Facebook user had about  likes on their profile this was ample for a computer to go on said Dr Wu  a visiting intern at Facebook and a PhD student at the University of Cambridge It may seem surprising because people are generally good at judging personality  Its intuitive to think that people close to us know us very well so its even more impressive that computers are able to beat us at our game She said that people now spent a lot of time online which gave computers the edge  Friends and colleagues might only see us in a limited number of situations so they have less information to go on  Computers can access a lot of relevant information about us and have a huge memory capacity And they can make judgements in a consistent systematic way whereas humans may be biased Alan Redman a chartered psychologist with a specialist interest in personality and psychometrics said advertising companies already used our digital footprints to build a picture of who we were  And potential employers might want to check social media sites before seeing a candidate  We do need to be careful he added We have little control over the data that is being collected about us
