More people are living a life marked by energydrinkfueled allnighters A toxic combination of digital leashes the hypnotic effects of technology economic anxiety and caffeine is encouraging workers to push far beyond normal limits in the name of hard work Its a costly trend Consequences range from poor work and long unscheduled absences to workers paying with their health and in rare cases their lives  Take Mita Diran The yearold advertising copywriter worked for  hours straight just before Christmas bragged that she was still going strooong on Twitter and dropped dead within hours The young Indonesian was the latest highprofile victim of what some are now calling binge working  Dirans story is eerily similar to that of Li Yuan an ad writer at Ogilvy  Mather in China whose   after similar bouts of overwork Its also similar to the sorry tale of Moritz Erhardt He died after a threeday work binge at Bank of Americas Merrill Lynch office in London Erhartdt was a yearold intern and apparently desperate to prove himself worthy of a fulltime job in banking The death has prompted the bank to take steps to ease the frantic working conditions for ambitious junior staffers To this sad list you might even add a Taiwanese gamer known only as Diablo who died in  after a hour video game binge Ken Matos researches workplace trends at the Familes and Work Institute a nonprofit He points out that a few binge working deaths certainly dont make a trend but he cautions that they are a canary in a coal mine More widespread consequences he said will be reduced life spans and other health impacts for workers who no longer take breaks even on nights and weekends  While dropping over dead at ones desk is likely to be a rare event experiencing negative health consequences and reduced lifespans as a result of decades intense work lives with little opportunity for regular recovery is a more likely possibility Matos said  Virtual overwork is just the most obvious representation of a larger trend Americans for example now toil for eightandahalf hours a week more than they did in  This phenomenon has sometimes been called the Great Speed Up as workers simply cant seem to jump off the digital ratwheel The effect has shown up in government data which indicates that  percent of Americans worked on weekends in  Were working at night too ruining the potential for those eight hours of rest A survey in  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that almost a third of working adults get six hours or less of sleep a night  Technology has a lot to do with it Not very long ago when a worker left the office at  pm there was simply no way to get work out of them until they arrived the next day at  am No one would expect a response to an inquiry made at  on a Friday afternoon  But technologys influence on the collapsing boundaries between work and life is subtle too Matos points out that email has created a vicious cycle in most workplaces with workers expecting instant responses from each other at all times  no one wants to be the team member who blocked a discussion for an afternoon by not replying What was designed as an asynchronous onewayatatime communication tool  akin to old fashioned postal mail  is now synchronous instant communication like a phone call Its as if we were all trying to carry on hundreds of phone calls at once Its enough to drive anyone crazy Or to make us sick A recent survey of medical research   lays out the case against overwork Its not fair to blame technology entirely for the problem Read Dirans tweets and you hear a typical young worker who is half complaining half bragging about her  am nights at the office Binge working is encouraged by many workplace cultures One reason Matos says Companies measure and reward the wrong things Organizations can develop a culture that focuses on the effort expended rather than the quality provided I call these cultures of selfsacrifice where employee value is measured not by how productive they are but by how much time and personal sacrifices they need to make to complete their work he said In such cultures the employee who stays later is valued more even if the quality of work produced is not different from an employee who left earlier Working late can be a subtle sinister test of loyalty particularly in an economy thats still struggling to replace jobs lost during the Great Recession It is human nature for bosses to keep asking for more work until employees cry foul but in a tough job market many employees feel like they cant say no The risks of overwork havent been lost on organizations Last week in a direct reaction to Erhardts death   a new policy that requires analysts and associates to take off a minimum of four weekend days off per month It also announced that managers were to closely monitor work volume hours and assignments The Wall Street Journal reported that Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase have taken similar steps  But as every worker knows policies come and go  and few employees are comfortable quoting policy when a request comes from the boss Matos points out an irony in the age of instant communication and overwork and in it a possible solution Communication about expectations is sorely lacking in most organizations Matos says Often employees wrongly imagine that every email and every request must be answered immediately  particularly when deadlines arent clear Middle managers often make this mistake too jumping as high as possible to impress bosses up the food chain rather than asking precisely how high they are supposed to jump In the end that means everything is a crisis and everything is treated like a fire drill  Fear can drive people to overwork Matos said  Fear shuts down open and honest communication which is necessary to creating an innovative and responsive workplace And necessary to keep workers from falling asleep at their desks  or worse
