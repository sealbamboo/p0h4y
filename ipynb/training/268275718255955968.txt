Last weeks election may have settled the   but its implementation after months of uncertainty has caught many of the players unprepared Late last week the federal government   for states to decide what they want to do about health exchanges Those are the new marketplaces where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance But with one of the deadlines still approaching at the end of the week this seemed as good a time as any to revisit what an exchange is Karen Pollitz a senior fellow at the   and former   says its not all that hard a concept An exchange is a place where you buy health insurance she says But its a lot more understandable and consumer friendly than where you buy it today At least thats the hope Theyre supposed to have more information available for people that you can understand not fine print and gobbledygook Pollitz continues Theyre supposed to have a lot of assistance people who can help you walk through things answer your questions be there in real time The exchanges  one for every state  are not only where people will go to choose plans theyre also where people will go to see if they qualify for help in affording that care And   The Affordable Care Act makes subsidies available based on a sliding scale depending on how much you earn Pollitz says And people earning up to four times the federal poverty level which is about  to  for a single person would be able to get some help paying for their premiums The state exchanges will also have to determine who has incomes low enough to qualify for   and help them enroll in that program It sounds like a lot but theres already a realworld example Massachusetts passed a law in  that was in many ways the template for the federal Affordable Care Act It launched something called the   within a year Literally on the Web which is where about  percent of our applications come in for the unsubsidized insurance individuals make a purchase decision in about  to  minutes and push a button and theyre enrolled Jon Kingsdale the Connectors   said in a  interview According to Kingsdale whats really made the Massachusetts exchange a success is the high quality and reliability of the plans it offers and the high level of its customer service Thats really the value that we bring he says So I think people in Massachusetts trust that when we give our seal of approval that those are good values and we certainly work very hard to make sure that we offer the best plans But now states that have been on the fence dont have a lot of time left to replicate what Massachusetts has done Exchanges need to be ready to start signing people and businesses up by next October for a plan year that begins Jan   Pollitz says there are a lot of moving parts that must be in place Exchanges have to certify that health plans offer required benefits and be able to determine who is and isnt eligible for financial help And most of all they have to be able to help consumers They need to have tollfree  numbers you can callontheground navigator and other assistance programs to help people she says They need holdtheirhand help people in languages they can understand So far nearly  states   what theyll do Just over a dozen states have passed legislation to take on this task themselves Governors in another handful have said they want no part of it That means federal officials will step in and run the state exchanges for them There is a third option States can partner with the federal government to run the exchange And now states can wait until as late as February to decide if they want to do that But theres pressure particularly on Republican governors to reject any participation in the exchanges If you agree with us that this law is not going to work why would you want to help them in creating it said Nicole Kaeding state policy manager for the conservative group   Opponents of the law also say states could face significant costs if they do their own exchanges These exchanges are expensive bureaucracies Kaeding said Theyre going to cost states an estimated  million to  million per year and they will be financed through a tax increase on health insurance premiums  a tax increase that will almost surely be passed along to taxpayers Friday is still the deadline for states to tell federal officials if they plan to launch their own exchanges That will send an important signal about the status of the health law
