The PSA test has been dissed a lot lately The nations preventive medicine task force for one says the test is so unreliable in figuring out whos at risk for deadly prostate cancer that most men shouldnt bother getting one But the test for prostatespecific antigen   remains one of two main tests for prostate cancer along with the digital rectal exam So for many men its hard to resist getting a PSA measurement even though testing can lead to unnecessary surgery and to nasty side effects like incontinence and impotence In a perfect world doctors would sit down with men and have a thoughtful discussion about the pluses and minuses of the PSA test The patient would explain his worries and health issues Then the doctor would take those into account and suggest personalized options including doing nothing But those discussions arent happening according to two studies and a survey That process called shared decisionmaking aims to give the patient a chance to learn about the options available and what good or bad could come of them Then he could decide which options best suit his needs Shared decisionmaking for prostate cancer testing was   by the American Urological Association But most doctors never ask according to a survey of more than  men ages  to  Almost twothirds said theyd never had a discussion with a doctor on the advantages disadvantages and scientific uncertainty surrounding the PSA test More educated men who get screened more often were more likely to have had the chat The   which was led by researchers at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute was reported in   Two other studies in the same issue of the journal looked at whether its possible to train doctors to get better at this The verdict Well maybe In the first   half of a group of  physicians were given training in using shared decision making to discuss the PSA test After that the doctors had visits from actors posing as patients who were trained to ask if the doctor thought they should get a PSA test The trained doctors were slightly more likely to use shared decisionmaking skills when talking to the patients and were more apt to say that not getting screened was an option In the   doctors were given another form of training on talking to patients about prostate cancer screening and some of those doctors were prompted by patients to talk about it Despite all that the patients reported no differences in shared decision making between the trained doctors and untrained controls But the trained doctors who were prompted by the patients were perceived as more neutral and more likely to bring up prostate cancer screening Both studies were conducted by researchers at the University of California Davis School of Medicine
