Sira Berzas winces when she remembers the pain  The acute ache started in her ankles before quickly spreading through her body crippling her muscles pounding her joints and leaving her hands and feet severely swollen Last summer the yearold from Antigua and Barbuda was struck down with the debilitating chikungunya virus which has swept across the Caribbean infecting more than  people since it was first detected in the region in December  The mosquitoborne disease which originated in Africa and has no known cure is characterised by the abrupt onset of fever deep joint and muscle pain headache nausea fatigue and a rash I was fine when I went to bed Ms Berzas says but when I woke up in the morning and tried to get up my ankles hurt so much I couldnt stand It was very scary After that I started getting different pains all over my body Soon my hands were so swollen I couldnt hold anything Most patients recover fully although the pain can persist for several months or even years  In older people the disease can cause death According to World Health Organization figures  fatalities across the Caribbean Latin America and US were linked to the virus in   I knew immediately it was chikungunya Ms Berzas says  I didnt go to the doctor as its expensive and everyone I knew whod been to their GP was just told to take paracetamol and rest I tried painkillers but nothing worked The mornings were the worst my joints were so stiff I could hardly move Ms Berzas is one of a growing number of sufferers who turned to natural remedies to alleviate the symptoms In Antigua where the minimum wage is just   per hour and a visit to a conventional doctor can set one back  herbalists specialising in bush medicine are often the first port of call When I got desperate I went to Dr Amu the naturopath He gave me two teas to drink and an oil to rub on my skin It soothed the rash and diminished the pain a lot It didnt go away but at least it was manageable Ms Berzas recalls It was four months before the aches finally abated  Even now  months later my ankles still hurt in the morning I dont know how I would have coped if it hadnt been for Dr Amu I recommended him to lots of people Nothing else worked for me Ms Berzas recalls Selftaught naturopath Sylvester Tyrone Amu Motley prescribes a fourpronged approach to fighting chikungunya  The first is a tea to be drunk three times daily on an empty stomach It contains echinacea to boost the immune system and chaparral and burdock root to purify the blood ease pain and soothe the rash he explains Second is a detox made by boiling five different plants in fresh spring water  Arnica soursop and cattle tongue are wonderful curealls Mr Motley who scours the local countryside looking for the plants says Then theres neem which is an antiseptic and dandelion to cleanse the body That should be drunk all day long instead of water He also makes a special oil to be applied after bathing and at night on critical parts of the body A staunch advocate of the power of plants Mr Motley says he has not had the illness himself and believes that is largely due to his own intake of herbs  Its tried to come a couple of times but my body fights it off he adds In the absence of scientific evidence conventional doctors are more sceptical Dr Nick Fuller whose GP practice is based in Antiguas capital St Johns told the BBC Herbalism is not proven so I couldnt recommend it But I dont see any harm in it he adds   At the end of the day chikungunya is a virus and needs to run its course he explains With no antiviral medicines available yet to fight chikungunya the only surefire way to deal with it is not to get it The government is therefore trying to stem the outbreak in Antigua which has seen  suspected cases to date through preventative measures  They have stepped up insecticide spraying in communities and made bulk purchases of bed nets and repellent  A public education campaign urges residents to avoid mosquito bites by wearing clothes that cover the arms legs and feet and to use repellents
