A yearold girl born in Mississippi with HIV acquired from her mother during pregnancy remains free of detectable virus at least  months after she stopped taking antiviral pills New results on this child published online by the   appear to greenlight a study in the advanced planning stages in which researchers around the world will try to replicate her successful treatment in other infected newborns And it means that the Mississippi girl still can be considered possibly or even probably cured of HIV infection  only the second person in the world with that lucky distinction The first is   a yearold American man apparently cured by a bone marrow transplant he received in Berlin a halfdozen years ago This   addresses many of the questions raised earlier this year when disclosure of the Mississippi childs case was called a   in the long search for an HIV cure There was some very healthy skepticism   a professor at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester tells Shots Shes part of the team that has been exhaustively testing the toddlers blood and considering every possible explanation for her apparently HIVfree state Luzuriaga is confident the latest tests prove that the child was truly infected with HIV at the time of her birth  not merely carrying remnants of freefloating virus or infected blood cells transferred before birth from her mother as some skeptics wondered The UMass researcher says theres no way the childs mother could have contributed enough of her own blood plasma to the newborn to account for the high levels of HIV detected in the childs blood shortly after birth Similarly Luzuriaga says new calculations show that the mother would have had to transfer a huge number of HIVinfected white blood cells to the baby in order for us to get the viral signal that we got early on Clinching the question as far as the researchers are concerned is the infants response to antiHIV drugs that she began receiving shortly after birth The remarkable earliness of her treatment is a crucial feature that makes this child different from almost any other Theres a very characteristic clearance curve of viruses once we start babies on treatment Luzuriaga says The decay of viruses we see in this baby is exactly what we saw in early treatment trials from  years ago when we initiated antiretroviral therapy and shut off viral replication Thats a very different decay curve than you would expect if it were just free virus transferred to the baby It might be helpful to recap the unusual if not unique features of the Mississippi case Her mother did not receive prenatal care so she was not identified as HIVinfected before delivery If she had been she would have received drugs that are highly effective in preventing mothertochild transmission of the virus While the mother was in labor she got HIV testing as is routine for women without prenatal care When that came up positive   a pediatrician at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson was ready to test the newborn for infection and start antiretroviral medicines within  hours of birth The treatment quickly cleared the virus from the babys blood Normally such children would stay on antiviral drugs for a lifetime But in this case the mother  whose life circumstances were reportedly chaotic  stopped giving the child the medication between  and  months after birth Gay and her colleagues caught up to the child when she was  months old and were astonished to discover she was apparently still virusfree despite being off treatment Five rounds of stateoftheart testing  at UMass Johns Hopkins federal research labs and the University of California San Diego  failed to reveal any trace of the virus in her blood That led to last springs report and widely reported hope that the child had been cured of HIV But   an HIV researcher at Columbia University in New York is not quite convinced Is the child cured of HIV infection The best answer at this moment is a definitive maybe  Hammer writes in a     that accompanied the report The reason is that a couple of tests done when the child was about  years old found indications that her system may contain pieces of RNA or DNA from HIV This hints that some of the nucleic acid building blocks of the virus are hanging around within her blood cells Theres no evidence these proviral remnants are capable of assembling themselves into whole viruses that can make copies of themselves But researchers are concerned about that possibility and how it might be headed off The question is whether those viral nucleic acids have the ability at some point to replicate and allow a rebound of the virus Luzuriaga acknowledges Thats why its important to continue to test the baby over time She says that means years But for now the signs from the Mississippi childs case are encouraging enough to have generated an ambitious global human experiment that Luzuriaga says is in final planning stages Women who present in labor without having had prenatal care will be tested for HIV and if positive their infants will be intensively treated within a couple of days of birth as the Mississippi child was Then theyll be followed with the most sensitive tests to determine if the virus has been eradicated If certain criteria are met researchers plan to decide whether it would be safe to discontinue HIV treatment deliberately and follow the children closely to see if the virus returns If it did treatment would be restarted If the experiment succeeds it would be a huge advance in the prevention of childhood HIV and AIDS in many parts of the world More than  out of  of the worlds  million   live in subSaharan Africa where many women deliver without having had prenatal care or HIV treatment Around  children are newly infected every day Meanwhile researchers pursuing an HIV cure will   in San Francisco to consider various strategies  for adults as well as children One other recent glimmer of hope was provided this summer by Boston researchers who   that two HIVinfected men with lymphoma remain virusfree without treatment for several months after stopping antiviral treatment
