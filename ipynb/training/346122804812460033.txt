
 In my s I moved to San Francisco and to my surprise found myself contemplating parenthood By the mids it seemed like every lesbian everywhere wanted to have a baby I was a member of a crucial demographic  HIVnegative gay men with viable sperm I attended regular Sunday matchmaking potlucks where gay women and men discussed and debated their childrearing desires all hoping to connect with the gamete of their dreams We milled about with plates of fruit salad and quiche sipping orange juice chatting quietly and slyly assessing the genetic wares on display But for a variety of reasons I decided against fathering a biological child I harbored too many philosophical and ethical concerns about contributing my own genes to our species uncontrolled experiment in environmental devastation I occasionally thought about adopting but I didnt want to do that alone And after burying a partner in  I didnt know if or when Id meet someone else So when two women  close friends of mine for more than a decade  said they were adopting a daughter from China and invited me to be her godfather I agreed Were all transplanted New York Jews and Jews dont really have godparents so what we were agreeing to wasnt exactly clear to me I figured if I wasnt going to be a father I could assume an undefined fatherlike position Unlike me both women had been close to their fathers and they wanted their daughter to have a similar opportunity My two friends waited and waited for news of their child They finally received a small photo of her at  months She was scowling caught by the camera in a squall of anger or gas or frustration The picture left them unsettled Was she unhappy Was she hungry Was anyone attending her when she cried I read the photo differently Her gaze was fierce determined No one was going to mess with that kid She was a survivor I said Because the Chinese did not allow two women to adopt as a couple only one of the moms went over The other stayed home prepped for the new arrival and fretted In  years shell be going to a support group for the adopted Chinese daughters of Jewish lesbians she said only half in jest We braced ourselves for the worst possible outcome by renting The Bad Seed a  schlock classic about the murderous exploits of an yearold with blond braids I can still back away from this whole thing I reassured myself The babys adoptive mothers named her Natalie She had been left at a courthouse after her birth and was  months old when she finally arrived home Natalie didnt speak much at first Instead she just quietly observed what we did and listened to how we spoke When I tossed her in the air and caught her in my arms she laughed and laughed and I fell in love As a toddler she knew how to establish boundaries She knew when she wanted to be touched or picked up and when she didnt She knew how far she could climb on a branch and when to stop I admired that clarity of purpose I also knew that when she gave me a big hug she meant it  We struggled over the nomenclature Why arent you my daddy she asked sometimes in the early years I mumbled something in response People would see us in public together and assume she was my daughter if they asked it was easier to say yes than explain But Daddy didnt feel right to her moms or to me Theyd chosen to adopt her not I theyd named her Natalie she was their daughter in a way shed never be mine  So at first she called me David Once when I scooped up one of her friends onto my shoulders she pouted Thats my David she announced loudly I understood then that David for her was a category of person the term for my role in her life whatever that was But I still wanted a special name Uncle was an option but felt too distant When one of her moms suggested Poppy it stuck When Natalie was  we all decided to move into a twofamily house Her moms had wanted to move to a quieter neighborhood in San Francisco And since I had been taking Natalie to school and picking her up several times a week it made sense for us to move together Soon Natalie learned that my upstairs rules were sometimes different from the downstairs rules Downstairs she drank a pungent tea every morning brewed from nettles provided by the acupuncturist upstairs she didnt have to Downstairs they switched TV channels if bloody Iraq war news flashed on the screen upstairs Id keep it on and try to explain what was happening even if what was happening made no sense  So am I a real father Ive wrestled with that question and Fathers Day always brings it into sharp relief Natalie and I spend time together and I usually get a bar of super premium dark chocolate Im easy to buy presents for  Once when she was mad at me because Id tried to exert my authority she implied that she didnt have to listen because I was just that guy who lives upstairs More recently when I asked her if she considered me a parent she said Sure yeah I guess From a yearold thats a yes Ive certainly devoted more time to nurturing my relationship with Natalie than my own father did with me Ive wiped her runny nose volunteered at her school and found myself playing  and actually enjoying  Candy Land From my perspective anyone who has watched Clifford Sagwa or Dragon Tales deserves honorary parenthood status Most often I guess I consider myself the tertiary noncustodial parent with special attributes I was the best cinnamontoast parent I put extra sugar in the sugarcinnamon mix and always spread the butter and sugary sugarcinnamon powder evenly Im the parent who taught her to tell a bar from a restaurant bar people standing around drinking some on stools restaurant people sitting around eating some on stools during afternoon walks into the Castro Ive been the pillowfight parent and the rollercoaster parent Her guinea pigs  Pritz and Scotch  lived upstairs with me so the cats in the downstairs flat would not harass them We share custody of a black mutt Harold  Im the parent who has lived and worked in faraway lands and returned with stories that have helped ignite her own interest in foreign adventures Ive uttered that useful awful phrase Because I said so more than once Im the man in charge when the moms are out of town Later this summer Natalie and I will spend a week traveling to some of the colleges she is considering  Sometimes I wonder what shell think of our arrangement  years from now Sometimes I think about other lives I might have led Then I remember the time her teacher assigned the students to write about someone in their family Natalie read me the paper shed written about me I dont remember much now  something about our living arrangements about how often I took her to school or picked her up But I remember hearing this And he always tells me he loves me As she read those words aloud she glanced up and graced me with a smile so full of mischief and pleasure that my chest felt as if it would burst  I might not be someone elses definition of a fullfledged father But I wouldnt change my fatherlike status for anything
