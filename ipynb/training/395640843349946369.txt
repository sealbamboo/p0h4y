This coming weekend I had planned to join  of those crazy masochists known as runners at  am in Staten Island lacing up and stripping down for that most peculiar of parades the marathon It was supposed to be a celebration of everything I care about and work for But this year it didnt work out I had been trying to break the marathons threehour barrier  is a holy grail for people like me the devoted amateurs who show up to these races over and over again for a chance to beat no one but themselves To get there I had to cut five excruciating minutes from my race time and I was confident that if I just worked harder I could do it Runners are a tribe of extremists they love rituals They relish going out in the dark and the rain The sports cult hero is Steve Prefontaine an athlete who was famous for saying things like I run to see who has the most guts who can punish himself into exhausting pace and then at the end punish himself even more The approach has always suited me just fine Moderation has never come naturally to me As a pressure cooker of a high school student I took quickly to runnings meritocratic way of letting its participants compensate for lack of natural skill through enthusiasm and commitment Sometimes I was too committed When I was a freshman my track coach told us to put a teaspoon of baking soda in a gallonsize water jug to drink at meets to keep from wearing out I figured Id go one step further I dumped so much Arm  Hammer into my ounce water bottle that the outcome was less liquid than it was thick alkaline paste I dont remember how the finish line worked out but other memories are fairly clear By the end of the day spent kneeling over a toilet Id learned that going overboard doesnt always work  But when pushing yourself is part of the goal and the only way to improve where is the line That question has never really gone away Its particularly important for the marathon which at its core is about redefining limits For this years marathon I focused relentlessly I changed all my inessential passwords to RunSub and put a Postit with  Get Up Now over my alarm clock I had been training since winter spending postsolstice evenings running down Broadway buffeted by wind and choking on snowflakes Every puddle I plowed through was a baptism a new chance at achieving my goal My training spreadsheet was posted on my desk right next to my computer monitor and every day I tallied my growing mileage It was paying off I ran my best K time ever at practice I spent my nights after work chasing my faster teammates around Central Park in the dark watching their graceful legs lilt across the blacktop and brooding over what felt like the comparatively thunderous staccato of mine But I kept up And then I discovered I ran too much One day in early September I set out for a run and the pain started It was innocuous at first then searing One thing all runners know is that the sport hurts often The whole objective is to run through the pain So I ran through repeating my most resonant clichs pain is temporary pride is forever And then I stopped in my tracks suddenly unable to run at all I hobbled three miles home I knew before the doctor told me that I had fractured my foot In my effort to do my best I had overdone it again In fact I was done for the season The frustrating thing about injuries like these is that sometimes the mental torture is worse than the actual injury There is nothing to do but trade your running shoes for a foot cast and wait Are you still a runner if you no longer actually run Two months of sedentary behavior suggest the answer is no While I was actively training I was too busy to notice how fit I felt Now that Im idle I have plenty of time to contemplate my expanding waistline and withering quads But the injury also left me with a lot of time to deliberate lessons that have gone too long unlearned Maybe the only way to change is to hit your limit and then settle somewhere comfortably in the middle To figure out whats sustainable and then try to do your best with that Maybe its possible to learn moderation from the marathon I hope so Because thats a finish line I still have to cross
