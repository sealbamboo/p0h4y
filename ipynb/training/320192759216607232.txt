A federal judge in Brooklyn NY has ruled that the morningafter pill for emergency contraception must be made available over the counter to girls  and under The ruling could end a more than decadelong battle over how easy or difficult it should be for teenage girls to obtain emergency contraception The ruling would also make it easier for older women to obtain the drug because it wouldnt have to be kept behind drugstore counters anymore The judges order effectively overturns a controversial    by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius overruling the Food and Drug Administration After years of study and internal debate the   that Plan B One Step should be allowed for sale without a prescription  and without age restrictions In the ruling dated April  Senior Judge Edward R Korman of the Eastern District of New York held that Sebeliuss decision on Plan B was arbitrary capricious and unreasonable On page  of the page decision Korman skewers Sebeliuss decision calling it politically motivated scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent  He also slammed the FDAs rejection of a socalled Citizens Petition dating to  that argued for the agency to approve unfettered overthecounter sale of Plan B That rejection he said was a direct consequence of Sebeliuss ruling In the decision Korman sends the Plan B case back to FDA with orders to make the morningafter pill available without a prescription and without pointofsale or age restrictions within  days If the agency decides the instructions for the drugs need tweaks thats OK When Sebelius essentially vetoed the FDAs decision in late  womens health groups erupted in protest As doctors and researchers have repeatedly stated ample research shows Plan B to be safe for women of all ages and appropriate for overthecounter access It is deeply disappointing that this administration would repeat the mistakes of the previous one said Susan Wood an associate professor at George Washington Universitys School of Public Health Wood was an assistant commissioner for womens health at the FDA but   over its continued delay on overthecounter approval for Plan B Advocates for Plan B kept up the pressure on the administration to reverse itself They argued in part that the rules were just too complicated The unique duallabeling of   has led to confusion among consumers and health care professionals alike particularly regarding age restrictions and whether men and women can purchase nonprescription emergency contraception said   signed by more than three dozen womens health reproductive rights and individual providers of health care A recent Boston University study of  pharmacies in five major cities revealed that when called posed as  year olds seeking EC one in five were told they could not purchase EC under any circumstances the letter said at the time In fact those  and older are eligible to purchase the product without a prescription those  and younger may purchase it with a health providers written order
