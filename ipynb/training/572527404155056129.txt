Sometimes a missing set of keys is just that  an inconvenience borne of lapsed attention But a new study suggests that when seniors report they are plagued by missing keys forgotten appointments words that cant be retrieved and names that dont come those complaints should not be lightly dismissed New research finds that after the age of  cognitive complainers  people who say they have noticed mental slippage  are more likely than those who do not complain of such changes to develop mild cognitive impairment and to have Alzheimerslike plaques and tangles in their brains upon death even when dementia was never diagnosed In a   published Wednesday in the journal Neurology researchers in Kentucky tracked  people with an average age of  and no signs of dementia for  years The researchers asked participants yearly if they noticed memory changes and administered a battery of cognitive tests Cognitive complaints were hardly rare fully  of the participants reported changes in their memory at an average age of  But people who reported memory complaints were nearly three times more likely to develop clinicallysignificant memory and thinking problems the researchers found About  in  participants developed dementia during the study and  of those first reported memory changes The study offers an important look at the length of time it takes from the point at which a senior acknowledges memory slippage and the time when symptoms satisfy the clinical criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia On average it took  years for seniors complaining of memory problems to satisfy the diagnostic definition of mild cognitive impairment with former smokers getting to that point  years faster For those who would go on to meet the criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimers disease it took an average of  years to do so Participants who carried the genetic variant APOE  which predisposes one to develop Alzheimers were more than twice as likely either to die or to develop dementia during the study Some  of participants went from cognitive complaints to fullblown dementia in just over six years those rapid decliners tended to be women and people with high blood pressure And women who had taken hormone replacement therapy were slightly slower to make that transition it took them close to  years on average to go from complaints of memory problems to a diagnosis of dementia Study participants agreed to allow researchers to autopsy the brains of those who died during the study and patterns emerged among those who had complained of mental slippage during life Even where no diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimers disease had been made those who complained of memory problems were far more likely than those who did not to have signs of Alzheimersrelated abnormalities in their postmortem brains Lead author Richard J Kryscio with the University of Kentucky in Lexington said that seniors complaints of memory slippage should not be dismissed but might rather be seen as a window for intervention before a diagnosable problem shows up With no effective Alzheimers therapies on hand however time itself may offer some small consolation The relatively slow rate at which cognitive complaints turn into dementia diagnoses may mean that some older seniors will die of something else before they get a diagnosis But younger cognitive complainers have more to worry about they are more likely to live long enough for their complaints to become a diagnosis of dementia
