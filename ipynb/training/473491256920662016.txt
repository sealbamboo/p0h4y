Decades ago I met a surprisingly quiet withdrawn young man Surprising because I knew his bright vibrant wife and wondered what had attracted her to him He barely participated in conversations even at friendly family gatherings Some years later the same man seemed to have undergone a personality transplant He was forthright and funny intelligent and interesting I asked a mutual friend what could have accounted for the apparent transformation The answer surgical removal of his chronically inflamed colon to treat ulcerative colitis Once free of painful abdominal cramps persistent diarrhea fatigue nausea and the depression and anxiety that can accompany these symptoms he came to life Even having to cope with a colostomy bag did not dampen his newly awakened spirit Today this rather draconian treatment is reserved for the very few patients with    Crohns and ulcerative colitis  whose debilitating symptoms dont respond to a growing number of less invasive modern therapies Although many people with chronically inflamed bowels still have surgery it is nearly always less aggressive rarely requiring an external pouch to replace a surgically removed colon and rectum Today in  percent of patients with ulcerative colitis in whom the colon must be removed it is replaced by an internal pouch creating a reservoir for stool that is sutured directly to the rectal canal said   chief medical adviser to the   This approach decreases urgency enabling patients to defer the need to evacuate and reduces the number of stools per day Dr Sartor said in an interview Inflammatory bowel diseases afflict  million Americans typically starting in the teenage years and lasting a lifetime But treatments for these chronic conditions are being transformed spurred by the decoding of the human genome and a growing understanding of the balance of microbes in the gut and why it goes awry in some people As with operative changes for ulcerative colitis in recent decades surgery for Crohns disease has become less disruptive of normal digestive function Instead of removing diseased sections of the intestine Crohns patients can have a procedure called strictureplasty better preserving the bodys ability to absorb nutrients Strictureplasty involves cutting the diseased area at its midpoint stacking the two pieces on top of each other then cutting and reconnecting them lengthwise The technique known as Michelassi strictureplasty for the Weill Cornell surgeon Dr Fabrizio Michelassi has been shown to encourage regression of the disease in the treated area Surgery doesnt cure Crohns Dr Sartor said but this technique preserves most of the natural function of the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed  gastroenterologist at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York emphasized in an interview that surgery is a therapy not a failure of therapy She added If doctors persist with medical therapy to avoid surgery they may be subjecting patients to chronic flareups At the same time however improved medical remedies are fast emerging Experts in inflammatory bowel disease are working on treatments based on a patients genetic makeup an approach now increasingly used to treat cancer  chief of gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said that after determining the genomic regions associated with inflammatory bowel diseases  genes have been linked to the ailments were now looking individually to identify certain genes that affect inflammation and the failure of ulcers to heal There are also genetic changes that protect the gut Dr Xavier said and targeted molecules could be designed to both treat the disease and prevent relapses Ulcerative colitis and Crohns are in many ways the poster child for which sequencing the genome is having a tremendous impact Dr Xavier said in an interview Equally important to improved treatment has been understanding how environmental factors like diet and antibiotics can disrupt the balance of microbes in the gut Some bacteria are protective and keep the gut healthy while others result in chronic inflammation Antibiotics which alter the gut microbiome may be helpful or not Dr Scherl noted Tailormaking antibiotics that attack only harmful bacteria could give protective microbes a chance to dominate And altering the diet to deny harmful microbes the nutrients they prefer can curb inflammation Dr Scherl said that sugars other carbohydrates and fats can lead to uncontrolled inflammation in the gut of people genetically predisposed to inflammatory bowel diseases When a flareup occurs she said patients must step back and eat simpler food  a socalled white diet  until the inflammation subsides  pediatric gastroenterologist at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio treats flareups in children with what is called enteral therapy in which they consume a formula  that deprives harmful bacteria in the gut of the nutrients they need to produce substances that foster inflammation Although Dr Kim acknowledges that the diet is not easy to stick to when pursued for eight to  weeks it can induce remission of the disease reduce the risk of relapse and enable the child to grow normally Another new approach aims at gutspecific transport of inflammatory cells from the blood into the gut The Food and Drug Administration just approved a drug called vedolizumab which blocks the movement of those cells This is a completely new strategy for treating Crohns and ulcerative colitis   professor in the gastroenterology division at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine said in an interview Perhaps most important for people with an inflammatory bowel disease Dr Scherl said is to be cared for by a specialist who understands its complexities and nuances and listens to patients who are living with it
