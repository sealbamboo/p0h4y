Just over a decade ago a French doctor invented a   for severely malnourished children that had a revolutionary lifesaving impact The product goes by different names in different parts of the world such as     and   Its basically peanut butter with some added ingredients dried milk oil sugar and essential minerals and vitamins Its been so successful that some public health officials now are pushing to expand its use It wouldnt just be a treatment to save a life but a snack to keep kids healthy in the first place Theres one catch The proponents of this strategy still have to show that it really works And thats why in a clinic in the city of CapHaitien on the northern coast of Haiti monthold Renande Raphael is getting laid out flat in a wooden box so that nurses can measure how much shes grown After getting measured Renande will get something else a pile of little foilwrapped snacks Enough to eat one every day for a month Shes been getting them for the past six months Sherlie JeanLouis a nurse with a quiet voice and a huge smile whos helping to run this trial program explains that the packages contain about four teaspoons worth of peanut paste thats been fortified with lots of essential nutrients such as zinc iodine iron and lots of vitamins Its a smaller version of the more famous peanut butter product thats used to treat children who are suffering from severe malnutrition But Sherlie JeanLouis explains that the children who come here have been doing just fine probably because theyve been breastfeeding Still theyre at risk for malnutrition This is one of the poorest neighborhoods in CapHaitien And the children now are vulnerable Theyre getting a little older and shifting to other foods often inferior ones nutritionally speaking Renande Raphaels mother Guerlandie Joseph says that the nurses have been giving her advice about what food to buy for her child Theyve been urging her to get milk eggs and vegetables But its hard to follow that advice she says Those foods are expensive and she doesnt have much money So they mostly eat rice beans and corn  a specialist in international nutrition at Washington University in St Louis helped set up this trial program in CapHaitien This is a critical period for children she says because many of the effects of malnutrition at this young age  from  to  months  are irreversible If a child is stunted meaning that they lose height during that period they never recover the height that was lost she says There can also be permanent effects on the brain Twenty percent of children in Haiti suffer stunting Iannotti says In Guatemala and some countries in Africa its about  percent Iannotti is monitoring the children in this trial program in CapHaitien comparing them to a similar group of children who arent getting enriched peanut butter  to see whether this daily snack reduces rates of stunting If her data show that it has a positive impact on health and growth she says then the idea is we move more into the rural areas of Haiti where malnutrition is a bigger problem And then ideally we move toward national coverage Similar experiments are under way in several other countries as well They could be the first steps toward turning enriched peanut butter from emergency treatments into routine supersnacks Some experts though are raising flags of caution  who is also at Washington University but in the med school has been a big booster of using enriched peanut butter for treatment of severe malnutrition Hes been disappointed by the results of the trial programs so far that have attempted to prevent malnutrition Unfortunately they have not worked very well he says Nobody really knows why the approach hasnt worked better Others in public health   that the peanut butter packages are being pushed in part by private companies that make them These critics worry that glitzy foilwrapped packets could distract people from local lowtech nourishment or from breastfeeding In an ideal world we wouldnt rely on packages of enriched peanut butter Iannotti points out Wed be helping parents get good food nearby nonpackaged food like eggs milk and meat But as Guerlandie Joseph the mother in CapHaitien explained that just doesnt always happen In this lessthanideal world Iannotti says if little packages of fortified peanut paste can help nourish children through their most vulnerable time of life the payoff would be huge
