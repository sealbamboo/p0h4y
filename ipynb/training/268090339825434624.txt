Hundreds of health care workers in Georgia are losing their licenses to practice because of a problem created by a new immigration law in the state The law requires everyone  no matter where they were born  to prove their citizenship or legal residency to renew their professional licenses With too few state workers to process the extra paperwork licenses for doctors nurses pharmacists and other health professionals are expiring Lisa Durden with the   says renewing a license used to be a straightforward process and most applications whizzed through Now they crawl Enactment of the law coincided with budget cuts that reduced the office staff by  percent Kelly Farr Georgias deputy secretary of state says  nurses alone have fallen through the cracks Theres nothing more frustrating than getting that call from the desperate nurse knowing  shes being slowed down because we literally dont have enough people to click the approve button  Farr said While the secretary of state handles licensing of nurses pharmacists and veterinarians   is in charge of doctors physician assistants and even acupuncturists Its the same story there Director LaSharn Hughes says she sent  letters of notification out on a recent Thursday And by Monday wed burned up a fax machine Hughes said We didnt have the staff We didnt have the equipment Phones go unanswered Paperwork piles up And processing delays coupled with confusion over the new rules mean lots of expired licenses Hughes estimates about  doctors and other medical practitioners have lost their legal ability to work Some didnt submit the required paperwork Others are stuck in the backlog of applications that havent been processed yet Donald Palmisano Jr executive director of the Medical Association of Georgia says the law fixes a problem that never existed  at least not among doctors Were not aware of any undocumented immigrants that are physicians Palmisano said Even   an outspoken activist and critic of illegal immigration who helped write the law agrees King says the law protects Georgia jobs but even he believes some parts of the legislation need fixing A bill that addressed some of the laws shortcomings died in the last legislative session I am not only outraged but sincerely disappointed and puzzled that our repair legislation was not allowed a vote King says Legislative sponsors of the law didnt respond to interview requests Neither did Georgia Gov Nathan Deal For now state licensing offices will keep plowing through the mail containing copies of passports and birth certificates then checking them against a list of acceptable documents But thats where the vetting ends confirms Kelly Farr and Lisa Durden of the secretary of states office The law says nothing about making sure the documents are genuine We really dont have a way to do that says Durden State officials say the new document requirements havent uncovered any undocumented immigrants Instead officials say they hope the process itself may discourage people in the country illegally from trying to get licenses in the first place
