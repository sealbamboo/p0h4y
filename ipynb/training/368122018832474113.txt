Two years ago Dorothy Holmes then  was in the cozy pink bathroom of her home getting ready to shower when she fell Its the type of accident thats common among older Americans  and its often the very thing that triggers the end of independence I got a big spot on my head it almost conked me out Holmes says in her soft voice She heard her husband come down the hall and when he turned the corner all I heard was Oh God honey what did you do now After that I dont know anything cause I passed out Holmes recalls Holmes spent almost three months in a hospital Her heart stopped a few times she had breathing and memory problems and doctors removed an ulcer as big as a grapefruit These days patients are often transferred from a hospital to a nursing home to recover But some never leave The only thing I worried about was not getting out Holmes says now She kept asking her husband and one daughter Youre not going to keep me here are you Holmes worried that her children and her husband wouldnt be able to handle her care at home in Belchertown Mass That was before Martha came into it and told us all we could get for help Holmes says Thats Martha Napierski a case manager at   in Holyoke Mass She drew up a plan for Holmes transition We made sure she had homedelivered meals personal care homemaking seven days a week sheets she needed for her bed and skilled nursing Napierski explains She also had physical therapy and occupational therapy Napierski says Holmes would not have gone home without this help Its help the federal government is packaging in a Medicaid program called   It identifies patients old and young who have been in a nursing home for at least  days but dont really need to be there Massachusetts is one of  states in the program created by the Deficit Reduction Act of  Holmes was a relatively easy patient to help make the transition because she had a place to return to and family who could help with her care In many cases Napierski has to start from scratch Finding housing for patients who have given up their homes is the hardest part Then Napierski shops for appliances some basic furniture and a few plates and cups Even with that expense its definitely a savings to the state and federal government says Priscilla Chalmers Napierskis boss and director of WestMass ElderCare Thats compared with sometimes  a month for nursing home care she says So it is a success from a humane point of view and also from the point of view of a cost savings to the state That may sound logical but as of yet there is no proof of savings or happier patients The program is off to a slow start Massachusetts had hoped to have more than  men and women enrolled by now It has  Community agencies are still waiting for final rules for how theyll be paid  whats covered and which patients will qualify The state has to establish connections in the program between housing mental health transportation and other departments And resettling patients who are used to life in a nursing home can be hard Its a very complicated program for a variety of reasons says Dr Julian Harris the Medicaid director in Massachusetts Its not a process thats sort of a onesizefitsall Putting together all the things a patient may need  a guard dog maybe or the right home care home renovations and rides to appointments  is challenging Harris says But she adds this administration has really made a commitment to making home and communitybased services possible The commitment goes back to a  Supreme Court decision in   The judgement said that state Medicaid programs must pay for home care as long as it doesnt cost more than a nursing home or some other institution It will be several years before supporters of this program will be able to say whether it saves Medicaid money and participants are better off But Dorothy Holmes is sure  shes really glad to be back home It just means everything to me Holmes says as a new puppy Jack jumps onto her lap My life is back almost the way it always was Holmes is frustrated that a leg she injured in her fall is still not strong enough for walking any distance or climbing stairs Shes fine at home but she wants to get out more especially to visit a new greatgranddaughter  her fourth greatgrandchild
