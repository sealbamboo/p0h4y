A jury in Philadelphia has found Dr. Kermit Gosnell guilty of first-degree murder in three illegally performed late-term abortions.. The jury also found Gosnell, 72, guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a woman who was overdosed on anesthesia while undergoing a second-trimester abortion. He was found not guilty of one other murder charge in the death of an infant. Three other similar counts were thrown out by the judge last month.. The first-degree murder convictions carry a possible death sentence.. In 2010, federal agents raided Gosnell's Women's Medical Society clinic in Philadelphia in search of drug violations but instead found what they described at the time as "deplorable and unsanitary" conditions, including aborted fetuses in jars.. Gosnell had run the clinic for some 30 years.. Further, as The Associated Press reports:. Prosecutors said some infants were born alive and viable in the last three months of pregnancy at Gosnell's clinic but that he used scissors to cut their spinal cords.. The case had become a cause celebre for anti-abortion advocates. As . :
