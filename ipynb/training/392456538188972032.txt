To spank or not to spank For most American parents it isnt a question The majority of US children have been spanked at some time in their life despite a robust body of evidence that suggests spanking a child leads to problems in the future The latest evidence of the negative effects of spanking comes from researchers at Columbia University After analyzing data from more than  families they found that children who are spanked in early childhood are not only more likely to be aggressive as older children they are also more likely to do worse on vocabulary tests than their peers who had not been spanked The study was published this week in the journal Pediatrics While several studies have found a connection between spanking and aggressive behavior the finding that spanking could be linked to cognitive ability is somewhat new Only a few studies have looked at the cognitive effects of spanking said Michael MacKenzie an associate professor at Columbia University and lead author of the study We are still trying to learn if spanking has a direct effect on early brain development or if families that spank more are less likely to read to their kids and use more complex language In this latest study MacKenzie analyzed data collected from more than  families as part of the Fragile Families and Child WellBeing Study FFCW The study followed children from  US cities from birth to age  Most of the kids were born between  and  Parents were asked questions about their childs behavior and whether they had spanked their children within the past month The answer was frequently yes  of mothers and  of fathers reported spanking their children when they were  years old as did  of mothers and  of fathers when their children were  years old When these kids turned  parents were asked to assess their behavior The researchers also gave the children a test that measured their vocabulary The FFCW study also collected other data that might influence a year olds behavior and performance on the vocabulary test including the age of the mother when the child was born the mothers selfreported stress levels her intelligence scores and her own impulsivity The researchers also knew whether the child had a low birth weight and what his or her temperament was like during the first year of life among other things The researchers factored all of these into their analysis If you were just to compare kids who were spanked and not spanked the differences may not relate to the spanking because the families that do spank may look different from nonspanking families in lots of ways said MacKenzie But even when the researchers controlled for these differences  we still saw that spanking is an influencing factor in future behaviors The researchers found a clear connection between spanking at age  and the childs behavior at age  Compared to children who were never spanked by their mothers those who were spanked at least twice a week scored  points higher on a test of aggression and rulebreaking while those who were spanked less frequently scored  points higher according to the study To get a sense of how much extra aggression that is boys tend to score  point higher on this test than girls MacKenzie said The effects of spanking by fathers were different Compared with children who were never spanked by their dads those who were spanked at least twice a week scored  points lower on a vocabulary test the researchers found To put that in perspective MacKenzie noted that children whose moms dropped out of high school score  points lower on this test on average than children whose moms finished college MacKenzie believes that this research shows a need for public health officials and pediatricians to reexamine how they are talking about spanking Spanking is still the typical experience for most kids he said We have to start being more thoughtful about how we present this information for parents in a way that they can receive it So many parents have a hard time accepting that spanking is truly bad for kids probably because they were spanked as children and think they turned out OK The decision to spank is tied to most parents own rearing experiences said MacKenzie It is intimately tied to family history
