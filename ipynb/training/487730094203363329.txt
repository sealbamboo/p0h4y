The only thing more astounding than the number of runners nowadays   finished a marathon last year and  million ran a halfmarathon  is the number of running injuries The guesstimates never change Every year half of all runners get hurt enough that they must stop running  sometimes for a few days sometimes forever Although running is a spectacular cardiovascular activity the impact ultimately beats up your knees and hips and ankles The risk of getting injured running is so high and so frustrating that it has led to an explosion of soft running methods in the last decade such as the Pose Method chi running and barefoot running Likewise injury reduction is the impetus for the rise of a new product category the soft running machine which lets you get a treadmilllike workout with little or no impact These new products dont come cheap but they work For the hard core who want to cut the injuries extend their running careers and get a real workout going soft might be the way to go  A platform with a inch adjustable cushion of highdensity foam and air and a solid rear post holds your waist in place with a highanchored retaining harness causing you to lean forward as you run in place A builtin air pump can adjust the running surface from very soft to soft  A surprisingly satisfying workout  surprising because I thought this was a ridiculous idea before I tried it but it definitely isnt Running while leaning forward on what feels like springy sand you naturally land on the ball of your foot and push off from the toes forcing you into good not heelstriking form The waist belt holds you in place and lets you run with a pronounced lean  so far forward that you could realistically fall without a belt holding you in place Helping to keep you from getting bored is a digital control console that includes power in watts distance traveled time elapsed average heart rate average speed and calories burned Attachments for stretch cords and straps allow for strength and jumping exercises  At nearly  feet long and  feet high its bigger than a treadmill It seems rather expensive for having no moving parts   more with accessories   The nonmotorized ellipticallooking apparatus with individual foot pads allows you to accurately replicate a real running motion with no impact It has greater stride lengthrange of motion than an elliptical and less impact than a treadmill  The most realistic running motion of any nontreadmill Ive tried While you can make a variety of movements from an ellipticallike oval glide and an upanddown stair step the Zero lets you flow into a real running gait That is due to a design that mimics the leg by placing pivot points at the knee and hips and it includes a foot platform that can flex like an ankle That allows you to flick your heel back and almost kick your own butt Combined with the large potential stride length I was hitting  inches at  miles double the length of the best ellipticals it feels very real My heart rate as expected was a little less than on land by about  beats per minute which actually encouraged me to go at a faster pace which is displayed on the monitor along with elapsed time and stride length Having a problematic right knee the complete lack of impact was a dream for me I could see runners using this to do a significant chunk  to  of their training thereby saving wear and tear on the joints without losing any conditioning In that sense its like water running but more techniquespecific Plugless selfpowered it is dead silent It will be available in Busybody and other fitness stores Aug   There is a learning curve It took me about  minutes to get into a natural handsfree running gait Others may have to hold on to the pivoting handlebars which can be used as part of an allbody ellipticalstyle workout I think any serious runner could go handsfree by the end of a minute session     This curveshaped electricityfree manual treadmill uses revolving freespinning rubberized slats on a track rather than a traditional tread belt on roller To run faster run up higher on the curve to slow drop back into the flatter section Great workout  unlike anything else Its as challenging as you want it to be No buttons to push  just move backward or forward on the slats Woodway claims youll burn  more calories than in a normal run and I believe it All the while the shock transmitted by the rubbercoated aluminum slats is much less than in normal running and is lessened more by the uphill requirement While it is nearly identical in looks to Woodways motorfree Curve model the EcoMill takes environmentally friendly one step further as your movement of the tread slats powers an onboard generator system that produces energy for the display and can even be used to charge a phone or mp player through the USB charging port The EcoMill can be synced with systems that can feed that selfcreated energy back into your homes electrical system saving you money Also unlike a regular treadmill the slat belt is maintenance free  Other than the cost nothing     A newstyle elliptical with arm stations provides a pseudouphill running motion  Its a fine workout that I couldnt get enough of even though the motion was not real running like the other three products in this review Instead it provides a satisfying ambulatory motion that is halfstepper and halfelliptical giving you the feeling of running uphill when you go handsfree When you use the twoposition handlebars you get a great upperbody workout The programs are motivating I especially liked a minute interval training program with a bell that goes off as you reach certain calorieburn thresholds The machine has a small footprint uses effective air fan resistance and includes a water bottle bay on the front It is relatively inexpensive as elliptical machines go  Only available for sale from the website Personally I like to have a store I can go back to if something goes wrong   M and  M including more programs and heart rate monitor strap and readout
