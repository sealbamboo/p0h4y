Could the National Health Service help the UK lead the way in personalised medicine and digital healthcare technology   Thats the enticing prospect held out by ministers as they unveil initiatives weeks before the end of this parliament At the heart of the vision is genomics  the analysis of an individuals complete set of genetic information  Its been announced that members of two families have been diagnosed with rare conditions as a result of an analysis of their genomes  they will now be eligible for personalised treatment   There is great enthusiasm about the  genome project which aims to sequence that number of genomes from NHS patients by    The health service is seen to be in the unique position of having access to a lifetime of medical records for a patient and that persons genome data   As an integrated healthcare system with tens of millions of patients it has been argued that the NHS is well placed to exploit the immense potential of genomics  The life sciences minister George Freeman and the NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh are among the enthusiasts for the  genome project  Mr Freeman who was involved in venture capital for the biotechnology industry before entering parliament believes that the US healthcare system cant develop genomics in the same way as the NHS   Sir Bruce has argued that American insurers will use individuals genomic information to levy differential insurance premiums depending on the perceived risk  that would not happen in the NHS It is acknowledged by NHS chiefs however that the US has a better track record when it comes to fasttrack approvals of news drugs   Under the US Food and Drug Administrations critical path initiative the process of transforming scientific discoveries into licensed medicines has been greatly  accelerated   Ministers frustrated by the sometimes lengthy process on this side of the Atlantic now want to make amends George Freeman has now set up an accelerated access review led by Sir Hugh Taylor Chair of Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust  to look at speeding up the availability of innovative medicines and treatments   Underlying this is an awareness that new drugs can be licensed relatively quickly by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency MHRA but getting them approved for use in the health service by the National Institute for health and Care Excellence NICE can take a lot longer  The hope in Whitehall is that the review will result in companies who are developing new drugs and therapies getting an earlier indication from regulators that approvals will fall into place if clinical trials are successful  NHS commissioners would also be in the loop at an earlier stage   The theory is that a combination of fast track regulation and more certainty of having the NHS as a customer would provide a huge incentive for investors in British research   For the taxpayer there would be benefits through this process Quicker drug development means cheaper drugs so the theory goes   The traditional lengthy pathway from laboratory discovery to blockbuster drug was a costly one for big pharmaceutical companies  The new world of personalised targeted medicines should mean lower development costs Pharma companies unhappy with the recent restrictions imposed on the Cancer Drugs Fund CDF may be sceptical about the brave new world which is being talked up by ministers   The industry says its increasingly frustrated with the current system and has called for reform of the CDF and NICE The role of the Cancer Drugs Fund will be considered by the Taylor review   It has the potential to herald major changes in the landscape for medical research and the purchasing of drugs by the NHS  Watch this space
