Growing up Robbie Schaeffer always assumed he would join OPI Products the nail polish empire his father founded and which was bought by Coty Inc in  And so he became a licensed nail technician and opened a salon in Studio City But then Schaeffer switched gears literally A longtime cycling enthusiast Schaeffer last year opened Pedalers Fork a bicyclethemed restaurant in Calabasas which combines some key ingredients of cycling culture great coffee healthful comfort food an impressive selection of beer and wine and a bicycle repair shop Schaeffer  regularly leads bike excursions from the restaurant biking  to  miles each week One hundred percent I do love the nail world and the people in the beauty industry but staying inside all day was really difficult for me Im a person who loves to play in the outdoors In Los Angeles weve been blessed with such an amazing place to live Take a step back and look whats around Dont be afraid to get out there On a bike or take a hike or go for a run or go kayaking paddle boarding  all of these amazing opportunities are at our doorstep Its that sense of freedom Its pure fun The wind is in your face youre moving fast Its competitive at times But for the most part its like that free spirit in you is being let out You forget about everything You just get on the bike and you go I start my ride with a small bite Coffee is a very integral part of it Cyclists have different routines on what they eat But you definitely want to get something in the tank And we carry food with us You should be eating every   minutes on the bike replacing calories as youre riding Were not shy about how we eat but we try to eat clean Were not eating fast food Also you want to be drinking water and some kind of electrolyte mix so youre supplementing that loss of electrolytes After a ride then its a celebration We always say the greatest recovery drink is beer The best way for people to really get excited about riding is to join a group You will get better and better because everybody pushes each other You slowly learn and you build your skill If youre by yourself its hard to gauge your progress You just improve when youre with other riders We try to go out at least once or twice a month on a destination or adventure ride where we go to Ojai to Santa Barbara or we head down south to Laguna A bicycle is a wonderful way to see a city The Beauty Bus Foundation is a charity that provides free beauty and grooming services to those who are chronically or terminally ill Not only for the person who is ill but for their caregiver as well because caregivers pretty much give up their lives for that person We provide athome hair nail and skin care to help patients maintain dignity and give them respite during a difficult time We also offer popup salons in area hospitals  I visited a woman two weeks before she passed Her daughter who was her caregiver said it was the first time her mother had smiled in three months If we can do that we know weve made a difference
