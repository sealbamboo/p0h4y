President Obama and his supporters had a rare opportunity to celebrate this week A lastminute surge in people signing up for health insurance sent the total government enrollment figures over the sevenmillion mark That number seemed out of reach just a few months ago when a crashprone website threatened to undermine the presidents signature health care law Republicans are still bent on repealing the law but now millions more Americans have a stake in Obamacares survival On Tuesday the president marked the comeback The bottom line is this Under this law the share of Americans with insurance is up and the growth of health care costs is down and thats good for our middleclass and thats good for our fiscal future he said We dont yet know how many of the new enrollees were previously uninsured but multiple surveys show that overall insurance coverage is on the rise Even before the surge in signups over the last few weeks Sharon Long of the Urban Institute estimated nearly  million people had gained coverage through private insurance or programs such as Medicaid Insurance coverage is going up Long says There may well be some people whove lost coverage But the number of people whove gained coverage swamps that effect That doesnt mean the controversial health care law is out of the woods Drew Altman president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation says the real test is still to come as people go to the doctor make their copays and decide whether the coverage is a good deal or not When you look at the policies theres no question but that the winners will vastly outnumber the losers Altman says But weve also learned over the last year that it just takes a small number of people who view themselves as losers to make trouble for the law politically Indeed Republican critics like Wyoming Sen John Barasso continue to highlight the stories of people whove been hurt by the health care law People paying more in premiums people losing their doctors not having access to the hospitals in their community higher copay higher deductibles Barasso said Thats what the American people are facing Republican Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana offered his own alternative health care plan this week at a breakfast sponsored by the   Jindal suggests offering vouchers as a substitute for Medicare and a tax break for those who buy health insurance on their own He also wants to let the states decide how to protect people with preexisting conditions The Republican Party needs to be more than the party of no Jindal said We have to have solutions We talk about the need to repeal Obamacare and I think thats absolutely right But Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says repeal has just gotten more difficult While polls show less than half the country approves of Obamacare attitudes towards it have improved somewhat Garin says we may have reached an inflection point I think the tables may have turned a little bit as more and more people feel they have a stake in the Affordable Care Act and who really dont want the Republicans to be taking away new rights and new benefits that theyre enjoying because of the law Insurance companies will soon be deciding how much to charge for next years coverage The late surge in customers may help to limit price hikes and perhaps boost competition But theres likely to be wide variation around the country and people in some areas may see much bigger increases than others
