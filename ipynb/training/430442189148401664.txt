Five days a week three hours a day Jonathan Nuez works out with a gymnastics coach on bars rings pommel horse and floor exercises He gets home and hes still not tired said his mother Yailin Hes jumping up and doing cartwheels At competitions Jonathan  often takes first or second place No one could ever tell what hes gone through Ms Nuez said Suddenly and mysteriously when Jonathan was an infant his liver began to fail At  months a transplant was his only hope His parents took a chance on an unusual operation He had a transplant but part of his own liver was left in place in the hope that it might eventually recover so that the donor organ would no longer be needed If that happened the antirejection drugs would be stopped and with luck Jonathans immune system would destroy the transplant leaving his own liver to do its job The advantage to this approach was that it would leave Jonathan free of the lifetime of powerful antirejection drugs that transplant patients normally require The gamble paid off Jonathans liver grew back the   and the oncefragile little boy is now a powerhouse in the gym But for all its apparent promise the operation his family chose has not really caught on  to the dismay of Jonathans surgeon Dr Tomoaki Kato of NewYorkPresbyterian Morgan Stanley Childrens Hospital in Manhattan Few children who need liver transplants are candidates for the procedure and other surgeons are wary because it is complex lengthy and riskier than a standard transplant And it doesnt always work The childrens own livers do not always recover Even so Dr Kato believes that doctors should be performing the surgery called auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation  more often and that it should at least be considered for any child under  who needs a transplant because of acute liver failure The total who would qualify is small maybe only a few dozen children a year in the United States but the prospect of a normal life without antirejection drugs makes it well worth considering Dr Kato said The drugs suppress the immune system and can increase the risk of infections   and other health problems It can be hard to convince colleagues to do something different Dr Kato said This is something you need to see and believe The operation has not worked well in adults and it is not appropriate for children with chronic   because scarring may prevent the liver from growing back In all Dr Kato said he had performed the surgery on  children from  months to  years of age with the most recent case about a year ago In all but one case the childrens own livers recovered If the liver does not recover the child is treated like any standard transplant patient and the antirejection drugs are continued Dr Kato said that the liver had not yet grown back in his youngest patient a monthold on whom he operated in August  I dont know if her liver will ever recover he said but added We have not lost hope completely He said that originally he thought any child under the age of  with acute liver failure could be helped by the surgery But now experience suggests that infants may not be good candidates As to why Dr Kato said he could only speculate In a baby the partial liver that is transplanted is much larger than the portion of the childs own liver that is left in place The transplant takes up too much blood Dr Kato said The old liver is sick so the transplant preferentially gets the blood flow Maybe the flow is taken too much to the transplanted liver and theres not enough for the old liver to survive He said he thought that problem might explain why it took three years for Jonathan Nuezs liver to grow back Jonathan also had a number of complications along the way Other experts acknowledge that the operation has not gained wide acceptance but say it poses substantial difficulties   director of liver transplantation at the Nebraska Medical Center said he had performed the operation about  times but no longer did Its a good idea but things dont always work out as perfectly as you would hope he said Theres a lot of obstacles He added Nobodys doing any with any real enthusiasm  the medical director of liver and intestine transplants at Seattle Childrens hospital said Im a big fan of the technique I tried to get my surgeons interested in doing something very similar But the patients you can apply it to may be one every three four or five years Its a hard thing to develop Standard liver transplants have become so successful he said that many surgeons are reluctant to take chances on something different particularly a complicated operation that they do not practice very often And not all transplant surgeons are Tom Kato Dr Horslen said Hes bold and he has a lot of pediatric experience After Jonathans recovery the only thing that worried his parents was that the cause of his liver failure had never been determined When he was  they got the diagnosis an autoimmune disorder that affects the liver A small amount of daily medication has kept it under control Ms Nuez said She has no regrets about the choice she and her husband made for Jonathan and she said she wished the same option were available to more families She added We were in the right place at the right time
