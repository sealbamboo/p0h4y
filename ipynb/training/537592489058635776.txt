A Kent hospitals AE department is still failing to protect patients from inappropriate or unsafe care a health watchdog has said  The Care Quality Commission CQC said assessment of patients at Medway Maritime Hospital remained flawed  The CQCs deputy chief inspector of hospitals Edward Baker said it was the hospital that caused them the most concern The hospital said it had made a number of changes since the CQC inspection Inspectors highlighted confusion over the movement of patients from the AE department which is in special measures to wards in the hospital Inspectors found one patient was at the AE department at the hospital in Gillingham for more than  hours and was then assigned to a ward bed only to be told later it was no longer available  Another patient remained in a trolley for nine hours when policy said all patients should be transferred to a bed within six hours of arrival  The report following an inspection on  August said We have taken enforcement action against Medway Maritime Hospital to protect the health safety and welfare of people using this service An earlier inspection at the hospital which was put into special measures in July  found a crisis situation with bloodstained walls overcrowding and potentially lifethreatening unsafe practices  The CQC wrote to Medway NHS Foundation Trust in July resulting in an action plan being devised  In its latest report the commission said The pace of change remained slow the ability to introduce change was hindered by the continued lack of leadership within the department However we were reassured that the trust was in the process of appointing experienced nurses to lead the workforce as well as commissioning external specialists in emergency medicine to help improve the safety of the department We have judged that the trust continues to fail to ensure that patients are protected from the risks of receiving care or treatment that is inappropriate or unsafe The trust said Two new emergency care consultants took post in September and October there is now a dedicated head of nursing in the department and three new emergency care matrons will all be in post by  December A spokesman said work was under way to improve patient flow and alleviate congestion in the emergency department  A new childrens emergency department is due to open in December  Dr Phillip Barnes acting trust chief executive said We realise the challenges before us and are fully committed to providing the high quality of care our patients deserve
