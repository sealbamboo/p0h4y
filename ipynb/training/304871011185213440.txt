Over the past few decades one of the most perplexing questions in global health is how to stop HIV There have been campaigns involving condoms abstinence and even the circumcision of all men younger than  But one relatively new strategy called   is causing quite a buzz The idea is to give all HIVpositive people antiretroviral drugs to drive down the levels of virus in their systems so they no longer pose a threat of transmitting the disease Sounds good in theory but how well does it play out in the slums of Nairobi or the townships of Johannesburg Two studies   in the journal   find that in places where HIV drugs are widely available the risk for new HIV infections drops dramatically and overall life expectancy increases by more than a decade In other words treatment as prevention isnt just a buzz word floating around health conferences but a promising strategy for stopping HIV  even in a part of the world with one of the most severe AIDS epidemics Epidemiologists from Harvard University followed  HIVnegative South Africans for seven years in the province of   They found that when more than  percent of HIVpositive people are on powerful antiHIV drugs it cuts the risk of contracting the virus by about  percent compared to when less than  percent of those infected have treatment The intention of this program the South African governments antiretroviral drug program is not treatment as prevention   a health economist who contributed to the study tells Shots The intention of this program is treatment for treatment to save lives A true treatmentasprevention model Barnighausen says would offer antiretroviral therapy to everyone who is HIV positive But the South African government is providing medications only to the sickest of the sick Nevertheless Barnighausen and his colleagues saw a sharp reduction in new HIV infections when drugs were widely available to the community It is a program with all the failures and challenges of a reallife publicsector nurseled program in southern Africa Barnighausen says And despite these challenges we see a strong effect of HIV treatment on HIV incidence And thats extremely encouraging Infectious disease specialist   at the University of North Carolina who wasnt involved in this study calls the findings a home run Cohen   a landmark report in  showing that HIV treatment nearly eliminates the chance that an infected person will transmit the virus to a partner The current study Cohen says demonstrates that treatment as prevention doesnt just work at the individual level but also at the community level And thus the findings are hugely important for public health Its teaching us something he says You dont have to treat everybody to see a community benefit In a companion   Barnighausen and his team found that overall life expectancy in KwaZuluNatal rose more than  years since the province scaled up HIV treatment in  But even when studies like these show the broad benefits of antiHIV medications major challenges remain in getting drugs to the millions of Africans who need them including the issue of who pays for these   Questions also remain about how sustainable these programs will be especially given that HIVpositive patients are going to need to be on those drugs for the rest of their lives
