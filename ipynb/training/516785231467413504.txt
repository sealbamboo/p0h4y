Treat HIV now dont delay Thats the new advice from the International Antiviral SocietyUSA  in a shift from earlier recommendations that called for waiting until a patients immune system showed serious damage Studies show that treating HIVpositive patients with antiretroviral drugs early in the course of the infection lengthens life and lowers the risk of tuberculosis and other bacterial infections the panel noted in a JAMA paper which was published to coincide with the start of the International AIDS Conference in Washington The medications can also reduce transmission of the virus to sexual partners by  the   Treatment in other words can double as prevention Adults infected with HIV should be offered treatment even if their immune systems are still relatively intact the panel added The recommendations are intended for wealthy countries where antiretroviral treatments are readily available the US Department of Health and Human Services released similar guidelines in March that advise treatment for all people with HIV Yet despite the growing consensus on the benefits of early treatment people who inject drugs are consistently denied this option said Dr Nora Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse speaking at the AIDS conference Sunday Volkow noted that  of injection drug users receive treatment later than nondrug users according to studies Doctors are reluctant to start HIV treatment for them because they fear they wont stick with the daily drug regimen  and that could coax HIV to develop resistance to the medications But research shows that injection drug users are just as likely as nondrug users to properly manage their HIV medication if physicians treat patients substance abuse at the same time as their HIV infection Volkow said citing work by researchers in British Columbia And she said turning the HIVAIDS epidemic around cannot be done without addressing this key group Numerous speakers in the opening days of the conference credited science  in particular antiretroviral drug therapies   with changing an HIV diagnosis from a death sentence into a manageable chronic illness Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said we now have a scientific foundation to even consider the feasibility of an AIDSfree generation We have a stunning amount of advances in the area of basic and clinical research Fauci said We know a lot about this virus Probably the most important knowledge is understanding how HIV replicates Fauci said  This has given us targets of vulnerability on the part of the virus that future antiretroviral drugs can exploit Fauci said science has brought us a long way from the early dark days of the epidemic when his patients would die within weeks or months Now if a yearold contracts HIV and starts treatment right away Fauci said he can look that patient in the eye and tell him or her they can live an additional  years  essentially a nearnormal life span The drugs have helped an increasing number of HIVpositive patients keep virus levels low in their bodies another JAMA study found The survey of  HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in  clinics around the country reported that just  had low levels of virus in   compared with  in  More tolerable drugs improved drug adherence and better access to healthcare may have contributed to this improvement the authors said But although statistics like that are encouraging Fauci noted that only  of people infected with HIV in the United States regularly take antiretroviral medication and as a result only  of HIVpositive people in this country have low levels of virus in their bodies
