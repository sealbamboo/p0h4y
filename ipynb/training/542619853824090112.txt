Theres a simple test that scientists could use to make sure the cells theyre studying in the lab are what they think they are But most of the time academic scientists dont bother That omission is a problem One   found that between  percent and  percent of all cell lines have been misidentified And this kind of mistaken identity is one reason that many results from experiments run in scientific labs cant be reproduced elsewhere These are really not very easy discussions to have says Leonard Freedman founding president of the   Irreproducibility is kind of an uncomfortable subject to talk about particularly among researchers But Freedman is trying to kindle that conversation Last month he hosted a   in Washington DC on the subject that I was invited to moderate and allowed to record We are fully convinced that this is a significant enough problem that we have to take steps to address it   director of the NIHs   said during the panel discussion One obvious step would be to require scientists who get federal funding to test their cells Howard Soule chief science officer at the Prostate Cancer Foundation said thats what his charity requires of the scientists it funds Theres a commercial lab that will run this test for about  so this is not going to break the bank Soule said But Lorsch at the NIH argued that its not so simple on the scale at which his institute hands out funding We really cant go and police  grants Lorsch said Sure you can Soule shot back How can you not Lorsch said if they do police this issue there are dozens and dozens of other issues that the NIH should logically police as well It becomes a Hydra Lorsch said You know you chop off one head and others grow Biomedical research gets more expensive all the time and the NIH is reluctant to pile on a whole bunch of new rules Its a balancing act If we become too draconian were going to end up squashing creativity and slowing down research which is not good for the taxpayers because they arent going to get as much for their money Lorsch said On the other hand if its the wild wild West were going to end up using taxpayer money in nonproductive ways  which is absolutely not acceptable The scientific journals that publish this research could also require that all cell lines be authenticated But at the moment that would mean rejecting the vast majority of submissions  executive editor at the   journals said editors there have tried to coax scientists to test their cells by adding it to a checklist they have to provide when they submit a paper But only about  percent of the scientists submitting papers check that box The thing that keeps me up is that weve tried to address this issue and weve failed she said This may all come down to money Scientists can avoid most of these problems by purchasing cells from a company that routinely tests them But most scientists would rather walk down the hall and borrow cells from another lab Academics share their cell lines like candy because they dont want to go back and spend another  said Richard Neve from Genentech It is economics And they dont want to spend another  to verify thats still the same cell line For companies like   though the economic driver is to make sure that scientists there know exactly which cells theyre using Neve runs a massive cell bank at the Bay Area biotech giant and like other biotech and pharmaceutical companies it maintains strict quality controls When scientists at his company find an intriguing result from an academic lab the first thing they do is try to replicate the result Neve said often they cant and misidentified cells are a common reason This is a problem But the exact implications of it though I dont think well ever understand he said And I think what we need to do at this point is to set these standards and move forward And then we can say from this point on we can believe the science that was generated In an ideal world scientists would toss all of their unauthenticated cell lines into the trash and start from scratch Freedmans nonprofit is trying to nudge scientists in that direction But so far theres not enough incentive for academic scientists to take that step
