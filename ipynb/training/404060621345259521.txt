What is the different between a gold and a silver medal The enhancement of the performance by just  is what could keep an elite athlete away from glory In order to achieve maximum performance an athlete can turn to a series of resources without crossing the line of illegality  They are called performance or ergogenic aids and may include anything from good nutrition and a training plan to the consumption of supplements and legal substances There are also special gadgets that enhance athletes lung capacity improve transport of oxygen and speed up recovery Many of these techniques are widely accepted and are as simple as having a customised balanced diet or getting into a bath full of ice after exercise Others tend to invite more controversy and some specialists warn that they may be banned Every morning before breakfast Fran Medina  and a Spanish professional cyclist takes a cocktail of multivitamins I normally have folic acid iron and vitamin C  that helps you to absorb all the vitamins He said he also takes vitamins B and B which he believes are good for oxidative stress There is a theory that cells in the body experience molecular damage caused by reactive forms of oxygen called free radicals This is known as oxidative stress  After two to four hours of training Fran takes more supplements These are a form of aminoacids which it has been suggested help rebuild muscles  During the season Fran also take Larginine which has been promoted as also being beneficial in tackling oxidative stress There are a wide variety of supplements on the market Dr Mikel Zabala of the Sport Science Faculty at Granada University in Spain says It could be anything from bovine colostrum  because of its protein content to caffeine sodium bicarbonate and nicotine although this last one has been under surveillance by the World Antidoping Agency due to its activating effects  He said that while nicotine and caffeine help athlete to be more alert other substances are used to build muscle strength One such supplement is creatine which according to the magazine Nature plays an important role in the production of energy in the body Beetroot juice is another common addition to the athletes diet It helps to increase the levels of nitric oxide in the body  In the case of swimmers for example it could help them to reduce the number of breaths they take in a short distance competition  One method that seems to be a current trend between professionals is socalled hypoxic training  Athletes could be in a natural or artificial environment in which oxygen levels are reduced forcing the cardiorespiratory system to work harder than normal Hypoxic training is often used in endurance sports when the transport of oxygen is highly important Dr Zabala says  If the training is in a natural environment the athletes need to stay for several days in a high altitude training centre while in an artificial environment this can be done at sea level with oxygen tents where the athlete can sleep in a simulated environment of over  feet or perform intermittent exercise It has been revealed that Mo Farah slept in a oxygen tent up to the last day of his London  Olympic event The British MotoGP rider Cal Crutchlow uses it as well There are athletes who spend between  and  hours a day in hypoxic explains Dr Victoria Pons from the nutritional department at the Centre of High Performance in Barcelona Spain  But she said Not everyone is going to benefit from it and experience an increase of haemoglobin and improvement in the transport of oxygen There have been suggestions that some high profile professional athletes are installing oxygen tents costing up to US  in their homes However Dr Pons recommends using them under professional supervision You cannot just get suddenly over  feet It has to be done gradually You have to watch out that you wake up fine that you dont have a sleep disorder headache or any other symptom that would be an indication that something is wrong Fran Medina hasnt tried oxygen tents but he has spent periods at high altitude training centres  It is true that you dont experience an incredible increase of enhanced performance However when you are competing at the highest level you do notice it You notice that you have a plus when you most need it Artificial hypoxic training is not free from controversy some countries have asked for it to be considered as form of doping while it is banned in Italy If improving endurance is key for the athlete so too is recovery The athlete must recover from training quickly and safety before getting his or her body back to maximum strength For this purpose exposure to cold temperature or cryotherapy usually works well to avoid problems of inflammation and bruising and to accelerate the recovery process through vasoconstriction There are different methods from putting ice into a bathtub to a cold sauna sometimes called a Cryosauna where the athlete exposes his body to temperatures as low as minus C and C The reason this is good for performance is because anything that helps recovery will also help to be ready for the next days training and to have a better assimilation says doctor Zabala Famous athletes such as Franck Ribry or Cristiano Ronaldo are believed to have used cold saunas However specialists recommend using it with caution You dont know how your brain is going to react or if your heart is sensitive to it says Victoria Pons Cryosaunas cost around US   Cyclist Fran Medina hasnt had a chance to use one But in general he thinks that ergogenic aids are fundamental to enhance performance Would he survive without them for a season I would but Id probably have to put a lot more time into recovery which means that I wouldnt be able to do more intensive training sessions Everything would add up and in the end I believe my performance would be at  Thats the difference between reaching the podium or being a runner up
