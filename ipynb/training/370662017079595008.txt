
 One morning last August Mary Arabes yearold gray and black tiger cat Leo came home from a night out exploring with a severe limp and an elbow swollen three times its normal size He was clearly in pain Ms Arabe thought he had dislocated his shoulder during a fall   He kind of lay around the barn that day you could tell he was hurting said Ms Arabe who lives on a acre farm in Rogers Ohio with  chickens three horses three cats and two dogs He was in so much agony I thought If someone cant remove this animals pain I have to put him down She took Leo to the veterinarian who said he could do nothing for him Despondent she took him to Rick Tsai a chiropractor in Darlington Pa who a few years earlier had adjusted Ms Arabes puggle Bustar after a head and neck injury An Xray found no broken bones but there was a large amount of swelling and fluid retention Dr Tsai couldnt make any promises but he placed his hands on the cats spine hips and neck and manipulated the joints until they popped  We brought the cat home and the next day he was walking fine said Ms Arabe Two thirds of the swelling in the arm was gone Whatever Dr Tsai adjusted it worked He healed him Millions of people swear by their chiropractors and chiropractic has long been a mainstay in the equine world especially among show or racehorses Now it is gaining popularity among pet owners as a way to treat household pets suffering from arthritis sprains joint pain and other ailments Animal or veterinary chiropractic originated around  when human chiropractic first began But it did not gain wider appeal until  when the late Sharon WilloughbyBlake a veterinarian and chiropractor started Options for Animals in Hillsdale Ill which taught vets and chiropractors how to adjust animals Two years later the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association a professional membership group and the main certifying agency in North America was formed According to Robbie Hroza vice president of operations for Options for Animals about  students have gone through their program Over the last two years student enrollment has increased by  percent a good portion are recent graduates of veterinary or chiropractic schools she said  Still the practice remains controversial in both people and pets While some studies have found that chiropractic care can be more effective than medications for people with   others have linked   Other researchers have found that unfavorable chiropractic outcomes are   There are only a   about chiropractics efficacy on animals and tensions exist both within and between the chiropractic and veterinary communities The   a trade organization reports that in  about  of the estimated  veterinarians in the United States practiced some type of animal adjustment In some states a chiropractor is not allowed to touch an animal without either a veterinarians referral or direct veterinary supervision And in its   the American Animal Hospital Association and the American Association of Feline Practitioners caution chiropractic methods potentially can cause injury through the use of inappropriate technique or excessive force There is currently insufficient published evidence of efficacy in dogs and cats to make specific recommendations about the use of chiropractic intervention they add Indeed since  the American Chiropractic Associations   that the term veterinary chiropractic is a misnomer and should not be used to refer to the application of manipulative techniques to animals  To get around it many veterinary practitioners use other monikers at least for official purposes At The Healing Oasis Wellness Center in Sturtevant Wis students are trained in veterinary spinal manipulative therapy enrollment has tripled since opening in  according to coowner Michelle Rivera The American Veterinary Chiropractic Association calls the  plus vets and chiropractors that have gone through its training AVCA certified doctors Dr William L Inman a veterinary surgeon and head of the International Association of Veterinary Chiropractitioners also known as the American Animal Adjusting Association in Coeur DAlene Idaho offers   which involves applying a sixinch long stainless steel rubbertipped Activatorlike device on an animals spinal column The  people who have gone though his course earn the title of certified veterinary chiropractitioner Many chiropractors think the rules are unfair to pet owners A person should be allowed to take their animal anywhere they want if they think it benefits them said Dr Tsai the chiropractor who treated Ms Arabes cat He has worked in tandem with veterinarians over the years but acknowledges that many of them dont like his field because it takes business away from them Do you really think that a few weeks course can possibly teach a vet the skills that has taken a good chiropractor years to learn said Dr Tsai who has adjusted everything from raccoons to owls out of his home office in East Palestine Ohio Gene Giggleman a veterinarian animal chiropractor and a professor of anatomy at Parker University College of Chiropractic in Dallas which has trained more than  vets and chiropractors in animal chiropractic thinks its more about a lack of knowledge My philosophy as a vet is chiropractic first drugs and surgery second but a lot of vets dont understand or know about animal chiropractic and so they dont refer people he said Other veterinarians say their reservations are more about the health of the animal Dave Geiger a veterinary neurologist near Santa Fe believes that animal chiropractic has the potential to be harmful because its performed by practitioners who often have very little background knowledge of veterinary neurology  or veterinary medicine at all  and thus are unable to fairly evaluate the theoretical or actual effects of their practices    Some practitioners even promote veterinary chiropractic for conditions that it is potentially dangerous for like degenerative disc disease he added It should be clearly identified as an unproven therapy and practitioners should be prevented from making claims about its effects  Still as with most kinds of alternative therapy adherents often cant be swayed  If its good enough for us why not them said Dee Hayes a yoga instructor in San Diego who shared the same chiropractor with her cocker spaniel Charlie for six years   Patricia Kallenbach a holistic veterinarian in Crystal River Fla said the field is growing because the client base demands it Theyre saying If Im going to eat better Im going to get my pet to eat better she said If I can benefit from chiropractic care on my body so can my pet Chiropractic also tends to be much cheaper than veterinary care with visits costing as little as  depending on the type of animal and of course the practitioner  To that end learning another modality is beneficial to veterinarians many of whom have been struggling financially Its a practice builder in that you can offer another service without a huge amount of training said Dr Kallenbach who recently added chiropractic massage therapy and acupuncture to her practice in addition to massage for humans Maureen Wilkins and her yearold Russian Peterbald cat Isak both get adjustments from Shannon GaertnerEwing a chiropractor in Nampa Idaho Ms Wilkins  had been seeing Dr GaertnerEwing herself on a weekly basis and started bringing in Isak three years ago   Isak is inclined to get grumpy and its my understanding thats usually because hes hurting said Ms Wilkins a retired teacher who pays  per visit So when Isak gets particularly grumpy and starts beating up on his feline brother or he jumps someplace and then falls off we take him to Dr G She adjusts him and its like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde His attitude improves he becomes Mr Cuddles He cant get enough affection Ms Wilkins maintains that Isak can sense in advance when its time to visit Dr GaertnerEwing When I put down the car carrier hell leap into it she said He is thrilled to go As soon as he sees her hes practically drooling
