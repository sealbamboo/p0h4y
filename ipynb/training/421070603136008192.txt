The standard treatment for people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is a mask worn at night that helps them breathe without interruption The mask is unwieldy and uncomfortable however one study found that percent to  percent of patients with obstructive sleep apnea    Now scientists may have found an alternative at least for some patients a pacemakerlike device implanted in the chest that stimulates a nerve in the jaw helping to keep part of the upper airway open The device called a neurostimulator helped reduce breathing interruptions and raise blood oxygen levels in about twothirds of sleep apnea patients participating in a trial researchers reported on Wednesday in   This is a new paradigm of surgical treatment that seems to effectively control obstructive sleep apnea in selected patients said Dr Sean M Caples a sleep specialist in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn Its very exciting Still Dr Caples who was not involved in the new study noted that a third of patients were not improved when all was said and done even though they were chosen because they were seen as likely to benefit The new trial was funded by the maker of the device Inspire Medical Systems At  sites internationally in  patients doctors surgically implanted a remotecontrolled neurostimulator that activated at night sends regular electric impulses to a nerve inside the jaw The impulses cause the tongue to move forward during inhalation opening the airway Patients experienced a decline in breathing pauses after using the device for a year to  per hour on average from  episodes per hour The number of dangerous drops in blood oxygen levels also declined to  per hour on average from  per hour There was no control group during this phase of the study however and other experts said that  diet exercise or other factors may have contributed to the reductions At a year only two of  patients stopped using their upper airway stimulator at night and  percent reported daily use But sleep apnea worsened in about  patients using the device though it is unclear why In the second phase of the study  patients doing well with the stimulators after one year were randomly assigned to either continue with the therapy or have it withdrawn for a week The therapycontinuation group had little change in the number of breathing pauses per hour or drops in blood oxygen levels But in the patients from whom the stimulation therapy was withdrawn the number of such breathing pauses increased sharply to  per hour on average from  per hour The episodes of blood oxygen level drops rose to  per hour on average from  per hour That rebound was compelling evidence that this device did something for their sleep apnea said Dr Christine H Won the medical director of the Yale Sleep Center An alternative therapy for patients who cannot or will not use the standard continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP masks diligently would be very valuable Dr Won said The neurostimulator is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration and may only benefit a subset of sleep apnea patients including those with a body mass index of less than  and people whose obstructions stem from airway collapse behind their tongues Only patients who could not or would not use mask therapy participated Experts disagreed on how widely beneficial this kind of stimulation might be Many people have a problem with upper airway dilator muscles so my hunch is this would work in a decent number of them said Dr Atul Malhotra chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of California San Diego who wrote     Dr Lawrence J Epstein a codirector of the sleep medicine clinic at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston said the study showed the success of a relatively novel alternative for a disease that has major health implications But he warned the technology would not be a universal option especially for obese patients When patients stop using the masks they sometimes get   But those surgeries which are associated with substantially more pain at least initially have not been as effective as we would like said Dr Patrick J Strollo the lead author of the new study  The new device doesnt require surgery that reconfigures the airway said Dr Strollo the medical director of the sleep center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Less than  percent of study participants experienced serious adverse events Still more than half reported discomfort from stimulation tongue abrasion incision discomfort and other issues After her chin incision became inflamed after implantation of the neurostimulator in  Jackie Kopplin  who runs a housecleaning business in Coon Rapids Minn was blown up like a basketball and in pain for six weeks I was regretting it at first she said But she now sleeps eight to nine hours at night is not bothered by the tongue thrusting and no longer dozes off while driving As long as she remembers to turn on the stimulator nightly Ms Kopplin said I wake up and I have energy to make it through the whole day Longterm impact of stimulation of the nerve in the jaw called the hypoglossal nerve is not known Dr Malhotra said This is a lifelong disease A year in the grand scheme of things is not very long
