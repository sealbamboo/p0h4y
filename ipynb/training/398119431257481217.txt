Bryan Shaw never expected to write a research paper about a rare eye cancer Hes a   who works on how   But life has a funny way of interrupting the bestlaid plans and now Shaw may be on to a powerful new way to detect   in newborns Such early detection could mean children with the disease would have a better chance of keeping their eyes and staying alive Shaws scientific odyssey begins in May  when he and his wife Elizabeth had a baby boy Noah Bryan was a postdoc at Harvard University at the time When Noah was  months old Elizabeth noticed that sometimes when she took a flash picture of Noah with their digital camera she would see a white reflection come back from his eyes instead of the usual red dot She had read in a parenting magazine that this could be an early sign of retinoblastoma so naturally as a firsttime parent she assumed the worst As husbands are wont to do Bryan assured her she was crazy But on their next visit to the pediatrician the doctor dutifully shined a penlight into Noahs eyes since a white reflection from this simple eye exam can also detect the retinoblastoma tumor The pediatrician didnt like what she saw so she sent the Shaws to an ophthalmologist who confirmed the worst Noah had tumors in both eyes There followed months of chemotherapy radiation and ultimately surgery to remove Noahs right eye  and eventually years of checkups At first Shaw says he was too distraught to think about his sons cancer in scientific terms But one day when Noah was  Bryan was in the waiting room while Noah was getting therapy and he started thinking about the baby pictures that first revealed the tumor He wondered if there was a way to track the disease back to the day the tumors first appeared He started small but ultimately he would end up digitizing thousands of pictures he and Elizabeth had taken of Noah searching for the first sign of   as the whiteeye condition is technically known It first showed up in a picture taken when Noah was  days old says Shaw It didnt appear in all the pictures taken around that time The tumor was small then and the camera angle had to be just right to get the white reflection But by  months there were days when nearly all the pictures showed signs of leukocoria Shaw is now on the faculty of   in Waco Texas He collaborated with the ophthalmologist who treated Noah at the   and Noahs oncologists at Dana Farber Cancer Institute to produce a   in  In addition to pictures of Noah the paper analyzes family photos from eight other children after theyd been diagnosed with retinoblastoma The leukocoria is present in all of them Using the more than  pictures Bryan and Elizabeth have taken of Noah the paper also shows that the amount of leukocoria that the digital cameras can detect increases with the size of his tumor Bryan is hoping to get more pictures from families with a child with retinoblastoma Hes also looking for a collaborator who could write software that would automate the process of scanning photos for leukocoria The disease is rare    That works out to about  case for every  live births Still Bryan thinks a screening test would help with early detection of the cancer and might save the vision of kids like Noah And speaking of Noah hes a hoot His health is good and the cancers seem to have given up He likes to draw and sing and hes anything but shy He has a prosthesis where his right eye used to be which makes him look pretty much like any kid his age And now he has a baby brother Samuel who happily doesnt share his disease
