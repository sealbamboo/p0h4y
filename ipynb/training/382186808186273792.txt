I rarely write about advance directives and endoflife discussions without a few readers asking sometimes plaintively What if you dont have a family The presumption is that everyone has someone available someone most likely younger or in better health and better able to carry out ones wishes or make decisions with your guidance Cheryl from Westchester commented   But not everyone does Ten years ago the American Bar Associations Commission on Law and Aging looked into this problem and cited estimates that perhaps  percent of older adults are the unbefriended elderly a chilling phrase referring to those who cant make decisions for themselves have no advance directive or surrogate decision maker and have no family or friends able to assist Most of those arent computerliterate Times subscribers trying to plan ahead like Cheryl Theyre primarily lifelong loners in hospitals and nursing homes the report found But its an important question If you dont have relatives or close friends who can serve as your health care proxy or hold your power of attorney which in most states involve two separate documents are you supposed to resign yourself to whatever the emergency room physician or intensive care staff member decides to do or not do when you cant direct your own care Even when youve written advance directives someone has to bring those documents to the attention of medical personnel That person may have to become a forceful advocate on an incapacitated patients behalf If not a sibling or nephew a friend or neighbor who can do it One solution Ive discussed before is   A senior recruits a cadre of friends and professionals makes her values and preferences clear and authorizes the committee to handle a variety of eventual decisions Steven M Cohen an elder law lawyer in Boston has organized about  of these I cant say the idea has taken off but for the right person it can work really well he said Though most of his clients havent activated their committees yet  theyre still functioning well on their own  one man with Parkinsons disease has experienced worsening symptoms As his illness has progressed and hes withdrawn the committee is taking more on Mr Cohen said You can also turn to professionals You can appoint almost anyone your health care proxy the exception is that  states plus the District of Columbia place some restrictions on treating health care providers or their employees In some states your cardiologist cant be your health care proxy said Charles Sabatino who heads the   Neither can a nursepractitioner who works in your cardiologists practice or a social worker employed by the nursing home where you live In other states all of the above could be But you can always ask an independent professional a lawyer especially an elder lawyer or a geriatric care manager generally a social worker who specializes in helping seniors manage their care The problem may be finding someone willing to shoulder that task Professionals are hesitant to get involved in this Mr Cohen said You cant make a more intimate choice for someone Its hard enough for families Hell serve as a clients decision maker occasionally if he knows the person well but doesnt welcome the role Many elder lawyers feel that way said Craig Reaves former president of the   Being someones surrogate means being willing to drop everything when a crisis strikes and to continue monitoring when a client is hospitalized or needs longterm care This is not a job for which an attorney can ethically charge a fee that is anything near the attorneys normal hourly rate if any fees are charged at all he said in an email And lawyers being lawyers he worries about liability Mr Reaves has taken on the role at times but I do not seek this job out Geriatric care managers seem a better fit theyre comfortable in hospitals and nursing homes and charge lower hourly rates than lawyers Karen Wasserman director of   part of Jewish Family and Childrens Services in Boston serves as surrogate for a yearold Holocaust survivor with no family and shes starting to see healthy people in their s putting their paperwork together and asking her staff to take that role I dont see it as that big a leap Ms Wasserman said Often its continuing the work we do anyway advocating for our clients whom the staff has often known for years Its often an honor to be there for these people Its part of the deal Yet three of the nine care managers on her staff are uneasy with the responsibility and decline to serve as health care surrogates At   a geriatric care management chain with branches in seven states company rules wont permit the staff to be proxies Somehow it just doesnt feel right to me said Bunni Dybnis director of professional services Of course courts can appoint legal guardians or conservators for incapacitated seniors and guardians  often attorneys or geriatric care managers  can then make decisions on their behalf But most seniors dont want to relinquish their autonomy in that way If youre thinking this all becomes a bit of a muddle I agree Its another way in which our traditional cultural expectations for aging  the Waltonslike family nearby pitching in to provide care and guidance  clash with the reality that more than a million older people may lack available family or friends Extended life spans mean that people may have outlived their relatives and many of them will suffer dementia Given that this situation will likely worsen for the baby boomers  who had fewer children more childless marriages and more divorces  we may see the rise of professionals serving as clients latelife surrogates How individuals will pay for that is another question Meanwhile people trying to plan ahead for aging without family will need detailed advance directives and   as they near the end of life to tell physicians what to do Then theyre also going to need luck in finding a committee or a trustworthy professional willing to take on this daunting responsibility Were in this interim period Mr Cohen said And we dont have good answers for people
