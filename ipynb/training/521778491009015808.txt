Every now and then a play or song or book comes around that perfectly encapsulates the time we live in despite having been created decades or even centuries ago Such is the case with George Bernard Shaws The Doctors Dilemma which was first staged in  and recently wrapped its run at Pasadenas A Noise Within theater The show touches on morality in medicine and on who should be saved and who gets turned away when resources are scarce Here director Dmaso Rodriguez talks to us about the plays current relevance the heart of its story and the reason its being put on now Its a rarely produced George Bernard Shaw play He wrote it as kind of a scathing satire of the medical profession so it has all these references to medical procedures and philosophies that are ripped from the headlines of its day In addition to being scathing though its a compelling story A doctor has been knighted for discovering this cure for tuberculosis and hes doing an experimental test case and being approached by lots of people to take on their cases What it comes down to is he has one slot left and he needs to treat either this very talented young artist or an old friend who is relatively speaking a mediocre doctor The play examines who is worth saving the doctors power and Shaw puts this twist in where the wife of the young artist is extremely beautiful and the doctor has fallen for her so if he lets the artist die he can potentially marry his widow The play was first selected for the season by the artistic director at A Noise Within and offered to me Its extremely timely  surprisingly so  and its not very commonly produced In light of everything thats going on right now in terms of Obamas healthcare plan and the insurance industry the play kind of cant help but reflect that moment in a way Its shockingly relevant It forces you to think about why things are driven by money in large part when it comes to peoples health and lives In this case people are unable to care for themselves and pay for available treatment so one person is going to die You are forced to think about it and talk about it and think about how we came to this place where those kinds of choices are made every day Someone doesnt have insurance and cant get the care they need when its readily available He gets his colleagues together and they are going to evaluate the worth of the individual and that leads to a whole other discussion about the value of lives and who is going to make the most out of life if they are saved What of course happens in the play is that the artist is undeniably brilliant but then you find out that hes a terrible person Hes a bigamist hes in massive amounts of debt hes constantly borrowing money and lives in his own moral code This person who produces art is a bad human  that becomes a true dilemma We consulted with a board member how would someone literally check somebody out in the medical profession There is also a lot of material in the play that tells you about the profession and Shaw was basing everything on personal interactions with friends who were doctors On top of that he wrote a hundredpage preface to the play which was a scathing commentary
