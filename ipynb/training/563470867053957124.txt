The case of a normalweight woman who rapidly became obese after receiving a fecal transplant from an overweight relative has raised new concern over the screening of donated stool The patient who underwent the novel procedure to treat a recurring bacterial infection in her intestines has gained more than  pounds since the transplant and continues to gain weight according to   published Wednesday in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases The patient has been unable to shed the unwanted weight through diet or exercise according to her doctors It remains unclear exactly what caused the dramatic weight gain However the physicians note that studies conducted on mice show that lean mice can become fatter if they receive fecal microbes from overweight mice Were questioning whether there was something in the fecal transplant where some of those good bacteria we transferred may have had an impact on her metabolism in a negative way Kelly said in a prepared statement Viewed for many years as a fringe medical treatment with a high snicker factor fecal transplants have recently shown promise in fighting   infection So called infections cause swelling of the intestines diarrhea and abdominal pain They often occur when the microbes that naturally inhabit the gut are killed by antibiotics and invading   bacteria move in and take over By collecting stool from a healthy donor and placing it within the intestines of a patient good bacteria are reintroduced to the gut and help to restore microbial order In the case of the thenyearold Rhode Island patient doctors treated her   infection with five courses of antibiotics only to see the infection flare up again after each treatment Ultimately she elected to have a fecal transplant As per the patients request her yearold daughter was chosen as the stool donor the doctors wrote At the time of FMT her daughters weight was about  pounds but it increased later to  pounds The patient weighed  pounds at the time of the transplant according to authors and her infection was cured by the procedure However  months later she had gained  pounds raising her body mass index or BMI from  to  She weighed  pounds and had become obese the doctors wrote She has continued to gain weight despite efforts to diet and exercise and at  months postFMT her weight was  pounds BMI  The doctors speculate on a variety of potential causes of the weight gain including the effects of antibiotic treatment stress caused by the illness and the disappearance of the infection Yet based on the fact that the woman was not overweight prior to the procedure as well as the animal studies the researchers said it was now their policy to use only nonobese donors for FMT However they said the case underscored the need to carefully vet stool donors on the basis of BMI and other health indicators Even though some patients might be more open to receiving stool from a family member this could lead to a number of complications the editorial says The published case report raises many questions about the selection of FMT donors wrote Drs Ana Weil and Elizabeth Hohmann FMT has not been studied in largescale controlled trials and we have much to learn about the effects of this treatment beyond the intended restoration of a diverse microbiota they wrote
