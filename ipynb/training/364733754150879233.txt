When it comes to chilies and peppers and other spicy ingredients some people like a little some like a lot and others arent happy unless their tongue is about to spontaneously combust I want  stars says Michael Lillie a yearold medical sales executive from Bellevue Wash I love chilies and lots of garlic I practically want the food on fire when it comes out I may have remedial taste buds so I have to fire the hell out of them just to get them going Then again he could just have a spicy personality A new study presented recently at the  Institute of Food Technologists annual meeting suggests theres a correlation between preferences for spicy food and risktaking personalities In general for an individual who is low sensation seeking as the perceived burning or stinging of a meal increases their liking will drop much more quickly than someone who is a high sensation seeking says Nadia Byrnes a doctoral candidate at Penn State Universitys department of food science  Byrnes says she wasnt surprised that a relationship between spicy food and risk taking existed but was surprised by the clear correlation she and colleagues found The fact that we showed such a strong predictive relationship between liking of spicy foods and a single personality trait was quite shocking she says adding that the findings were much stronger than previous studies that examined personality and food preferences For the study researchers gave nearly  nonsmoking participants ages  to  a test known as Arnetts Inventory of Sensation Seeking AISS to determine their level of risktaking behavior The scale asks questions about how much the individual likes certain sensations such as listening to loud music watching highly suspenseful movies public speaking gambling and standing on the edge of something high and looking down says Byrnes After the behaviors were assessed each subject was then given  micrometers of capsaicin  the active component of chili peppers  dissolved in a glass of water and were asked to swish it around in their mouth for a few seconds like mouthwash After swishing and spitting they were then asked to rate how much they liked spicy meals as the capsaicin went to work  People who scored low on the AISS test quickly expressed a dislike for spicy foods people who scored high were happy as clams  in garlic sauce Dr Alan Hirsch of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago says the correlation between risk taking and spicy food makes total sense to him Theres a longstanding hypothesis that risk takers are adrenaline deficient and that they take risks to get that adrenaline and feel better he says So theyll work with bombs or in other high risk environments and then theyll feel normal Similarly when you eat hot spicy food I gives you a little bit of pain and therefore enhances your adrenaline level How do these findings line up with the spiceloving Lillie If someone says Hey lets go bungee jumping Id go bungee jumping just to try it out he says adding that he also likes roller coasters motorcycles and hopes to go skydiving some day Pat Tanumihardja on the other hand says she doesnt like roller coasters she gets vertigo and has never been hang gliding or sky diving in her life I wouldnt say Im a big risk taker but neither am I always playing it safe says the yearold food writer from Fairfax Virginia I like to do my research first and find out what all my options and alternatives are before I jump in Whats her preference when it comes to spicy meals Im a one to no star person says the author of   A total disgrace to my Indonesian taste buds Byrnes herself admits to being a fiend for wasabi horseradish and mustard  My rule of thumb is if I dont get tunnel vision I need more  but says just because someone likes spicy food it doesnt automatically make them a risk taker I dont think we can say that spicy food lovers are always risk takers since there are always exceptions to the rules she says However it wouldnt be totally off base to guess that someone who enjoys spicy foods would also be someone who would be inclined to enjoy taking certain risks like riding roller coasters Maybe yes maybe no says Tanumihardja who says her mildmannered mother loves to snack on spicy raw chilies  Americans didnt grow up with spice so those who acquire that taste for spice might be risk takers she says But in Asia its part of the culture It doesnt describe the personality or character I think Asia would be a chaotic place if that were the case
