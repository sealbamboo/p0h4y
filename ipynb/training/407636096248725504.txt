Commemorating the th World AIDS Day a day late President Obama announced an initiative Monday to find a cure for HIV infections that would be funded by  million shifted from existing spending The United States should be at the forefront of new discoveries into how to put people into longterm remission without requiring lifelong therapies  or better yet eliminate it completely Obama said at a meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House The initiative reflects a   among scientists that it may be possible to get patients immune systems to control HIV without drugs or even to eliminate the virus from their systems A feat like that seemed impossible not so long ago The moneywill come from expiring AIDS research grants over the next three years the administration said in a   The president also pledged  billion over the next three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria if other countries contribute twice that amount The Global Fund is   this week in Washington with a goal of topping the  billion pledged three years ago And he signed   enacted last month to extend the yearold Presidents Emergency Program for AIDS Relief or   started by President Bush Obama boasted that PEPFAR has exceeded the goal  thought to be ambitious when he    of getting antiHIV treatment to  million people in developing countries Today Im proud to announce that weve not only reached our goal weve exceeded our treatment goal he said Weve helped  million people receive lifesaving treatment and were going to keep at it Obama also noted that the waiting list for treatment under the federalstate   last week fell to zero from a peak of  in the fall of  Apart from that domestic bright spot however a   on how America is doing with its own HIV epidemic reveals only slow progress In a panel discussion following Obamas remarks   of Johns Hopkins University pointed out that when PEPFAR and the Global Fund began AIDS experts were betting it would be easier to combat HIV in targeted populations in America than to get millions of HIVinfected people in subSaharan Africa into treatment But the opposite has happened AfricanAmerican men are about half as likely to have their HIV infection under control as nonHispanic white men Beyrer says And twothirds of new infections are among men who have sex with men The White House report is thin on promising results as one section puts it and heavy on challenges For instance a  National AIDS Strategy set a goal of reducing new HIV infections in this country by  percent But the incidence remains unacceptably high the latest report says And in fact new HIV infections increased  percent among men who have sex with men in the most recent figures   percent among the youngest males from  to  years old The strategy aimed to increase the percent of HIVinfected who know their status to  percent But the most recent figures indicate undiagnosed HIV decreased by only  percent between  and  And fewer than half of those between ages  and  years are aware of their infection When it comes to effective antiHIV treatment fewer than half of Americans at highest risk  men who have sex with men blacks and Latinos  get sufficient antivirals drugs to keep their HIV under control Still theres evidence that concerted efforts to combat HIV can pay off in the most heavily affected places The report cites impressive gains in New York City the District of Columbia and San Francisco All three have made care and treatment very available have ramped up testing and needle exchanges says   policy director of amfAR the American Foundation for AIDS Research When you do that you see infection rates fall For instance when Washington DC increased publicly funded HIV testing from  tests in  to  in  newly diagnosed cases went down by almost half Newly diagnosed cases have also fallen by half in New York City and San Francisco The proportion of HIVtreated people whose virus was suppressed has gone steadily up in New York City especially after the health department recommended that all newly diagnosed patients should be offered antiretroviral treatment By the end of last year nearly  in  were virally suppressed
