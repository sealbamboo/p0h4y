Ebola patients are missing out on basic care that could improve their chances of survival according to a report in the Lancet medical journal  Researchers say organisations are being misled by an inaccurate view that there is no proven treatment for Ebola  They add that patients who could be treated with fluids and electrolytes are dying of dehydration Charities say there are many challenges to giving the intensive fluid replacement that some patients need  Ebola has killed more than  people in the worstaffected areas of Sierra Leone Guinea and Liberia  The virus causes severe vomiting diarrhoea and bleeding  all of which can lead to the profound loss of fluids and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium  When patients are too sick to drink they can be given fluids intravenously  using a drip through a vein  But Prof Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Prof Anders Perner at the University of Copenhagen say these rehydration therapies are being neglected while people focus on potential drugs and vaccines  Prof Roberts told the BBC When the outbreak started people thought there was nothing we could do unless we killed the virus  But it quickly became apparent when people treated in highincome countries didnt all die that ordinary goodquality medical care makes a huge difference There are some simple things  like replacing fluids and electrolytes  that could improve the fatality rate The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres says patients are encouraged to drink but only the sickest patients are given drips as inserting them can leave staff at risk of getting the disease Dr Catherine Hoolihan of Save the Children who is currently working at a treatment centre in Sierra Leone told the BBC Some weaker patients absolutely require intravenous fluids in order to support them but it is a challenging thing to do  There are concerns about the safety of having needles inside wards but we are starting to see that when there are training and facilities in place this can work  We also have challenges of confused patients who wont let you put in drips Others will pull them out And you need people to put up the next bag of fluid This requires greater staffing and patient ratios But it would save more lives   Dr Charlie Weller of the Wellcome Trust said We know intensive fluid therapy can help patients but this requires more staff  The UK and global agencies are calling for more people to help But giving fluids alone will not eradicate Ebola Other therapies and vaccines will also be important right now and for future outbreaks
