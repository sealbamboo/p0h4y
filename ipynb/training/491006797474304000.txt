Cheerful screams squeaks and laughter from children welcome you to Nyumbani Childrens Home located in the verdant suburb of Karen in Kenyas capital Nairobi  Nyumbani is a Swahili word which means home  and home is what more than  children have found here since it was founded in  by Father Angelo DAgostino There are between two and three dozen children in the playground swinging sliding and playing hideandseek in the sandpit which is surrounded by different houses in a wellplanned and landscaped compound  It is hard to tell that all of the children  some as young as two  are living with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV which causes Aids In those early years we were burying a child maybe once twice three times in a month says Sister Mary Owen who now runs the home We have a little graveyard which reminds us of our history  But now we dont have mortality here But it has not been a smooth ride Twenty years ago not much was known about HIV and all the home could provide was quality care for dying children In those early days we cared for them here until their status was confirmed which took about  months says Sister Mary Today we dont accept any child who has not been definitively confirmed HIVpositive because we now have the sixweek test She says Father DAgostino got the first antiretroviral ARV medication for the children in  and that made a huge difference to them  Five years later the home became one of the first beneficiaries of US funding through Pepfar  the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief  But we have a challenge explains Sister Mary Our children have been on antiretroviral medication for over  years and some of them have started to develop resistance to all the drugs we are supplied by Pepfar says Sister Mary That has meant that Nyumbani finds stronger thirdline drugs from abroad for two of its children One of them yearold John not his real name shows me his prescription  nine pills he takes twice a day without fail I want to be a pilot when I grow up he tells me confidently wearing a Wayne Rooney Tshirt But he says Cristiano Ronaldo is his favourite footballer  and he supports Real Madrid not Manchester United John is growing up like a normal teenage boy with passion for sports and a bright vision for his future  Yet it is a future he can only live long enough to see if he continues to get the right medication The major challenge is that these drugs are not supplied by the government so Sister has to source them from outside the country the nurse who works at Nyumbani explains She has to do it early enough so that we dont miss them since its the last option for the child The younger children at the home sometimes have to swallow big bitter and hard pills meant for adults Sister Mary says there are not enough childfriendly ARVs You see in the developed world there are so few children born with HIV that the pharmaceutical companies are not interested in manufacturing because its in the developed world they get their profits not in the developing world So weve been using adult tablets for our children sometimes we have to split them and we even have to open a capsule sometimes Some scientists consider paediatric Aids a neglected disease Researchers from the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative say this may be hard to grasp given that in the  years since the Aids virus was discovered more than  antiretroviral drugs have been approved and many more are in the pipeline However that is not the case for paediatric HIV Children with HIVAids in low and middleincome countries are not considered in the HIV research and development agenda because they are poor and voiceless and do not represent a lucrative market in the traditional sense   Titus Syengo who heads the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation in Kenya feels it would be good if scientists in the developing world could get more involved in such neglected areas Research in the developing world is still in its nascent stage especially for technologies But if governments put enough money into research it can happen The focus at the moment is in preventing transmission of the virus from mother to child and to halt that by   With proper infrastructure and education the strategy has brought great success But the reality in lowincome countries is that literacy levels and access to healthcare remain low and so mothers are still more likely to pass on the virus to their babies And Mr Syengo says lack of lifeprolonging medication has dire consequences If they dont get treatment  of them will die by the age of two and by five years  of them will have died So theres no option but to put them on treatment otherwise youll lose a whole generation The cheerful playing at the orphanage dies down as children return to their houses as evening draws in At six oclock exactly they all queue up to get their lifesaving drugs  the younger ones have their medicine stirred in water and the older ones swallow the pills Sister Mary likes to reflect on how life has improved for the children over the years One of our first boys has a wife now and theyve had their first child and that child is not infected neither is the wife I thank God and I feel so happy for our children our young people now a beaming Sister Mary says
