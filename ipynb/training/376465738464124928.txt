Electronic cigarettes work about as well as nicotine patches in helping smokers kick the habit researchers report And ecigarettes helped people smoke fewer cigarettes overall even if they didnt quit completely The study is the first major piece of research to show that the products which deliver a nicotine mist using a cigaretteshaped pipe can actually benefit smokers The findings published in the Lancet medical journal are not quite enough to make public health experts embrace ecigarettes which are not yet regulated and which are growing in popularity But its enough to make them look more closely at whether there may be some benefit to them Youre trading one addiction for another addiction Dr Cheryl Healton president and CEO of the antitobacco Legacy Foundation told NBC News But it may be that for some people this will be a better way to quit and there may be people whove tried other things and havent been able to quit who will quit with this For the study Chris Bullen of the University of Auckland in New Zealand and colleagues recruited  smokers who wanted to quit They divided them into three groups to get either  weeks supply of ecigarettes nicotine patches or placebo ecigarettes that contained no nicotine After six months  percent of the volunteers had managed to completely quit smoking It was slightly more in the ecigarette group but not in a way that was statistically significant Bullen reported Its very difficult to quit smoking but the ecigarettes also appeared to have helped people cut back on real tobacco Bullens team found that  percent of volunteers given real ecigarettes were smoking half as many cigarettes a day as before compared to  percent of those who got patches  While our results dont show any clearcut differences between ecigarettes and patches in terms of quit success after six months it certainly seems that ecigarettes were more effective in helping smokers who didnt quit to cut down Bullen said in a statement  Its also interesting that the people who took part in our study seemed to be much more enthusiastic about ecigarettes than patches as evidenced by the far greater proportion of people in both of the ecigarette groups who said theyd recommend them to family or friends compared to patches Healton said that was a provocative finding It does also suggest consumer acceptability of the product is higher she said US health officials are very concerned about the rise in popularity of ecigarettes The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration   showing a doubling in the number of high school students who have tried them to  percent More than  percent of adults have tried them at least once but the CDC says they are addictive and may themselves be dangerous We dont know much about them says Dr Tim McAfee director of the CDC Office on Smoking and Health But he says they could potentially be useful if tobacco companies would stop making products like cigarettes and make ecigarettes instead  and if those ecigarettes did indeed turn out to be less harmful than conventional cigarettes Our nirvana is a world where nobody is dying from death and disease caused by tobacco McAfee told NBC News If you have a product that doesnt kill people that is where the money should be going that is where the promotion the marketing should be going They are pricey  an ecigarette product ranges from  to  depending on how many charges it provides And there are dozens if not hundreds of brands FDA says some appear to contain carcinogens and there is some evidence that nicotine is not only addictive but may itself damage health They could have inherent dangers that are greater than using something like gum or the patch Healton said CDC says tobacco is the leading preventable cause of disease disability and death in the United States killing  people a yearÂ  Public health experts are desperate for ways to help people quit smoking but it is hard The American Cancer Society says on any single given try Drugs such as Chantix or Zyban can raise this rate to  percent Theres also counseling nicotine gum and patches hypnosis and acupuncture and companies are working on antinicotine vaccines
