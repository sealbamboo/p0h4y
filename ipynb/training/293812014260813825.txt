 Beta carotene the nutrient that gives red and orange fruits and vegetables their color might lower a persons risk for type  diabetes if they have a certain   Stanford University School of Medicine researchers report in the journal   Meanwhile gamma tocopherol the major form of vitamin E in the American diet could increase a persons risk for type  diabetes the study finds This conclusion doesnt necessarily mean that vitamin E which is most commonly found in   is bad for you researchers caution More research is needed to determine whether beta carotene and vitamin E truly prevent or   or whether they are simply markers for the disease The scientists used what they call a big data approach to reference   risk and blood levels of different nutrients In people with one such predispositioning gene variant researchers saw that beta carotene reduced type  diabetes risk while gamma tocopherol was correlated with risk for the disease Because both nutrients interacted with the same genetic variant researchers also believe this finding paves the way for more study of the specific gene  SLCA Some  percent to  percent of Americans have SLCA which previous research has linked to type  diabetes risk But its just one of  genetic variants associated with an increased risk for the disease In  lead researchers Chirag Patel PhD and Atul Butte MD PhD compared people with or without high blood sugar  a defining marker of type  diabetes  to the two groups exposures to   That analysis found five environmental substances including gamma tocopherol and beta carotene that affected type  diabetes risk Now Patel Butte and their colleagues are conducting mice studies of purified beta carotene and gamma tocopherol to see whether the substances themselves prevent or accelerate type  diabetes Until more research is done its impossible to say whether beta carotene can prevent diabetes But because   and other diseases it cant hurt to eat a few more yelloworange vegetables such as carrots sweet potatoes pumpkin and winter squash
