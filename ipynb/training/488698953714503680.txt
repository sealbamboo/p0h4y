Desmond DSa helped shut down a toxic landfill The landfill was located in South Durban  an industrialized city teeming with petrochemical plants paper mills and oil refineries DSa and his family had been forcibly relocated to the area by the apartheid government in the s together with thousands of other Indian and black South Africans The apartheid government was notorious for forcing nonwhite laborers to live in the industrial areas where they worked In  the landfill  which had operated for nearly  years  was looking to extend its lease Thats when DSa the coordinator of the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance began fighting back Earlier this year he was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for his efforts We asked DSa about his quest to keep his community clean In the early s I was working for the state oil corporation I worked in a chemical plant and I had done safety and risk assessment so I saw the damage to workers and that made me realize that the work we were doing was quite toxic and dangerous and could affect our community as well At night I started to go to the safety research lab to get documents and I would read up and try to understand what was going on with hazardous waste disposal When I confronted management they said We dont need people like you here In  I was fired while I was on holiday Thats when I began working fulltime as an environmental activist They unleashed a monster Carefully documenting everything We brought in health experts and researchers from the Durban University of Technology and from the US We got people in the community to write down the problems they were experiencing We took photos and videos and collected water and air samples and worked with researchers to analyze them Beyond that the key is very simple Work all the time and talk a lot Get up early in the morning and get on the road Talk to people in communities and churches Leave your cellphone on During the apartheid era the government placed toxic landfill sites in poor black communities  it was a common practice Its only after South Africas first democratic elections in  that people realized they can stand up and fight There are a lot of people who are willing to help Theyre in universities and communities Theyre retired people There are lots of people who are ready to pick up their backpack and say lets do this together Even before the attack my wife would sometimes say This community work I dont want to see it at our home Because people used to come by at all times of the day and night Then a few years ago some assailants came and put a petrol bomb under our door The fire came like a huge fireball and I got burned trying to put it out My daughter was affected by the smoke and we both had to go to the hospital My wife was traumatized  completely traumatized  and went to live with her parents I had to put steel gates at the stairway leading to my house Ive never lived with gates in all my life But my wife and I are still together Shes a strong person And now she has moved back in with me The dump used to be a clean nature valley Its now a manmade mountain of waste that stinks every single day Theres an awful rotten smell sometimes you get the benzene smell and youll get a severe headache if you go near the site There are houses right next to it The odors will continue for a few years until the site is properly remediated and closed off But at least no new waste is going in and the trucks that were passing through the community often spilling stuff are no longer there And were continuing to monitor the water and air quality Were fighting against the expansion of the Durban port Expanding the port will lead to displacement of the community and inadvertently ports bring in a lot of social ills like drugs and prostitution Now we have stable communities and small businesses in the area and all that will go if we allow them to develop the port There are also serious environmental concerns around the chameleon and the green frog as well as ecosystems that are unique to this area Its going to be a big fight
