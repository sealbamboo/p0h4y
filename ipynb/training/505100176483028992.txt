The Ebola outbreak has crippled local health systems Its flooded wards with patients killed doctors scared away medical staff and forced some hospitals to shut down entirely Thats the grim assessment of Dr Tom Frieden head of the   whos visiting West Africa this week for a firsthand look at the situation Frieden spoke to Goats and Soda by cell phone as he was traveling by car from the hardhit eastern Sierra Leone city of Kenema back to the capital Freetown Frieden says theres now a vicious cycle around Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia which is amplifying the spread of the disease More cases are leading to less adequate management of each case which is leading to more cases he says That cycle has got to be broken for us to stop this The best hope lies in a new  million plan proposed by the   with the goal of stopping Ebola transmission within nine months The ambitious plan would deploy hundreds of international experts and thousands of local medical staff But first Frieden stresses the money has to be raised Meanwhile the bad news is mounting The number of cases is spiraling upward he says Theres an urgent need to get patients into isolation and start to get better control of the disease But there arent even enough isolation beds for current Ebola patients and the World Health Organization predicts that the outbreak will get far worse before it gets better So far WHO says over  people have been infected with the virus this year and roughly half have died WHO estimates that some  people could fall ill with Ebola before this current outbreak is over This is a threat not just to West Africa and to Africa this is a threat to the world Frieden says emphasizing the need to fund WHOs effort Every day the outbreak continues increases the risk of spread to other countries West African health departments dont have the staff training or equipment to control this disease on their own Frieden says That means the international community must pick up the pace of its response to the crisis Literally every day that we dont make more progress controlling the outbreak Frieden says is another day that the outbreak will not just continue  but grow much larger
