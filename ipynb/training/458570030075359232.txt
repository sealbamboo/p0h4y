Determined to get herself on the right track Henson signed up at the gym while it was still under construction  It was March  Henson was foot and  pounds She knew that her poor diet and inactivity were not the path to a long healthy life She didnt suffer from any serious health problems but her parents and three brothers were all diabetic so she knew the potential consequences  Henson  is very close with her family Loved ones especially her mom would often approach her with concerns about her health telling her she should lose weight I think the older I got the more concerned my mom became because she knew she wouldnt be there to take care of me Henson says She was my No  supporter on my plan to exercise and lose weight In the past Henson would put herself on diets to make everyone happy but they wouldnt last long There was an endless array of rules from eating nothing but grapefruits to nothing but carbs until she realized that diets just werent for her For me diet is a fourletter word for failure she said What she was looking for was a lifestyle change And not because her friends and family wanted it for her but because she wanted it for herself With Anytime Fitness hours Henson had no trouble finding time to work out She goes to the gym every day after work for anywhere from  minutes to an hour She even created a mantra I have a desire to work out I keep a determination to work out I created a discipline to work out and I choose to work out What she struggled with most was changing her eating habits  She started by cutting out soft drinks and dropped  pounds in the first month  Her mom known as Mama Henson to many of Hensons friends cheered her on daily and was excited to see her daughter start to adopt a healthier lifestyle Every day she would ask me How much you lose today I would laugh and say Mom I cant lose every day But she would tell me that I was trying and thats all that matters said Henson After cutting out soda Henson started making healthier food choices  She continued to eat at fast food restaurants because it was convenient switching out fried chicken for grilled a side of fries for a side salad By December  Henson was down  pounds and healthier than ever Unfortunately her moms health was deteriorating Mama Henson had suffered several seizures and ministrokes that severely weakened her  Hensons healthier lifestyle would help provide the mental and physical strength she would need in the final months caring for her mother  Two months before her mother died Henson remembers walking into the house after a workout She had lost  pounds at this point Her mother looked up at her and said Youre pretty We both just started crying Henson said I dont have a clue why she said it it was a memorable moment Mama Henson passed away in August   Whenever Henson loses sight of why shes working out or skipping sweets she thinks of her moms smile and how much she wanted her daughter to be happy I knew she was proud of me for losing the weight Henson said I know she felt I was going to be OK now that I had lost the weight In the past year Henson has made even more changes to her diet She has started to eat products like quinoa whole wheat bread and fresh vegetables  There was a time when you couldnt have gotten broccoli anywhere near me But now she roasts it and includes it in her meals for the week She cooks in bulk on the weekends freezing meals in individual containers for during the week so she knows exactly how many calories shes eating She aims to eat  calories a day In less than three years Henson has lost  pounds or  of her body weight  On March  she celebrated the threeyear anniversary of her first step into Anytime Fitness  Losing the weight has helped her find an inner strength It allows her to see a glimpse of the strong accomplished woman her mother always saw One of Hensons passions has been participating in K walks for charity Since she started working out three years ago she has participated in five walks and recently finished one in  minutes her personal best Hensons transformation has been so complete that her doctor who has been monitoring her progress since she started losing weight uses her pictures to show patients what a little determination can do The smallest of changes one can make in their present lifestyle can garner big changes Henson said not only in the physical body but in the mind
