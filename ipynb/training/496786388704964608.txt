A Japanese scientist involved in a scandal over discredited stem cell research has been found dead at his laboratory in an apparent suicide Prof Yoshiki Sasai  was cleared of direct misconduct by an investigation but faced criticism for his oversight Scientists around the world have expressed regret at losing a renowned researcher and concern at the witchhunt that followed the revelations The president of RIKEN where he worked said Sasai was irreplaceable The yearold professor well known for his work turning stem cells into other types of cells like eye and brain tissue was found by a security guard at RIKENs Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe western Japan  Prof Sasai the centres deputy chief was widely respected in the scientific community But earlier this year two studies that he supervised caused controversy after other scientists failed to replicate the results The two papers both published in the journal Nature in January  had suggested that stem cells could be produced from normal adult cells by dipping them into acid for a minute shock period  These STAP cells stimulustriggered acquisition of pluripotency held great promise for both developmental biology and medical science But the   were too good to be true attracting scepticism and eventually claims of scientific fraud The work was investigated by RIKEN and   in July amid concern that some of the results had been fabricated Although the studys first author Dr Haruko Obokata was   Prof Sasai was cleared of direct involvement  He was criticised however for his supervision of Dr Obokata and for not spotting inconsistencies in the publications Prof Sasai had said he was deeply ashamed of the problems in the papers and regretful of his role in the scandal Many of his scientific colleagues have expressed their regret and called for more reasonable discussion of irregular results  Others have noted the damaging effect of the fierce competition that pervades science heaping pressure on both junior and senior researchers  Prof Robin LovellBadge a stem cell researcher from the National Institute for Medical Research described Prof Sasai as an excellent scientist who made some fundamental discoveries adding that he had played a central role in establishing the world class reputation of the RIKEN institute We will never know quite how he got ensnared into the whole story about STAP stem cells and for some reason wasnt his usual cautious self Prof LovellBadge told the BBC Maybe some lessons can come from this  that you have to be a little bit more proportionate in the way these things are dealt with Natures editorinchief Dr Phil Campbell said This is a true tragedy for science and an immense loss to the research community Included in the legacy Sasai leaves behind is a clinical trial   which draws on some of his work It is testing the safety of a stemcell based treatment for macular degeneration a severe eye disease
