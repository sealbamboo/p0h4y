Thats a scant  years  although the clock gave it to me in seconds left to live At the time it was   and counting down Old enough not to believe everything I read on the Web I queried my doctor about my expected longevity He quickly emailed back All things being equal I believe your estimated survival time would be around  to  Good luck Good luck I spent a few moments processing the possible meanings behind good luck none of them particularly appealing realizing my good doctor had pretty much corroborated the Death Clocks calculation then sat there feeling sorry for myself imagining the hourglass emptying Then not allowing myself to wallow one grain of sand longer I decided to quit my day job Yes just like that Call me crazy I worked as an editor and ironically my soontobeformer boss had once given me a copy of Malcolm Gladwells   suggesting I needed to act more on impulse than rationality I had previously underlined this particular section Decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately Id long been toying with  even planning for  the day Id quit But so many fears had stood in my way starting with the most basic dollars and cents Yes my partner and I had downsized Yes Id been squirreling away a rainyday fund And yes  and most significantly  Id been talking regularly with my therapist not just about quitting but about how to live a truly meaningful life I knew it wasnt sleeping my way through the workdays to get to the weekend  Now a new fear  the ticktock of the clock  squashed the pecuniary one and the decision to leave my job seemed like a Gladwell nobrainer  Anyway my plan wasnt to spend the rest of my life traveling the world First of all that rainyday fund isnt that big And as short as  years sounds thats a heck of a lot of days and weeks and yes seconds not to fritter away Rather my plan was to do what Id been doing in bits and pieces in between jobs on vacations before the work day and after hours Be a fulltime writer Fortunately I had some role models in making this leap My friend Peter  a documentarian had left his fulltime job  months earlier to take what he then called a sabbatical to write a play He explained to me I realized it was a myth to think there would be a time when I dont have any financial worries If not now when He then added that his yearold best friend who died of a malignant brain tumor was a very real accelerator of my decision Similarly my friend Tom  told me over coffee hed come to the realization I only have so many years left A photographer and writer hed recently stepped down from a university directorship after watching two of his closest friends die guys that I thought were bulletproof he explained I want to quit talking about doing my own work  and do my own work  The week after getting my doctors good luck email I gave notice I told a good story but what I didnt say was this Ive got only one life to live and if I dont do it now when I couldnt sleep the next few nights the loud echoes of my naysayers circling through my head But over the weeks that followed things began to shift I started to get new assignments and finished up a book proposal Id get up at  am as excited as a kid on Christmas morning I felt a new sense of ownership joy and meaning to my days This wasnt my work it was my life And I didnt just like it  I loved it   Of course I know I wont spend the rest of my days in this state of euphoria I will struggle with blank pages and intermittent paychecks But I will appreciate each day more I understand now what my friend Tom was telling me when he sent me a short passage from Wendell Berrys novel Jayber Crow in which the namesake main character reflects on the passage of time Back at the beginning as I see now my life was all time and almost no memory  And now nearing the end I see that my life is almost entirely memory and very little time I know too well the feeling that my life is now more memory than future As I finish these pages I see that my clock is down two million seconds from when I started Call me crazy but I have to say I love the ticktock of the Death Clock Without it I might not be living
