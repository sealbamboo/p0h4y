Getting young healthy people to sign up for health insurance is seen as critical to the success of the Affordable Care Act Its precisely those   of the older sicker ones But while cheap health insurance and subsidies based on income are intended to make the program appealing to the young what if they havent even heard of the health care law Or dont want to buy even an inexpensive policy To find out I needed to find groups of those young healthy people I live in Hollywood so where better to look than a casting agency I met Matt Rife a comic at the Cazt agencys open call for a comedy show Rife  works at comedy clubs and doesnt have health insurance But he does need it he says Like if I get hurt Im kind of screwed he says If I get sick Im on my own  Im down to some ibuprofen and some cough drops and thats about it Rife says he and his friends dont talk much about health care because it seems like a distant political thing that doesnt have much to do with them Were worried about it but not like Oh we gotta get this today or were going to be in trouble you know If something did happen Rife says having insurance would be nice But he admits hed like to buy a car first Blake Sheldon  is also here for an audition He works at a sandwich shop when not looking for acting gigs and is uninsured He hasnt thought much about the Affordable Care Act he says What I do know is that it doesnt seem too easy right now at least from my understanding Sheldon says And so with you know all the other stuff going on in my life moving out here  I dont know I guess I just havent done that much research into it In fact a lot of the young people that I talked to didnt seem aware of the Affordable Care Act and how it related to them in any great detail  though there have been   to   Carrie Prince  is a freelance production assistant for a major Hollywood studio And while she works more than  hours a week she doesnt get insurance from her employer Shes going to buy coverage she says but shes torn about it It will make me broke all the time she says Its basically taking every last dollar that I would have to spend on extra food or a parking ticket or anything Prince says shes gone to   and calculated that with a subsidy she would have to pay just over  per month  I am superhealthy I rarely go to the doctor So to pay over  a month for something I rarely use seems crazy to me she says Over at The Bar Method a small health club in Long Beach Calif Aubrey CastleSaunders teaches a workout thats a cross between Pilates yoga and s aerobics Shes  and doesnt have health insurance right now Up until last year she says she would rather have paid a penalty than buy coverage Shes healthy and takes care of herself she figured But then she got kidney stones And it was completely out of the blue and the bill was astronomical she says  and the pain was unbearable too That was a wakeup call CastleSaunders says Shes gone to HealthCaregov to look at the plans but even now shes not  percent sure shes going to enroll I really do want to sign up And I most likely will she says But its just kind of like oh God OK I have to put  that money out there So I really am dragging my feet The administration cant afford much of that feet dragging however  it needs millions more like CastleSaunders to sign up
