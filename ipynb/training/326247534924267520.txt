One recent morning Evelyne Lois Such was sitting at her kitchen table in Denver when the phone rang Such whos  didnt recognize the phone number or the deep voice on the other end of the line He asked Are you a senior and I said yes and he said Well we are sending out all new Medicare cards and I want to make sure I have all your statistics just correct  Such recalls At first the caller didnt seem too fishy He started by running through her address and phone number just to make sure they were right But then he read off a series of numbers and asked if it was her bank routing number I didnt know really at the time whether it was or not but I just said no she says The man pressed her for the number Well could you give it to me so Ill have it correctly she recalls him saying She hesitated then hung up When the scammer called her a second time she hung up immediately scribbled down the number from her caller ID and dialed Medicare to report him I kind of thought it was funny at first and then I thought you know how dare they Such says There are some seniors who arent well and dont think as well as they used to and it just made me angry that they would be victimized like that Law enforcement agencies are reporting an increase in   across the country Many of the fraudsters seem to be   the publics confusion over the massive changes taking place in the nations health care system Seniors are    theyre more likely to be home to answer the phone and they tend to have retirement savings that scammers hope to tap But they arent the only victims The federal government received nearly   of these types of scams last year  up  percent from the year before America is rife with health scams says James Quiggle communications director at the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud in Washington DC Crooks are offering fake health coverage strippeddown policies masquerading as real coverage Theyre also selling what  theyre lying  is fake Obamacare coverage he explains Recent   have found that well over half of Americans say they still dont understand how the new health law will affect them Crooks are playing on that confusion Confusion is a crooks best friend says Quiggle Fraudsters are as attuned to whats going on in the news as anybody else says Lois Greisman who runs the division of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission Before Katrina hit land websites were up soliciting funds to help victims of Katrina This is not a surprise this is par for the course A program as vast as the health care overhaul makes for a dangerous twist on the regular scams she adds Greisman and her team are working to take down health care scams as quickly as possible but there are an endless number of them Scammers range from just your average amateur looking to make a quick buck to wellorganized crime rings that massproduce fraud The first line of defense is dont take a call from out of the blue from anyone whos offering to help you navigate the new health care market cautions Greisman Those kinds of cold calls just shouldnt take place  same thing with an unsolicited email an unsolicited text Many people see through those sorts of simple scams says Sally Hurme an elder law attorney at AARP But even if one in a thousand falls for the scam and gives up info or agrees to send information off to who knows where theyve made the scammers day Thats what their job is says Hurme As the Affordable Care Act ramps up the country is likely to see more frequent insurance scams and theyre likely to get more sophisticated she adds Savvy senior Evelyne Lois Such offers this advice for others who get a suspicious call Dont answer too quickly think about the answer you give them and what theyre asking And never give any personal or financial information over the phone Better yet Just hang up
