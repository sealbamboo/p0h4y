Federal officials on Tuesday   for the first time that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and young children eat a minimum of two servings of lowmercury seafood every week for their health  represent a significant shift for the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency whose previous seafood advisory in  set only an upper limit on the amount of fish that these groups should eat The proposed advisory which will enter a public commenting period recommends a weekly limit of  ounces  or about three servings  of lowmercury seafood like salmon shrimp cod tilapia and light canned tuna for the women But unlike the last advisory it now encourages a minimum of two servings or about eight ounces which was prompted by an FDA analysis that found that one in five pregnant women in the United States ate little or no fish at all Dr Stephen Ostroff the FDAs acting chief scientist said the agency was concerned that pregnant and nursing women were missing out on the benefits of eating fish He cited studies showing that children born to women who consume fish have higher IQs and better cognitive development than children born to women who do not A large percentage of women are simply not eating enough fish and as a result they are not getting the developmental and health benefits that fish can provide he said Studies very consistently demonstrate that among women who consumed more fish during pregnancy  or at least the amounts were currently recommending  that there were improvements in children Dr Ostroff said the advisory did not pertain to supplements like fish oil that contain omega fatty acids but lack a wide variety of other nutrients typically found in seafood We dont believe women would accrue the same benefits in terms of health and development if they were to use supplements in place of fish he said The FDA is also recommending that young children eat a weekly minimum of two fish servings the size of which would vary depending on their age and weight Some environmental groups criticized the new recommendations Michael Bender the executive director of the Mercury Policy Project one of two advocacy groups that   this year demanding that it post warning labels about mercury content on packaged fish said he was particularly concerned about tuna consumption He said Americans get about a third of their methyl mercury exposure from tuna and he argued that the FDA should discourage pregnant and nursing women from eating it The latest advisory discourages pregnant and nursing women and young children from eating four highmercury fish shark swordfish king mackerel and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico The FDA said orange roughy and marlin might be added to that list in the future As for tuna the advisory lists the canned light variety as a lowmercury option It recommends a limit of six ounces a week on albacore tuna because it has more mercury than canned light tuna Dr Ostroff said tuna was not a problem as long as women did not eat it to the exclusion of lowmercury fish The health benefits that accrue from the consumption of fish far outweigh any risks he said Some doctors said the new advisory did not go far enough in encouraging greater fish consumption among pregnant women By setting an upper limit on the amount of fish that should be consumed the federal advisory has scared many women away from eating any fish at all said Dr Roger B Newman the director of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the Medical University of South Carolina and a member of the Perinatal Nutrition Working Group which promotes seafood consumption among pregnant and breastfeeding women Dr Newman said that many women in his clinical practice vowed to stop eating fish after the last advisory in  because they were concerned or confused by the recommendations They didnt know exactly what was wrong with fish he said but they had heard that it was bad Dr Newman said he told pregnant patients not to worry about restricting themselves to  ounces of fish weekly as long as they were eating lowmercury varieties He said there were many epidemiological studies suggesting that children born to women who ate fish while pregnant have higher IQs and better behavioral development One large study of thousands of mothers and their children   for example suggested that pregnant women needed to eat a minimum of about three servings of fish per week to get the benefits for child development Seafood has multiple nutritional benefits to pregnant women to developing fetuses and to young children Dr Newman said Im disappointed in the recommendations But I do think theyre a step in the right direction
