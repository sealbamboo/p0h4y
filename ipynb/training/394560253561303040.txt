A clearer picture of what causes Alzheimers disease is emerging after the largest ever analysis of patients DNA A massive international collaboration has now doubled the number of genes linked to the dementia to  The findings   indicate a strong role for the immune system Alzheimers Research UK said the findings could significantly enhance understanding of the disease  The number of people developing Alzheimers is growing around the world as people live longer  However major questions around what causes the dementia how brain cells die how to treat it or even diagnose it remain unanswered It is really difficult to treat a disease when you do not understand what causes it one of the lead researchers Prof Julie Williams from Cardiff University said The genetic code the instructions for building and running the body was scoured for clues  A group  involving nearly three quarters of the worlds Alzheimers geneticists from  academic institutions  looked at the DNA of  patients and  healthy people They found versions of  genes or sets of instructions which made it more likely that a person would develop Alzheimers disease They do not guarantee Alzheimers will develop but they do make the disease more likely By looking at the genes function in the body it allows researchers to figure out the processes going wrong in Alzheimers disease  Prof Williams the head of neurodegeneration at Cardiff University told the BBC Weve doubled the number of genes discovered and a very strong pattern is emerging  There is something in the immune response which is causing Alzheimers disease and we need to look at that The way the body deals with cholesterol and the way cells in the brain deal with big molecules in a process called endocytosis also seem to be involved It now needs other research groups to pick up on the findings work out exactly what is going wrong and develop treatments This could include drugs genetic therapies or changes to lifestyle  Dr Eric Karran the director of research at Alzheimers Research UK said By mapping the genetics of the most common lateonset form of Alzheimers these findings highlight new biological processes that could significantly advance our understanding of this devastating disease  While this new discovery holds real potential the true value will come from pinpointing the exact genes involved how they contribute to Alzheimers and how this could be translated into benefits for people living with the disease  Dr James Pickett head of research at the Alzheimers Society said This exciting discovery of genes linked with Alzheimers disease opens up new avenues to explore in the search for treatments for the condition  We now need continued global investment into dementia research to understand exactly how these genes affect the disease process
