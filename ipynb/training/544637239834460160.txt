 Feeling sad or stressed Put down that Oreo or bowl of mac n cheese and brace yourself for another bummer The emotional healing powers of comfort food may be overrated True your mood will probably improve shortly after you eat your favorite highcarb hug but no more so than if youd eaten a granola bar  a pleasant enough choice but hardly a fixture in that calorically elevated comfort food category In a study   researchers at the University of Minnesota found that even when you dont soothe yourself with food your mood will probably bounce back on its own People have this belief that highcalorie foods are the path out of difficult feelings said Kelly D Brownell dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke who studies   and behavior and was not involved in this research But the assignment of the word comfort to these foods implies there is a relationship between comfort and food that may not exist Comfort food is usually defined as food that gives distinctive pleasure  or makes you feel better when youre low Ones comfort food steeped in ritual memory and taste is highly personal Women often choose sweets   but there are many exceptions just as it is true that not everyones favorite comfort food is high in fat Though the celerystalkascomfortfood fan club is decidedly underpopulated The Minnesota research was funded by NASA in hopes of improving the mood of astronauts on space missions Astronauts tend to lose weight in space where the work demands are stressful and the food quality less than stellar Traci Mann a psychology professor and the studys lead researcher wanted to know whether giving people comfort food would boost their mood a finding that might help astronauts during a long taxing voyage to Mars For the study  subjects took a food survey in which they were asked to pick three foods that would make them feel better if they were in a bad mood The term comfort food intentionally was not used The subjects also identified foods they liked but that they believed would not affect their mood Then to induce feelings of anger sadness and anxiety researchers compiled  minutes of scenes from feelbad movies like Sophies Choice Armageddon and The Hurt Locker After watching the videos the subjects took a mood questionnaire They generally all reported feeling awful In fact several participants were so upset that they quit the study Next some subjects were served tripleportionsized helpings of a comfort food Others were given a food they liked but didnt consider a mood booster typically almonds cashews or popcorn and some were given the neutrally rated granola bar Some werent given any food Over the many weeks that the trial was underway the lab exuded intoxicating aromas as researchers made scrupulous efforts to ply subjects with their chosen comfort food Researchers baked brownies heated apple pies and topped them with ice cream and prepared mac n cheese studentpreferred box brands not from scratch The food was distributed under the guise of thanking subjects for their time As a result one popular comfort food wasnt offered It would have looked weird to say Thank you for being in our study heres a bowl of mashed potatoesÂ  Dr Mann said Three minutes later the subjects took another mood questionnaire While they all felt better there was no appreciable difference among the groups who ate comfort food other foods or no food at all Although   that eating food high in fat sugar or salt activates the brains reward system Nicole M Avena a neuroscientist and assistant professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who writes about   said in an email that the Minnesota study suggested that such neural response may not translate into measurable   Dr Avena said it would be interesting to see whether these results would hold up in studies of subjects who are obese or regularly eat comfort foods Elissa Epel a professor at the University of California San Francisco noted that there is a lot of individuality in how people are conditioned to respond to pleasing foods But even if the food helps with mood the effect is transient shorter than the effect of the dense calories in our body The study had limitations not least because the negative mood was induced in a laboratory The comfort food theory was not roadtested for example on hardcore denizens of Heartbreak Hotel Larry Christensen a psychology professor at the University of South Alabama who writes about food cravings pointed out that the subjects bad moods were shortlived People who seek food to comfort themselves he added usually have felt low for much longer Dr Mann said the studys findings helped demystify the belief that comfort food is uniquely comforting Lets not say were allowed to eat something because it will make us feel better about whatever were suffering she said People are looking for a justification to eat something unhealthy Just eat the ice cream Its not magical But it is yummy
