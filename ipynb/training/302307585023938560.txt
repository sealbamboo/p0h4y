 The more TV children watch before bedtime the less sleep they get researchers found In a crosssectional sample of children and teens from New Zealand roughly  minutes of the  minutes before participants went to sleep each night were spent in sedentary screentime TV video games computers according to Louise Foley PhD of the University of Auckland in New Zealand and colleagues Those who spent the most time in front of a screen were more likely to go to sleep later than those who were engaged in nonscreen sedentary activities before bed they wrote online in  Sleep duration in younger people has declined rapidly over the past  years they noted adding that   is associated with behavior and health issues in this younger population Although they cautioned that causality could not be inferred from their crosssectional study they added that teens and childrens presleep time in front of a video screen may be implicated through disrupting or displacing sleep To investigate associations between activities children and teens engage in  minutes before sleep and time to sleep onset the researchers used data from a nationally representative crosssectional survey of New Zealand children and teens ages  to  Participants were interviewed inperson and then followup was done through telephone interviews between September  and May  Baseline facetoface interviews gathered information on participant characteristics and  to  days of data on use of presleep time The followup gathered  additional days of data Younger childrens parents would assist with recalling activities when necessary Participants reported time of sleep onset sedentary behavior physical activity and self care during the  minutes before sleep by selecting from a list of roughly  activities Activities were given energy costs and psychometric properties and were recounted with time spent engaged in each activity Times of sleep onset were categorized as very early early late and very late Participants were grouped by ages  to  and  to  A total of  survey participants were included in the current analysis The mean age was  just over half were male  percent and most were of New Zealand European ethnicity  percent Overall younger participants went to bed earlier than older ones The most common activities before bed were watching television while sitting  percent dressingundressing before bed  percent and brushing ones teeth  percent and all were considered lowintensity activities metabolic equivalents ranging from  to  In New Zealand a maximum of hours of screen time per day is recommended for young people the authors noted adding that the roughly half hour of screen time before bed accounted for one quarter of a childs daily recommended screen time They also found that participants who reported later sleep onset also reported up to  more minutes of screen time before bed than those who went to bed earlier Additionally early sleep onset was associated with significantly less time in screenbased sedentary activity versus later sleep onset Differences in screen time differed by  to  minutes between early and late sleep onset groups Those who went to bed earlier also spent more time engaged in nonscreen sedentary behaviors although differences between late and early sleepers varied by clinically nonsignificant  to  minutes for these activities The largest mean time differences between those of early and late sleep onset were for screen time which suggests that this set of activities may be an appropriate target for interventions to promote earlier sleep onset and subsequently improve sleep duration in young people Foley and colleagues concluded The authors found their research may be limited by a  percent nonparticipation rate and biases associated with selfreported data Source
