By the current blood test for vitamin D most AfricanAmericans are deficient That can lead to weak bones So many doctors prescribe supplement pills to bring their levels up But the problem is with the test not the patients according to a new   The vast majority of AfricanAmericans have plenty of the form of   that counts  the type their cells can readily use The research resolves a longstanding paradox The population in the United States with the best bone health happens to be the AfricanAmerican population says   a professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study But almost  percent of these individuals are defined as having vitamin D deficiency This was perplexing The origin of this paradox is a fascinating tale of genes interacting with geography More on that later To unravel the mystery Thadhani and his colleagues looked closely at various forms of vitamin D in the blood of  Baltimore residents black and white They focused on a form of the vitamin called   which makes up most of the vitamin circulating in the blood Its the form that the standard test measures The hydroxy form is tightly bound to a protein and as a result bone cells immune cells and other tissues that need vitamin D cant take it up It has to be converted by the kidneys into a form called   For Caucasians blood levels of hydroxyvitamin D are a pretty good proxy for how much of the bioavailable vitamin they have But not for blacks Thats because blacks have only a quarter to a third as much of the binding protein Thadhani says So the blood test for the hydroxy form is misleading His study finds that because of those lower levels of the protein blacks still have enough of the bioavailable vitamin which explains why their bones look strong even though the usual blood tests say they shouldnt The conclusion from this study is that just because your total levels are low it doesnt mean we need to replace vitamin D using supplements Thadhani says The study was published Wednesday in the  The reason people of African descent have far less proteinbound vitamin D is probably related to the geographic origins of the human race Our earliest ancestors lived near the equator in Africa where sunlight was plentiful and intense yearround Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when sunlight strikes it When sunlight is deficient the vitamin has to come from   such as eggs and fish oil Humans living in sunny climates make plenty of vitamin D on their own In fact one reason for the high degree of skin pigmentation in people of African descent is to prevent the synthesis of  vitamin D which can be toxic Early humans didnt need to store up reserves of vitamin D so they didnt need as much of the binding protein whose function is to squirrel the vitamin away in a form where it can be used later Everyone who came out of Africa had the ancestral genotype associated with lower vitamin Dbinding proteins Thadhani says When humans moved to areas with less sunlight a different genotype evolved The further north they went the more people needed reserves of vitamin D So Dbinding protein levels went up And that genetic difference in vitamin Dbinding proteins is what researchers have finally figured out  a leading authority on vitamin D at Boston University Medical School tells Shots that the new research is prompting him to resurrect blood samples from earlier studies to figure out whether the ill effects of low vitamin D in AfricanAmericans and Caucasians are related to low levels of the bioavailable form or the proteinbound form While the effect of vitamin D on bone health is undisputed Holick says theres a lot of controversy about the vitamins effect on hypertension diabetes cancer and infectious diseases Meanwhile Holick who wrote an   in the journal accompanying Thadhanis study intends to keep giving his AfricanAmerican patients vitamin D supplements when their blood levels of hydroxyvitamin D are low even though they may not need the pills to maintain strong bones Theres no downside to supplementation so its not a big deal Holick says But Thadhani says doctors should hold off on prescribing vitamin D until they do other tests to determine whether their AfricanAmerican patients are really vitamin D deficient Those tests include blood levels of     and   levels There is currently no approved test for the bioavailable dihydroxyvitamin D although Thadhani and his colleagues are working on one and have filed for a patent He says he used to take vitamin D supplements until I realized there are genetic differences then I stopped Ive looked at my bioavailable levels of vitamin D Now Im comforted to know that Im not deficient
