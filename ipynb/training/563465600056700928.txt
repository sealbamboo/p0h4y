And yet just telling parents they should vaccinate and why they should vaccinate is unlikely to do the trick said a number of doctors I interviewed The problem is not as simple as just saying lets educate people because I think a lot of these parents have seen the data have seen the science and yet they still dont want to vaccinate said Dr Celine Gounder an infectious diseases and public health specialist Gounder said some people just dont believe they could be at risk Theres this idea were healthy weve always been healthy were a healthy family so that the idea you would be at risk for a disease  theyre kind of resistant to that Most antivaxxers arent necessarily antivaccine said  director of the   at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia They share more of a vaccinehesitant sentiment which is not surprising he said Children are expected to get more than  inoculations during their first few years of life with as many as five shots at one time to prevent disease that most people dont see using biological fluids most people dont understand said Offit who is also professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Some of those people are looking for a reason not to vaccinate and the Internet and some celebrities and now politicians are perfectly willing to provide them that information that says OK good its OK not to vaccinate because vaccines really arent as safe as theyre claimed to be   So what can be done to persuade them to vaccinate their kids an educational psychologist with over  years experience in the school system thinks ultimately the only way to get people to vaccinate might be to force the issue That would be by removing the personal and religious exemptions that allow parents not to vaccinate and still send their children to public and private schools In  states and the District of Columbia parents can request religious exemptions from vaccines and  states allow philosophical exemptions  Two states Mississippi and West Virginia limit vaccine exemptions to children who cant be vaccinated for medical reasons such as having compromised immune systems Everyone else needs to have their vaccinations or they cant attend school We legislate that children have to ride in car seats and wear seat belts thats for their own safety and so there are all kinds of things that we do legislate about safety said Day who is also the author of a book on motherdaughter book clubs called  I think that its going to take rules like what they have for other safety issues Changing the way we talk about the issue online and in real life injecting more understanding into the discussions could also help Day said The shaming and the anger and the youre dumb kind of stuff that people are doing isnt working she said I think it is making people dig in more and it seems to me what has to happen is a different type of dialogue that is a little bit more empathetic and more listening and more saying I understand how you feel and that this is scary   associate professor of epidemiology at Kent State University  said psychological studies have shown that when medical professionals tell people what they should do and pull out the science to back up their opinions that doesnt necessarily move people who are skeptical about vaccines and in some cases makes them more firmly antivaccine So thats kind of our conundrum right now is how to best display and describe the science thats out there without making people dig in even further to their antivaccine views said Smith who also leads an emerging infections laboratory at Kent State As weve reported previously medical experts say talking parent to parent definitely helps with doctors who are parents expressing that they understand how other parents want to protect their children more than anything else and then sharing why they believe vaccinating their kids is the best way to keep them safe I sort of hate these false dichomoties of  Ill go with the parent instead of the public health professional  said Offit of Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Public health professionals are parents doctors are parents pharmaceutical company workers are parents so I think you have to establish the fact that you all are on the same side But what might move the needle more than anything else is when more and more people get diseases such as measles and when we see what those diseases can do We in public health we talk a lot about how public health is often invisible You dont think about what it does until you see an outbreak of disease said Smith So I think its those breakthrough disease outbreaks like were seeing now that do bring parents back to realizing  in  kids with measles could die and several get measles encephalitis and pneumonia so they realize  just how deadly and how serious it can be
