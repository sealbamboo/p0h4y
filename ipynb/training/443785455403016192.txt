 An ingenious new study of marathon runners and their nonrunning spouses should reassure anyone headed for a spring marathon that  prolonged training doesnt damage the heart a concern that has been raised in previous research At the same time becoming fit as a marathoner doesnt seem to protect the heart to the extent you might expect although it may have unexpected benefits for your spouse  While we all know that exercise is healthy some   about whether its possible to overdo a good thing A few studies have found that longtime endurance athletes can have a heightened risk for abnormal heartbeats and   Likewise experiments with lab animals have found possible links between prolonged extremely strenuous running and undesirable changes in the structure and function of the heart    But the actual incidence of runners having a heart attack during a marathon race   a finding that seems to suggest that marathon training cant be excessively hard on hearts or there would be greater obvious consequences   Such inconsistencies in the data about prolonged endurance exercise and heart health prompted researchers to wonder if perhaps past studies had been too imprecise Its difficult to isolate the risks associated with strenuous exercise from other lifestyle factors said Beth Taylor an assistant professor in the health sciences department at the University of Hartford who led the new study which was   Runners whose hearts seemed to have been affected by their exercise habits might also have smoked gorged on junk food or otherwise imperiled their hearts separately from how much they worked out  So Dr Taylor and her colleagues decided to better control for such factors by studying marathon runners along with their domestic partners who presumably would be sharing their lifestyles if not their physical exertions If cardiac health differed among these couples the scientists felt they could reasonably conclude that training had played a role since so many lifestyle factors would be the same  With that idea in mind Dr Taylor and her colleagues contacted a slew of runners who had qualified and signed up for the  Boston Marathon inquired if they had nonrunning spouses or partners and asked if both would be willing to have their hearts scanned and cardiovascular disease risk assessed  Fortytwo of the runners said yes along with their spouses or partners Half of the runners were women Their ages ranged from  to  although most were in their mid to late s Their partners were around the same age but considerably less active averaging fewer than two sessions of moderate exercise per week Many did not formally exercise at all although most reported frequently walking gardening or undertaking other types of moderate activity   The day before the  race the racers and their partners visited a makeshift lab next door to the race expo where they filled out questionnaires about their exercise and health histories Scientists then drew blood to determine the volunteers cholesterol and triglyceride profiles and measured their height weight pulse rate blood pressure and other vital signs Finally each volunteer underwent a noninvasive heart scan to reveal the buildup of arterial plaques an indication of heart disease  Not surprisingly the marathon runners were significantly thinner than their partners although few of the partners were overweight The runners also generally had lower blood pressure heart rates bad cholesterol and other indicators of cardiac health  But running did not insulate the racers altogether from heart disease the scientists found Some of the racers particularly the oldest ones carried large deposits of plaques in their arteries a worrying sign These older racers also tended to have the highest tallies on a numerical assessment of heart attack risk called the   which considers medical and lifestyle factors that along with genetics can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaques  In essence the scans showed that marathon training did not cancel out the depredations of age longstanding bad health habits or a family history of cardiac problems Dr Taylor said  On the other hand the scientists found no relationship between the number of hours the runners trained or how fast they ran and the levels of plaque in their arteries indicating that marathon training had not directly damaged any of these racers hearts  Over all Dr Taylor said the studys data suggests that if youre training for a marathon or otherwise doing frequent and prolonged endurance exercise youre probably not hurting your heart and are likely strengthening it But you should be aware of your past health habits and family history and monitor any symptoms such as shortness of breath that could be a sign of potential heart troubles  Perhaps the more surprising takeaway of the study Dr Taylor said is that marathon trainings cardiac benefits may be transferable The spouses of the runners were quite healthy too she pointed out More so than many people they walked and moved around frequently and had generally robust cardiac risk profiles Dr Taylors conclusion if you want improved heart health but cant be a runner marry
