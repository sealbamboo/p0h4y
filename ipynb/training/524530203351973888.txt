Criticism of the health service in Wales will do nothing for staff morale the first minister has said Carwyn Jones told assembly members that Health Minister Mark Drakeford had written to health workers following attacks on the Welsh NHS Claims that thousands of patients were desperate to flee the Welsh NHS have been dismissed by the Welsh government It said residents of border counties routinely travel to England if that is where their nearest hospital is  into the running of the NHS in Wales following   Speaking during First Ministers Questions on Tuesday he said I dont pretend in any way that the Welsh NHS doesnt have its difficulties  it clearly does We as a government are committed to dealing with those difficulties  what we wont do though is play politics with the issue of peoples health Writing to NHS staff in Wales Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he was very proud of their work and warned that political and media attacks would intensify in the run up to the general election It saddens me to see our NHS used in this way he wrote warning of the potentially damaging impact on morale  Meanwhile Mr Drakeford has also   accusing the Conservatives of a ploy to drag the reputation of the Welsh NHS through the mud for entirely partisan political purposes Mr Hunt told the House of Commons on Tuesday that Wales was getting a secondclass health service    The newspaper resumed its attack on Tuesday with claims that    A claim that nearly  cancer patients had sought treatment in England has been dismissed by the Welsh government  It said the figure was nearer  patients making a total of  visits Even by the highprofile standards of some of the articles criticising the state of public services in Wales over the past year the Daily Mails blistering attack on the Welsh NHS seems to have gone up a notch We already knew much of what was in the Daily Mail such as the call for an independent inquiry and bitter complaints from the relatives of people who have died But the real heart of the controversy is the hard data itself which the Welsh government insists paints a different picture in sensitive areas like cancer treatment while the paper in its coverage claims the opposite With so many figures flying around you can see why this is an issue people are going to be arguing about right up until the general election
