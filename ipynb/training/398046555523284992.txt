With the open enrollment period for switching Medicare Part D drug plans upon us the   has released two reports that both question the design of the plans and the inattention of  million of us who have them Signing up for all the other parts of Medicare  hospitalization outpatient physician visits  requires one effortless phone call But Part D is a far more complicated hybrid administered by private insurance companies on behalf of the government In  my first year of eligibility   offered in various iterations by Humana Caremark AARP Aetna and the like  Each year Part D enrollees are asked to reconsider their plans monthly premium its annual deductible its authorized pharmacies and its formulary of drugs Branded or generic In what dosages How many tablets per month Which drugs are in which price tier  Almost   Kaiser has found As one of the wide majority who chose inertia this comes as no surprise   I had assumed that during this window of opportunity I would revisit my Part D choices and decide whether to switch Picking a plan is more onerous than filing income taxes every year but I am the sort of person who is diligent about such things Except it turns out Im not Im staying put   Id get in big trouble if I failed to file tax returns But within months of doing the Part D dance I knew Id never do it again Being lazy wasnt a crime If the prices went up so be it the price of everything goes up  The Aetna CVSPharmacy drug plan includes all my medications allows me to pay extra to use my neighborhood pharmacy and to my surprise always has been accommodating when I need special permission to cover a drug not normally on the formulary Aetna was likely to be my dance partner for life  Learning that just about everybody behaved the same way made me feel less indolent it freed me from the last frisson of guilt That remained true even when Aetna sent an Annual Notice of Change for  My  monthly premium of  was going up to  I had no idea if that was a lot or a little compared with other plans My deductible of  was going down to  Nice but far from a wash     With that notice came an abridged version of the  formulary with the full list to follow But according to Kaiser the few who switch plans make that decision based on the monthly premium and to a lesser extent the deductible Its a vastly easier calculation than comparing formularies although that might yield bigger savings Kaiser found that slightly more women then men make a change especially those with multiple chronic conditions or those past the age of  People who have switched once a small subset often continue to do so some annually      Kaiser resisted making hardandfast conclusions about inertia among Plan D beneficiaries and the study notes that it is possible some are signaling satisfaction with the status quo But far more likely the authors said is that the confusing array of plans is too much choice and this kind of competitive model is not working  After years of observing consumer behavior private insurance companies have less incentive to keep costs down in Part D plans they added  since that doesnt seem to matter The unintended consequence is that both beneficiaries and the government are paying more than necessary         Still I considered my recalcitrance about looking into other  options reasonable as I had no clue how my plans increases stacked up Then a day later a second study from Kaiser landed in my email inbox  That one knocked me from my comfortable perch as lazy and perhaps even stupid but not exceptionally so Buried in its charts and graphs were alarming details about my Aetna plan details that made it clear I was an outlier My plan it turned out was   The average premium increase by comparison was  percent and the average premium   Most plans mine among them had acquired many additional wrinkles More tiers of drugs in the formularies some allowed and others not and each with its own pricing More plans that required innetwork pharmacies or bigger penalties for going out of network In other words an even more complicated algorithm than in years past And the study found that some plans mine among them that had begun with reasonable premiums jacked them up from one year to the next in what looks a lot like baitandswitch Both Kaiser studies cited polls and focus groups  qualitative not quantitative evidence  saying beneficiaries would prefer a simpler system This view is supported by behavioral economic research the report said which suggests that decision makers who face a wide range of choices have more difficulty making decisions make poorer choices and may in fact fail to make any decision whatsoever        Does this mean I have to reconsider reconsidering Be a responsible consumer Just the prospect of vetting these plans year after year exhausts me Open enrollment ends Dec  which gives me a few days to kick the can down the road
