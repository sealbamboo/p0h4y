There are numerous benefits to making produce a main attraction at mealtime In addition to upping your intake of vitamins minerals antioxidants and fiber eating at least five servings a day is tied to a lower risk of chronic diseases including heart disease stroke and certain cancers Fruits and veggies also help displace foods that pack more calories per bite a plus if youre trying to lose weight

slash anywhere from  to  calories  A good rule of thumb is to include a serving of fruit in each breakfast and snack and two servings of veggies in every lunch and dinner One serving is  cup fresh about the size of a tennis ball Whip fruit into a smoothie add it to oatmeal or yogurt or just bite right in And for easy ways to make veggies the base of a meal check out my previous post  Youve heard about the unwanted effects of drinking both regular and diet soda but you may not be aware of some of the benefits of drinking more HO According to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition people who get much of their daily fluid intake from plain water tend to have healthier diets overall including more fiber less sugar and fewer highcalorie foods  And in addition to hydrating you water may be a helpful weight loss aid by curbing appetite and boosting metabolism One study found that people who drank about  cups of water a day ate nearly  fewer daily calories compared to those who gulped less than one glass Another found that when adults drank  cups of water right before eating a meal they ate between  and  fewer calories And a German study concluded that consuming ounces of water upped calorie burning by  within  minutes an effect that was sustained for more than an hour Reach for  ounces  cups of water four times a day And if you dislike the taste of plain HO spruce it up Add wedges of lemon or lime fresh mint leaves cucumber slices fresh grated ginger or organic citrus zest or a bit of mashed juicy fruit like berries or tangerine wedges Americans are eating far too many refined grains including white versions of bread pasta rice crackers and pretzels in addition to baked goods and cereals made with refined starch The intake of whole grains like brown rice whole wheat and quinoa is on the rise yet the average intake of whole grains in the US is less than one serving a day Research shows that a higher whole grain intake is tied to a lower risk of heart disease stroke cancer diabetes and obesity The latter may be because whole grains are filling Their fiber helps delay stomach emptying which keeps you fuller longer delays the return of hunger and helps regulate blood sugar and insulin levels which are tied to appetite regulation In  strive to replace refined grains  which have been stripped of their fiber and natural nutrients  with  whole grain options including glutenfree varieties if you need to or prefer to go glutenfree Or choose nongrain nutrientrich starches such as skinon potatoes root vegetables squash beans and lentils If weight loss is a goal moderate your portions rather than cutting out carbs altogether so you dont miss out on the nutrients and sustained energy they provide which are important for enhancing mood and exercise endurance two other keys to successfully shedding pounds Aim for just one to two servings of whole food starch in each meal more if youre more active less if youre less active Great choices include oats or a puffed whole grain cereal at breakfast quinoa or chickpeas in a salad at lunch and sweet potato squash lentils or wild rice at dinner One serving is generally a halfcup of a cooked starch or the serving stated on the nutrition label for packaged foods In all my years counseling clients Ive found that for most people moderation works better than deprivation Currently the average American takes in a whopping  teaspoons of added sugar each day Added sugar doesnt include the type put in foods by Mother Nature like the sugar in fruit but rather the kind added to foods like sweetened yogurt or the sugar you spoon into your coffee According to the American Heart Association the daily target for added sugar should be no more than  level teaspoons for women and  for men  thats for both food and beverages combined Its strict but the target isnt zero which means you dont need to banish sugar completely Allowing yourself some of the sweet stuff can be a helpful way to stay on track because swearing it off completely can result in intense cravings and rebound overeating  Start by cutting out processed versions of sweet stuff like candy and packaged treats and begin tracking how many foods you buy that are presweetened such as yogurt or almond milk sugar can even be lurking in storebought tomato sauce and salad dressing Next opt for unsweetened versions of packaged foods or make them yourself without adding sugar For example for an awesome DIY dressing whisk together extra virgin olive oil balsamic vinegar Dijon mustard minced garlic and Italian herb seasoning Now that youve slashed your sugar intake strategically decide how to spend small amounts while staying within your budget Enjoy a little bit of dark chocolate up to an ounce of  cocoa or greater every day or once or twice a week preplan splurges that wont derail your overall healthy diet like splitting a dessert with a dinner companion or buying one really worthwhile cookie from a bakery If you dont feel you need regular treats thats great Many of my clients find that the less sugar they eat the less they crave But if your sweet tooth strikes or its a special occasion dont succumb to allornothing thinking eg I cant have any or I had a little so I might as well go all out People who lose weight and keep it off longterm find ways to strike a sane and healthy balance One of the most powerful resolutions you can make for  is to work on raising your eating awareness which includes tuning into hunger and fullness cues as well as slowing your eating pace and identifying nonphysical eating triggers boredom habit or a bad day Paying attention to body signals has been shown to be as effective as a formal class for weight loss And slowing down your eating can naturally help you eat less while feeling more satisfied  One University of Rhode Island study found that fast eaters downed more than  ounces of food per minute compared to  ounces for mediumspeed eaters and  for slow eaters Finally becoming more mindful can also help you realize when youre drawn to food even though youre not physically hungry which can help you address your emotional needs in nonfood ways To hone your mindfulness skills start keeping a food journal to record not just what and how much you eat but also your degrees of hunger and fullness before and after meals as well as any emotional notes such as craving something crunchy because you feel angry or wanting to eat while watching TV  Also try committing to not doing anything else while you eat at least once a day Take breaks between each bite check in with your body focus on the flavors and textures of your food and stop when you feel like youve had enough even if you havent cleaned your plate  It may feel awkward at first to slow down and eat solo but this practice can help you to catch yourself eating too fast ease you into a slower pattern and allow you to break mindless eating patterns which may be the key to a happier and healthier year ahead
