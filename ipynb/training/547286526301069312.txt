Professors of molecular and cellular biology at UC Berkeley and Stanford University are sharing the  Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work in unraveling the mystery of a key cellular process Randy W Schekman of Berkeley and Thomas C Sudhof of Stanford have been awarded the prize along with Yale University professor James E Rothman chairman of the cellular biology department The announcement was made on Monday The Nobel Committee lauded the researchers for making known the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases diabetes and immunological disorders For decades the men have studied the cells intricate internal transport system in which bubblelike vesicles shuttle key molecules  hormones neurotransmitters enzymes  to different parts of the cell and through the cells membrane The researchers had been cited as among the top contenders for the award which is worth roughly  million At a press conference in Berkeley Schekman said he was aware of the speculation but didnt think it would happen But then hours after returning from an award ceremony in Germany the yearold was awakened atÂ   am by a ringing phone and his wife Nancys shouting This is it This is it My heart was pounding and I was trembling Schekman said But then I heard a comforting voice with a thick Swedish accent congratulating me The voice belonged to the chairman of the Nobel Committee Sheckman said and he assued me it wasnt a crank call All I could say was Oh my God Oh my God Schekman said I was speechless I couldnt say anything more Schekmans research began in the s and focused on the use of yeast cells In the s and s his findings enabled the biotechnology industry to use yeast cells to create pharmaceutical products such as insulin Currently onethird of the worlds supply of insulin is created and secreted by yeast Sudhof  a native of Germany studies how signals are transmitted from one nerve cell to another within the brain Last month he was recognized with the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award The bulk of Sudhofs awardwinning research was conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center He moved to Stanfords medical school in  where he has made further advances into the pathology behind Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases Sudhof was in the remote town of Baeza Spain where he was attending a conference when he learned of the honor according to the a Stanford press release Im absolutely surprised Sudhof said Every scientist dreams of this I didnt realize there was chance I would be awarded the prize I am stunned and really happy to share the prize with James Rothman and Randy Schekman Initially the Nobel committee called Sudhofs home in Menlo Park  The phone rang three times before I decided to go downstairs and pick it up said Sudhofs wife Lu Chen an associate professor of neurosurgery at Stanford I thought it was one of my Chinese relatives who couldnt figure out the time zone At a press conference at Yale on Monday Rothman said he was overwhelmed Its still a little hard to believe this is all happening I have to admit said Rothman  The researcher did however note a connection between his work and the elation he was feeling after learning of the award  an elation caused by the secretion of endorphins Everyone has commented on how my mood has been very good today and my wife Joy Hirsch has commented that I havent complained today and its already  I think thats because the secretory pathway that my colleagues Randy Schekman and Thomas Sudhof and I are credited with understanding in a new way has been stimulated and so my endorphins are stimulated
