 Some children who are   at an early age will ultimately shed all signs and symptoms of the disorder as they enter adolescence or young adulthood a new analysis contends Whether that happens because of aggressive interventions or whether it boils down to biology and   is still unclear the researchers noted although experts suspect it is most likely a combination of the two The finding stems from a methodical analysis of  children who were deemed normal at the studys start despite having been diagnosed with autism before the age of  Generally autism is looked at as a lifelong disorder said study author Deborah Fein a professor in the departments of psychology and pediatrics at the University of Connecticut The point of this work was really to demonstrate and document this phenomenon in which some children can move off the autism spectrum and really go on to function like normal adolescents in all areas and end up mainstreamed in regular classrooms with no oneonone support Although we dont know exactly what percent of these kids are capable of this kind of amazing outcome we do know its a minority she added Were certainly talking about less than  percent of those diagnosed with autism at an early age Certainly all   can get better and grow with good therapy Fein said But this is not just about good therapy Ive seen thousands of kids who have great therapy but dont reach this result Its very very important that parents who dont see this outcome not feel as if they did something wrong Fein and her colleagues reported the findings of their study which was supported by the US National Institutes of Health in the Jan  issue of the   The  individuals previously diagnosed with autism most between the ages of  and  were roughly between the ages of  and  during the study They were compared to a group of  individuals with highfunctioning autism and a control group of  normal peers Indepth blind analysis of each childs original diagnostic report revealed that the nowoptimal outcome group had as young children shown signs of social impairment that was milder than the  children who had highfunctioning autism As young children the nowoptimal group had suffered from equally severe communication impairment and repetitive behaviors as those in the highfunctioning group That said the optimal group retained none of the telltale signs of autism with respect to impaired social skills communication behaviors or the ability to recognize faces Whats more all were enrolled in   that did not cater in any special way to the needs of children with autism Fein stressed that her groups work is ongoing and the team will analyze brain imaging information that might reveal some of the structural shifts under way among the formerly autistic group The researchers also will look at various types of therapies the children had received following their initial diagnosis to determine what kind of intervention seemed to have the greatest positive impact We do have data on this but we havent looked at it yet Fein said From  years of clinical experience it seems to me that behavioral interventions are the ones that are most likely to produce this outcome But I want to point out that this is the result of years of hard work she added This is not anything that happens overnight I would say that at minimum were talking about two to three years of intensive therapy to produce this outcome but it could also be five years Its variable The other important thing to say Fein said is that even for the minority of children who experience this outcome you dont want to let go of therapy prematurely Although we havent seen any kids whose autism has come back we dont really know that that cant happen Children who go on to lose the symptoms of autism will still continue to be at risk for certain things like attention problems and anxiety so intervention of some sort may be needed on a continual basis Apart from that I would tell parents that with all of this an early diagnosis and early intervention is very very important Fein added If a parent out there has any questions about their child and autism they should not wait and see If a doctor tells you to wait you should not Get an evaluation Geraldine Dawson chief science officer for Autism Speaks said the study provides concrete support for what many on the front lines of autism have been witnessing Clinicians have long observed that a minority of children who originally received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder will lose that diagnosis she said We still dont know what factors account for why some children lose their diagnosis whereas others continue to have significant challenges Dawson added However it is likely that a combination of both early intervention and inherent biological factors play a role
