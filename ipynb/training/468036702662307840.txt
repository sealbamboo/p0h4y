Nick Auden didnt live to see the legislation but the case of the Denver melanoma patient who died while seeking access to an experimental drug helped inspire a firstofits kind law in Colorado The Right To Try law allows terminally ill patients to obtain experimental drugs without getting federal approval Its a proposal being advanced in several states by patient advocates who are frustrated by the yearslong federal approval process for experimental drugs in the pipeline There are experimental drugs out there that can and do save lives and access needs to be expanded said Audens widow Amy Auden of Lone Tree Colorado Nick Auden died in November at age  after unsuccessfully lobbying two drug companies to use an experimental treatment outside of clinical trials Auden had acknowledged there was no guarantee the drug would work Gov John Hickenlooper on Saturday signed Colorados Right To Try bill which was passed unanimously in the state Legislature Similar bills await governors signatures in Louisiana and Missouri and Arizona voters will decide in November whether to set up a similar program in that state Supporters call it a ray of hope for dying patients trying to navigate the red tape of existing compassionate use guidelines for obtaining drugs outside clinical trials The process requires federal approval When youre terminal and theres a drug out there that might help you it can seem that the obstacles to get that drug are insurmountable said state Sen Irene Aguilar a physician who cosponsored Colorados bill Aguilar dubbed the measure the Dallas Buyers Club bill after the movie about a determined AIDS patient who smuggled treatments from Mexico because they werent cleared for use in the US But skeptics call Right To Try a feelgood campaign that wont help dying patients The law doesnt require drug companies to provide any drug outside federal parameters and theres no indication pharmaceutical companies will do so A  lawsuit to force the US Food and Drug Administration to expand the availability of investigational drugs failed A federal judge disagreed that terminally ill people have a right to access to investigational medicine and the US Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal Statelevel approaches are an effort to circumvent the federal system but critics say they wont work The FDA regulates drug development and this doesnt do anything to change that said Dr David Gorski a surgical oncologist and editor of the blog Science Based Medicine Gorski said a drug company wouldnt do anything to endanger a drug theyre potentially spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bring to market through elaborate FDA trials Colorados bill got a careful nocomment from state doctors groups hospitals and health insurers The bill was amended to clarify that health care providers and insurers arent liable if a patient who uses a drug outside clinical trials gets sick or dies
