When you hear the term nextgeneration condom beef tendon probably isnt the first thing that pops into your mind But a condom made from the cow part is one of    from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation in its reinventthecondom competition Another winning proposal uses a material that shrinks when it warms up on the body so it provides a perfect fit Yet another team combined opening the condom package with application  in a single quick motion  so theres no more fumbling in the dark Back in March the Gates Foundation   to design a condom that men or women would actually want to use The goal was to develop new condoms that significantly preserve or enhance pleasure   the foundations website The motivation is simple The Gates Foundation is one of the biggest supporters of global health and a funder of NPR It figures that if more couples use condoms theyre less likely to transmit viruses like HIV or end up with unwanted pregnancies The foundation received more than  entries for the condom challenge It announced the  winning proposals on Wednesday For the nextgeneration condom its all about being thin and strong Studies have found that most men prefer a condom that they dont notice says chemical engineer Mark McGlothlin of   in San Diego But it still needs to be tough enough so it doesnt break or allow pathogens to pass through Current condoms always have a plastic feeling McGlothlin tells Shots We wanted to make a condom you dont feel when you have intercourse To do that McGlothlin has invented a condom made out of the same material in animal tendons and ligaments long fibers of protein called   We take raw collagen from beef tendons or fish scraps and gingerly separate out the fibers he says We form it into a condom  and when it dries down it looks like sausage casing The result he says is a material that almost feels like wet skin Its a totally different sensation than a latex condom Its like rubbing your hand on a real leather car seat versus one with fake leather The fake fabric  and the latex  just feels bad Of course condoms also have to fit right to work So Ron Frezieres and his team at the   have developed a condom that he hopes will be more comfortable and less noticeable for men To that end theyve redesigned the standard latex condom A quarter of men say theyre too tight he tells Shots Our material clings to the penis so its not as restrictive His design also improves the application of the condom or donning as the industry calls it Instead of rolling on Frezieres condom has two tabs on either side that allow men to pull the condom on like a sock over a foot A team in South Africa stuck to the traditional rollon method but theyve made it faster and easier The   cracks the package open at the center The condom slides on without ever leaving the foil Of course all of these ideas are in the early stage of development Inventors will still have to develop working prototypes and test them before they can be produced for public use The competition is part of the foundations   The goal is to give scientists money to explore quirky ideas that sound a bit crazy but if they actually pan out could have a huge impact on global health The winning groups of the condom competition have  months to show that their design can be easily manufactured and that the device could be safe and effective Then each group can apply for a  million grant to scale up production and do rigorous clinical trials Who knows maybe in five years youll be able to pick up a beef tendon condom at your local CVS Sounds so appealing
