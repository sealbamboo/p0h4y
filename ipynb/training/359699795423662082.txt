When Lygia Dunsworth was sedated intubated and strapped down in the intensive care unit at a Fort Worth hospital she was racked by paranoid   Outside her window she saw helicopters evacuating patients from an impending tornado leaving her behind Nurses plotted to toss her into rough lake waters She hallucinated an escape from the ICU  she ducked into a food freezer only to find herself surrounded by body parts Mrs Dunsworth who had been gravely ill from abdominal infections and surgeries eventually recovered physically But for several years her stay in intensive care tormented her She had shortterm   and difficulty sleeping She would not go into the ocean or a lake She was terrified to fly or even travel alone Nor would she talk about it Either people think youre crazy or you scare them said Mrs Dunsworth  a   in the DallasFort Worth area In fact she was having symptoms associated with   Annually about five million patients stay in an intensive care unit in the United States Studies show that up to  percent may   particularly if they had a   with severe infection or   Those   include intrusive thoughts avoidant behaviors mood swings emotional numbness and reckless behavior Yet ICUinduced PTSD has been largely unidentified and untreated When patients leave the ICU said   a psychiatrist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Everyone pays attention to whether patients can walk and how weak they are But its the exception for them to be screened for psychiatric symptoms like posttraumatic stress or low mood Now critical care specialists are trying to prevent or shorten the duration of the mood disorders which can rattle not only ICU patients but their frantic relatives Sometimes   tormented by memories of a loved one thrashing in restraints delirious near death Other PTSD sufferers  victims of combat sexual assault or natural disasters  also endure flashbacks but theirs are grounded in episodes that can often be corroborated What is unsettling for postICU patients is that no one can verify their seemingly real horrors one patient described a food cart in the ICU selling strips of her flayed flesh ICU patients have vivid memories of events that objectively didnt occur Dr Bienvenu said They recall being raped and tortured as opposed to what really happened such as painful procedures like the insertion of catheters and IV lines The ICU setting itself can feel sinister to patients as if lifted from The Twilight Zone The eerie sleepindifferent lights The cacophony of machines and alarms Certain treatments in the ICU may be grim but they are essential Intubation for example Patients who need help breathing must have a plastic tube placed down their windpipes for mechanical ventilation The feeling of nearsuffocation and the   can be nightmarish Such invasive procedures may raise the odds that a patient develops PTSD A longer ICU stay also increases the risk of posttraumatic symptoms But some patients arrive more vulnerable to PTSD Women may be more at risk than men as are patients with a history of depression or other emotional difficulties Because patients are often rushed to the ICU unexpectedly doctors cannot take a psychological history Age may be a factor Elderly patients generally recover more slowly but younger patients may be more likely to develop symptoms of PTSD Experts suspect that young patients further from natural mortality are even more shaken by the possibility of unanticipated death Moreover the violent events that land patients in the ICU like gunshots and car crashes tend to happen to younger people noted   an assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine Those events also exacerbate the onset of PTSD he said But researchers have begun to identify the ICU treatment that has led to the most harrowing flashbacks sedation Sedation  to manage pain and compel patients to lie still and not fight the ventilator  is crucial in the ICU But many   contribute to the patients   and intense hallucinations which can return unbidden for years A British doctor Sarah Wake was a yearold intern when in  she was intubated and sedated in the ICU following a severe reaction to an   medication She described her hallucinations   Blood seeping through holes and cracks in my skin forming a puddle of red around me She wrote that the fragmented delusional memories made it difficult for her to understand what had happened This prevented my psychological recovery and led to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder For months she could not work in a hospital Even now after therapy she is practicing medicine again and yet she wrote I still cannot bear a shower curtain to be drawn as it reminds me of closed hospital curtains and hidden death Dr Wake was given benzodiazepines a class of sedatives that includes Valium and Ativan as well as opioids for pain Researchers now believe that benzodiazepines may intensify the hallucinations that are so disturbing to ICU patients The philosophy about ICU sedation has gone through pendulum swings In the s patients on ventilators were allowed to remain awake But doctors turned to benzodiazepines to calm anxious patients and prevent them from fighting the tubes If a patient was heavily sedated thought doctors the resulting   about the ordeal would be worthwhile But in the last decade researchers have realized that the benzodiazepines did not just give patients amnesia the delirium and hallucinations they may also trigger in critically ill patients may set the stage for PTSD Opioids can also cause delirium Dose and duration are also relevant In January the Society of Critical Care Medicine concerned about the weakened physical cognitive and psychological condition of many postICU patients   They urged ICU doctors to treat pain first and only then to weigh using benzodiazepines for anxiety Although evidence is not definitive lighter sedation seems tied to better cognitive and physical rehabilitative recovery as well as fewer and less shattering hallucinations ICU staff were encouraged to keep assessing patients for pain alertness and delirium  an associate professor in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins noted that even when the sedation has stopped a patients delirium may continue Many patients return home mentally shaken with physical and cognitive weaknesses Dr Needham said they havent fully recovered within six months or a year Therefore he added the   ICU nurses have taken the lead in efforts to alleviate the trauma of stays and to shorten the duration of the subsequent mood disorders for both families as well as patients In Britain Germany and some Scandinavian countries nurses in many critical care units keep a diary of the care they provide to a patient with contributions from the family which they give to the patient upon discharge The   to patients hallucinations or amnesia Judy E Davidson research nurse liaison for themedical center at the University of California San Diegoand a former critical care nurse teaches nurses to work with relatives of ICU patients to reduce posttrauma symptoms of their own The antecedent to PTSD is fear horror and helplessness Dr Davidson said If you give relatives things to do  applying lip balm and hand lotion to the patient keeping their joints limber  it keeps their minds active and decreases the fear response and helplessness The details of what happens in the ICU often stay in the ICU primary care physicians rarely learn about their patients difficult journeys there and so often do not evaluate them for problems that may have arisen In the interim a handful of hospitals in the United States are focusing on the challenges faced by postICU patients including PTSD Once a week for the last two years Dr Khan a pulmonologist has been seeing patients at the Critical Care Recovery Center at Wishard Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis His team treats postICU patients who have spent at least two days on a mechanical ventilator or suffered acute brain dysfunction during that period About half he said develop PTSD Vanderbilt University Medical Center has been running a postICU clinic on Friday afternoons since last fall Typically the treatment team includes a critical care nursepractitioner a psychologist a pharmacist a pulmonologist and a nurse who functions in a social worker capacity They evaluate patients for physical cognitive social and psychological impairments But whether patients or family members develop PTSD symptoms or the full disorder persuading them to seek treatment poses unique challenges About three years ago a woman then  had a   at a Tennessee community hospital but developed a severe infection She awoke in the ICU intubated with delusions that she had been raped and that her family had abandoned her Since being discharged she has had   She is afraid of crowds frightened of contagion She has retreated from activities at church and her childrens school She has become claustrophobic in reaction to having been restrained in the ICU said   a psychologist and assistant professor in the division of critical care medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who worked with the patient in a study Though she knows she needs help she is too anxious to go back to the community hospital which she associates with so much anguish Such avoidant behavior Dr Jackson noted is among the most debilitating of PTSD symptoms Even now seeking medical care anywhere is extremely difficult for her This phenomenon is not uncommon he said But it makes it hard for individuals who need help to take the necessary steps to get it Related
