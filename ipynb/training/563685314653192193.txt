Training very hard may be as bad for you as not putting on your running shoes at all a report in the   says Scientists studied more than  healthy joggers and nonjoggers over a year period  The study suggests jogging at a steady pace for less than two and a half hours a week was best for health UK guidance says adults should aim for  minutes of exercise each week The Danish study asked participants to register how frequently they jogged for how long and at what intensity  as well as requesting details of their health The scientists concluded the ideal pace to jog was about mph kmh  and that it was best to jog no more than three times a week or for  hours in total  Researcher Jacob Louis Marott from the Frederiksberg Hospital in Copenhagen said You dont actually have to do that much to have a good impact on your health  And perhaps you shouldnt actually do too much No exercise recommendations across the globe mention an upper limit for safe exercise but perhaps there is one This is a small study particularly when it comes to the people in the most active groups  only  were classified as strenuous joggers and just two of this group died  So experts caution this makes it harder to detect and be confident of the differences between each group  But the paper does build on previous research   and other work which has suggested longterm strenuous endurance exercise can damage the heart Maureen Talbot senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation said This study shows that you dont have to run marathons to keep your heart healthy  Light and moderate jogging was found to be more beneficial than being inactive or undertaking strenuous jogging possibly adding years to your life National guidelines recommend we do  minutes of moderateintensity activity a week  It may sound like a lot but even brisk walking is good exercise And if youre bit of a couch potato this is a good place to start
