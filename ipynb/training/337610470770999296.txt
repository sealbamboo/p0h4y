
 Ensconced in Babyland I attend the relentless rhythms of soothing my visiting monthold grandson who cannot seem to sleep more than  minutes at a stretch I have determined to jettison all other obligations with two exceptions providing meals for my nursing daughter and reading a memoir lent to me by a friend who must have known how it would move me In The Kitchen Congregation Nora Seton mourns the death of her mother a novelist from cancer at age       Im sauting onions and washing greens which is what Ms Setons mother did until she was weakened by leukemia treatments Even then her daughter testifies she tried to bake slice and serve because you didnt let chaos in through the kitchen door Yet Ms Seton the youngest child in the family remembers realizing that she could not beat her developing fists against her mothers imperturbable flanks because they were not imperturbable not in the least and in fact any slight twist of the wrist might kill her  Children of mothers with cancer must learn this painful lesson early the vulnerability of the figure on whom they have grounded their existence With varying degrees of fearful awareness such children intuit that the mother who comforts by murmuring I am here will not always be there Under such circumstances how to safeguard childhood or adolescence from anxious vigilance and dread Mothers often stand at the center of their childrens orbit After her mothers death Ms Seton needed help finding a center in herself   As I sense my dear dear daughters slowly coming to terms with my incurable state I am grateful that they are young adults who cooked with me as children learned my quirky recipes during their college years and later reproduced them for their own families How thankful I am that I was given enough years to bequeath the sorts of memories grievously truncated in yearning younger offspring And of course the separation anxiety that cancer instills in children also haunts dying mothers  Nora Setons sorrow after her mothers death reminds me of two mothers with terminal cancer who lamented having to leave their children too soon Both were journalists who wrote about the agony of a compulsory abandonment For Marjorie Williams the first sign of advanced liver disease arrived with her sons remark Mommy youre getting thinner What women with latestage cancer and little children do she decides is lead as normal a life as possible only with more pancakes  In her last column before she died at age  Ms Williams recounted a Halloween of her dreams with her daughter Though she refused to buy fashions designed to clothe tiny hookers she colluded with yearold Alices determination to be a rock star giggling over dreadful platform shoes grownup lipstick and loads of glitter which mothers know to be the work of Satan Seeing her daughter transformed into a teenager Ms Williams could reimagine preparations for trickortreating as if they were for Alices first prom or date She thereby cheated time flipping the calendar five or six years into the future and glimpsing the character she might have played as the yearold mother she would never become Ruth Picardie a British columnist might have envied the treat of Ms Williamss trick because she and her children were younger When she learned at age  that breast cancer had metastasized in her liver and lungs Ms Picardie  who enjoyed ridiculing her obsession with her appearance  determined It aint over until the fat ladys thin She died one month after celebrating her twins second birthday with chocolate cake and Champagne She had written that she was most hurt by losing the future She turned to the agonizing task of compiling memory boxes for Lola and Joe though she worried How do you write the definitive love letter to a partly imaginary child Brooding over these testimonies I consider our fraught helplessness confronting cancer and the passionate bonds latched by the generosity of mothers and children who fear the worst hope for the best deny and confront what they try to but cannot comprehend Like Nora Setons mother Marjorie Williams and Ruth Picardie tell me something about staying steady hanging in for as long as possible Together they suggest that the motherloss inflicted by cancer can be salved if not healed by small acts performed noted remembered or retold   A series of loud yelps threatens to escalate into wails Wakefulness is good I tell the baby and his exhausted mother as I imagine him transported into a future world I wont see  where he and his parents will savor his urgent desire to be active and alert I ponder these matters while tossing a stirfry to serve my daughter as she feeds her son
