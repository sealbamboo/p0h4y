When a runners heart stops during a marathon it gets a lot of press  even though its actually a pretty rare event A more common killer among runners and a condition that needs more prevention efforts is heatstroke according to a study by Israeli researchers During a  running race physicians at a Tel Aviv hospital noticed there were far more heatstroke victims admitted than   They wondered if this was an anomaly so they analyzed local races from March  to November  encompassing  runners Across those races there were two serious cardiac events neither of which was fatal or life threatening But there were  serious heatstroke cases including two fatalities and  that were life threatening Theres a continuum of   ranging from milder heat cramps all the way to heatstroke which is defined as a fever above  degrees and symptoms including dry hot skin rapid breathing and unconsciousness When the body gets that hot the kidneys brain and other organs can fail One caveat It gets hot in Tel Aviv Its possible that not every race site will face the same heatstroke danger though its reasonable to assume that heat stroke is just as common in other countries with similar climate Dr   senior author of the study and a cardiologist at Tel Aviv Medical Center told Shots via email And heatstroke can   Its important for racers to be prepared for heat That means acclimatizing to warmer weather  though that can take up to two weeks so its not always practical The authors say it may be better to schedule races during the summer when participants are used to the heat rather than the spring People also should beware of racing if theyve recently had a fever since that can reduce the bodys ability to ward off heatstroke the authors say The National Athletic Trainers Association   drinking enough fluids before during and after exercise to help avoid overheating And race organizers need to be able to diagnose heatstroke quickly by taking a runners body temperature rectally on site so they can provide   most effectively by immersing the person in a cold water bath Heatstroke is a big problem says Dr   a Northwestern Medicine emergency medicine physician Hes also medical director of the Chicago Marathon which made some changes after the  race was halted amid high temperatures that sickened hundreds The single death that year was actually a result of a heart condition not the heat Now runners see green yellow red or black flags along the route to indicate whether the conditions including weather are good less than ideal potentially dangerous or so bad that the race has been stopped Chiampas tells Shots Postrace surveys show that runners run more slowly and adjust their strategy if conditions are yellow or red he says And medical personnel near the finish line are trained to talk with runners to see if their mental status has been affected  a sign of heat illness The study was published Monday in the
