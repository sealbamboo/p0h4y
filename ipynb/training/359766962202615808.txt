Or this Youre going to experience a lot of challenges when you get home Here are the three or four concerns that should be your priorities  Heres what your caregiver needs to know to help you most effectively  Here are resources in the community that might be of assistance Given the inadequacies in care for discharged patients  a welldocumented and common problem  is it any wonder that so many bounce back to hospitals after theyre sent home Medicare the governments health care program for seniors has trained its sights on the issue and is focused on trying to reduce the number of seniors readmitted to hospitals shortly after being sent home Nearly one in five older adults discharged from a hospital   according to a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine    Not all readmissions are avoidable  sometimes a patients condition will worsen no matter what anyone does But experts are convinced   if hospitals did more to educate patients ensure theyre able to care for themselves and coordinate their care with other medical providers  The Obama administration hopes to trim Medicare readmissions by  percent and under the Affordable Care Act has started   with heart failure heart attacks and pneumonia   Medical centers risk losing up  percent of their annual Medicare reimbursement that financial penalty will rise to  percent by October  More medical conditions   over time  What does this mean to older adults and their caregivers  What can they expect as hospitals put into place programs to address readmissions and what can they do to prevent return trips to the hospital Ms Grumans problems began in the hospital when a day after surgery a nutritionist came to visit and tell her how to manage life without a stomach  It was misguided to see me so soon after surgery when I was loopy and could barely remember my name said Ms Gruman now a patient advocate and president of the Center for Advancing Health in Washington  When youre in the hospital youre not operating on all cylinders she added  You dont really know until youre home for a while and reality sets in what questions are going to be important anyway  Heres what she learned from the experience Lesson No  If a patient isnt ready to hear what a medical provider wants to say meaningful communication becomes impossible  Ms Gruman said she probably should have told the nutritionist I cant possibly concentrate on what youre telling me right now its not a good time   Speak up when you find yourself in a similar situation feeling muddled or unable to concentrate  The morning of her discharge from the hospital the nurse responsible for her discharge didnt help Ms Gruman see the big picture No one said this is going to be a really big deal adjusting to this change in your body and youll have a lot of adjustment to go through  What was missing she said was any recognition of the magnitude of the time and attention my husband and I would have to spend attending to my recovery Lesson No   Handing someone a sheaf of papers and going over a set of instructions wont guarantee a successful transition from the hospital to home  People need more  They need a human touch emotional recognition and a sense that theyre not going to be left on their own as they try to recover from the setback that brought them to the hospital   Feel free to stop the person handling your discharge and say Wait slow down I dont really understand how Im going to get along day to day and how all this is going to work  Dont leave until you feel more comfortable At home Ms Gruman wasnt sure about her health priorities  I had a whole new digestive system and I wasnt sure how it functioned she said   I wish Id known more about eating what to expect in terms of my energy level how much I should try to exercise if there was anything I needed to be monitoring Lesson No   Some people may be able to assimilate information in the hospital or upon discharge but many cannot It may take several days or even longer at home for people to understand what challenges in their recovery are most important Staffers also need to teach caregivers the skills they will need while the patient is still in the hospital Thats the time to learn how to turn someone in bed help with mobility assist them in taking a bath or assess their breathing or level of pain   Be willing to ask a nurse show me how you do that several times if necessary so you are not left in the lurch when you get home Ms Gruman said Many of you have undoubtedly had experiences with this issue  wed be glad to hear about those in   Later this week well post some advice from experts
