Every time we read or hear about older adults victimized by   scams on the street   or   we wince And we think Is there no way to protect aging parents from such predators short of taking charge of their finances Law enforcement has trouble keeping up with these fastmoving thieves who have often moved onto the next scheme by the time the police and regulators have warned about the current one And warnings wont help some potential victims anyway Poor   researchers have warned Yet after decades of adequately handling their own money older people understandably resist ceding control Cant we leave them some autonomy  the ability to support a favorite charity or carry some walkingaround money or buy a new purse  without   A thought The use of prepaid debit cards as a substitute for credit cards and checking accounts has grown enormously in the past few years A   earlier this month reported that  percent of American adults use them at least monthly and that the amount of money loaded onto them   billion in   has more than doubled over three years Few card users were over age  Pew found  just  percent But maybe more of them could or should be Lots of banks stores and online sources offer prepaid cards which function much like debit or credit cards but are not linked to bank accounts You can load and reload them with cash via direct deposit or in some cases with transfers or checks deposited at ATMs People then use them with either PINs or signatures to get cash and to shop in person or online Relying on these cards makes it a lot harder to wipe out an IRA or   Prepaid cards can be a useful tool for monitoring and controlling the spending of others Christina Tetreault a staff attorney at Consumers Union told me You cant spend more money than has been loaded on the card and that can be very attractive In fact one fledgling company considers older adults such a promising market that it is about to offer a prepaid Visa card called   specifically intended for seniors Highly customizable it will permit the administrator a trusted family member to set perpurchase or perday spending limits or cap ATM withdrawals It can block charges to individual merchants or charities or whole categories like magazine subscriptions You could block only your mothers phone purchases for instance She can go to the movies grocery shopping or out to dinner and the card works like any debit card said James Tinsley director of marketing and communications at True Link But if shes watching latenight television and decides to order four crock pots the card gets declined You could authorize card use at the corner Rite Aid but not the one across town where she never goes And you can receive text alerts if someone uses the card to make ATM withdrawals at  am Prepaid cards can entail some risks for seniors or for anyone Consumer advocates caution that they lack the federally mandated protections that apply to credit and debit cards The funds loaded on prepaid cards need not be  insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for instance though many issuers provide FDIC insurance voluntarily Some offer the same loss and theft safeguards as debit or credit cards others dont A few allow overdrafts defeating the whole idea of controlling spending I encourage consumers to really read the fine print on these said Maggie Flowers senior program manager at the National Council on Aging All of them have different rules and fees The fees can mount too The best cards    to Bluebird an American ExpressWalmart product and Green Dot  set low monthly charges that often can be waived with few other costs But other cards require fees when you set them up when you reload or use an ATM even when you dont use them frequently Some are very transparent and others you have to hunt for the information  and even then its not clear Ms Tetreault said    so has the   Clearly a prepaid card wont work for every older person confused about money Perhaps the cardholder cant remember his PIN or loses the card so regularly it serves little purpose But large numbers of seniors can use and misuse checking accounts and debit and credit cards which sometimes leads them into trouble At least a prepaid card could limit their losses  not only from scamsters but from pushy marketers overzealous investment counselors or because of their own illadvised spending Theoretically anyway
