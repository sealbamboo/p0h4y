A discovery in mice could help to treat people with a form of brittle bone disease scientists said  In an American study mice were bred with osteogenesis imperfecta OI and the activity of a protein which shapes and reshapes bones was monitored  Scientists said intense activity of the protein in the mice was linked to OI They said the finding could lead to a new target for treatment but experts warn the study is in mice and might not apply to humans  One in  people in the UK are estimated to have osteogenesis imperfecta OI It is an inherited condition where abnormalities in the genes controlling collagen affect the bones strength  In severe cases people with OI can have between  and  fractures by the time they reach age  the Brittle Bone Society said Current treatment is lacking Scientists at the Baylor College of Medicine University of Texas looked at a protein in mice bred with the condition and compared them to normal mice  They said the activity of transforming growth factor beta TGF which coordinates the shaping and reshaping of bone was excessive in mice with OI  When TGF was blocked with an antibody the mices bones withstood higher maximum load and ultimate strength and showed improved whole bone and tissue strength suggesting resistance to fracture the study said Research was  Dr Brendan Lee professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine said the study could move quite quickly into humans and be at a clinical trial stage later this year or early next year  A pharmaceutical company in the US was looking at the pathway of TGF in other diseases such as kidney disease which could accelerate the trials he said  One mechanism behind the findings could be that the disruption of TGF meant the bone was absorbed in the body more quickly than it was made Dr Lee added We now have a deeper understanding for how genetic mutations that affect collagen and collagen processing enzymes cause weak bones He said the treatment appeared even more effective than other existing approaches  Prof Nick Bishop is professor at the University of Sheffield and chairman of the Brittle Bone Societys medical advisory board He said the study was a paradigm shifter as it exposed a possible new target for treatment  But Prof Bishop said This is another mouse study with potential to transfer to humans we hope but remember mice are not human  He added Other treatments that have worked really well in mice with brittle bones like bone marrow transplantation havent worked as well in humans and are not standard practice as of now Dr Claire Bowring medical policy manager at the National Osteoporosis Society said the study was basic science in mouse models to understand the basics of bone biology  She said It could in the future help develop knowledge about bone conditions more fully As we understand more about bone turnover and communication between bone cells work could open doors for future research that could affect osteoporosis Dr Bowring said it could take  to  years for such mouse studies to reach the stage of clinical trials in people
