When a patient who has had a stroke enters the emergency room its a race against the clock Those who receive the clotbusting drug tPA within  minutes of experiencing stroke symptoms have the best chance of avoiding brain damage or death but studies show that only  percent of patients eligible for treatment with the drug get it within this golden hour But that lessthanstellar response can be sped up according to studies published Tuesday in   the Journal of the American Medical Association In a project called Target Stroke launched in  by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association hospitals were recognized if they met a goal of treating  percent of stroke patients within an hour after they arrive The   to meet that goal include having ambulance staff call ahead and rushing patients to a CT scanner immediately As a   hospitals reduced doortoneedle treatment from  minutes to  minutes in four years according to data from  of those hospitals and more than  patients The percentage of patients treated within the golden hour increased from a little less than a third to more than half and researchers saw an almost  percent decrease of inhospital deaths from  percent to  This is something that every hospital would be able to do says   a cardiologist at the University of California Los Angeles and the studys lead author In another   German researchers suggest that treatment with tPA doesnt have to wait until the patient arrives at the ER The treatment can be administered right in a specialized ambulance equipped with a paramedic a neurologist a radiology technician CT scanners and lab capabilities In a way we bring the hospital to the patient says   a neurologist at the Center for Stroke Research in Berlin and the studys lead author Over a month trial where these specialized ambulances were deployed every other week in Berlin researchers saw an average minute reduction time in treatment delivery And the rate of tPA treatment increased from  percent to  percent More promising says Ebinger is that there was no increase in the risk of tPA treatment which can include bleeding in the brain and death Its actually quite difficult to treat a patient within  minutes on a routine basis because there are many issues that need to be addressed says   a neurologist at Duke University Issues he says like getting patients to know what a stroke is and how to respond and understanding what kind of stroke the patient is having as well as the patients history Public understanding of stroke treatment is also a big problem Goldstein says The patient or bystander needs to recognize that somethings wrong and to contact  so the patient can be transported rapidly he says adding that that is the first step to speeding up the treatment process
