Airport health screeners in hazmat suits and armed with gun thermometers are becoming a familiar sight in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone where the Ebola epidemic continues to spiral out of control Passengers boarding aircraft are checked for fever If cleared they receive a stamped leaflet declaring them fit for travel The precautions are similar to steps taken during previous outbreaks of contagious diseases including Middle East respiratory syndrome and deadly bird flus For now the threat to air travelers outside West Africa appears to be low The World Health Organization is recommending that in nonaffected countries authorities should strengthen the capacity to detect and immediately contain new cases while avoiding measures that will create unnecessary interference with international travel or trade In addition medical experts note that even if a passenger infected with Ebola were to board a flight other passengers would not be in imminent danger The risks of contracting the virus from an infected passenger are extremely low according to Lee Norman the chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Hospital and an adviser to homeland security on infectious diseases If a traveler were to come in contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient who was bleeding having diarrhea or vomiting and the traveler came in contact with those bodily fluids then it would be possible he says But one would hope that a patient that ill would not be allowed on the airplane in the first place Nonetheless the Ebola outbreak is raising questions that apply to any passenger who is not well What are your rights to a refund or new ticket if you cancel a trip because you have an infectious illness And what right does an airline have to deny you boarding A passenger who is ill might prefer to cancel and receive a full refund for the ticket Thats possible if youve purchased a topdollar refundable ticket But most passengers opt for the cheaper nonrefundable fare If youre too sick to fly you can rebook a different flight but there will be a change fee of  to  And youll have to pay the difference if the new fare is higher than the old one But there is an   If a passenger shows up at the airport and is denied boarding because of a visible illness then the airline may offer a full refund The reasons behind the airlines reluctance to offer full refunds appear to be mostly financial Simply put airlines dont want to refund tickets on a wide scale Every exception costs an airline potential revenue Last year domestic airlines collected  billion in ticket change fees up from  billion the previous year Although its not clear what percentage of that is from customers who had to cancel their flights because of an illness If you do show up and inform the airline you are too sick to fly a gate agent will make the decision whether to refund your money Refunds are approved on a case by case basis says Steve Loucks a spokesman for Travel Leaders Group a network of travel agents The availability to cancel a ticket depends on the situation the airline and the type of ticket purchased says Victoria Day a spokeswoman for the Airlines for America or AA a trade association for domestic airlines The same goes for tickets to international destinations That information is typically contained in a document called the contract of carriage or conditions of carriage according to Perry Flint a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association Each airline makes its own decisions with regard to the refundability of a fare subject to any government regulations as applicable he adds In the wake of the Ebola outbreak AA is recommending that passengers who believe they have been exposed to the virus and possibly are infected not go to the airport but go to a medical professional for treatment  A doctors note can sometimes persuade an airline to offer a refund even on a nonrefundable ticket And what if you think youre well enough to fly but the airline disagrees Under federal regulations airlines may deny boarding a passenger who is a   to the health of other passengers To be a direct threat a condition must be both able to be readily transmitted by casual contact in the course of a flight  have severe health consequences according to the federal regulation  It lists SARS and active tuberculosis as examples of direct threats Airlines have their own policies as well that give them the right to prevent a passenger from boarding For example   says it has the right to refuse carriage to any passenger who has not complied with applicable laws regulations orders demands or requirements or whose documents are not complete Although this rule is thought to apply mostly to passengers with invalid visas or passports it could also be used to send a sick passenger packing Passengers with paperwork problems are offered a flight credit in accordance with the rules of their fare Meanwhile as the Ebola epidemic continues the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to make sure airlines know how to handle a potential patient A document called   updated on Aug  suggests providing a surgical mask and air sickness bag for a traveler who is coughing sneezing or vomiting The crew is advised to wear impermeable disposable gloves for direct contact with blood or other body fluids And indeed there have been cases of passengers flying who were later diagnosed with Ebola LiberianAmerican Patrick Sawyer hopped a plane in Liberia arrived in Nigeria then collapsed and died of Ebola It does not appear that he infected anyone on the plane but two health care workers who treated him in Nigeria were subsequently diagnosed with Ebola The Sawyer story is a reminder that even if ticket refunds are an important issue for passengers preventing the spread of Ebola by airline passengers is a far greater concern    The Washington Post USA Today   National Geographic Traveler   How To Be the Worlds
