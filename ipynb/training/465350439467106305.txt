On Sunday the charity Scope is launching a national television campaign to get people talking about why they might feel awkward around disabled people Comedian Lee Ridley known as Lost Voice Guy regularly experiences public awkwardness  Hello Im Lee and Im disabled Do you feel awkward yet In fact I have a disability called cerebral palsy and in my case it means I cant speak I use a communication aid to talk with  a bit like Stephen Hawking but better looking I move like a zombie from The Walking Dead and the right side of my body is weaker than my left Do you feel awkward now What if I told you that I also do standup comedy where I enjoy taking the mick out of myself and disability in general How awkward are you about that Judging by some audience members Ive encountered recently you may not know where to look  According to a survey by the disability charity Scope two out of three people feel uncomfortable talking to a disabled person So they have launched a campaign to help people to end this perpetual awkward standoff  The awkwardness goes both ways though rest assured  My tablet computer speaks my words in a synthetic voice but I have to write those words first And because people see me writing people think Im also deaf for some reason  Im not You dont have to write everything that you want to say to me on a piece of paper I can understand you perfectly  Of course I will wait while you write down what you want to say to me as by then Ill feel awkward too and Im not going to make the situation worse by explaining things Ill take the easy way out and let you continue partly because Im too polite and partly because I cant be bothered to explain it again Often I cant even read your writing but thats another matter Youre not too sure whats up with me either or how to refer to me are you Awkward Often this comes from people youd expect might know a thing or two a doctor once kept calling me physically challenged I always thought that was a game on The Crystal Maze Please dont get me started on the taxi driver who opened a conversation by asking me if I was as clever as Hawking Of course Im not The only thing I know about the universe is that HeMan is the master of it Contrary to popular belief disabled people dont all know each other and we dont all live on Disabled Avenue which is just behind Pigeon Street either The survey by Scope also suggests that  of people dont know anyone who is disabled Either those people are blind which would be very ironic or they dont understand disability that well Were not all in wheelchairs Some disabilities are more visible than others   Only  of people are born with their disabilities The rest I call the notyetdisabled because being ablebodied is not a lifelong certainty Im afraid Now thats certainly awkward Its easy to joke about this awkwardness but it has serious consequences as well   Im fairly sure Ive been overlooked for jobs because potential employers couldnt see past my disability Of course if they had asked me I could have explained how I work and put their minds at rest They probably felt too awkward to ask but until that changes disabled people will always be fighting a losing battle  a particular problem with the benefits system in disarray as it is  When I started in standup comedy I didnt do it to get people talking about disability more openly But Im fairly sure it has helped bridge the gap between disabled people and the notyetdisabled people I like to think Im showing that disability is nothing to be scared of Its something which can be joked about to help put people at ease  So feel free to be curious and ask questions its the only way we can all become less awkward  Just dont write your questions on a piece of paper
