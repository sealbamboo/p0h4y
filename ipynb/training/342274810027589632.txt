When Jason and Stacy Binghams yearold daughter Sierra got a transplant to replace her failing heart the couple thought with relief that their lives could finally go back to normal But six years later they watched in anguish as yearold Lindsey started showing some of the same symptoms that had plagued her older sister before doctors diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy Stomach pain and shortness of breath soon gave way to more frightening symptoms When Lindseys breathing became labored and her face and belly swelled the Binghams rushed her to the emergency room where doctors Xrayed the little girls chest the Haines Ore parents told NBCs Dateline As they waited for the results Jason recalled thinking Oh please Oh please Oh please Oh please have a normal chest xray Please have a normal chest xray Please Well take anything you know Well try our hand at something else I dont want to go down that road again  Then one of the doctors came over to talk to the family He said Tell me more about Sierra Stacy said After the couple told him about Sierras condition he said Shes got the same thing I think I lost it Stacy remembered I couldnt keep my composure and I remember just sobbing The Binghams had just embarked on a traumatic and terrifying odyssey With two out of five children already diagnosed with a rare genetic heart disease odds were that the rest of the kids were at risk too  But at the time Jason and Stacys focus was on Lindsey who was going to need a heart transplant just as Sierra had She was already so sick that she would need the help of an artificial heart to survive until a donor heart became available The next day she was flown from their home in Haines to the Lucille Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto Calif Approximately  out of every  million kids younger than  are diagnosed each year with dilated cardiomyopathy a disease in which the heart becomes increasingly weaker  and larger as it tries to compensate  While the disease can be sparked by a virus about  percent of cases can be traced to genetic mutations said the familys cardiologist Dr Daniel Bernstein a professor of cardiology at Stanford University and a pediatric cardiologist at the Lucille Packard Childrens Hospital At the time when the older sister was first diagnosed not much was known about the genetics that can cause these defects Bernstein told TODAYcom Today there are genetic tests But even with genetic testing it can be difficult to predict what will happen with an individual child Bernstein said Gene mutations boost the risk of having an enlarged and weakened heart but other genes can modify that risk he explained Though there were no genetic tests back when Sierra had her transplant the Binghams asked doctors to evaluate the heart function of all their other children  including Lindsey  And they all came out normal Stacy said So we thought good Then we can rule that out Thats not an issue But then Lindseys heart started to fail And when the Binghams had their other kids rechecked they found more evidence of trouble Their son Gage now  had begun to develop such severe problems with his hearts electrical system that he needed to have a pacemaker implanted  and could require a transplant in the future  And while their other two children werent showing symptoms of heart disease yearold Megan did have a minor abnormality on ultrasound Hunter age  hasnt shown signs of any problems but the family history of heart disease is enough to say hes at risk Bernstein said The average wait for a donor heart for a child is about three months But in Lindseys case the months passed relentlessly three then four then six then seven Still no heart became available Finally after  days the family was told that a heart was on its way  For Lindsey the news was good  but a little frightening  Im just scared a little she said Theyre going to be cutting up my chest and then putting out a heart and putting another one in Meanwhile the family had tough news about Sierra Tests showed that she was starting to reject the heart shed been living with for nearly  years Im sick to my stomach Jason said To be honest its like someone hit me in the gut While the doctors worked on Sierras rejection issue the Binghams learned that Lindsey would have her heart surgery in the wee hours of Valentines Day  Lindsey crying hugged her parents and then was wheeled off to the operating room  At  am Lindseys new heart arrived packaged in a cooler marked Human Heart The organ came from a child who died at a hospital in Nevada the parents learned The surgeons meticulously stitched together all the connections to the new heart and then slipped it inside Lindseys chest Then came the moment of truth They jolted the heart with a defibrillator Immediately the organ began to pump in a regular rhythm  As the weeks went by Lindsey was doing well but Sierras body was still attacking her heart The first set of treatments failed  That light at the end of the tunnel is so close Stacy said Its right there and then the tunnel collapsed But then Sierras doctors told the family they had another treatment option Four more weeks went by with the family nervous but hopeful When the tests came back they showed that the therapy worked For now at least her body had stopped trying to attack her heart  That means  We can go home Jason asked Is that what Im hearing I think so said Stacy  The Binghams know that their joy came at a cost to some other family  It really is a twoedged sword cause you know what it meant said Jason And as much as we love our child and want them to live I cant imagine the grief that the other family has to deal with because they actually had to lose theirs As they get ready to head home the Binghams are counting their blessings Weve walked away twice now with two children still alive and thats more than a lot of people can say here Stacy says We can go home with five children
