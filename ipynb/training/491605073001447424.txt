About half of diagnosed epilepsy cases have no known cause according to the Mayo Clinic For the cases that are identifiable epilepsy is the result of  Genetics Its estimated that up to  genes could be associated with epilepsy according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke but genes are only part of the cause Genes also make certain people more sensitive to environmental conditions that can trigger seizures    Head trauma after a traumatic fall or car accident  Brain conditions such a strokes Alzheimers disease and tumors Strokes are the leading cause of epilepsy in adults over age     Infectious diseases such as AIDS viral encephalitis and meningitis  Prenatal injury such as poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies Developmental disorders such as autism or neurofibromatosis can also play a role In order to be considered an epileptic seizure the seizure has to be unprovoked and occur two or more times according to Dr Lawrence Seiden a board certified neurologist and psychiatrist at the Peachtree Neurological Clinic  While it may be difficult to identify between epileptic and nonepileptic seizures nonepileptic seizures are provoked by a temporary medical condition such as a high fever or low blood sugar levels  In addition epileptic seizures are caused by an electrical problem in the brain unlike nonepileptic seizures Epilepsy symptoms vary from a blank stare during a seizure to repeated twitching of ones arms and legs according to the Mayo Clinic However even mild seizures can be dangerous especially while driving swimming or being at another unsafe location at the time of the seizure   Epilepsy is also associated with other chronic health problems such as depression obesity bone loss and reproductive disorders   Its known as   according to the Mayo Clinic  The cause of SUDEP is unclear but doctors have several theories  Epileptic seizures can cause pauses in breathing also known as apnea When these pauses are long enough oxygen levels in the blood can be reduced to dangerous levels SUDEP may also be caused by an irregular heart rhythm or cardiac arrest One of the common misconceptions about epilepsy Seiden said is the belief that epileptic patients are not normal and suffer from mental illness or mental retardation While people with mental retardation may experience seizures most epileptic patients have normal or aboveaverage intelligence  The majority of people with epilepsy are completely normal except for the few seconds they are having seizures said Seiden The verdict is still out on medical marijuana among epilepsy experts Some scientists believe the healing compound in marijuana called cannabidiol or CBD has medicinal properties that quiet the excessive electrical and chemical activity in the brain that causes seizures While much research is still needed   and adults who suffer from severe seizures have responded to medical marijuana when other medications did not work  Antiepileptic medications are effective in nearly  of the people who are newly diagnosed with epilepsy according to the Mayo Clinic When medications are not effective and the exact area of the brain where the seizure is generated is identified surgery is recommended   Doctors also recommend a highfat lowcarb ketogenic diet for children who suffer from epilepsy    Some of the more famous sufferers or rumored sufferers of epilepsy include the philosopher Socrates French military and political leader Napoleon Bonaparte Nobel prize founder Alfred Nobel Russian novelist Fyodor  Dostoyevsky and several Olympic medalists
