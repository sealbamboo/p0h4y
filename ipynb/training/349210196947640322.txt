like mile hikes As anyone sitting quietly and reading this article probably knows that message did not resonate with most Americans And these days a majority get no planned exercise at all So at the recent annual meeting of the   one of the hottest topics was not how much exercise Americans should be completing but how little Dozens of presentations and seminars examining a variety of activities concluded essentially that a few minutes of any strenuous exercise is sufficient to improve various measures of health and fitness Everyone was talking about those findings said Linda S Pescatello a professor of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut Storrs who attended the conference in Indianapolis Its very appealing obviously the idea that you can get fit in a very short period of time But she and other experts say there are still many unanswered questions about the longterm effects and efficacy of the wildly shrinking doses of exercise being studied and promoted by scientists and journalists   People have been trying to figure out forever what the right amount of exercise is said Dr Paul Thompson a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut who has long studied exercise In the past formal recommendations have called for a substantial amount of regular exercise For example   from the Health and Human Services Department in  suggested  minutes of moderate exercise per week  the equivalent of five minute walks The guidelines added that  minutes of vigorous exercise a week like jogging could be substituted These guidelines were based on a large body of science showing that  minutes of moderate exercise was associated with a longer life span and a reduced risk of heart disease diabetes and other illnesses But in practical terms the guidelines have not been a success By most estimates at least  percent of Americans dont meet the recommendations That has led to the quest to find a smaller amount of exercise that will produce health and fitness benefits without intimidating the millions who dont work out And that in turn has resulted in the rise of interest in very brief highintensity interval training This approach to exercise started to take off in  when   a physiologist at McMaster University in Ontario and his colleagues   showing that a threeminute sequence on an electronic stationary bicycle   seconds of punishing allout pedaling followed by a brief rest repeated five or six times  led to the same musclecell adaptations as  to  minutes of prolonged bike riding The study which was published in The Journal of Physiology soared to the top of the journals most emailed list and stayed there for years Since then Dr Gibala and his colleagues as well as other groups of scientists have been closely parsing the effects of brief bouts of intense exercise trying to determine just what happens in the body when you work it very hard for a short period of time and what dosage of such intense effort is likely to be most effective and tolerable for a majority of people The most recent research suggests that a few minutes per week of strenuous exercise can improve aerobic fitness generally more quickly than moderate activity does In a representative study   Norwegian scientists found that three fourminute runs a week  at a pace equivalent to  percent of a persons maximal heart rate an intensity that will feel frankly unpleasant  improved volunteers endurance capacity by about  percent after  weeks Other   have shown that  to  minutes per week depending on the study of highly intense exercise also improves certain markers of health with volunteers developing improved blood pressure and blood sugar levels after several weeks of these truncated workouts But so far all the studies have been small usually with only a few dozen volunteers most of them men and often young None have been longer than a few months We know from some very good epidemiological studies said Dr Thompson that  minutes of moderate exercise each week is clearly associated with improved health outcomes including longevity and reduced risk of many diseases What we dont know he added is whether that will be the case if people rely solely on a few minutes of intense exercise a week Its particularly unclear whether short hard workouts can help people maintain their weight Weight maintenance means burning more calories than consumed Dr Thompson said and these short sessions do not result in much energy expenditure Nor do they aid much in building muscle Dr Gibala said adding that short intense exercise does not seem to stimulate the hypertrophic physiological pathways that result in larger stronger muscles What the new abbreviated approach to exercise has going for it is brevity In   eight male recreational runners in Britain reported preferring a workout of six threeminute intervals to one involving an easy minute jog because the interval session was soon over It may not be the ideal form of exercise for everyone Dr Gibala said And we have a lot more science to do But he added Im  with a family and very busy and he has found the brief intense sessions to be very helpful So he said this is how I work out now Many scientists in the United States and abroad are conducting or planning additional studies of the effects of brief intense training Dr Gibala said But financing for large studies in this field is difficult to obtain and results from longterm studies wont of course be available for years For now he says if youd like to try a highintensity session first visit a doctor for clearance then simply push yourself very hard during your next workout whether it is running cycling or Zumba Researchers havent established a definitive period of time for an interval to provide maximum health benefits Dr Gibala said  although in his research and experience a minute of hard effort followed by a minute of gentle recovery is effective Complete  such intervals three times a week for a total of  minutes of strenuous effort he said and our data would indicate youll be in pretty good shape
