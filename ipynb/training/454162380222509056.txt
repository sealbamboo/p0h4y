For doctors hospitals and insurance companies all the complexities of medicine get boiled down into a system of codes These codes are used to track and pay for every procedure you can think of Theres   for mending a broken forearm and  for treating a concussion Theres even  for being hurt in an unarmed fight or brawl But this coding system is now four decades old The codes were scheduled to be upgraded in October but last week Congress delayed the switch JaeLynn Williams for one is seriously bummed out Its kind of like looking forward to Christmas and it doesnt come she says Williams and her company M Health Information Systems are helping about  hospitals upgrade from the old coding system called ICD to the new one ICD Its a  million project for M Health Williams   about the upgrade since it will give doctors hospitals researchers and insurance companies better data  which will allow them to zero in on the best most costeffective treatments With ICD theres only so much information thats captured with each code she says ICD offers about   for procedures ICD has about  Without very specific codes cardiologists for example cant differentiate between the dozens of different kinds of implants now commonly used to open clogged arteries Williams says So we cant use the data to analyze which implant had a better outcome she says We cant use the data to determine which implant results in the shortest recovery time You wont be able to use the data to understand which implant had the best longterm success For better research health care needs to upgrade to ICD and everybody needs to do it at the same time The White House has been trying to coordinate the shift   But some doctors in smaller practices welcome the delay like Eric Novack an orthopedic surgeon in Phoenix Its good news for us because there are enough challenges going on now with things changing in health care he says For Novack upgrading to the new coding system would have a significant impact on the ability of the  doctors in the practice to take care of patients efficiently And support staff needs expensive training too We can put that on hold and not have to worry about having to spend that big chunk of money at this time he says Doctors and small hospitals are already struggling with   beyond the ICD upgrade such as implementing electronic health records in the first place says   a health information technology consultant Weve asked way more than weve ever asked from an IT standpoint from a project standpoint from a dollar standpoint Lavelle says Their vendors havent provided them updated software so they cant start testing or planning and they just havent gotten started or pushed their vendors to get started But big hospitals and insurance companies have invested heavily in being ready to switch to ICD six months from now Theyve already sunk millions into retraining staff and many have started testing the new systems in anticipation of the October  deadline After all the Department of Health and Human Services was   as recently as February And HHS didnt ask Congress for the delay it was part of a political compromise Congress pushed back the deadline which many doctors wanted at the same time it passed a major Medicare bill that doctors didnt like Ms Williams says her clients worry the delay will make upgrading harder in the future I think the biggest issue with the delays is the lack of trust that any new deadline will be held to she says In a written statement to NPR HHS says it is studying Congress action and will provide guidance on a new deadline for the coding upgrade soon
