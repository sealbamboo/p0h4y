Nearly  percent of   in the United States are performed robotically say researchers who found the robo procedures jumped dramatically between  and  But they question whether robotic surgery is preferable to another minimally invasive procedure   for women having their uterus removed for noncancerous conditions While the two procedures have similar complication rates the robotically assisted hysterectomy costs roughly  more than the laparoscopic procedure according to the new study The robotically assisted procedure was substantially more expensive said the studys lead author Dr Jason Wright an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City Wright said more work is needed to determine which women would benefit from robotic hysterectomy This data also raises a lot of questions about surgical innovations and the need to find ways to better study them before they diffuse into practice he added Results of the study are published in the Feb  issue of the  Hysterectomy is a common treatment for noncancerous gynecological conditions such as fibroids endometriosis and excessive bleeding As many as one in nine US women will undergo such a procedure according to the study Different surgical techniques exist for performing a hysterectomy One choice is traditional open surgery where a surgeon removes the uterus through a  to inch opening in the abdomen Another is vaginal hysterectomy  removal of the uterus through the vaginal opening Laparoscopy is done with special tools that allow surgeons to perform the surgery using only small incisions Robotically assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery but the surgeon uses a robotic device instead of a laparoscope to do the procedure Dr Michael Zinner chief of surgery at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston said there are advantages to robotically assisted surgery in certain situations The robotic device is easy to learn Zinner said The wrist on the machine gives you greater flexibility unlike a straight laparoscope thats more like a chopstick If the surgeon has any slight tremor the machine evens it out he said In cases such as prostate surgery where the surgery must take place in a very confined space and theres a significant risk of nerve damage the delicate articulating robotic device can be ideal he said But for larger areas of the body a laparoscope generally works just as well Nobody talks about using robotic surgery for removing the   noted Zinner because it would be more expensive without providing an additional benefit Zinner cowrote an editorial in the same issue of the journal In the current study Wright and his colleagues reviewed data from more than  women who had a hysterectomy for a noncancerous condition Robotically assisted hysterectomies were performed  percent of the time in  By  that number had jumped to  percent The rate of laparoscopic surgery also increased during this time period from  percent to  percent according to the study At hospitals that introduced robotically assisted hysterectomy its use quickly rose the study found But at hospitals without the robotic option use of laparoscopic hysterectomy increased during the same time period Overall abdominal and   declined  hysterectomy was less likely to lead to a hospital stay of two days or more compared to laparoscopic surgery but the two procedures were similar in all other measured complications Where the two procedures differed most significantly was in cost with  the median fee for a laparoscopic hysterectomy versus  for the robotically assisted procedure Joel Weissman deputy director and chief scientific officer at the Center for Surgery and Public Health at Brigham and Womens Hospital and coauthor of the editorial said the robotic machine costs about  million and requires extra personnel Its a little bit unclear whos paying the extra cost he said It seems like at this point in time insurers are paying the same whether the surgery is robotically assisted or not But hospitals have to somehow pay those extra costs If youre considering a robotically assisted procedure Zinner and Weissman advised talking with your doctor about which procedure will deliver better results If two procedures are similarly effective they suggested comparing costs In the case of hysterectomy because robotically assisted surgery and laparoscopic surgery have similar results but significantly different costs Zinner said hed like to see more surgeons training in the laparoscopic procedure  Copyright     All rights reserved
