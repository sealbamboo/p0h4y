This week Belgium is expected to become the first country in the world to allow terminally ill children to choose euthanasia Belgium legalized euthanasia in  for those  and over and the number of adults choosing a doctorassisted death has been rising annually reaching  in  But a bill before Parliament would lift age restrictions and allow terminally ill children to ask to be euthanized if they are in unbearable pain and treatment options are exhausted In addition their parents and medical team would have to agree Belgiums Senate passed the bill by a wide margin in December and the House of Representatives looks set to do the same in a vote planned for Thursday In discussions about the proposal some members of Parliament say they think that  to  gravely ill Belgian children annually will invoke the law and ask to die Neonatal pediatrician Olivia Williams has spent her career trying to save the lives of desperately ill children in one of Brussels best criticalcare wards Ive seen children ask to die she says children with terminal cancer suffering children who refuse another operation that might give them another three months They ask to die they dont want it Not all of them but it does happen Williams says kids should have the same options as adults in ending their pain and suffering If you go to a geriatric ward patients with the same quality of life and the same life expectancy as a yearold with bone cancer you wouldnt let them suffer she says When they ask you to go youd let them go But Els Van Hoof a senator with the Flemish Christian Democratic party strongly opposes the legislation She insists children cant possibly understand the implications of such a request They cant legally drink before theyre  They cant smoke before theyre  They cant vote before theyre  They cant marry before theyre  They cant be punished because they dont have the competence she says But when they talk about life and death they can decide Its not coherent Van Hoof worries overstretched parents will be the ones asking for their childrens euthanasia or manipulating vulnerable kids into asking for it Beyond that she believes the law is simply unnecessary since Belgium already allows whats called palliative sedation That allows doctors to increase pain medication to the point of eventual death when a patients endoflife suffering can no longer be alleviated in a conscious state Religious leaders also oppose the measure A group representing several faiths issued a statement saying the law risks trivializing the sanctity of life and sets a dangerous path for society Catholic bishops have also condemned the measure Decades ago that would have carried a lot of weight in this heavily Catholic country The Church has the opinion that life is a gift from God and that we dont have the right to throw it away says religious commentator Rik Torfs a former parliamentarian and current rector of Catholic University of Leuven He says that the huge public support for the bill is another mark of an erosion of religious faith In the past people were very Catholic and they thought OK we are not living nice days over here but after our death everything will be beautiful he says Now they are saying OK nothing will happen afterward so try to construct a happy end which means a death controlled by ourselves
