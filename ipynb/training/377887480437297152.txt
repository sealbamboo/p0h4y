Strenuous exercise seems to dull the urge to eat afterward better than gentler workouts several new studies show adding to a growing body of science suggesting that intense exercise may have unique benefits As readers of this column know short intense workouts usually in the form of intervals that intersperse bursts of hard effort with a short recovery time have become wildly popular lately whether the sessions     or slightly longer Studies have found that such intense training no matter how abbreviated usually improves aerobic fitness and some markers of health including blood pressure and insulin sensitivity as effectively as much longer sessions of moderate exercise What has not been clear though is whether interval training could likewise also aid in weight control So for a study   in The International Journal of Obesity researchers at the University of Western Australia in Perth and other institutions set out to compare the effects of easy versus exhausting exercise on peoples subsequent desire to eat To do so they recruited  overweight but otherwise healthy young men in their s or s and asked them to show up at the universitys exercise physiology lab on four separate days One of these sessions was spent idly reading or otherwise resting for  minutes while on another day the men rode an exercise bike continuously for  minutes at a moderate pace equivalent to  percent of their predetermined maximum aerobic capacity A third session was more demanding with the men completing  minutes of intervals riding first for one minute at  percent of their endurance capacity then spinning gently for  minutes The final session was the toughest as the men strained through  seconds of pedaling at  percent of their normal endurance capacity then pedaled at barely  percent of their maximum capacity for a minute with the entire sequence repeated over the course of  minutes Before and after exercise and rest the scientists drew blood from the men to check for levels of various substances known to influence appetite They also provided their volunteers with a standardized liquid breakfast at the end of each minute session Then about  minutes later they let the men loose at a table loaded with a sweetened but bland porridge The researchers wanted to avoid rich aromas or other aspects of food that might influence the mens desire to eat they hoped to isolate the effects of pure appetite  which needs to be robust to make porridge enticing As it turned out gruel was quite appealing to the men after resting or pedaling moderately they loaded their bowls But their appetites were noticeably blunted by each of the interval workouts and in particular by the most strenuous second intervals After that session the men picked at their porridge consuming significantly less than after resting or training moderately They also displayed significantly lower levels of the hormone ghrelin which is known to stimulate appetite and elevated levels of both blood lactate and blood sugar which have been shown to lessen the drive to eat after the most vigorous interval session than after the other workouts And the appetitesuppressing effect of the highly intense intervals lingered into the next day according to food diaries that the men completed They consumed fewer calories during the subsequent  hours after the very intense second intervals than after any of the other workouts These results parallel those of another recent study of exercise intensity and appetite   for which obese teenage boys were asked to spend  hours within an enclosed metabolic chamber that constantly measured their energy intake and output The boys made three visits once resting throughout their stay and on the other two occasions exercising on a stationary bicycle at either a moderate or highly intense pace until they had burned about  calories Afterward they were allowed to eat whatever they chose from a varied buffet and being teenaged boys they chose plenty more than replacing their energy output each time But after the intense session they ate significantly less over all consuming about  percent fewer calories than after resting or pedaling moderately The upshot of both of these studies is that intense exercise leads to a shortterm suppression of food intake said Aaron Sim a postgraduate researcher at the University of Western Australia who led the study of adults and interval exercise That conclusion would seem to be fine news for anyone hoping to deploy exercise to trim a waistline But Mr Sim cautions that the studies available to date including his are very shortterm covering only one session of the various exercise options Whether or not weeks or months of intense training would have an impact on longterm weight management remains to be determined he said Its also important to note that both of these studies involved fairly young male volunteers all of them overweight Whether the findings would apply equally to women older men and people of either gender who are normal weight remains unknown Still the results are heartening not least because in Mr Sims study although the exertion involved in the interval sessions was much greater than in the moderate workout the men reported that they enjoyed the grueling exercise every bit as much
