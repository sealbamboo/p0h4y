Still groggy from the hour liver transplant surgery that saved his life Thomas Dodds demanded a pen and paper to send a message to the adopted sister who made it possible  Thank you Marj the Pittsburgh man  wrote in a wobbly but readable script last December And then he added a shaky ink heart  It was the first thing he could do Dodds says to repay his sibling Marj Kilcup for being both a rare live liver donor  and a perfect match  Seven months later sister and brother are recovering well from the swap that takes part of a liver from a live donor and transplants it into the body of a sick patient Doctors say the siblings  who were a surprising match considering they arent biologically related  are an example of the success of the rare procedure that could help ease Americas organ shortage crisis which has left nearly  actively waiting for transplants each year including nearly  who are hoping for livers People who are healthy and willing should consider being tested to be living donors for a loved one or even a stranger said Aisha Michel spokeswoman for Donate Life America an advocacy agency Today living donors can donate kidneys livers lungs and intestines The trouble Many people dont know that this is a possibility said Dr Cristiano Quintini the Cleveland Clinic transplant surgeon who supervised Kilcups care For Dodds adopted sister Marj Kilcup  there was never any question that shed step up for the operation to help her brother whose liver was being destroyed by a rare genetic disorder Its like life calls and you answer said Kilcup a dental hygienist from Puyallup Wash I was just meant to do this Kilcups selfless act is unusual Indeed when it comes to livers only about  percent of the  organs transplanted in the US each year come from living donors The operation is so complicated and the availability of donors is so scarce that only  such procedures were performed in  according to figures from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network or OPTN Ive done transplants for more than  years and its nowhere close to any other procedure we do in terms of difficulty Quintini said  Such operations are often the only answer for patients like Dodds who was born with Alpha antitrypsin deficiency a rare condition in which the liver doesnt make a protein that protects the lungs The international business consultant was fairly healthy until about six years ago when his condition began deteriorating In  he developed a serious warning sign spontaneous bacterial peritonitis a potentially lifethreatening infection  They said I might as well start looking down the road of a liver transplant said Dodds who was added to the transplant waiting list in September   But that list includes those nearly  people all hoping for one of the  organs that come from deceased donors in the US each year Despite Dodds declining condition he knew he wasnt sick enough to get a liver within a year the timeframe his doctors recommended  I could probably have survived  years but my quality of life would have suffered he explained They said your options are Can you find a donor As he started to look Dodds realized that he was fortunate to have landed at the Cleveland Clinic one of only about  liver transplant centers in the country that performs  or more live liver donor operations a year Although there are roughly  centers in the US that do liver transplants only half will accept living donors and most of them perform only one or two of the operations per year Quintini said Dodds was also lucky to have a homegrown donor who turned out to be a surprisingly good match Of his three adopted siblings Kilcup had always said shed be a donor if her brother needed it But when the time actually came doctors were skeptical  There were blood tests to do and tissue typing In addition Kilcup is foot and while Dodds tops out at  feet so they feared her liver would be too small to function well in her bigger brother But early tests showed Dodds and Kilcup shared the same blood type Apositive There were no tissue typing conflicts And when a D model of her liver was made it turned out that Kilcups right liver lobe was exceptionally large the perfect size and proportion to fit into her brother  Thats fairly interesting about Marj and Tom Quinitini said Because they were probably the least favorable combination Still there were worries Live donor transplants including liver transplants are not without risk Even one catastrophic failure can have devastating consequences for patients  and the programs The  death of a healthy yearold New York man who donated part of his liver to his brother sent live donations plunging transplant experts say  Overall the risk of early death among live liver donors is about  cases per  donors according to a  paper led by Dr Dorry Segev a transplant expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine There have been four deaths of living liver donors among the more than  transplants performed since  according to OPTN  For comparison OPTN officials estimate that there were  deaths of living kidney donors between  and  out of more than  live donor transplants The longterm mortality rate is comparable for living kidney and liver donors Segev concluded Still on Dec   when the siblings were being wheeled to separate surgeries they both say there was no fear or worry She said See you tomorrow Dodds recalled I said See you tomorrow  Nearly  percent of Kilcups healthy liver was transplanted into Dodds leaving her with barely a third of her original organ  The aftermath wasnt easy of course Kilcup said the first four days were pretty terrible and the operation left her with a scar that runs from her chest to her belly button  But both siblings are back to work and have resumed normal lives with their spouses and kids Kilcup ran a halfmarathon within three months of the swap They see each other only once a year or so when they visit their parents in Ottawa Canada but they talk or email weekly  and they say they feel connected in deeper way too We keep in good touch Kilcup said  Dodds remains profoundly grateful to his sister but she says gratitude is beside the point because there was no other option  If something had happened to him theres no way I could wake up in the morning knowing that I could have helped him and that I didnt she said Its not brave its just what you do Now shes become an advocate for live liver donation For more information on live donation  My thing is not so much Look what I did but Look what you can do too she said Sometimes I think if people know its an option theyll be more proactive JoNel Aleccia is a senior health writer with NBC News You can reach her on Twitter at   or
