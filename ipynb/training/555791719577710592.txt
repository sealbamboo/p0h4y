Vodka is our enemy so well utterly consume it goes the old Russian proverb That lovehate relationship is thought to have helped send  of Russian men in  to the grave before they had toasted their th birthday And a new study finds that despite fitful campaigns to stem heavy drinking vodka continues to exact a huge toll on Russian men Among male Russian smokers  of those in the hardestdrinking category  those who consumed more than a liter and a half of vodka per week  died between the ages of  and  the   found That death rate was more than twice as high as it was for lighter drinkers  of whom died before age  The heaviest drinkers were a minority at  of subjects in that age group while  were classified as lighter drinkers But fully  of the Russian men in the study were classified as heavy or intermediate drinkers meaning they drank more than a bottle of vodka  half a liter  per week Among the intermediate male drinkers  those who said they consumed between half a liter and and a liter and a half of vodka weekly   died between ages  and  A dismal  of Russias male smokers who were in the lightest drinking category died between ages  and  the study found But among the hardest drinkers  died somewhere between those ages Among the intermediate male drinkers  those who said they consumed between half a liter and and a liter and a half of vodka weekly  would die between ages  and  and  would expire between ages  and  Virtually all of Russias male drinkers also smoke so the authors of the latest research largely found they were comparing the death rates of male smokers as a function of how much vodka they drank The basic unit of measurement they used were bottles of vodka consumed per week  a bottle being a halfliter  the equivalent of roughly  single servings of alcohol by US standards The latest research published Thursday in the journal Lancet improves on past efforts to assess vodkas wages on the Russian populace For existing studies researchers have visited the homes of random Russians after they died and asked family members to report on the extent of their drinking Such methods can be unreliable because families recollections are often colored by the circumstances of the death The latest study is prospective meaning that researchers starting in  recruited  Russian participants older than  while they were still alive and healthy and asked them how much vodka they consumed as well as other forms of alcohol which were not as common and which generally tracked with vodka consumption Most were reinterviewed three years after the first occasion to assess whether their drinking habits had markedly changed  many had but in differing directions Then the authors let the clock tick till  and counted which of their subjects had died and how The authors of this study hailed from several research centers in Russia and from Oxford University the French Cancer Research Agency in Lyon and Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai New York The groups earlier research had found that the bulk of premature deaths of heavy drinkers in Russia were attributable to a cluster of external causes  accident suicide violence alcohol poisoning  or a group of diseases including liver cancer cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract tuberculosis pneumonia liver or pancreatic disease or acute ischemic heart disease that is not heart attack The average life expectancy of men in Russia is only  years putting it  among the lowest  countries in the world In a commentary published alongside the new study Juergen Rehm of Torontos Center for Addiction and Mental Health wrote that since alcohol is clearly a contributor to those early deaths statesanctioned policies that reduce the availability of alcohol including price increases can be a valuable tool for improving Russian mens longevity After the collapse of the Soviet Union in  deaths among Russian men younger then  rose steeply peaking in  declining a bit when the ruble collapsed in  and then climbing again until  Since strict new policies restricting alcohol sales in  premature death rates among Russian men have begun to fall but by  had not yet reached levels that prevailed in the final years of the Soviet Union when the thenPresident Mikhail Gorbachev imposed significant strictures on alcohol sales  An earlier version of this post was unclear concerning the statistical relationship between two groups in the study indicating that lighter drinkers had higher death rates than heavy drinkers The death rate for heavy drinkers was more than twice as high as it was for lighter drinkers
