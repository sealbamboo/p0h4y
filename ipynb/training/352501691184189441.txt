Disease detectives have traced the continuing outbreak of hepatitis A that has so far sickened  people in the US to a shipment of pomegranate seeds from the Anatolian region of Turkey As a result the Food and Drug Administration has  any new shipments from the company that shipped the suspect fruit Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading to be seized at American ports That should be enough to end this outbreak   is commonly spread when food workers dont wash their hands after using the bathroom But in the current outbreak there are slight variations in the virus among the people who have fallen ill That suggests that the pomegranate may have become contaminated with sewage carrying the virus from more than one person Its unsettling to think that a few people in Turkey could cause a serious disease   halfway around the world It makes global food safety seem like a highstakes version of the s childrens game  All of the people who have fallen ill bought the organic frozen berry mix at Costco a company renowned for its food safety efforts Given that the US gets  percent of its fresh fruit  percent of its fresh vegetables and  percent of its seafood from other countries are we doomed to more outbreaks like this We called up   deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the FDA to find out I do think that the hepatitis A outbreak is a wonderful snapshot of the makeup of the global food system and the challenges it presents for food safety Taylor told The Salt It reflects the diversity of conditions in the scores and scores of countries involved he says The frozen berry mix in this outbreak had been packaged by Townsend Farms Inc of Fairview Ore using berries and pomegranate arils or seed kernels from the US Argentina Chile and Turkey  a miniUnited Nations of fruit The FDA currently inspects less than  percent of food imports so oversight of imports is left largely to the US processors and distributors They often hire companies called thirdparty auditors to inspect foreign producers and processors Some of those thirdparty audits have been conducted well Taylor says and some are not done well In the case of produce he adds it includes paying attention to the microbial quality of the water used in processing In one   from  a private auditor gave a cantaloupepacking facility glowing reviews while it was shipping out melons contaminated with listeria  people died Back in  Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act intended to remedy those problems But the law is only just now on the way to being put in action In January the FDA released proposed   for two key aspects of the new foodsafety law sciencebased standards for fruit and vegetable farms and requirements for food processors to develop controls to prevent contamination Other proposed regulations on accreditation of thirdparty auditors and a requirement that US importers have a foreignsupplier verification program are in the works A central feature of FSMA is that we have better ways to make sure those standards are being met says Taylor It doesnt do any good to have regulations on the books if we cant inspect and enforce The law gives the FDA more power to oversee thirdparty auditors and to do its own inspections overseas But both of those tasks cost money and its not clear if Congress will hand over the kind of cash needed to do it right We have to be realistic Taylor says Theres no switch were going to turn off and have no foodborne illness But we ought to be conscious of where the hazards are
