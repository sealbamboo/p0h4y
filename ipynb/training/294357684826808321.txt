 Thinking of getting a cat? European researchers found that acquiring kitty as an adult can lead to .  to cat dander.. The risk is lower if you had a cat as a child but higher if you already have some other allergies, according to Giuseppe Verlato, PhD, of the University of Verona in Verona, Italy, and colleagues.. On the other hand, adults who get a cat but don't let it in the bedroom appear to be unlikely to become sensitized to the animal, Verlato and colleagues reported online in the . .. The bottom line, the researchers concluded, is that "acquiring a cat increases the risk of cat sensitization in adulthood, particularly when the cat is allowed in the bedroom.". The findings come from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS), a large cohort study of asthma conducted from 1991 through 1993.. The aim of the analysis was to determine the risk of new-onset sensitivity to cats as a function of changes in cat ownership.. The cat was allowed in the bedroom by 94.3 percent of the people who had a cat at both surveys and by 92.5 percent of those who got a cat during the follow-up. Two-thirds of those who got rid of their cat between the surveys had allowed the cat in the bedroom.. Over the follow-up period, 231 people developed . .. Analysis showed:. Interestingly, none of the adults who got a cat but .  became sensitive to cat dander during follow-up, the researchers reported, compared with 61 of the 1,262 (4.8 percent) who did let the new cat into the bedroom. The difference was significant, but the study had insufficient power to evaluate the issue.. The researchers cautioned that changes over time both in cat ownership and sensitization were assessed at only two points. Also, they noted, the data on pet keeping in childhood were based on retrospective reporting by adults, which could have been affected by recall bias.
