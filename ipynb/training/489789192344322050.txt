The first time I saw a patient who had received CPR the experience wasnt what I expected Sure I thought she wouldnt look well After all her heart had just stopped beating But I wasnt prepared for the scene before me a frail woman in her mids barely conscious vomiting with broken ribs and a bruised lung Her stomach was bloated and her chest was bleeding She looked more like a survivor of CPR than of cardiac arrest I thought to myself When she died a few days later I couldnt help wondering if she really knew what she was getting herself into At most hospitals its routine to ask patients about their resuscitation preferences when theyre admitted regardless of how healthy they are In the event your heart stops beating and If you are unable to breathe on your own are commonly used  though probably not the most helpful phrases introducing these discussions In conversations Ive had with patients Ive encountered a variety of responses One patient  young and relatively healthy  became tearful assuming that I was asking because of his imminent demise Some have avoided the discussion because they didnt think it was likely or maybe didnt want to think it was likely Most have thoughtfully grappled with the issue But consistently most of the patients I talk to dont understand what exactly CPR is what its for and what its risks and benefits are The origins of cardiopulmonary resuscitation  date back centuries The thcentury physician Andreas Vesalius wrote But that life maybe restored to the animal an opening must be attempted in the trunk of the tracheayou will then blow into this so that the lung may rise Two centuries later the Scottish surgeon William Tossach described performing mouthtomouth resuscitation on a coal miner I applied my mouth close to his and blowed my breath as strong as I could But it wasnt until the s that CPR in its current form was introduced into American medicine initially as a treatment for sudden cardiac arrest after heart attacks drowning drug overdoses and other potentially reversible conditions By  it was so widely used that the American Medical Association issued a recommendation that patients preferences be documented in their medical records Since then the use of CPR has continued to grow and millions of people around the globe have been trained to perform it Experts say CPR is a lifesaver and with good reason Each year more than  people  in the United States  one every  seconds  experience cardiac arrest The vast majority of these do not occur at a hospital and those who receive CPR from a bystander are   more likely to survive than someone who doesnt receive such assistance But CPR is not without its drawbacks especially for patients with chronic conditions and terminal illnesses Patients who receive CPR may sustain not only a number of immediate complications like rib fractures damaged airways and internal bleeding but also serious longterm consequences like brain damage resulting from extended oxygen deprivation Some argue that in patients with very low likelihood of returning to a reasonable quality of life CPR leads to an unnecessarily prolonged and painful death Precise survival rates after receiving CPR are tough to come by and vary according to patients underlying health status   that about  percent of patients who receive CPR after experiencing cardiac arrest in a hospital survive immediately after being resuscitated and only  to  percent survive long enough to be discharged Research also suggests that patients significantly overestimate the likelihood of success   of older patients found that  percent believe their chances of leaving the hospital after CPR are greater than  percent and almost a quarter believe their chances are higher than  percent This discrepancy is important because patients preferences for CPR are strongly related to their perception of how likely it is to be successful Older adult patients are   to want CPR near the end of life when they are told the true probability of survival Some have suggested that misrepresentations of CPR on television may lead patients to have unrealistic expectations of what the procedure entails and the likelihood of success Survival rates for patients receiving CPR on popular primetime medical TV shows have traditionally been much higher than in the real world   found that  percent of TV patients who receive CPR are alive immediately after and  percent of patients survive in the long term   has shown that though recent shows like Greys Anatomy have more accurate immediate survival rates they are still misleading TV portrayals of CPR are mostly binaryfull recovery or deathwith little attention given to survival to discharge or longterm disability TV patients also tend to be younger and experience cardiac arrests because of trauma unlike realworld CPR recipients who tend to be older and have longstanding heart and lung disease Its not unreasonable to think that news media representations of CPR are shaping patients views of the procedure Many older adult patients   TV as a primary source of health care information and   of adolescents found that those who watched more medical dramas have significantly higher estimates of CPR survival rates Other work suggests that almost all people have unrealistic expectations of CPR but those who use TV as a source of information have the   None of this means that CPR isnt effective in many situations or that it should be performed less frequently But it does mean that theres a lot to clarify CPR is one of the few treatments that patients must expressly opt out of instead of opting in to and as such carries a special burden of explanation Preserving patients autonomy and assuring their true desires are reflected require that they have an accurate understanding of CPR In the end we are all potentially providers and recipients of CPR and we should know what were getting in to
