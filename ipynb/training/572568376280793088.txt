You've got to act fast to fight off . . Case in point: University of Arizona scientists have found that when someone is sick in an office, it takes only four hours (!) for surfaces like coffeepot handles, copy-machine buttons and the fridge door to show traces of infectious virus. Considering that the 2017-2018 flu season was such a bad one, it's well worth arming yourself against aches, cough, fever, and general misery. For reality-tested tips that actually work, we turned to doctors, politicians, makeup artists and other brave souls who are exposed to viruses every day.
