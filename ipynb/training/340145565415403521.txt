Assume that Cynthia Browns audience as she addressed the American Geriatrics Societys annual scientific meeting in Texas this month already knew that hospitalized older adults spend too much time in bed Her listeners  geriatricians nurses administrators  had probably observed for themselves how quickly elderly patients become deconditioned how even a few days of bed rest causes loss of strength and muscle mass while the risks of blood clots bed sores and pneumonia increase Dr Brown the director of geriatric medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham has been sounding this alarm for a decade But one number sent a murmur through the auditorium anyway  minutes Thats the median time   Dr Brown and her colleagues reported in  Healthy older adults at home are on their feet more than six hours a day But in this small study hospitalized patients in their s spent  percent of their time in bed according to the accelerometers attached to their thighs and ankles to measure movement Fortythree minutes And this was a population that wasnt delirious that didnt have dementia Dr Brown said when we spoke later They were able to walk in the two weeks before they were admitted Once they have donned their immodest gowns another problem however the patient thinks hes supposed to lie there and no one says We want you to get up  So even when doctors fix whatever problem brought older people to the hospital prolonged immobility often sends them to rehabilitation ie a nursing home for weeks or sometimes for good The less their mobility Dr Brown has determined the greater the   like bathing or dressing Less active patients were also much more likely to be discharged to institutions Anyone gets weaker after days spent horizontally but older people have less of what doctors call physiologic reserve If we put you in bed for the typical three to fiveday stay we might tip you over the edge Dr Brown cautioned So youre not able to recover your previous level of functioning Her Texas talk  she was receiving an award for outstanding scientific achievement  encompassed both depressing and heartening findings One consequence of hospitalization she reported is a reduction in something called lifespace mobility a scale measuring how often a person leaves the room where he sleeps leaves his home moves around his neighborhood or goes into town Patients in their s who had surgical hospitalizations  joint replacement even heart surgery  show sharp declines in such mobility but they recover fairly quickly But patients hospitalized for medical reasons thereafter inhabit a narrower world they   even two years later They stay a lot closer to home Dr Brown said Unless  and heres the better news  they get up and walk in the hospital When I last wrote about   I mentioned research by Dr Steven Fisher of the University of Texas Medical Branch showing that elderly patients went home two days earlier if they did modest amounts of early walking Dr Browns latest experiment involved  patients at the VA Medical Center in Birmingham Those in the mobility group received twicedaily visits from staff members who helped them out of bed and brought them a wheeled walker if they needed one They were encouraged to get up and do as much as they could to take meals in a chair or walk  feet or make a loop around the ward Dr Brown said Their progress was tracked in a folder The control group received visits too Wed talk about football or the kids Dr Brown said But not encourage them to move A month after discharge the mobility group showed virtually no change in their lifespace score but those who had not walked suffered a significant decline Their lives had contracted To climb out of a hospital bed after a nurse has warned you not even to take the few steps to the bathroom without ringing for help can be frightening to an older person who is sick in pain afraid of falling   makes staff members and administrators nervous too especially because Medicare will not reimburse for additional costs from falls like surgery Even when physicians recognize the hazards of immobility and write orders that include ambulation overworked staff cant always find the time Old people in hospitals walk slowly But entering a nursing home is an alarming prospect too In my own experience hospital nurses seemed grateful when I asked if I could walk with my father I brought his walker it is startling that hospitals dont typically provide them and a robe and supportive slippers wheeled his IV along on a pole and accompanied him up and down the halls several times a day Im convinced that helped him recover Visiting family members cannot give their elders injections or change their IVs but walking is something that  with staff permission  we can take on If families can be there to be cheerleaders and to help it can make a huge difference in the health of an older person Dr Brown said We want people to say We need Mama to get up
