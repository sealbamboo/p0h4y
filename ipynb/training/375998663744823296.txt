One of the most famous scenes in the movie  unfolds when a waitress drops a box of toothpicks on the floor Dustin Hoffmans character Ray takes a look and says    He quickly sums the numbers declaring Of course  total It was almost if Ray had a sense about how many toothpicks were there That he didnt actually need to count them Turns out we all have a bit of this ability  although few of us are as facile as Ray Scientists have found a region of the brain that quickly senses quantities Its a small patch of neurons just above each ear that allows us to say at a glance Oh yeah there are five meatballs on my plate but there are maybe a hundred strands of spaghetti Some scientists think of this ability as a kind of sixth sense something like a number sense One reason is that the skill appears to originate in specific parts of the brain much like our sense of touch and sight a team of scientists   Thursday in the journal   When we see a small number of items visually we dont need to count them says   of Utrecht University in the Netherlands who lead the study We just know how many there are straight away Most people hit their limit at around five items Harvey says Then people get less and less accurate about estimating the quantity But theres definitely variation among people One subject we measured was just beautiful he says His brain responds all the way through the number eight The better you are at number sensing Harvey says the better you tend to do on standardized mathematical tests This part of the brain  and the ones nearby  is active when you do math and solve equations as well But its distinct from the region that recognizes numerical symbols like a  displayed on a computer screen Monkeys arent mathematicians but previous studies had found neurons in monkeys brains that light up when the animals see a specific quantity like three circles on the screen So Harvey and his team went hunting for similar neurons in people The team showed people a series of circles on the screen one circle then two circles all the way up to eight circles They mapped the activity in their brains using a technique called   Throughout the experiments a group of about  neurons  or a clump about the size of a postage stamp  kept lighting up in the fMRI for all eight people they studied And there was a pattern Neurons that sensed the smaller numbers were located on one side of the patch while those that responded to larger numbers were on the other side Its similar to how the brain organizes other senses like touch and sight There are maps on the brain that represent the surface of the skin  or the surface of the retina Harvey says These all reflect an external organ We found the first map for a cognitive function The brain allocates more computing power for tasks it wants to excel at For seeing theres more neurons that process the center of the field vision where you have very sharp vision he says For touch you have huge hands mapped onto the brain but smaller ones for legs The same strategy gets applied to numbers More neurons are devoted to sensing smaller quantities than larger ones Harvey and his team found Thats probably why most people cant count  toothpicks on the floor in a flash but can quickly do it for five toothpicks That brings us back to Ray in   Could some people have even more neurons in their numbersense region and wind up with extraordinary capabilities like Ray Its too soon to tell Harvey says The idea is well known because of the movie   but few such people exist And we havent scanned one he says So we dont really know whether they are doing the same task  that is determining large numbers quickly and accurately like we all do for small numbers We would be very excited to meet one of those savants
