A new study finds patients who had a lower co-payment for a generic statin were not only more likely to take their medicine, but they were also more likely to experience fewer deaths due to heart attack or stroke than those taking a brand-name statin. To wit, patients on a generic statin had an 8% reduction in the rate of adverse outcomes.. And the difference in co-payments was notable. The average out-of-pocket cost to fill a prescription for a generic statin was $10, while a brand-name cholesterol pill cost patients $48. As a result, the lead study author says co-pays should be slashed or waived.
