Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park Surgeons doctors and nurses were turned away after  caravans moved onto the space area Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result But one hospital worker who did not want to be named said it was infuriating Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing the worker said I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp Terry Jones  who was visiting a relative in hospital said Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift It just shouldnt be allowed to happen It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately  spaces We will ensure that security is available on site from ampm every day to reassure and support staff he said We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible  there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible  There has been no disruption to hospital services and in the main staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning Another hospital spokesman Jamie Marchant told the BBC that they believed the travellers were visiting Newport for a family funeral and planned to leave in a few days
