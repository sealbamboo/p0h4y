Critics of Americas health care system say its really a sick care system Doctors and hospitals only get paid for treating people when theyre sick But thats starting to change Health insurance companies and big government payers like Medicare are starting to reward doctors and hospitals for   So many health care companies are trying to position themselves as organizations that help people stay well One of the latest is   a provider of kidney dialysis services The company operates  dialysis centers in the US and  in its fastgrowing   DaVita is making a move into primary care and it just announced a joint venture with a hospital company in Colorado and Kansas DaVita   says its like changing the company from being an electrician into a general contractor And in so doing he says We have a much more comprehensive impact on how the house gets designed how it gets built how it gets maintained for the betterment of those who live in the house Thats the simplest way to characterize the change DaVitas partner in the new venture is   the biggest hospital company in Colorado Like DaVita it is also expanding aggressively into primary care and services beyond hospitalbased procedures Centura   says that in order for his company to keep people healthy it needs the ability to crunch lots of health data The idea is to use computer systems to keep track of peoples health and flag health problems before they happen He says DaVita HealthCare Partners is really good at that Our physicians have gone scouring around the country and believe that Health Care Partners really has the premier analytics So if DaVita wants to grow substantially beyond the current  dialysis patients it serves now it needs to expand beyond just kidney care says Mark Stephens with   In  the company started buying big doctors practices in several states Its hoping that its experience caring for very sick dialysis patients will help it manage family practices and now make hospitals more efficient Stephens also  says DaVita might also be trying to create a model for Medicare to follow That agency currently picks up the tab for about  percent of all Americans getting dialysis He says Medicare has been offering dialysis companies opportunities to assume responsibility for those patients health care beyond dialysis but that the companies havent found the deals attractive so far If DaVitas new joint venture is successful and it lowers the cost of care for both dialysis patients and those who arent as sick the company may be able to win lots of new business from Medicare and private insurance companies
