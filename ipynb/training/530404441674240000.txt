Between birth and seven months of age the average baby born into a twoparent household hears nearly three times as much babbling cooing and singsong questionsandanswers from a woman  generally the mother  than from a man new research shows Virtually no single factor  neither a mothers education level nor a familys financial resources  influences a childs language abilities and IQ more powerfully than does the amount of parental speech a baby hears Pediatric researchers from Women  Infants Hospital of Rhode Island sought to discover which parent that speech comes from and how often  and to which children  parents dispense it What they found is that even on days when both mother and father were with a baby the mother engaged in the lions share of vocalizations aimed at the child Babies returned the conversational favor by vocally responding to their mothers vocal overtures consistently more often than they did to speech from their fathers And mothers in turn were more responsive to conversational overtures from their baby girls than they were to those from their baby boys That preferential pattern was barely discernible by the time the babies were about seven months old But a mothers more consistent early response to a baby girl may help explain why on average girls start talking earlier than boys develop larger vocabularies and greater grammatical complexity than boys read earlier and spell better Another possibility that girls greater responsiveness to vocal cues from the start prompts more ongoing verbal attention from mothers As the babies neared seven months of age however their responses to both parents speech increased The new findings   in the journal Pediatrics emerged from a study that recorded and analyzed hour blocks of vocal interaction between babies and their parents starting from the babies first days in the hospital Twice more over the next seven months  on days when both mother and father were home  the researchers had parents switch on a recording device that would pick up any vocal exchange between baby and parent The researchers didnt count crying or burps or other vegetative sounds as vocal cues Long before discernible language emerges the giveandtake of vocalizations between an infant and his caregiver is thought to serve several key functions it builds a babys sense of effectiveness by teaching that calling out will make someone respond  And it introduces babies to the conventions of human speech and conversation setting the stage for smooth social interaction When a mothers verbal interactions are minimal  as often happens    babies can suffer lasting consequences A   published in  by researchers Betty Hart and Todd R Risley found that by the time they were three years old children growing up in households that received welfare payments heard  million fewer words by age  than did children growing up in professional families Further their parents messages were generally more discouraging and negative than were those of more affluent parents
