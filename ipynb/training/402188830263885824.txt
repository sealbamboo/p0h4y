Since  violence in films has more than doubled the study authors concluded Perhaps more surprising is that gun violence in PG films has tripled since  even exceeding the amount found in Rrated films in more recent years  Parents need to realize that just because a movie has been rated PG does not mean that their yearold should go to see it study author Daniel Romer said We would like to see Hollywood go back to labeling movies with lots of violence and gun violence in particular with an R rating just like they have been doing for explicit sex all along The average American sees seven movies in theaters every year according to Nielsens   Those rated PG are often the highestgrossing bringing in   of the market share The   first began using the PG rating in  The rating urges parents to be cautious saying some material may be inappropriate for preteenagers but theaters do not check IDs for those seeing a PG movie And some worry that exposing children to violence on the screen may encourage them to act it out in real life  There has been a long line of research showing that continued exposure to screen violence among children mainly on TV predicts the emergence of later aggressive behavior Romer said We dont know if seeing gun violence on the screen has a unique effect but it is concerning considering that we have seen a rise in the use of guns in schools and other settings in recent years Experts are still debating whether watching violent movies or playing violent games leads to reallife violence  In  a coalition of public health organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association published   saying science had clearly shown a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children  They said viewing violence led children to view aggressive acts as acceptable behavior and to become emotionally desensitized The effects were measurable and longlasting according to the statement  Since then several scientific studies have shown   And the American Psychological Association has   to review the new evidence and potentially update its position  The problem is that people are looking for a yesorno answer  when there is none Brad Bushman professor of psychology at Ohio State University wrote   for CNN   Bushman and his colleagues recently conducted a study that showed college students who played violent video games for  minutes at a time for three days showed more aggressive behavior each day they played  The argument I hear most often is that video games cant be dangerous because millions of people play these games without becoming violent Bushman wrote Thats because they come from good homes arent victims of bullying dont have mental health issues and dont have many of the other risk factors for violence But what about players who are already predisposed to violence  Those who dont believe a link exists have crime data on their side Coinciding with the rise of violent video games and violence in movies is a   in juvenile violent crime In  at the peak teens aged  to  had a serious violent crime offending rate of  crimes per  juveniles according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics By  that number had dropped to just six crimes per  juveniles  While the study authors saw gun violence in PG films triple the same was not true for R and GPGrated films Violence in Rrated films held at a steady rate while Gand PGrated films saw a decrease over the same time period
