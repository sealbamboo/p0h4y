The administrations actions this week on emergency contraception have left many womens health groups sputtering with anger But what really has some of the President Obamas usual allies irritated is the fact that the moves are in direct contrast to speeches he made in just the past week Recall that on Tuesday the Food and Drug Administration defied a federal judges order to make the morningafter pill available overthecounter to women of all ages by   On Wednesday the Justice Department   the federal judges ruling Yet only last Friday Obama became the first sitting president to address Planned Parenthoods   His spirited defense of reproductive rights included this statement We shouldnt have to remind people that when it comes to a womans health no politician should get to decide whats best for you And on Monday he said this to the   In all the sciences weve got to make sure that we are supporting the idea that theyre not subject to politics that theyre not skewed by an agenda that as I said before we make sure that we go where the evidence leads us But now many womens health advocates say the administration isnt putting its actions where the presidents rhetoric has been It doesnt square and that is whats so disappointing said Nancy Northup Shes president and CEO of the   one of the groups involved in the emergency contraception lawsuit against the administration thats prompted this weeks activity There couldnt be a clearer record than there is in this case that emergency contraception is safe and effective for all ages that we had not one but two administrations who continued to put what they judged as the politics of the issue about contraception ahead of whats doing right for the public health she said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius   to remove the age restrictions in  She said she was worried that the youngest teens wouldnt understand how to use the product safely But thats not a concern for the nations pediatricians who support full overthecounter access to the drug We get derailed over and over again in peoples ethical and moral concerns about whether teens should be sexually active and not that this is a safe drug that can be and should be available to all women of reproductive age said Dr Cora Breuner Shes a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and coauthor of the American Academy of Pediatrics  r on Emergency Contraception Womens health advocates say even the steps the FDA did take this week  to lower the age for sale of the drug without a prescription from  to   doesnt do much because they still have to show identification  and yearolds are much less likely to have an actual government ID with your birth date on it said Susan Wood a public health professor at George Washington University and a former   So that  doesnt really expand access to that age group very much In fact what really worries the womens health groups is that idea that this fight that has already gone on for more than  years now could stretch out years longer
