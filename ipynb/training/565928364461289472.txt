There was cardio and there was strength In the gym the two have long been separate entities in separate sections often with separate audiences If you wanted both you hit the weights first and then jumped into an aerobics or spinning class or vice versa But thats changing Hybrid workouts In the June  Saturday section an article about classes that combine forms of exercise referred to the cofounder of Exhale Gym in Santa Monica as Elisabeth Papp Her name is Elisabeth Halfpapp  Meet the hybrids  classes that hit you with a bunch of activities that you arent used to seeing together running rowing kettle bells sandbags dumbbells calisthenics stretching yoga a ballet barre and more Hybrid workouts throw aerobic and strength workouts in a blender turn up the speed to pure and dare you to keep up Classes such as ShockWave which combines rowing and weights or Orangetheory which combines running and rowing with strength and stretching are thriving Thats because everyone wants to get as much as possible out of an hour nowadays says Elisabeth Papp who added an aerobic function to her longstanding New York Core Fusion Barre and expanded nationwide in the last couple of years Mixing it up is effective and fast Ultimately people pay a gym to push them out of their comfort zone These hybrid classes seem to do a good job at that  Rowing and strength exercises  Row for  seconds Pump weights for  seconds Slam sandbags to the floor for  seconds Do medicineball situps for  seconds Then hit the rower again do prone exerciseball dumbbell flies Bosuball jump squats pushups and lunges all for  seconds each Then do the whole set two more times ShockWave is frantic exhausting and exhilarating a frenzied nonstop rush through eight workout stations It uses interval training to jack your pulse through the roof with the rowing done as twiceperset races and delivers a good strengthtraining pump The best part is how fast its done urgently racing from station to station you lose track of time When it was over  minutes seemed to have gone by in   Firsttimers I talked to after my class at the Irvine Equinox were impressed The music the energy the cardio the fullbody workout  it was very motivating said Person Garcia  a salesman from Costa Mesa who lifts weights and runs twice a week Because of this class Im going to join this club Rowing can be intimidating in large doses because its a new movement pattern so we made it more palatable by breaking it up into small pieces and mixing it up with the other stuff says ShockWave cocreator Josh Crosby a former US national team rower The combination of the interval training with strength stations keeps it exciting and works everything on your body Nobody jumps on a Spin bike after this He was right Id planned to go for a swim after ShockWave I got as far as the hot tub    Running rowing weights suspension straps stretching  Its one thing for a trainer to push you to go faster harder Its another to see your effort measured and displayed in vivid colors on a big video screen up on the wall where everyone else can see if youre dogging it or not Thats the hook at Orangetheory a franchised gym that outfits you with a networked heartrate monitor before you start An instructor pushes you to run and row faster to get your heart rate into the orange  a challenging intervaltraining zone that represents  to  of your maximum heart rate If you go too slowly the color of your rectangle on the big screen is green or blue push too hard and your color changes to red meaning its an allout effort you cant sustain for more than  seconds The goal is to stay in the orange as long as possible ultimately accumulating  to  minutes there by workouts end The orange zone not only burns more calories than a more normal pace it also keeps burning fat long after youre done by jacking up your metabolism and postexercise oxygen consumption More important the psychological reward of seeing your name in orange up on the screen keeps you pushing hard Tellingly nobody left the room when the workout was done until we all got our orange scores and saw how we ranked  Woohoo screamed Christina Nunez a yearold technology recruiter from Newport Beach when she saw that shed been in the orange zone for  minutes A lifelong nonexerciser until last year shed been doing some Spin and Zumba classes until she heard rave reviews of Orangetheory in October from a friend and signed up Im not a runner or a rower and I get bored easily but I wont miss a class of this unlike with the other stuff I want to do this she said I love the action and the muscle definition which Ive never had before This has turned me on to fitness In a big way Shes now training for her first K run    Yoga plank running barre squats and plis and stretching  Among  perfectly coiffed women on yoga mats at the Exhale gym in Santa Monica one sweaty stinky bumbling male stood out But my selfconsciousness and my chauvinist assumption that this would be an easy workout quickly evaporated as the sun salutations warrior poses and downwardfacing dogs of yoga were mixed up with something Id never heard of plank runs In a plank run you assume the top position of a pushup and literally sprint in place pumping your knees alternately into your chin for    seconds or more This rockets your heart rate and transforms a tranquil yoga session into a heaving throbbing interval training session But thats only the half of it After  minutes came the ballet barre and strength work the plyometric squats and plis of the barre method exercises honed over the last couple of decades by Exhale cofounder Elisabeth Papp  We warm you up strengthen posture and alignment with yoga heat you up with cardio then go to strength because now you can really get deep into the positions the New Yorkbased Papp told me when it was over True my thighs and glutes were toast due to holding a variety of singleleg bar positions for a minute or two each Her challenging stretchingstrengthcardio allbody workout concludes with a focus on the center a final  minutes of ab work and stretching    Three LA area locations Santa Monica Hollywood and Venice  Boxing and kicking a heavy bag pushups situps squats sprawls running and stretching  Hybrid workouts are redhot today but theyre not all new KM Bag spun off  years ago as the fitness workout of namesake Krav Maga the Israeli martial art may have kicked off the blendedworkout trend Like ShockWave it has you move to stations positioned around a main attraction But in this case instead of a rowing machine you pound heavy boxing bags And ultimately they pound you Jump rope Pushup Squat Situp Down dog Shadow boxing Running Wrestling sprawls Thats just the minute KM warmup and I was already gasping for breath After that we donned the gloves and began hammering the bag with increasingly complex combinations of punches Leftright Leftrighthook Leftrighthookkick Soon lithe foot women and hulking foot men alike were pounding the heavy bag with six and sevenpunch combinations that would have seemed incomprehensible minutes before While your partners take their turn theres no rest You do pushups squats situps and run around the room The workout climaxes in an epic threestation battle that pits you against the heavy bag a prone groundandpound dummy and bicycle situps I was dazzled by my newfound pugilistic expertise  when I could breathe  The satisfaction I felt over building a skill is by design Even if you just want to get in shape you still want to learn something  like how to punch and how to kick Michael Margolin cofounder of Krav Maga told me You also will learn that punching and kicking are a couple of the most exhausting and heartrate raising fitness activities you can do By the end I was so spent drenched and wasted that I literally could not hold my hands up to my chin anymore Ever wonder why boxers have such great bodies
