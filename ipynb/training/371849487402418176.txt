 Each year one in six Americans becomes sick from eating contaminated food But while outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to processing plants or imported products capture the publics attention and raise fears about the safety of the food supply as many as  percent of food poisoning cases originate in the kitchen People not products are the main cause of foodborne illnesses and they can be avoided by following certain basic principles of food safety Unfortunately some of the best advice like using disposable paper towels in place of reusable cloths and sponges butts headfirst against modern efforts to be green Other measures like discarding leftovers after two days are antithetical to the waste not want not philosophy I was raised on Just before writing this paragraph I reheated and ate a plate of delicious wellcooked leftovers that I had prepared for a dinner party six days earlier and promptly refrigerated Still there are many noncontentious steps that can be taken to minimize the risk that anyone will be sickened by the food you buy and prepare  Seek stores that are clean wellorganized and appear to have high product turnover you can tell partly by checking the expiration and sellby dates on the goods Reject expired products and those in damaged or leaking packages Dont buy more perishables than you can use Pick up dry products first then those that should be kept cold or frozen In warm weather or if there will be delays getting home bring a cooler with ice or a freezer pack to keep items cold Put all raw meats poultry and fish in separate plastic bags before placing them in the shopping cart At checkout have them bagged separately from the dry foods and produce  Separate raw meats poultry and fish from other foods in the refrigerator placing them on the lowest shelf in a bin or on a tray to prevent dripping Freeze meats that will not be cooked within two or three days Use eggs within three to five weeks of purchase In the pantry place newly bought products behind older ones which should be used first Place thermometers in the refrigerator and freezer if they are not built in Make sure the temperatures are at or below  degrees in the refrigerator and  degrees in the freezer Defrost all uncooked foods in the refrigerator the microwave or in a bowl of ice water  Start by washing your hands with soap and warm water Pin long hair back or cover it remove rings and bracelets and put on a clean apron If you should sneeze have to blow your nose or use the bathroom while working with food wash your hands again Half of people harbor the infectious Staphylococcus bacteria in their nasal passages Also wash if you pet the dog or handfeed it while preparing food Wash all produce including melons lemons and limes and fruits that will be peeled before picking up a knife If the fruits surface contains infectious organisms they can spread to its flesh when the fruit is cut Although some suggest that poultry and meats not be rinsed lest they contaminate the sink I find that hard to avoid Instead I rinse them then clean the sink with a bleach spray And I do use clean paper towels to dry raw food Work on wellwashed cutting boards using separate ones for produce and raw animal products I use plastic boards that can be cleaned with a bleach spray or in the dishwasher but wood is fine as long as all implements and boards are washed immediately after each chore Never reuse an unwashed knife plate or board on cooked food that was in contact with raw food without washing it first Crosscontamination from raw to cooked food is a common cause of foodborne illness If making dishes a day or more ahead cover them well chill them quickly and keep them cold until it is time to reheat or serve  You cant always tell if a food is contaminated by its appearance foods containing harmful organisms can look smell and taste OK A goal of cooking is to destroy most infectious organisms Its best to use a food thermometer and to heed recommended final temperatures when preparing meats poultry fish and seafood and eggs Whole cuts of beef veal and lamb should be cooked to an internal temperature of  degrees followed by a threeminute rest off the heat pork and fresh ham should reach  degrees followed by a threeminute rest heat precooked ham to  degrees Ground meats should reach  degrees poultry whole or ground  degrees and fish  degrees or until it is opaque and separates easily with a fork Shrimp lobster and crab should be cooked until the flesh is pearly and opaque Clams mussels and oysters should be cooked until the shells open and scallops until the flesh is milky white or opaque and firm Cook eggs until the yolk and white are firm and cook egg dishes to  degrees If a recipe calls for raw or partly cooked eggs in a dish that will not be cooked like eggnog mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing use only pasteurized eggs which are available in most large markets If you taste a dish while cooking use a clean spoon each time If serving foods buffetstyle over a period of hours use hot plates or cold trays Leftovers should be refrigerated as soon as possible Reheat leftover meats and other animal products to  degrees  You dont have to become a clean freak some exposure to infectious organisms is necessary for a healthy immune system But do take steps to reduce the risk of foodborne illness Kitchen sponges and dishcloths are notorious for harboring and breeding germs Wash them often in the dishwasher or in the sink with hot soapy water or clean them with a bleach solution Never wipe the floor with sponges used on countertops and food preparation equipmentConsider investing in a large package of microfiber cloths Use separate cloths for the floor counters and to dry utensils Put soiled cloths in the laundry When handwashing dishes and pots use very hot water and put them on a rack to airdry Damp dish towels can harbor bacteria Thoroughly clean the refrigerator stovetop and countertops often I use a bleach solution on most surfaces especially those that come in contact with foods
