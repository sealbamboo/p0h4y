Diabetes increases a womans risk of dying from a heart attack or a stroke much more than it does for men and scientists are trying to figure out why Women with diabetes were almost three times more likely to develop heart disease than women without the disease a relative risk thats  percent higher than it is for men Thats despite the fact that men are more likely to have heart disease than women overall Since heart disease already is the number one killer of women and the number of people with diabetes has been rising rapidly this is not good news Researchers looked at  studies dating back to the s which involved more than  people around the world including Europe Asia Australia and North America They found that the sex differences in diabetesrelated cardiovascular risk remained strong across different ages and continents and when nonfatal heart attacks and strokes werent counted Back in the s the difference could have been because women were less likely than men to get diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and to get treatment for it But thats not as true now So we called up Sanne Peters an epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and University Medical Center Utrecht the Netherlands to find out whats going on here Shes an author of the study which was   Thursday in the journal   We are still trying to get our heads around that she told Shots Since sex differences in treatment for heart disease arent as large Peters says We think it may be a biological difference between men and women In the prediabetes phase before diagnosis of fullblown   women tend to have higher risk factors and a worse metabolic profile then men including weight gain And that could mean more cardiovascular risk This could mean that women should get screened earlier and more often for   and that theres better followup for women at risk especially those who had gestational diabetes while pregnant Fortunately the things that reduce diabetes risk work for cardiovascular disease too maintain a healthy weight exercise  minutes a week keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check dont smoke Its important to recognize cardiovascular disease in women Peters says The symptoms are really different For instance half of women who have heart attacks never have   They are likely instead to have heartburn nausea tiredness or trouble breathing
