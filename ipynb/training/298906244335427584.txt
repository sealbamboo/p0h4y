 Treatment with a type  diabetes drug that suppresses appetite and increases feelings of satiety may offer hope to severely overweight teens researchers reported In a small placebocontrolled randomized trial the glucagonlike peptide receptor agonist exenatide Bydureon Byetta was associated with both lower body weight and body mass index BMI according to Aaron Kelly PhD of the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis and colleagues Glucagonlike peptide GLP receptor agonists reduce body weight by slowing gastric motility and activating GLP receptors in the hypothalamus in people with and without diabetes The modest reductions are preliminary evidence that the drug approved for adults with type  diabetes can be useful in adolescents with a BMI of  kgm  or higher Kelly and colleagues reported online in   But they cautioned that the study was short in duration  just  months in the randomized phase followed by a further  months of openlabel treatment  and included fewer than two dozen teens ages  to  Larger studies with longer periods of treatment will be needed they noted to evaluate the durability of the weightloss effect over time Moreover while the results of the trial were statistically significant their clinical importance remains unclear commented Jeffrey Schwimmer MD of the University of California San Diego in an accompanying editorial Schwimmer noted that patients in the study were very obese with an average BMI of  kgm  so that the reductions seen in the study would typically reduce body fat from  percent to at most  percent Is this likely to be clinically meaningful Schwimmer asked The drug had been shown in a previous nonrandomized study to reduce BMI by about  percent To extend those results they studied outcomes of  adolescents randomly assigned to receive exenatide or placebo twice a day by subcutaneous injection twice daily for  months The randomized doubleblinded part of the trial was followed by an openlabel phase in which all patients got the drug The primary endpoint was the change in BMI from baseline to the end of the randomized part of the study Participants in the randomized phase had a baseline BMI of greater than  kgm  at an average age of  gm  Kelly and colleagues found that exenatide patients had an average reduction of  percent in BMI compared with placebo They also had a reduction of  points in absolute BMI compared with those in the placebo group During the openlabel extension those initially randomized to exenatide had a further drop in BMI leading to cumulative decline of  percent In contrast those initially randomized to placebo had less than a  percent decline in BMI during their  months on the drug Kelly and colleagues reported The reason for the latter finding remain unclear Kelly and colleagues noted adding perhaps frustration with the lack of weight loss during the first  months andor the unblinded nature of the openlabel phase led to altered lifestyle behaviors for the remainder of the study Source
