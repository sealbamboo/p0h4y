Doctor Phuoc Le will travel to West Africa next week to join the fight against Ebola  a trip that involves a great deal of sacrifice On top of the month he will spend in rural Liberia teaching rural clinics how to handle Ebola patients he plans to be quarantined for three weeks afterward I believe I am wellequipped to go he told NBC News That doesnt mean Im not scared His wife Erin is also scared On a very selfish level I dont want him to go she said Still she understands the need in West Africa is great But she knows her husbands homecoming may not come with great fanfare I think people may be nervous being around him even after the quarantine she said Despite the possible stigma Les employer the University of California San Francisco is encouraging its healthcare workers to make the trip Our mission our focus should be on getting enough people to West Africa to stop transmission said Dr George Rutherford who heads the universitys Ebola task force If we dont do that its not going to go away The university has set up a system for employees to give their vacation days to those heading to West Africa So far more than  hours have been donated On top of that some employees including Doctor Madhavi Dandu are voluntarily picking up shifts for colleagues who are heading overseas The stigma and the concerns around the quarantines really worry me partly because we risk the loss of many other health professionals who might decide to go there Dandu said UCSF will not allow Le on campus for  days upon his return That means no interaction with patients and no meetings It might be a moot point because Le intends to be quarantined for  days He realizes that quarantine rules for returning health workers are fluid right now so it is unclear where he will have to stay during those three weeks But he is more than willing to isolate himself to reduce fears I dont want the focus to be on me when I come back he said The surest way to do that is just to take myself out of the picture That means he might go a couple months without seeing  or hugging  his yearold daughter That will not be easy but Le calls is a small price to pay for the greater good And to reward his daughter he plans to take her to Florida once the quarantine is over
