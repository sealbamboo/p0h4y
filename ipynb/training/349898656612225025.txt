wisdom tells us and youll wind up hurt But a provocative new study shows that this deeply entrenched belief is probably wrong and that there is still a great deal we dont understand about pronation and why the foot rolls as it does For the new study   researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark and other institutions began by advertising in Danish newspapers and at gyms to find men and women who didnt run but were game to try Recruiting novice runners for studies of injury risk is somewhat unusual More typically researchers rely on surveys of experienced runners since those are after all the people who develop running injuries By asking them about themselves their training their bodies and how they became injured researchers have gained valuable insights into why runners get hurt But such studies have limitations They rely on peoples notoriously leaky memories instead of controlled experiments And because experienced longtime runners often have a history of injuries and one injury frequently contributes to the next it can be difficult to tease out the original primary risk factor So the Danish researchers turned to running newcomers who would provide in effect a blank injury slate They eventually settled on  healthy adults an impressively large group by exercisescience standards The volunteers men and women ranged in age from  to  Then using elaborate measurements and visual evaluations the researchers profiled each volunteers foot to determine how he or she pronated Pronation of course is natural and desirable during running When your foot flattens and rolls inward as you strike the ground  that is when it pronates  it absorbs some of the forces generated by the impact of landing But it has long been thought that pronating too much or too little leads to a heightened risk of injuries to the leg or hip Determining exactly how much any given person pronates while in motion however is not easy In very broad terms flatter feet are associated with more pronation and higherarched feet with less But in this study the researchers went beyond those simple guidelines and created what is known as a foot posture profile for each runner Using a widely accepted foot classification system they divided the volunteers into those with neutral pronation overpronation severe overpronation underpronation or severe underpronation Then they gave all of the volunteers the same model of lightweight neutral running shoes rather than motioncontrol shoes which are designed to correct pronation problems along with a GPS watch to track their mileage and instructions to report any injury which would then be assessed by medical personnel The volunteers subsequently ran as much as they wished at a selfchosen pace for a full year As a whole the group covered more than  miles and developed about  medically confirmed injuries Contrary to received running wisdom however those who overpronated or underpronated were not significantly more likely to get hurt than runners with neutral foot motion Among those who covered at least  miles during the year injury rates in fact were slightly higher among the runners with neutral feet than among those who overpronated This result confirms those of     showing that when runners choose their shoes based on their foot type  when overpronators wear motioncontrol shoes for instance to reduce how much they pronate  they sustain injuries at the same rate or at higher rates than when they choose shoes at random In essence what these findings suggest says Rasmus Ostergaard Nielsen a doctoral researcher at Aarhus University who led the new study is that supposedly deviant degrees of pronation may not in practice be abnormal and do not contribute to injuries And if that is the case he continues runners especially those new to the activity probably do not need to obsess about their foot type Instead he says they could more profitably pay attention to things like body mass training behavior age and previous injury in order to prevent runningrelated injuries Other researchers agree This is an excellent study says Bryan Heiderscheit an associate professor of biomechanics and director of the running clinic at the University of Wisconsin at Madison The research reinforces a widespread belief among scientists studying running that pronation doesnt play much of a role in injury risk he says It also suggests he says that trying to alter pronation with a specific type of shoe is probably misguided At the universitys running clinic we see so many injured runners whove been told that they overpronate and need sturdy motioncontrol shoes to fix the problem They wind up injured anyway Instead he says this new study and common sense suggest that comfort is likely to be a better guide to shoe choice than foot posture We dont know whether anyones given degree of pronation needs to be altered he says We do know that comfort helps to make running tolerable But when he asks injured runners at the clinic whether their current shoes are comfortable its amazing he says how many say no
