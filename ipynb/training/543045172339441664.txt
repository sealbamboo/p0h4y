Good morning, everyone, and how are you today? Steely skies are hovering this morning over the Pharmalot campus, which is exceedingly quiet now that the officials mascots are snoozing and our shortest short person has left for the local schoolhouse.

The Philadelphia transit agency has sued Gilead Sciences for allegedly price gouging its $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi hepatitis C drug; A clinical trial of the Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck and NewLink was interrupted in all 59 volunteers in Geneva a week early “as a measure of precaution” after four patients complained of joint pains in hands and feet; The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance says the quality of FDA inspections has “significantly deteriorated” this year, and their approach is creating a climate of fear among Indian manufacturers.
