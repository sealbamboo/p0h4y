As nurses we are taught that we are professionals and we must maintain a certain emotional distance with our patients Its a boundary that encompasses the therapeutic relationship nurses as caregivers patients as the recipients of the care But now working as a nurse I have found that while most of my professional boundaries are well defined sometimes the line between a professional and personal relationship with a patient can become blurred I work on an orthopedic surgical unit where most patients are coming in and going out very frequently That makes it hard to get to know anyone too well But there are some patients that we never forget for good or bad reasons Most of the time these patients stay with us because for whatever reason one of us crossed the invisible boundary nurses set for themselves Recently I cared for two patients who touched me so deeply it was impossible to maintain a professional distance My grandfather had recently passed away and both of these men reminded me of him My grandfather or GrandDaddy as we all called him was oneofakind and one of the kindest and most generous people Ive ever met He was hard of hearing but constantly fiddled around with his hearing aids so it was wise to always be prepared to repeat yourself once or twice He had an extraordinary memory until the day he died and was one of the funniest people Ive ever known  One day at work an older man arrived on my floor after a total hip replacement As I worked to admit him to our care his room was crowded with half a dozen family members who surrounded him with love I asked him about his family and he told me about his eight children  grandchildren and a couple of greatgrandchildren too It was uncanny how much this man reminded me of my grandfather who also had a large family of six children  grandchildren and three great grandchildren   I smiled as I watched my patient fiddle with his hearing aids and tears welled up in my eyes as he answered all of my questions with a familiar What did you say I didnt mind repeating myself and for a moment it was as if I was speaking with my grandfather again  After I was finished admitting him and settling him in I found myself constantly peeking back into his room asking if he was OK and if he needed anything He was pretty lowmaintenance and never really needed much and eventually he was gone I never told him that he reminded me of my grandfather or how he tugged at my heartstrings and I often wonder if I should have But I worried that in showing this man a little extra attention I had somehow breached the therapeutic relationship Not long after that another patient came up to the floor  The report said he was an older man who was in comfort care This essentially means that no lifesaving efforts would be made on his behalf we were there to keep him comfortable during his final days When this patient came up to the floor I was quite taken by him His gruff Irish exterior belied his sweet nature Medically he had a lot of issues but when he came up to the floor the only thing he wanted was a bowl of oatmeal When his tray came he found cream of wheat instead He was so disappointed but I was determined to find him a bowl of oatmeal  Miraculously after a search through our floor kitchen I found oatmeal and delivered it to him He was delighted and blew me a kiss and gave me a wink His chart said he needed assistance to eat but he dug right in Sure he made a mess but he managed just fine on his own Watching him eat that oatmeal reminded me of some of my last meals with GrandDaddy GrandDaddy never was the neatest eater and we would always laugh about what a mess he made But he didnt care  at his age he just wanted what he wanted when he wanted it My patients personality was  strikingly similar to that of my grandfather As he lay curled up in the bed I thought about the strong man he must have been a long time ago When his wife and children came to the room I felt a pang of familiarity His wife remained so graciously composed during her visits It brought back memories of my grandmother during my grandfathers last days Despite her deep sadness and fear of what was to come my grandmother kept full composure and took care of not only him but also everyone around her I still am amazed by how strong and selfless she was during that time a true role model for unconditional love and I saw these saintly qualities in this mans wife   The following day the man was sent back to a nursing home where comfort care would be resumed When the transporters came to get him I started to feel emotional like someone I loved was going to leave me Even though I knew he was going to a nice and comfortable facility I didnt want him to go We transferred him onto the stretcher and I made him cozy in his blankets His family was sincerely thankful and I remember telling them with tears in my eyes how much we enjoyed taking care of him and how much we would miss him  The tears continued to well up as I watched his stretcher go around the corner and out of sight because I knew I would never see him again I felt like I was saying goodbye not only to him but also to my grandfather all over again But once again I stopped myself from sharing these feelings with my patient or his family They knew I cared but they never knew how much caring for him meant to me personally Looking back I still dont know if I did the right thing keeping my feelings to myself I now realize that both of these patients were helping me heal even as I was helping them Watching them leave was like letting go of my grandfather again but they also gave me the gifts of laughter and reminiscence right when I needed them most  I know that ultimately I am still just the nurse and they are still just my patients But I think its better for both the patients and myself if we both sometimes allow ourselves to feel something more than a professional bond Nurses and patients move in and out of each others lives so quickly but we are nonetheless changed by every encounter  I became a nurse because I want to care for people and make a difference Being touched in return is an added bonus
