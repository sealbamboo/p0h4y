Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war most sufferers receive no medical help Many are chained up  to trees or at home Some are even locked in cages with hyenas But one man is trying to change all that Dr Habs advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishus radio stations Hes gone crazy Hes running away screams the actor Chain him down The scenario is familiar in Somalia A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh But as the young man protests a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out  Stop with the chains the voiceover orders Take him to Dr Habs hospital If hes having mental problems take him to Dr Hab He wont chain him hell help him Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist Rather its the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization WHO has made it his mission to rescue Somalias mentally ill He claims he is able to treat everything from postnatal depression to schizophrenia  But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalias popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional  and sometimes barbaric  cures There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people  think cause mental illness says Hab So in Mogadishu you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay   to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal The expensive treatment  more than the average annual wage  is as brutal as it sounds By clawing and biting at the patient the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out Patients including young children have been known to die during the process  We are trying to show people that this is nonsense says Hab People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods Habs campaign was prompted by an incident in  when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths There was noone to help them he says I decided after that I would have to open Somalias first mental hospital The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Habs six centres across Somalia Together they have now treated over  patients   There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count and Hab  despite his lack of advanced qualifications  is head of what has become the countrys leading provider of mental health services He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so Hab faces a near insurmountable task WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness compared to a global average of one in  In parts of the country where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict the rate is even higher Cases of posttraumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse Khat is a big big problem says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis We treat them in the hospital and they leave but then they start eating khat again Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain Hab meanwhile says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies  Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain  headaches sweating and chest pain Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture  depression for example translates as the feelings a camel has when its friend dies But nothing is more indicative of the populations poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chainingup sufferers to trees and in rooms GRT an Italian NGO has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life  I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres Parents siblings relatives  theyve just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone The WHO has funded a Chain Free Initiative with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether starting with the use of chains in hospitals  But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients He tells the story of how in  one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the antipsychotic drug fluphenazine hydrochloride was an increased appetite in his patients They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food But still desperately unwell some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint Chaining them to their beds concluded Hab was the only option Many patients take a long time to treat he says There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs  new mattresses food for patients and diesel for his minibus There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll  Physiologically and mentally its a very hard job he says I was healthy when I started now I suffer from diabetes I am dealing with big big problems all by myself I have cried on TV I have cried in public places I have cried in front of presidents he says Even now I feel like crying
