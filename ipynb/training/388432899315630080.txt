The government shutdown is likely to mean an early death for thousands of mice used in research on diseases such as diabetes cancer and Alzheimers Federal research centers including the National Institutes of Health will have to kill some mice to avoid overcrowding researchers say Others will die because it is impossible to maintain certain lines of genetically altered mice without constant monitoring by scientists And most federal scientists have been banned from their own labs since Oct  Im sure its chaos at the NIH for anyone doing mouse experiments says   a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who uses hundreds of socalled transgenic mice in his work on Down syndrome NIH officials say they arent doing media interviews So Reeves and other scientists at Johns Hopkins agreed to talk about what a shutdown would mean for their lab animals and the research these animals make possible The loss of socalled transgenic mice many of which have genes that cause them to develop versions of human diseases is especially troubling scientists say A single animal can cost thousands of dollars to replace they say And some cannot be replaced at any cost To maintain a colony of transgenic mice every new pup must have its DNA tested by a highly trained researcher Reeves says The animal care staff now in charge of NIH mice would not be able to do the testing he says So once federal scientists knew a shutdown was going to happen they probably had to choose certain mice to eliminate If I thought we were going to be down for two weeks we certainly would reduce the colony Reeves says If I thought it was going to be a month then I would take a little harder look And if I thought it would be longer than that then we really would have to take things off the shelf By off the shelf Reeves means freezing some embryos and killing an entire line of mice Reviving a line that has been frozen down can take months and cost thousands of dollars he says Reeves has seen what a government shutdown can do to research He was at a government lab in the s when a shutdown forced him to walk away from his experiments with cell cultures The experiments were ruined he says It was a complete waste Shutdowns in the s typically lasted no more than a few days The current one promises to go on for weeks And that could be disastrous for researchers says   a researcher at Hopkins and a  Nobel Prize winner Not being able to breed mice for several weeks could really shut down years worth of experiments she says The NIH will face another problem with its mice researchers say overcrowding Ordinarily the NIH keeps more than  mice on hand But that number has almost certainly been growing quickly since the shutdown says   who is in charge of research animals at Johns Hopkins Every  days a female mouse can have a litter which can mean  or more pups he says So you can see its a geometric progression of how many mice you would have to deal with The mouse facilities at most research institutions run near capacity Adams says And national guidelines for research animals prohibit crowding more mice into the same space he says We might start moving animals around to facilities where we have some room Adams says But at some point we would probably have to start euthanizing animals Its not clear how much of that has already occurred at NIH One reason is that federal researchers had been keeping fewer mice than usual because of budget cuts from sequestration In response to questions about mice at the NIH a spokesperson provided a written statement saying that institute directors are developing approaches to manage the population of animals so as not to delay experiments further after the shutdown has ended and taking into consideration facility constraints during the shutdown Managing the population of NIH mice wont be easy Adams says The first thing he would do if Hopkins faced a shutdown would be to separate male and female mice he says That would require a lot of extra cages And pregnant females would still be producing new litters for weeks he says which would require many more cages Within a couple of weeks of a shutdown Hopkins would run out of room Adams says Then he would have to start bringing animals to a machine that includes a stack of airtight chambers Mice cages would be placed in the cages and the machine turned on he says It slowly brings up the carbon dioxide levels so they essentially get anesthetized and then they eventually suffocate he says Biomedical research often involves killing animals Adams says But usually there is a compelling scientific reason
