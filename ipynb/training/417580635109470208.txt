Federal regulators this month opened a new era in the treatment of a deadly liver virus that infects three to five times more people than HIV Now the question is Who will get access to the new drug for hepatitis C and when The drug   will cost  per pill A typical course of treatment will last  weeks and run  plus the cost of necessary companion drugs Some patients may need treatment for twice as long Hepatitis researchers call the drug a   in the treatment of this deadly infection More than  percent of patients who get the new drug can expect to be cured of their hepatitis C infection with few side effects Curing hepatitis C has been difficult involving regimens that dont work as well as the new option and bring harsh side effects More than  million Americans are infected with   and perhaps  million people have the disease worldwide By comparison about  million Americans have   which has infected about  million people globally The drug company   of Foster City Calif manufactures Sovaldi And some activists are beginning to complain about the companys decision to charge so much for the drug For Gilead we have outrage pure and simple Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation     But   a vice president at Gilead says the high price is fully justified We didnt really say We want to charge  a pill  Alton says Were just looking at what we think was a fair price for the value that were bringing into the health care system and to the patients But Andrew Hill a researcher in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Liverpool says  per cure is too much based on his   of Gileads cost to produce the drug Even when we were very conservative with our estimate the cost of a course of these treatments would be on the order of  to  per person Hill says He questions whether the  price tag represents a fair profit Hill estimated the cost of producing Sovaldi by comparing it to similar antiviral drugs used to treat HIV which cost about a  per gram to make The amazing thing with hep C is you only need a few grams of these drugs to cure the infection Hill says You need  grams or  grams of drugs There are some interesting parallels between the new hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and others in the pipeline and the antiviral drugs that came out  years ago to treat HIV Both classes of drugs were initially very pricey Both revolutionized the treatment of chronic lethal infections that are major global health problems But there are big differences First hepatitis C is actually a much   public health threat than HIV  a fact that has received little attention Secondly the new hepatitis C drugs can eliminate the virus completely  once its gone people are cured Drugs against HIV just suppress the virus so must be taken for a lifetime Given that latter point   of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston thinks that the high cost of the new hepatitis C treatments might be justified Maybe we decide that  is a worthwhile investment to cure someone of an otherwise devastating chronic infection Graham says After all it can now cost up to  to treat patients with advanced hepatitis C using less effective and more harrowing regimens Graham is a hepC specialist So she knows firsthand how the slowmoving virus kills patients by destroying their livers and causing liver cancer The virus is the main reason that nearly  Americans are waiting for a liver transplant Another factor to consider Graham says is that the clock is ticking for people infected with hepatitis C most of whom   We have a very narrow window of time to find as many people as possible and to cure them as quickly as possible if we want to make a substantial impact on their disease progression as well as on those very expensive complications in the future Graham says You have to treat them now The urgency is greater for people who are infected with both HIV and hepatitis C because having both diseases accelerates the liver damage from hepatitis Older hepatitis C regimens carry many   such as fatigue muscle aches fever skin rashes anemia depression nausea and loss of appetite These side effects have been deterrents to treating people before they developed clear signs of liver damage But the availability of gentler therapies is an incentive to beginning treatment earlier before people develop signs and symptoms of liver scarring That approach greatly expands the number of people eligible for treatment  and the potential market for Sovaldi and upcoming drugs Graham thinks Gilead should factor the larger market size into the drugs price She notes that Gilead   more than  billion to acquire a smaller company that developed Sovaldi She acknowledges that Gilead should be allowed to recoup that investment On the other hand you only need about  people to recover that cost Graham says And so if youre treating  million people once you have recovered your cost then I think its  I dont want to say its unfair but it does start feeling more exploitative Graham says she thinks once Gilead has recovered its investment cost it ought to cut the price of Sovaldi Thats very unlikely that we would do that responds Alton Gilead vice president I appreciate the thought Alton says critics should look at the big picture Those who are bold and go out and innovate like this and take the risk  there needs to be more of a reward on that he says Otherwise it would be very difficult for people to make that investment Gilead will help US patients pay for Sovaldi if they cant afford it Alton says or the company will help them look for drug coverage And Gilead will charge far less for a course of the drug in places such as India Pakistan Egypt and China where most people with hepatitis C live Pressed on how low the price of a cure will go Alton says I dont think well be able to get it into the low hundreds But I think we can get it into an affordable range for them Itll be from the high hundreds to low thousands for these types of markets It took more than  years for many people in developing countries to get access to lifesaving HIV drugs Advocates hope it wont take anywhere near that long to start curing hepatitis C
