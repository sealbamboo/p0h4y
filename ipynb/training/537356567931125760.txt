As employers try to minimize expenses under the health law the Obama administration has warned them against paying highcost workers to leave the company medical plan and buy coverage elsewhere Such a move would unlawfully discriminate against employees based on their health status three federal agencies   issued in early November Brokers and consultants have been offering to save large employers money by shifting workers with expensive conditions such as hepatitis or hemophilia into insurance marketplace exchanges established by the health law Kaiser Health News   The Affordable Care Act requires exchange plans to accept all applicants at preestablished prices regardless of existing illness Because most large employers are selfinsured moving even one highcost worker out of the company plan could save a company hundreds of thousands of dollars a year Thats far more than the  or so it might give an employee to pay for an exchange plans premiums Rather than eliminating coverage for all employees some employers  have considered paying highcost claimants relatively large amounts if they will waive coverage under the employers plan Lockton Cos a large brokerage said in a recent memo to clients The trend concerns consumer advocates because it threatens to erode employerbased coverage and drive up costs and premiums in the marketplace plans which would absorb the expense of the sick employees The burden would fall on consumers buying the plans and taxpayers subsidizing them Administration officials approached independent lawyers about the practice in May saying We dont like this but how can we address this said Christopher Condeluci principal at CC Law  Policy a legal firm This months guidance he said is the first time that theyve come out explaining how and why the administration believes it violates the law The Affordable Care Act itself doesnt block companies from paying sick workers to find coverage elsewhere lawyers said But other laws do including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Public Health Service Act according to three federal agencies Specifically paying a sick worker to leave the company plan violates those statutes restrictions on discriminating against employees based on medical status the departments said in their bulletin If you were to cherrypick your highcost individuals and offer them money to send them over to the exchange  this would be a violation of HIPAA according to the regulators said Amy Gordon a benefits lawyer with McDermott Will  Emery The agencies publishing the guidance were the departments of Labor Treasury and Health and Human Services Starting next year the health law requires large employers to provide medical insurance to most workers or face fines How many companies have offered to pay workers with chronic conditions to find coverage elsewhere is unclear I know there are some brokers out there that were pushing this but it was a limited number that I had heard about Condeluci said Even so he added the attitude of the administration was We dont want it to become widespread Lets nip it in the bud now
