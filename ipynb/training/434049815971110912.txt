When we imagine Olympic athletes at the table before the most important competition of their lives we might picture a huge plate of pasta with Gatorade to wash it down and a welldeserved ice cream sundae for dessert Turns out they might be preparing with a salad a glass of beet juice and some almonds As we   back in  during the London Games athletes actually deploy a pretty wide range of fueling strategies to coax peak performance from their bodies Those strategies depend a lot on the demands of the sport  whether its endurance or aesthetic  and maybe even a desired body shape think speedskating For the Summer Games there was Michael Phelps legendary calorie binge On the other end of the spectrum were the wrestlers consuming just  calories the day of competition to make weight Winter athletes are just as likely to have specific calorie needs and goals   senior sport dietitian for the US Olympic Committee and a professor of sports nutrition at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs tells The Salt In Sochi Meyer is cooking for and advising the speedskaters Shes also   enthusiastically from such venues as the Olympic Dining Hall and the local grocery store According to Meyer the food in Sochi is excellent  better even than in Turin Italy Meyer who published a   on sports nutrition for winter Olympians in  in the   says choosing the right fuel is most challenging for crosscountry skiers competing in long events Theyre advised to load up on carbs before competition three to five hours beforehand is the recommended time frame but they sometimes dont manage to get enough and their performance suffers as the glycogen in their muscles is depleted Meanwhile some ski jumpers are aiming to reduce their body weight and dont need nearly so many carbs The lighter the jumper the longer the jump the thinking goes Meyer helped us put together the table below to show just how much energy winter Olympians aim to take in by sport She cautions that many of these numbers are rough estimates and even within sports male and female athletes may eat very different amounts According to Meyers research more elite winter athletes have been trying to maintain lean and muscular physiques and even intentionally low body weight in recent years But this has also heightened the risk of eating disorders which she says have been documented among figure skaters freestyle aerial skiers crosscountry skiers biathletes ski jumpers and Nordic combined athletes The sports dietitians job is to help bring some order to athletes diets whatever their goals We help athletes build their plates steer them away from McDonalds and keep them excited with interesting new things in snacks and familiar things shortly before during and after exercise which would be their training or competitions writes Meyer on her blog That sometimes means juicing fruits and vegetables which Meyer was doing last week or having easytoeat processed foods at the ready Specific event needs may be energy bars either with higher carbohydrate or protein content gels with concentrated amounts of carbohydrate some with caffeine Shot Bloks just like gummy bears with a sport nutrition twist protein bars for recovery powders for during and after exercise and so forth she says But dont bet on these regimens sticking around for long The field of sports nutrition is evolving fast and has come a long way since Meyers days as a member of the Swiss alpine ski team about  years ago When I was an athlete all we had was bars and a sport drink  Nowadays we have anything from gooey slobbery sweet viscous liquid or gummy bears with a touch of salt Sport nutrition has taken its twists and turns she blogs from Sochi
