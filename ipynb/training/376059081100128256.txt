On Thursday, we .  the mystery of the 15-year-old gymnast who suddenly developed a huge, distended belly and intractable constipation. More than 500 readers weighed in.. 
. No one got both answers. (Confession: I never said that there were two.). Dr. Ann Clark, an OB-GYN in Louisville, Ky., figured that this was some kind of problem of the abdominal muscles and did a quick search on PubMed to come up with the diagnosis of abdominal phrenic dyssynergia. She was the first of three readers to make this diagnosis.. Dr. Carrie Richardson from Chicago was the first of five readers to correctly identify pelvic floor dysfunction. She is a second year resident at Northwestern. Congratulations to both doctors.
