Over the last decade US kids and teenagers have started getting slightly more exercise and reduced their television watching a new study suggests Using surveys conducted in middle and high schools researchers also found increases in the number of days youth reported having breakfast each week and in how often they ate fruits and vegetables Those trends have corresponded to a leveling off in obesity rates but not a decline the study showed I would like to believe that all the public health efforts focusing on increasing physical activity and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption are having an effect because that seems to be a pattern Ronald Iannotti the lead author on the study from the University of Massachusetts Boston said The fact that obesity is leveling off thats a surprise and a major change from the steady increase that weve seen Iannotti who worked on the study while at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda Md said This is great news He and coauthor Jing Wang analyzed surveys given to a nationally representative sample of students in th through th grades in   and  as part of the Health Behavior in Schoolaged Children study Each survey period included responses from between  and  adolescents The researchers found encouraging trends on measures of most diet and lifestyle habits For example the number of days each week that kids reported being physically active for at least  minutes increased from  in  to  in  with similar trends among boys and girls Likewise youth reported eating breakfast on three school days each week on the first survey and  days on the last The average number of hours students spent watching TV each day fell from  to  with drops in both weekday and weekend viewing Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption also rose slightly  although it remained at less than one daily serving of each on average  and consumption of sweets and soft drinks fell However the proportion of survey participants who were overweight or obese based on their own height and weight reports did not decrease the researchers wrote Monday in Pediatrics Rates of obesity  defined as body mass index a measure of weight in relation to height in the th percentile or higher  rose from  percent in  to  percent in  then held steady through the final survey This is encouraging because at least it looks like things have kind of stabilized and at least theyre not going in the wrong direction Marian Huhman who studies health communication and health campaigns at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign said Maybe it just takes a few years for the outcomes of obesity changes to follow from the behavioral changes she added Huhman who wasnt involved in the study pointed to the effort on many many fronts that may have led to the positive changes in physical activity sedentary behavior and diet  such as walktoschool programs and campaigns targeting foodÂ   However adolescents are still largely not meeting the recommendations for amount of screen time amount of physical activity and amount of fruit and vegetable consumption she said Iannotti echoed that concern Although theyre increasing the recommendation is five servings of fruits and vegetables per day And were looking at one or two he said Theres still vast room for improvement
