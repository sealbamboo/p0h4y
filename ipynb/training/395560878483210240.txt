A year ago public health officials were scrambling to figure out why people across the country were suddenly coming down with lifethreatening cases of meningitis The outbreak eventually was traced back to contaminated steroids produced by the New England Compounding Center All told  people contracted   and other infections from the tainted shots  died And its not over Some people are still undergoing treatment and others who thought they were cured have relapsed and are once again fighting infection To get up to date Shots talked with   section chief for infectious disease at the Carilion Clinic in Roanoke Va a hospital where  patients have been treated Two of them had strokes and died almost immediately A third person died after  days of treatment Kerkering an expert on fungal infections was a coauthor of   of  papers published in last weeks   on the outbreak This is an edited version of the conversation Fungal infections are hard to treat Thats due to the drugs we have the mechanisms of how the drugs work on the fungus and our own immune systems Then there arent drugs that reach high levels in the central nervous system And the central nervous system is a much more severe place to be infected than the lungs for example We made the decision that we would treat for  more days after the spinal fluid was normal and then to follow up we would do   at one month three months and six months after completing therapy We have a few more patients who are awaiting their six month lumbar puncture in November And we still have two patients on therapy a year later Not yet Did they have a second form of fungus or does the organism just hang out in places that the medication didnt get to and we didnt treat enough I dont know if any of us have the answers I dont think the public has an idea of all the things that the   went through Of course they had headaches and fevers and didnt feel well at all at first But then some did have strokes They needed rehabilitation and physical therapy for that Some of them developed something that we call   That leads to urinary retention and a whole lot of back pain The patients were pretty miserable And remember these patients all had back problems to begin with Then they got their shots and they get fungus and we treat them through all that misery and they get back to where they were originally  they still have back pain Some have gone on to have surgery and have done very well and have not relapsed The patients were really troupers on this Challenge is too harsh a word but patients need to ask their doctors do I really need this Even with modern medicine nothing is riskfree
