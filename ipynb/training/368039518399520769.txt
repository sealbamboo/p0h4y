On average elementary school children get six to eight  each school year according to  For high school kids its about half that  are at   for the flu Teachers and parents commonly refer to this cold and flu phenomenon as the backtoschool plague But there are simple ways to keep your kids healthy Miller isnt worried about her own kids Her son Justin is in th grade and daughter Kaitlyn is a high school freshman Ive taught my kids healthy habits Im sure theyll be fine she said She makes sure they get plenty of sleep and regular exercise and they eat a healthy diet Shes taught her children to wash their hands often and shes been known to hook antibacterial gels on their backpacks for when they cant Im not a germaphobe like some of my colleagues who have put antibacterial lotion all over the place their cars their classrooms Miller said I do feel like some germs are OK Kids are most likely to get colds in the   In part thats because theyre now indoors and in close contact with their fellow germy friends Its also because cold viruses love low humidity In these months your nasal passages get drier and that  for the  viruses that can cause infections  Germ candy stores thats what   professor emeritus of pediatrics at the   and author of the book Germ Proof Your Kids calls schools It is stunning how many times kids touch their faces and then touch other kids Rotbart said This is a very touchyfeely demographic and thats how we share germs  And the little ones dont have the same exposure to germs that we do so until their immune systems get built up they get sick Schools are full of hot zones for germs Rotbart says Most people think thats the bathroom but it really isnt Those get regularly cleaned If he had to rank the germiest places in school No  would be the drinking fountain Its germier than the toilet seat he says but doesnt get disinfected as much Plus its the perfect spot for kids to ingest these microorganisms as they put their mouths on the stream of water  or right on the fountain itself Rotbart suggests teaching students to run the water a little first and then drink Or better yet children should bring their own water bottles to school and not share them with anyone Cafeteria trays are another germ hot zone Those dont get wiped down nearly as well he said recommending that kids bring the tray to their table and then use hand sanitizer before they pick up their food There is a real delicate balance though we dont want to make kids paranoid Rotbart said We need to be prudent Germs for people who are healthy really arent a big deal The   highly recommends that students get vaccinated each flu season It also advises students to stay home if they are sick especially if they   They should be feverfree and have stopped showing signs of being sick like being flushed or sweating for  hours before going back That helps keep germs from spreading Rotbart also tells parents to make sure their children get enough rest Schoolage children should be in bed nine to  hours a night High schoolers need eight to  hours   Sleep deprivation lowers the immune systems ability to fight off infection as does stress Exercise Rotbart says is another effective way to keep kids healthy He suggests a daily dose of  minutes of runningaround time even in the winter If its cold children need to keep their jackets zipped and hats on their heads Your mother was right Studies have shown that people who do bundle up against the cold are less likely to catch colds later on in the year Rotbart said Keep your distance from people who are sick   to avoid touching others when they are sick and remind them to stop  touching their eyes mouth and nose since this spreads contamination  Every year Miller invites a nurse to teach her firstgraders the proper techniques She uses her bathroom as the place to remind kids about hygiene  I have three posters around my sink about good hand washing I review the rules as well as anyone whos supervising the kids during that time I encourage them to wash after they go to the bathroom and after recess before they eat anything Miller said If I dont hear them wash their hands  even if Im in the middle of a lesson and the principal is doing my evaluation  I stop what Im doing and say Wash your hands Its that important  a foods and nutrition professor at the University of Georgia says studies shes conducted show that most kids dont know how to wash their hands properly only  knew the right method Properly washed hands cut down on gastrointestinal problems as well as cold and flu Harrison designed the  handwashing initiative I teach them to sing Happy Birthday to yourself twice to make sure they wash for at least  seconds Harrison said She also teaches them to clean between their fingers and around their fingernails and to use a clean paper towel or a hot air dryer to dry off A lot of people think hand sanitizer is better she says but really washing with soap and water is the most effective way to eliminate germs But if kids cant get to a sink make sure the sanitizer i My kids are obsessed with hand sanitizer said   a fifthgrade teacher in suburban Chicago Each classroom has a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall Many use it to an extreme Falcone used to think the school plague was more of an elementary school thing but with increasing pressure to get good grades some of the older students she had when she taught seventh grade science did come to school sick And that gets others sick Ive never been a sickly person but I did catch strep throat Falcone said Ive never had it in my entire life but I had it Got rid of it Got it again Falcones been teaching for more than  years Shes noticed over the years that newer teachers get sick more often When you are new you are killing yourself to impress and some young teachers really do forget to take care of themselves Falcone said She advises new teachers to mind their own health Eat healthy get sleep do whatever you do to reduce stress Staying healthy is totally doable
