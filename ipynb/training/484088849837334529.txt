 Yes you can OD on caffeine The trick is to know your body pay attention to what else youve ingested and do your homework on energy drinks Caffeine acts as a stimulant in humans It can be found in the seeds leaves and fruit of plants like coffee or kola nuts Safe doses of caffeine are usually quoted at around  to  milligrams or two to four cups of coffee per day says Dr David Seres associate professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University  There have been plenty of reports that say caffeine is beneficial Some studies call it a potential protector from diseases such as Parkinsons and even some forms of cancer But those  Magnum Pills that Brenner ate contain  milligrams of caffeine each which means he downed around  milligrams of caffeine in one big literal gulp  Take note Energy drinks like Red Bull usually contain around  milligrams of caffeine in an eightounce can Some of the bigger cans such as a ounce Monster have up to  milligrams Meanwhile a ounce cup of coffee think a venti at Starbucks packs upwards of  milligrams Barbara Crouch executive director at the Utah Poison Control Center says that unlike coffee drinkers energy drink consumers especially young people like to chug down not just one but two or three of the peppy beverages to get a good jolt on before a hardcore workout soccer practice or maybe to enhance a night of dancing  When you pound down more than one energy drink verses sipping a cup of coffee youre not metabolizing it the same way she says adding that factors like size age sex drug interactions hydration levels and the amount of food in the stomach can mean different outcomes for different people when on a caffeine binge Yes there is absolutely such a thing as caffeine poisoning and the dose essentially makes the poison she says But Crouch has a bigger bone to pick with the makers of energy drinks She says that many of them arent being fully forthcoming about ingredients Seres points out that many natural additives  such as guarana taurine and socalled Siberian ginseng  havent been fully tested Energy drinks contain other natural ingredients which may have additional amounts of caffeine says Seres Theyre also likely to contain herbs with stimulatory effects not tested for safety or interactions with prescription drugs and other potentially pharmacologically active substances But James Coughlin a food nutritional chemical and toxicology safety expert in Los Angeles who consults for the American Beverage Association the industry group that represents energy drink companies disputes that  The caffeine contained in the guarana of an energy drink is only around one milligram versus the  milligrams of synthetic caffeine added by a beverage company such as Red Bull he says The lethal dose of caffeine is  to  grams of pure powder caffeine so if you were going to try and kill yourself with caffeine youd probably drown in the liquid first if you did it with coffee  and even more so with an energy drink Coughlin calls the very idea that beverage companies are sneaking caffeine into energy drinks through other ingredients a total myth Still itd be hard to deny headlines claiming that there have been increased energy drinkrelated visits to emergency rooms One highly cited  report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration stated that energy drinkrelated emergencydepartment visits went from  visits in  to  visits in  All the press about energy drinks led the Federal Drug Administration to say its taking a fresh look at caffeinated food  and that it plans to hone in on how energy drinks impact young people  We are contracting with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a public meeting to obtain additional scientific information and expert input on caffeine and are actively reaching out to the food industry and health care practitioners to discuss concerns about caffeine in conventional foods and dietary supplements says FDA spokesperson Teresa Eisenman   Crouch however cautions that people should monitor caffeine intake from other sources as well  So you have that cup of coffee but lo and behold you decide to get an extradark bar of chocolate she says Or you drink a soda Or maybe you do take an allergy pill or a dietary supplement Truth be told sometimes people miss the fine print on labels about stimulant properties in all these products
