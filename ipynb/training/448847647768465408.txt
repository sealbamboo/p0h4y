Agerelated vision loss is common and devastating But new research suggests that physical activity might protect our eyes as we age There have been suggestions that exercise might reduce the risk of macular degeneration which occurs when neurons in the central part of the retina deteriorate The disease robs millions of older Americans of clear vision A   for instance found that those covering the most miles had the least likelihood of developing the disease But the study did not compare runners to nonrunners limiting its usefulness It also did not try to explain how exercise might affect the incidence of an eye disease  So more recently researchers at Emory University in Atlanta and the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center in Decatur Ga took up that question for a study published   Their interest was motivated in part by animal research at the VA medical center That work had determined that exercise increases the levels of substances known as growth factors in the animals bloodstream and brains These growth factors especially one called brainderived neurotrophic factor or BDNF are known to contribute to the health and wellbeing of neurons and consequently it is thought to improvements in brain health and cognition after regular exercise But the brain is not the only body part to contain neurons as the researchers behind the new study knew The retina does as well and the researchers wondered whether exercise might raise levels of BDNF there too potentially affecting retinal health and vision  To test that possibility the researchers gathered adult healthy lab mice Half of these were allowed to remain sedentary throughout the day while the other animals began running on little treadmills at a gentle rodent pace for about an hour a day After two weeks half of the mice in each group were exposed to a searingly bright light for four hours The other animals stayed in dimly lit cages This light exposure is a widely used and accepted means of inducing retinal degeneration in animals It doesnt precisely mimic the slowly progressing disease in humans obviously But it causes a comparable if timecompressed loss of retinal neurons The mice then returned to their former routine  running or not exercising  for another two weeks after which the scientists measured the number of neurons in each animals eyes The unexercised mice exposed to the bright light were experiencing by then severe retinal degeneration Almost  percent of the neurons in their retinas that detect light had died The animals vision was failing  But the mice that had exercised before being exposed to the light retained about twice as many functioning retinal neurons as the sedentary animals in addition those cells were more responsive to normal light than the surviving retinal neurons in the unexercised mice Exercise it seems had armored the runners retinas Separately the researchers had other mice run or sit around for two weeks and then measured levels of BDNF in their eyes and bloodstreams The runners had far more  Tellingly when the scientists injected still other mice with a chemical that blocks the uptake of the growth factor before allowing them to run and exposing them to the bright light their eyes deteriorated as badly as among sedentary rodents When the mice could not process BDNF exercise did not safeguard their eyes  Taken together these experiments strongly suggest that exercise protects vision at least in mice by increasing BDNF in the retina said Jeffrey Boatright an associate professor of ophthalmology at Emory University School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study But obviously mice are not people so whether exercise can prevent or ameliorate macular degeneration in human eyes is impossible to know based on the data we have now said Machelle Pardue a research career scientist at the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center who is the senior author of the study She and her colleagues are trying to find ways to determine the impact of exercise on human eyes But such experiments will take years to return results  For now she and Dr Boatright said people who are concerned about their vision and especially those with a family history of retinal degeneration might want to discuss an exercise program with their doctor As potential treatments go she said its cheap easy and safe   Dr Boatright agreed adding that eye researchers have been trying for some time to find a way to externally deliver growth factors or drugs to aging eyes but the available methods typically involve injections into the retina a process that is complicated chancy pricey and fundamentally objectionable Now though its beginning to look like we may have this other method  exercise   that costs almost nothing and results in you making your own growth factors which is so much safer and more pleasant than having a needle stuck into your eyeball he said getting no disagreement from me
