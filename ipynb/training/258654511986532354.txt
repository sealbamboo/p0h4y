Accidental falls are one of the   of injury death in people over  worldwide but for a long time researchers have struggled to understand just how they happen     What they do know is that many older patients have   and even the most conscientious medical staff can have trouble remembering details of a fall So a group of researchers in British Columbia decided to use a roundtheclock video in a   facility to observe accidental falls right as they happen    Their   published in the   found that most of the  falls caught on video happened because the patients lost their balance not because they slipped or tripped    But what causes this momentary loss of balance    One simple explanation could be the lack of walkers or wheelchairs says   professor of biomedical physiology and kinesiology at Simon Fraser University and lead author on the study Though  percent of patients reported using a walker or a wheelchair to get around only  percent were using one when they fell he says     That indicates that people are neglecting to use their device but also many times those falls are occurring in those transition periods  when someone is going from the walker to sitting down in the dining room or getting up Robinovitch says So these are very important danger periods that need to somehow be addressed    But convincing patients to actually use their walkers wont solve the problem entirely Robinovitch says that many other factors can make elderly folks lose their balance    They span physiological reasons that may relate to muscle weakness or impaired vision or  different types of medications Robinovitch says And often these factors are coexisting so its difficult to really understand what might be the dominant cause    Robinovitch and his team are also working on solutions to help make the effects of a fall like serious head injuries and wrist fractures less severe     His next project involves the installation of a oneinch thick rubber flooring material in nursing homes which he says can reduce the impact force of falls by  percent    And though trips werent the leading cause of falls among the elderly they came in at number  Robinovitch says there are a few ways to prevent them too Twentyfive percent of trips occurred on the legs of chairs and tables So why dont these items have a central flaring support where there arent so many obstacles that are tripping hazards he says    Most importantly though Robinovitch says that this study creates awareness of the importance of elderly fall prevention Theres some important lessons for how care providers should go about assessing risks for falls and what are the activities that you should be watching for he says
