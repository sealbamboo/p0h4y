You cant hear it over the noise of Londons traffic But its there That faint whining hum Right under my feet thousands of mosquitoes are dining on human blood To visit them you have to go through a sliding glass door into the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine This school started as a hospital on the Thames River where doctors treated sailors returning from faraway places with strange parasites Today the building holds countless exotic diseases that you hope youll never catch The mosquitoes carry just a few of them and their keeper is an entomologist named Dr James Logan To get to them you have to go underground then through two sets of doors and a net and into the restricted access room We dont want any mosquitoes to escape onto the streets of London obviously because weve got tropical mosquitoes here says Logan On the side of the net with the mosquitoes it feels like the worst kind of August afternoon Humid hot and still  just the way mosquitoes like it Were in low caverns that were built almost  years ago and we have to duck so we dont hit our heads Luckily we have quite short people who work in our insectaries Logan says But these rooms are part of the vaults of the building At one time during World War II for example they were used as shelters Clear plastic boxes line the walls each one holding hundreds of mosquitoes Some are from Pakistan others from Tanzania There are mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus and dengue fever The really dangerous ones live in a different room though When you jostle a box the mosquitoes go crazy hungry for blood What I can probably do as well actually is put my hand inside if you want to see them he says When I press him on his willingness to be eaten by his mosquitoes he makes a confession Actually I have to admit I have to put my hands up and admit I dont do it myself Logan says Not because Im a wimp but because I react really badly to mosquito bites to that particular species So we have some people who dont react at all and they can do it Or we take blood from people and feed them artificially Malaria and other mosquitoborne illnesses kill hundreds of thousands of people every year This lab is doing research that could help lower that number Its the reason people call Dr Logan the mosquito slayer He cultivates these insects to learn how better to obliterate them on a massive scale Speaking of massive he points out a box behind me with enormous mosquitoes each one the size of a small beetle This species doesnt actually feed on humans The larvae eat other mosquito larvae so this is actually a beneficial kind of mosquito I stick my microphone into the box and that spinetingling whine immediately pierces my ears Suddenly I catch a movement out of the corner of my eye Its definitely a mosquito on the loose But Logan isnt worried Its a male he says How I ask can you tell that the tiny thing buzzing around is a male They have bushy antennae he says noting that only the females bite Then he snatches it out of the air Dr James Logan is an entomologist whos not afraid to squish a bug
