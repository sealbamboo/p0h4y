An overhaul of the way ambulance service and AE department performance in Wales is monitored and measured will be trialled next month The Welsh government says new indicators will give patients a more meaningful understanding of the quality of care to expect It has been claimed present targets are too narrow focusing on response times or patients waiting in AE However political opponents have questioned the motives for change New indicators for the ambulance service and AE will focus on three key treatment areas  care for people who have had heart attacks strokes or fractured hips The targets will look at how good ambulance crews are at administrating the most appropriate care In some cases if symptoms are detected early then patients can be referred directly to surgery or other departments instead of AE It is hoped it could help relieve pressures on emergency units and reduce ambulance queues However the old targets will not immediately be scrapped and will continue for the time being Health Minister Mark Drakeford said I want us to judge the success of our services by measuring things which make a difference to patients and the effectiveness of the treatment they receive This development work will make sure what we measure is more meaningful in terms of clinical benefit and outcomes for patients rather than on the basis of time alone Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Mr Drakeford also defended the new targets and said they would not be complex and difficult for people to understand Dr Grant Robinson the Welsh governments clinical lead on unscheduled care said Its about giving patents the right care at the right place at the right time We absolutely dont want to forget about those measures of timeliness Thats why well continue to report against them What were saying is that other measures are just as important or more important including measures of safety clinical outcomes and time to get the right treatment It is unclear exactly how the new indicators will be measured but the Welsh government says information will be publicly available for example on a   which already publishes data about some targets Richard Lee head of clinical service at the Welsh Ambulance Service said the pilot aimed to assess how effective staff are at providing some treatments at the scene or on the way to hospitals What were doing is looking at outcomes for patients and the care we provide We know for lots of conditions theres no clinical evidence to support the arrival of an ambulance within eight minutes he said The new indicators are announced on the day the latest statistics on ambulance response times are due to be published The Welsh Ambulance Services target is to respond to  of potentially lifethreatening calls in eight minutes The target has only been achieved once since Summer  and performance has lagged behind ambulance services in England and Scotland However the ambulance chief also stressed that changes to indicators was absolutely not an admission of defeat Clearly the length of time somebody waits for an ambulance when theyre in pain or frightened is a really important matter for us and the public he said Were not stopping reporting the timeliness targets Eventually the Welsh government intends to extend similar outcomebased targets to other areas for example cancer care and eye care Kirsty Williams Welsh Liberal Democrats leader said she welcomed improved clinical outcomes for patients but was nervous that the motivation for these changes is based on the Welsh Labour government trying to avoid the flurry of negative headlines we have seen in recent months  Conservative Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar AM said Communities across Wales will rightly question the motives behind these changes
