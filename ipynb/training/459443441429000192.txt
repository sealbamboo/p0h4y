A sizable investor in Allergan Inc. doesn't favor the offer Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. has made for the Botox maker, in conjunction with activist William Ackman..  Dan Davidowitz, the chief investment officer of Polen Capital Management LLC, said Thursday in an interview: "We think we could get this type of price just from another couple of years of compound earnings growth. So I don't think this is that attractive of an offer."
