Scientists know that the   to make a vodka martini is to mix the ingredients with a thin wooden spoon  it combines the ingredients effectively without raising the drinks temperature the way a metal stirrer would So why would James Bond the worlds most sophisticated martini drinker routinely order his cocktail shaken not stirred A trio of British medical researchers believe they have the answer The heavydrinking  most likely suffered from an alcoholinduced tremor that forced him to shake his martinis In fact they argue the British Secret Intelligence Service agent with a license to kill consumed so much alcohol that he ought to be dead Ideally vodka martinis should be stirred not shaken the researchers   in the British Medical Journals Christmas issue That Bond would make such an elementary mistake in his preferences seemed incongruous with his otherwise impeccable mastery of culinary etiquette The  s Christmas issue is known for its       but the authors who diagnosed James Bond took the matter quite seriously For starters they used the books by Sir Ian Fleming as their source material not the movies Two of the  books were excluded from the analysis  The Spy Who Loved Me was dropped because it was told from the point of view of a waitress who doesnt introduce Bond until twothirds of the way into the story and Octopussy and the Living Daylights failed to make the cut because its a series of short stories The other  books were read by the study authors curled up at home in comfy chairs As they read the researchers took detailed notes about Bonds activities including his drinking They looked up drink recipes on Wikipedia to figure out the ingredients in each of his cocktails In cases where the storyline was vague  ie Bond got drunk or there was an order to bring in the drink tray  the researchers made relatively conservative estimates in the context of his overall drinking habits according to the study Then they crunched all their numbers The study authors calculate that the total elapsed time in the  novels added up to  days during which  consumed  grams of pure alcohol Thats not the combined volume of his many cocktails  thats just the amount of proof ethanol This works out to  grams of pure alcohol per week or  grams per day For the sake of comparison the British National Health Service advises men not to exceed  grams of alcohol per week with no more than  grams on a single day and at least two days per week that are alcoholfree Among Bonds  recorded days  were alcoholfree But on  of those days he was not alcoholfree by choice On these occasions he was locked up in jail laid up in a hospital or doing a stint in rehab and unable to imbibe Taking those days out of the equation the  grams over  days averages out to  grams of pure alcohol per week or  grams per day But thats just an average The peak of s drinking came on Day  of the mission described in From Russia With Love During that hour period  drank a whopping  grams of pure alcohol the study authors calculated To consume that much alcohol youd have to down about  vodka martinis assuming theyre made with the proof vodka the strongest option listed on this handy   from the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism one of the National Institutes of Health If youre drinking something more tame like beer or wine it would take about  glasses to get the same amount of alcohol These drinking habits would put Bond at serious risk of some serious diseases including hypertension stroke depression and sexual dysfunction which would considerably affect his womanising the study notes Most important the study authors say Bonds risk of developing liver cirrhosis is at least seven times greater than for a nondrinker A person with cirrhosis dies at age  on average according to the BMJ study Fleming a heavy drinker and smoker died of heart disease when he was only  and we suspect that Bonds life expectancy would be similar the researchers writeÂ  Bond himself had even lower expectations In Moonraker he says he expects to be killed before he turns  and is forced to retire from the  section of MI Perhaps this helps explain why In Goldfinger Bond drives home after consuming  grams of pure alcohol in an evening with Auric Goldfinger And in Casino Royale  has  grams of alcohol before participating in a highspeed car chase that lands him in the hospital for two weeks We hope that this was a salutatory lesson the study authors write Getting back to the issue of Bonds shaken martinis the researchers cite a   in the Journal or Neurology Neurosurgery  Psychiatry that pegged heavy drinkers as having a four times greater risk of developing an essential tremor compared to light drinkers   is an unintentional rhythmic muscle movement of one or more parts of the body according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders  Stroke The most common body part affected is the hand the institute says James Bond was unlikely to be able to stir his drinks even if he would have wanted to because of likely alcohol induced tremor the researchers conclude Bonds heavy drinking may have been a response to his job stress as well as his need to rub elbows with folks who arent exactly teetotalers the study authors note We appreciate the societal pressures to consume alcohol when working with international terrorists and highstakes gamblers But thats no excuse for being such a lush the researchers add We would advise Bond be referred for further assessment of his alcohol intake and reduce his intake to safe levels They are doctors after
