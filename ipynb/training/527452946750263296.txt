In a bid to save his job Sanofi chief executive Chris Viehbacher last month wrote a letter to the board of directors to explain why it would be a bad idea to replace him Viehbacher sent the letterÂ in response to what he called rumors about board interest in letting him go The letter followed growing tension with some directors over various decisions he has taken The most recent tension reportedly occurred over his plan to sell about  billion in drugs a move that was reportedly was not conveyed to the board For its part the drug maker has only said that from time to time Sanofis board meets in nonexecutive sessions to discuss a wide range of issues In comments today Viehbacher says succession issues were not on the agenda at a regularly scheduled board meeting yesterday but did not otherwise mention the letter You have seen the transformation of the company over the past six years Im proud of that track record
