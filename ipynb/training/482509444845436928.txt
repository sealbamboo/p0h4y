And so another working week is about to draw to a close Not a moment too soon yes As you may recall this is our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans Once again our own agenda is quite modest We plan to spend time with assorted short and notsoshort people visit the Pharmalot ancestors and if we get our chores done catch up on some reading But what about you This is the time of year to enjoy the great outdoors so perhaps a drive to the beach or to the country is in order You could tidy up around your own castle if the weather fails to cooperate Or simply spend time with some fun people Whatever you do have a grand time And be safe See you soon
