As if women needed another reason to kick the habit a new study shows that smoking can speed the ticking of the biological clock hastening the onset of menopause Researchers found that heavy smoking white women with a certain genetic mutation entered menopause nearly nine years early according to the study published in Menopause That particular mutation occurred in about  percent of the white women in the study   The study was designed to look at the effects of specific genes that interact with substances in tobacco smoke said Dr Samantha Butts the studys lead author and an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania A lot of toxins are inactive when entering the body she explained Some of these genes are ones that make inert toxins more toxic The ongoing study followed  women aged  to  for  years Half the women were AfricanAmerican and half whites of European origin Overall current smokers in the study entered menopause a year younger than their nonsmoking counterparts Though the findings did not extend to the AfricanAmerican women Butts believes researchers will eventually find other genes to explain smokings impact on the fertility of black women  We know that smoking significantly damages eggs Butts said This paper was designed to shed light on the fact that every woman is not at the same risk Some are at exquisitely higher risk
