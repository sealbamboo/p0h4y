A key report into the sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile of patients at Stoke Mandeville hospital is to be published on Thursday The investigation into the scale and details of the sexual assaults on patients at the Buckinghamshire hospital was delayed after new information came to light The report overseen by former barrister Kate Lampard is likely to highlight how Savile who died in October  abused his position within the hospital and in his role as a charity fundraiser to abuse and attack vulnerable patients Savile a volunteer porter at the hospital was said to have committed  offences Savile raised m for Stoke Mandeville and boasted that he lived in a bedroom that hospital managers had given him and he could do as he pleased Three investigations were launched at Stoke Mandeville Leeds general infirmary and Broadmoor hospital after details emerged about cases of alleged abuse by Savile in hospitals   reports on Leeds and Broadmoor were published last year but those abused by Savile at Stoke Mandeville were told that the publication of the investigation  featuring some of his worst offences  had been postponed after new information was received In a separate report also to be published on Thursday Lampard will highlight recommendations to stop such a scandal occurring again within NHS hospitals Over more than four decades the entertainer conducted what previous reports have said was truly awful sexual abuse within the wards of hospitals where he was given free rein by staff At Broadmoor he had keys allowing him unrestricted access He was allowed to watch female patients strip and bathe The inquiry was also given macabre accounts of Savile acting unacceptably with dead bodies in the Leeds mortuary Michael Salmon  a consultant paediatrician was last week convicted of nine indecent assaults carried out against girls at Stoke Mandeville and two counts of rape Salmon was abusing girls at the hospital between  and   a time when Savile also had unfettered access to patients in the hospital He was jailed for a minimum of nine years for what the judge at Reading crown court said was a horrific abuse of vulnerable children Salmon had previously been jailed for three years in  after admitting indecent assaults on two yearold girls and a yearold girl He was struck off the medical register in  But further allegations about Salmon were made to the Metropolitan police in  during investigations of historical abuse carried out by Savile and others One woman told BBC Radio s Today programme that Savile began molesting her in the early s when she was a yearold auxiliary at Stoke Mandeville  The woman who was given the pseudonym Debra said It was always very casual patting on the bottom to start with then he Savile was always trying to push the boundaries with me  putting his hands under my skirt trying to put his hands inside my knickers  She said the abuse lasted  months but she was too frightened to report it I was just starting out and didnt want to rock the boat the former nurse said I think people must have covered up for him because I cant believe people didnt know about it I imagine people knew he was doing it and just chose to not to say anything Stoke Mandevilles former director of nursing Chris McFarlane said Savile had  access to all parts of the hospital  If he knocked on a closed door and somebody opened the door Jimmy would be allowed in I dont believe I knew anybody who would have said Y oure not allowed in here because he was Jimmy Savile How could we have allowed him to sit with our patients in the spinal unit some of whom were paralysed from the neck down maybe he was just talking to them maybe he was doing much more than that patients wouldnt have known  Lawyers for Saviles victims are demanding that managers at the hospital at the time of the abuse are held to account  Slater and Gordon which represents  former staff and patients who say they were abused by Savile at Stoke Mandeville said it beggars belief that senior staff failed to intervene Solicitor Liz Dux said The victims are hopeful the review will establish a much greater level of accountability than the previous one did Anything less will rightly be seen as a whitewash by those people still suffering from the awful crimes Savile committed all those years ago Abigail who was abused by Savile when she was an yearold patient in the s said I want to see some accountability from the report in to Stoke Mandeville No one has properly said sorry We must make sure this can never ever happen again to anyone else in an institution No more lives must be ruined Sylvia Nicol a former trustee of the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust said Savile was welcomed with open arms where ever he went  I never heard any rumours  She added Im not denying anything took place  but I can only say that I saw him do good I cant be a judge or jury on anything else none of the sadness that seems to have been going on there was I aware of Dux told the BBC that many of her clients had given evidence of how they reported abuse at the time but they were told to keep quiet One of them has named the senior nursing sister to whom she told immediately after she had been assaulted in the childrens ward She was told by the senior nursing sister Be quiet you silly girl Do you know what he does for the hospital The senior nurse has since died Dux said We do know that numerous people reported Saviles abuse to senior members of staff They will want answers today as to why people didnt act I hope the inquiry does try to name people and I hope those people who are still alive who did know what was happened feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves  She said nothing more could be done to punish those who knew Deliberately turning a blind eye is not a crime at the moment which is why we are calling for a change in the law supported by Labour and the Liberal Democrats so that if abuse happens in a regulated activity and a blind eye is turned in future those people can be prosecuted
