s a patient I like the look of Simon Stevens   pdf It doesnt prescribe in detail what should happen to the existing silos primary and secondary care but stands back to look at patient care in the round This seems to infuriate the medics who see their centuryold world crashing down around them and there is a vocal group of   who dont like it Listen to how some doctors comment on an article in one of the GP house magazines outlining the Five Year Forward View  I no longer believe a single word from NHS England  who I hold in well deserved contempt  Ah you gotta love it The Five Year Backwards Plan would seem more apt What a novel idea  consultants employed by primary care and GPs employed by the hospital What a load of rubbish  The Five Year Forward View which was coauthored with CQC Monitor the Trust Development Authority Public Health England and Health Education England  So it was authored by people who know sweet fall about primary care  Not even simple Simon understands what he is talking about  after helping to wreck the NHS as Blairs adviser he has had further training in mindless stupid and deranged management at the immoral United    his plan regurgitates all the failed rubbish from the past and wilfully avoids the real crisis  the catastrophically deranged and damaging NHS changes since his  wrecking plan started the deluded managerial nonevidencebased cult of willful blind doctrinaire willful stupidity One can expect that some doctors might be so close to the end of their tether that they express themselves in this dare I say unprofessional way I do not blame them What worries me is that  of the  comments are all in the same vein The only comment that takes a more positive view of the plan is not from a GP but a practice manager Not one of the  doctors seems to have read the whole report or tried to understand its general drift much of which I as a patient would have thought to be good news for clinicians For instance he wants bn of extra funding from the government But of course the plan suggests that bn can be saved by new ways of working and thinking and that seems to be anathema to the readers of this GP magazine All this I find rather odd as I find that what   is proposing is already happening where I live The GP practice I attend is merging with another local practice and moving to more fitforpurpose new premises They will be installing more testing equipment and offering new services Also in my area a new medical centre has been built for a GP practice where a local hospital offers outpatient clinics in various specialisms These two initiatives seem to be closing the gap between primary and secondary care and bringing services usually associated with hospitals closer to the GP and the patient As a patient fed up with being stuck in the endless cycles of echo cardiograms tests and waiting for specialist appointments this delights me This surely is one of the things the Five Year Forward View is all about The same magazine also gathered views from some of the   movers and shakers including some heads of the clinical commissioning groups Almost all were reasonably positive They also show that the  naysaying commenters may just be a vocal minority of medical trolls stuck in the past If however the naysayers are in fact the majority of GPs then Stevens plan is in trouble To use a first world war analogy he has the general staff with him but the disillusioned rank and file clinicians are mutinous When the whistle blows for Stevens to lead his men over the top the medical infantry might refuse to follow or worse still shoot him in the back It would not be the first time this has happened to gamechanging NHS field marshals To avoid this catastrophe Stevens should train his frontline officers the senior partners in GP practices and hospital consultants to be leaders motivated to take the mutinous trolls into a different and better sort of world Not an easy task when the trolls are culturally stuck in an imaginary past golden age But I do find that the platoon commanders of the medical profession are failing in this leadership task
