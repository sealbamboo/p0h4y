n  I became the th person in the world to undergo an intestinal transplant which took place at the Churchill hospital in Oxford I knew a key postoperative requirement would be the constant monitoring of my condition What I didnt appreciate was the time and effort it would take On the third anniversary of my surgery I was diagnosed with highgrade B cell lymphoma Like so many I constantly use my mobile phone and technology as part of my everyday life I want to manage my health journey in the same way Why cant I receive blood results via text or use Skype calls for routine followups The truth is I can Information governance is no excuse and privacy and security challenges can be overcome The technology is also not to blame and some companies are already helping   organisations to safely and securely unlock the value of their information with models that can be integrated within their IT systems In my case it took bravery  the bravery of a surgeon who said If that is how you want to interact then lets do it How much simpler is it to text routine blood results It saves clinical and patient time and improves efficiency Why wouldnt you use this in everyday messaging of routine results It takes a cultural change for the system to go from no we cant to yes and this is how we can Being a longterm patient with multiple complex chronic conditions means two things to me Firstly its imperative that I am an active participant in every aspect of my care I want to know everything that is happening to me and be part of every decision Secondly I am aware that I am one of the biggest drains on healthcare resources When I asked my surgeon if I could Skype him instead of travelling for  minutes for a routine appointment he agreed and emailed me to confirm I had given my consent As he was about to dial in the four nurses in the room walked out from fear of interacting with a patient in this way Here a patient was consenting to using a freely available and perfectly capable service but because it was a health discussion they didnt want to engage The surgeon went home and we did the call from his house Eighteen months on at the same hospital Skype clinics have become the norm They are being adopted in other departments in the trust and the email consent is now a threeline letter It saves time money and improves efficiency and patient satisfaction When I come to the clinic the medical team are up to date with what issues need managing and tests have been prearranged I recognise technology is not for everyone but   has some interesting health facts   of people go online to look up health matters  do it from home via their mobile and  of patients benefit from online communities The biggest demographic of online patient users are those over  according to   We are ready for this technological change but the cultural shift that is needed in the NHS is not there yet there arent enough brave chief executives or clinicians Patients understand the benefits and data protection issues can be overcome Years ago the idea of getting money by walking up to a cashpoint where anyone could see you typing in a pin number would have been laughed at Now we can bank on our mobiles we can shop and manage virtually every aspect of our lives through technology I want to manage my healthcare in the same way
