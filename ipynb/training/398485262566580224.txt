Trans fat can be found in processed foods including desserts microwave popcorn products frozen pizza margarine and coffee creamer and has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease Partially hydrogenated oil is formed when hydrogen is added to liquid oils to make solid fats like shortening and margarine It increases the shelf life and the flavor of foods Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil or shortening was used in American kitchens as early as  However in recent years many food manufacturers have taken steps to limit or eliminate trans fat from their products  McDonalds for

hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads in restaurants Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday that he was encouraged by the FDAs move The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason Theyve worked Today New Yorkers life expectancy is far higher than the national average and weve achieved dramatic reductions in disease including heart disease The FDA deserves great credit for taking this step which will help Americans live longer healthier lives Bloomberg said Trans fat intake among American consumers decreased from  grams per day in  to about a gram a day in  according to the FDA However current intake remains a significant public health concern FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a written statement  There is no safe level of consumption of trans fat Hamburg said It has been shown to raise the bad or LDL cholesterol  Through our efforts at product reformulation and the development of suitable alternatives trans fats that are not naturally occurring have been drastically reduced in the food supply the Grocery Manufacturers Association which represents more than  food beverage and consumer product companies said in a prepared statement  Since  food manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the amounts of trans fats in their food products by over  Other countries are also working to reduce trans fat in the food supply Policies in Brazil Costa Rica Denmark the Netherlands South Korea and the United States have proved effective over the past two decades the World Health Organization said in April The WHO has called for eliminating trans fat from the global food supply  The FDA has opened a day comment period on the determination to collect additional data and to gain input on the time potentially needed for food manufacturers to reformulate products that currently contain artificial trans fat should this determination be finalized the agency said  There are two phases to the process FDA officials said Thursday The agency will evaluate the comments and evidence received during the comment period If we finalize our conclusion then we are inviting comments from industry on what would be an appropriate phaseout said Michael Taylor the agencys deputy commissioner for foods  The timeline would be based on the comments we get Given the public health impact we want to move as quickly as we can The National Restaurant Association noted in a statement the industrys tremendous strides in reducing or eliminating trans fats We plan to discuss the impact of this proposal on the industry and submit comments and we will continue to work with our members and the manufacturing supply chain to address any new federal standards that may arise out of this process said Joan McGlockton the associations vice president of industry affairs and food policy Hamburg called Thursdays move an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat The American Heart Association the American Medical Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest were among those praising the move The scientific evidence is clear  eating food with trans fat increases production of bad cholesterol which is a risk factor for heart disease the AHA said  So what should consumers do in the meantime Choose products that have the lowest combined amount of saturated fat cholesterol and trans fat the FDA said Under current regulations companies can claim their food has  grams of trans fat if the food contains less than  grams of trans fat per serving according to Mical Honigfort a consumer safety officer at the FDA But if partially hydrogenated oil is listed in the ingredients there may still be a small amount of trans fat present Nancy Brown the Heart Associations CEO said she hopes the FDA goes a step further and revises labels for foods that are trans fat free  The preliminary determination was based on available scientific evidence and the findings of expert scientific panels the FDA said  The determination covers only partially hydrogenated oils not trans fat that naturally occurs in some meat and dairy products Trans fat is also present at very low levels in other edible oils such as fully hydrogenated oils where it is unavoidably produced during the manufacturing process according to the FDA Avoiding foods containing artificially produced trans fat could prevent  to  heart attacks and  to  coronary heart disease deaths each year according to one study from the US   Artificial trans fat is a uniquely powerful promoter of heart disease and todays announcement will hasten its eventual disappearance from the food supply said Michael Jacobson the Center for Science in the Public Interests executive director Not only is artificial trans fat not safe its not remotely necessary Many companies large and small have switched to healthier oils over the past decade I hope that those restaurants and food manufacturers that still use this harmful ingredient see the writing on the wall and promptly replace it
