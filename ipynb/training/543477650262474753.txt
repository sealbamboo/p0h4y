Misunderstandings about whether some types of jobbased coverage disqualify consumers from signing up for subsidized insurance through the health laws marketplaces may lead some people to buy skimpier employer plans instead In recent weeks some of the people called assisters who help shoppers find coverage say consumers are being told by employers that their barebones plans meet the minimum requirements under the law That kind of insurance would cover preventive benefits for instance but might leave out prescription drugs and emergency care The problem is that consumers mistakenly think that having access to skimpy coverage means they dont qualify for subsidies if they want to buy a more complete policy on the exchanges instead But thats not necessarily the case Rather they would be ineligible for subsidies if their employer plan is deemed affordable under the law and pays for  percent of allowed medical charges on average Coverage is considered affordable if it costs no more than  percent of an employees income for individual coverage Some of the confusion relates to the similarsounding bureaucratic names for these different legal standards Minimum value coverage means the plan pays for  percent of allowed medical charges on average Minimum essential coverage which can include a range of things from grandfathered health plans to some of the preventiononly plans being offered by large employers refers to what large employers must offer to avoid paying penalties for not offering coverage as well as what individuals must carry to comply with the laws coverage requirement Some consultants have reportedly developed jobbased plans that   Unlike small group and individual plans which are required to provide comprehensive coverage under the health law no such requirements exist for large group plans Its hard for consumers to understand how a plan that is lousy in their eyes could somehow prevent them from getting subsidies on the exchange says JoAnn Volk a senior research fellow at Georgetown Universitys Center On Health Insurance Reforms The federal government recently   saying that plans that dont include coverage of hospitalization services and doctors visits dont satisfy the minimum value standard even if they manage to meet the  percent actuarial value threshold without those benefits Until final regulations are released next year workers who are offered such plans   on the exchanges the guidance said The vast majority of plans are believed to   however No more than  percent of people covered by employersponsored insurance   million people  are enrolled in plans with an actuarial value of less than  percent according to a  estimate by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Those affected are more likely to be in lowwage jobs and may not have had health insurance before In addition because the  percent affordability standard is based on the cost of employeeonly coverage rather than family coverage most plans will be considered affordable says Judith Solomon vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Having said that we know there were some pretty shabby plans being offered out there Solomon says During open enrollment health   a summary of benefits and coverage that explains the details of the plan and also states whether it provides minimum essential coverage and meets minimum value standards We were hearing from assisters that people were having trouble understanding this employer coverage information says Cheryl FishParcham private insurance program director at Families USA a consumer advocacy organization Families USA and other advocacy groups sent a letter to the administration requesting that it amend the summary of benefits and coverage requirements to add language informing people that they could be eligible for premium assistance on the marketplace if their employer plan doesnt meet the minimum value standard FishParcham says Workers who are filling out an application for a marketplace plan and are uncertain about whether their onthejob coverage meets minimum value standards can   from   and ask their employer to complete it However employers arent required to fill out the form Its a bewildering process says FishParcham
