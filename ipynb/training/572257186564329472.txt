Measures to protect childrens health should be put at the forefront of the general election say doctors  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said child health was falling to the wayside with too much attention on the elderly It said there was large public support for junk food advertising bans cooking lessons in school and lowering speed limits  It added that such measures would make moral economic and political sense Dr Hilary Cass the president of the college said We often see policies hitting the headlines that are targeted at the ageing population  increased funding for dementia research and additional dementia training for NHS workers are among the pledges that have been made in recent weeks  But whilst caring for our ageing population is important it shouldnt mean that childrens health falls to the wayside The organisations poll of  adults in the UK suggested Dr Cass added The UK has the worst child mortality rate in Western Europe has the highest rate of childhood obesity and has an estimated  children and young people living with serious mental health conditions   of five yearolds with anxiety or diagnosable depression are not in contact with mental health services  These are figures that are going to see little improvement if bold policies are not put in place to directly address them  Whats needed is urgent and increased investment in childrens mental health services and policies like taxation of foods high in salt sugar and fat compulsory PSHE lessons in all schools and heightened road safety measures such as mph zones  policies that are backed by the public  I call on the next government to listen to the facts and listen to the public  make child health a priority Not only does it make strong moral sense it makes economic and political sense too
