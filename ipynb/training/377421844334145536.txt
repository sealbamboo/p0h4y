I got so far into it he says I couldnt realize how I got there Like many others who say they are addicted to the Internet Van Cleave likens his addiction to alcoholism  A beer a day becomes a case a day he says You cant stop no matter how much you want to The real problem Van Cleave adds is that most people laugh at you and dont consider it a serious thing That sentiment could change on Monday when the countrys first inpatient treatment program for Internet addiction opens at   in Pennsylvania Ive been studying Internet addiction since  says Dr Kimberly Young a professor at St Bonaventure University and the psychologist who founded the program at Bradford Regional When you talk about the controversy behind it laughing it off thats often been the case with my work The program is designed to accommodate four patients at a time who all begin and end their treatment on the same day The addicts day stay begins with a hour digital detox followed by a full psychological evaluation Young and Dr Roger Laroche the medical director of Bradford Regionals Psychiatry department expect to see withdrawal symptoms in their patients similar to those seen in hardcore drug addicts Some they say will need to be medicated to make it through the detox Were really behind other countries in treating this problem says Young China Korea and Taiwan all have treatment centers Here in the United States people who need treatment dont have anywhere to go Now we finally have something to offer people Because Internet addiction is not classified as a mental illness in the American Psychiatric Associations   often referred to as the psych bible none of the programs  cost will be covered by insurance Dr Allen Frances the chairman of the DSMIV and professor emeritus at Duke University says theres little doubt that some people could indeed suffer from an Internet addiction But he believes the research is premature  The concern is that there will not be a clear bright line in between a true Internet addiction and the rest of us who are using it recreationally he says People can spend  hours a day in front of a screen blow off their wives blow off their work but that doesnt necessarily mean theyre addicted says Frances Addiction implies a pattern of use that you cant stop The compulsion continues even though time spent online is no longer productive or enjoyable Some studies show that the same areas of the brain that light up when alcohol and drug addicts get their fix light up when Internet addicts log on An addict by nature is seeking a rush of dopamine the neurotransmitter that is associated with feelings of reward and pleasure That is a very critical aspect as far as what separates addiction from just a bad habit says Laroche We literally are talking about someone who has jeopardized his life and every aspect of it Dig deeper into the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSMV and youll find an entry for gaming disorder in Section III meaning the American Psychiatric Association believes the condition warrants further research before it can be formally classified as a mental disorder Most Internet addicts it seems are plagued by an addiction to online games more so than other online activities such as looking at porn shopping or using social media Such was the case for   who chronicled his experience in   Van Cleave began gaming when he was a child  At college he says I suddenly had a lot of unsupervised time I started gaming exponentially more If you dont study much you have even more free time Eventually Van Cleave reached a crisis point buried for up to  hours a week in World of Warcraft a roleplaying game in which you can join thousands of mighty heroes in an online world of magic and limitless adventure Van Cleave lost his job some friends and was barely able to save his marriage I pushed it awfully close to the line by not being available for a long time he says It was so obvious these things were happening but I couldnt see it because I was kneedeep in the problem The foreword for Van Cleaves book was written by   a professor at Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom who studies behavioral addictions in the School of Social Sciences He says Internet addiction has five key criteria  The Internet becomes the most important activity in the persons life affecting feelings behaviors and thoughts The person receives an emotional buzz from using the Internet  The person becomes acclimatized requiring increasing amounts of Internet time to get that buzz  Abruptly ceasing Internet activity can cause the personal emotional or physical distress  The addict tends to fall back into the same behavior very easily even after years of abstinence or control When you see that behavior says another recovering addict   its only the tip of the iceberg Youre often going to find underlying issues In Roberts case the underlying mental health issues turned out to be ADHD and anxiety which both went undiagnosed until his Internet addiction spun out of control It was good friends who had been through AA dealing with addiction themselves who recognized Roberts categorical consumption with gaming had reached addictive proportions Unlike van Cleave Roberts went on binges  I would go through periods when I wouldnt indulge he says Other times he would play realtime strategy games for weeks at a time at least eight to  hours a day These binges were usually set off by an emotional trigger I would often be sleepdeprived sometimes going a whole day or two without sleeping Roberts likened himself to a functional drunk  I held a job and paid my bills he says I wasnt real successful at relationships because of the screen but I didnt know that at the time While he was able to keep it together for a while thanks in part to his being selfemployed Roberts eventually began to lose clients I even lost money after performing work for someone he says because I was too busy gaming to send out an invoice  He lost standing in his profession that he may never gain back I eventually stopped gaming Roberts says because the thrill became less and less even as I played more and more  He and Van Cleave are among the minority of Internet addicts experts say who have been able to break their bad habits without an extreme intervention Roberts wrote a book about his experience   Perhaps more importantly he joined a cyberaddiction support group Were always there for each other he says Its our Vitamin C C being for community Its that sense of camaraderie that Young hopes to evoke from her patients at Bradford General Theres a group dynamic in having them be in a class together she says Theres a support system that builds up Its worth noting that   the countrys first retreat center program for Internet addiction opened in  A day retreat to disconnect and find yourself at reSTART costs  after which patients have the option to extend their retreat for  a day depending on their individual treatment needs Van Cleave underscores the importance of getting professional help and learning quite simply how to properly think and function again in daily life Alcoholics can stay out of bars and restaurants that serve booze but an Internet addiction is like an eating disorder he says They have to relearn how to eat what foods to avoid what stores to avoid says Laroche employing the same metaphor But Frances is worried a treatment regimen that could and should be applied to tens of thousands of people will instead be applied to millions Im concerned theres so much publicity about these four lousy beds he says This is being commercialized prematurely Before developing clinical programs we should have the research says Frances This is a dangerous sign of a fad diagnosis Unfortunately the history of psychology is a history of fads like this Remember counters Young when Betty Ford first admitted she was an alcoholic we didnt have people believing it was actually a problem until she came around and talked about her own problems with it This is a place for people to go for help and that we hope will help everyone around them stop taking Internet addiction so lightly
