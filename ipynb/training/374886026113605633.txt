Few medical students receive extensive classroom training about Alzheimers disease or have much experience with someone diagnosed with the incurable brainrobbing disease With as many as  million Americans living with Alzheimers  and that number expected triple by   theres a pressing need for physicians who can recognize it treat its symptoms and better communicate with patients and their caregivers Thats where the Buddy Program comes in  The program is helping improve medical student knowledge and familiarity with Alzheimers while heightening sensitivity and empathy towards dementia patients according to recent research Created in  by Darby Morhardt of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine the Buddy Program pairs medical students with Alzheimers patients or mentors Morhardt presented research results from the program at a recent international Alzheimers conference in Boston  Its very important to put a human face on this disease says Morhardt research professor in cognitive neurology at Northwesterns Alzheimers Disease Center The students are spending most of their lives in a classroom and studying this illness in a textbook And when they meet their buddies theyre seeing the human side of this illness and how someone is actually living with it on a daytoday basis One mentor Anne Shrank is helping medical school students get a look at Alzheimers disease up close Diagnosed with early stage disease when she was  the former biology teacher has joined a buddy program at Northwestern University that pairs Alzheimers patients with firstyear med students  Students dont take care of the patients Instead patients teach the students what everyday life is like for someone with Alzheimers  Ive been an educator all my life Schank now  told NBCNewscom This is sort of a way of just being myself  being a person who can educate someone In the program med students and their mentors are asked to get out of the hospital setting for their meetings at least for four hours each month Many doctorpatient pairs go for walks a trip to a museum or zoo or for a meal The program can help ease the dramatic life changes that descend on the newly diagnosed patient The crux of the thing is that when you are newly diagnosed you often cannot work in the same capacity or do many of the activities you used to Morhardt said But you might still want to participate and contribute in valuable ways Lee Haggenjos a medical student at Northwestern who has been paired with Schank says hes learned a lot from her  Anne is really incredible he told NBCs Maria Schriver She is you know really intelligent really open Its really impressive the courage that she has  to teach me about this so that I can help future patients while at the same time dealing with this herself Patients say their participation makes them feel usefulthat they still have something to give before they lose selfawarenessand because of that their selfesteem and selfworth are boosted Ive gotten a lot of pleasure out of mentoring him Shrank told NBCNewscom  Her husband Bob Schank sees the difference Its given Anne a chance to do something a little different with someone different  not just family and friends he said She comes back very very pleased  The program usually with different titles has been replicated at Boston University Dartmouth College and Washington University and other medical schools around the country Many medical students stay in touch with their mentor buddies over the course of their medical school careers Its not unusual for the person with dementia to not recognize their student maybe three or four years after Morhardt says I often hear how a medical student has stayed in touch with the family after the person has died  For Schank its a chance to take back some control of her life I could get depressed she told NBC News I could make me and everybody around me really miserable Or I can just say hey I wouldnt choose this but here it is and how can we make the best of it
