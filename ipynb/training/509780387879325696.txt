A child isnt   with   until age  or later While the   or ASD may be hard to detect in infants researchers suggest there may be some early indications if you know what to watch for  Children with autism often dont produce many sounds or use their voices to communicate They may engage in frequent repetitive behavior They stare at their hands or at objects for long periods of time  a professor of psychiatry and behavioral studies at   wondered what would happen if a parent could intervene before a child is officially diagnosed with autism   on early intervention has shown   Rogers asked Hinson if she would be interested in becoming  Since the study involved behavioral modification therapy if Noah wasnt diagnosed with autism there would be no harm Hinson said yes as did six other parents with children between the ages of  months and  months who showed some signs of autism  As a parent Ill take anything that can help my child Hinson said For the study she and the other parents visited Rogers clinic once a week for  weeks There the researchers taught the parents behavioral modification techniques they could use on their children  The techniques were simple exercises Hinson would play piggies with Noah reciting   about pigs going to market and touching Noahs feet Often children with autism become distressed when they are touched Other times she would play airplane with Noahs food as she fed him Or theyd focus on songs and rhymes   Basic things you do as a mom but really are cuing into the responses he is making and really reinforcing the responses to get him to engage with me Hinson said The wonderful thing about it was that most of what they taught me they taught me how to use in my general daytoday routines with Noah  Scientists thought parents would be more apt to do exercises that could be woven into daily life  At about  months in there were still concerns but Hinson had noticed improvement in Noahs interactions with her At  months he seemed to be back on track developmentally  It was like this beautiful thing happened Noah didnt just catch up to the developmental goals of other children his age he surpassed them He remained talkative and engaged This completely helped him she said I dont know what would have happened otherwise  She was not alone At  months the group that had used the behavioral intervention techniques with their children had much lower rates for autism spectrum disorder Five children no longer showed symptoms of autism  one had mild autism but no developmental delays and one had severe autism Today Noah is a yearold boy with extensive language skills The scientists behind the study caution that this is only a pilot study the findings cannot be applied to a larger population yet   With seven children you cant draw a conclusion Rogers said But other researchers in the field see real promise in the results   It is exciting to think about an intervention that could change the developmental outcome for babies at risk of autism spectrum disorder said   an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University This pilot study  suggests that parents can be trained to interact with their atrisk infants using many of the same principles that are used for toddlers and preschoolers with ASD It begins to set the scene for future randomized controlled studies to evaluate whether this type of intervention could actually prevent babies from developing full symptoms of autism spectrum disorder VeenstraVanderWeele said  If it proves to work on a larger group this would be a truly transformative finding
