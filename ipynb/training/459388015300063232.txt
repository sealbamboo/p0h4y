Few things drive an emergency room staff quite as nuts as a patient who has yes carefully considered her preferences designated a health care decisionmaker should she become incapacitated and documented all that information in an advance directive  which is sitting in a locked safe deposit box or stashed in an bureau drawer at home But as weve discussed before thats   In fact the president of the American Bar Association Jim Silkenat told me that until recently his own advance directive wasnt easily accessible It was in a file here in my office in Midtown Manhattan he said My kids knew about it but they had no idea where it was Nobody had really focused on it Fortunately since his children live in Scotland and Arizona Mr Silkenat hadnt encountered an emergency requiring them to show up at a hospital with the document But enough people do find themselves in that quandary that the associations Commission on Law and Aging has developed a smartphone app   that allows you to store your own advance directive or family members on your iPhone or Android phone When you need them the app lets you present such documents  and other health information and contacts  via email or Bluetooth Those digitally transmitted documents have the same legal authority as a signed and witnessed form on paper said Mr Silkenat who now uses the app himself Weve tested this with health care providers family members health insurers he said So far its worked well My Health Care Wishes comes in two versions The free one lets you store one persons information the  Pro version offers unlimited storage for any number of people and includes clicktocall and clicktoemail features that let you send the information instantly As readers have pointed out you can store advance directives in other digital ways Several recommended   which for  a year makes health care and legal documents available  with a phone call   is another free webbased system About a dozen states  including     and    have established online registries though not all are very active and there have been attempts to create national registries You could store an emailable document on any phone or tablet sans app or file one in Dropbox or another cloudbased storage system Mr Silkenat unsurprisingly sees advantages to his associations app It works on your cellphone It really is as convenient as we can possibly make it And its free But he cares less about whether you use My Health Care Wishes or some other method than about having your advance directive handy Only a minority of Americans have created such documents but even when they do they arent as useful as intended unless youve taken the next step and made it available to people at the time the problem comes up
