In the countries of West Africa where Ebola is taking its heaviest toll one special concern is for the thousands of children whose parents have died from the illness According to UNICEF at least  children in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to Ebola since the outbreaks start The figures are climbing says Andrew Brooks  s head of child protection for West and Central Africa In Liberia alone where hes currently based Ebola has robbed about  children of their parents One particular case struck him On Sunday he says I was called to one of the Ebola treatment units urgently There was a yearold boy there whose mother was admitted a couple of days before She had arrived in such a terrible state that social workers could get very little information from her All they had was the mothers name two cell phone numbers and the boys name  not even his age The woman died Her son was tested for Ebola and the test result was negative So there was a need to get the boy quickly out of the Ebola treatment unit Brooks says Treatment centers are rough places for children and also are filled with the potential for infection Government social workers found a survivor considered likely immune to the disease who was willing to take the boy in that day But once the little boy was taken to the survivors home Brooks says the community around refused to let the boy stay with her because of the fear because of the stigma that the virus could come into the community The boy was moved to the home of another survivor A social worker was able to track down the boys aunt who was overjoyed to learn that her nephew was still alive Hell move in with her once he clears the day incubation period There are many more like him says Brooks His case shows the complexities of managing this kind of care for a child This isnt the first time Brooks has worked with stigmatized children Years ago he worked in Liberia with Save The Children to resettle former child soldiers sometimes back into the very communities where they had committed atrocities Those were not easy negotiations But this is another dimension says Brooks These children  do represent a real risk a continued risk when they start showing symptoms To some extent the fear of these orphans is legitimate he says Theyve been in close contact with infected people Even if they test negative for the disease early on they arent considered fully clear until theyve made it  days without showing any symptoms Still even people harboring the virus arent contagious unless and until they show symptoms Brooks says the focus now should be educating caregivers about how to care for a potential patient safely  and to seek medical care quickly if the child develops early signs of infection As much as possible children should be cared for by the normal people who care for children  their families extended families communities Brooks says The Liberian government is strengthening the systems that allow social workers to track down extended family members he says As a last resort were starting to work with the government to put in place some centers  called interim care centers  where children can go for the day period Brooks says The centers are meant to provide the reassurance and the confidence that the communities and families would need to be able to take the children home he explains But its an uphill struggle and the needs are far surpassing the available resources at the moment And while more social workers would be helpful Brooks says the top priority is to get enough beds and trained medical staff to keep parents alive
