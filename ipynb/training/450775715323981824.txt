Eating seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day is healthier than the minimum five currently recommended and would prolong lives experts say  A study of  men and women indicated the more fruit and vegetables people ate the less likely they were to die  at any given age  Seven a day cut the risk of dying from cancer and heart disease  But the government says its   is sufficient and that many of us struggle to achieve even this  Experts said other lifestyle factors such as not smoking or drinking excessively may have accounted for the drop in mortality although the study authors said they had tried to account for this  The University College London researchers used the Health Survey for England which collects data from people in England each year through questionnaires and nurse visits to look at diet and lifestyle They analysed data between  and  which provided a snapshot rather than peoples continuing dietary habits The study looked at general mortality as well as death from cancer heart disease and stroke and found risk of premature death from any cause decreased as fruit and veg consumption increased Risk of death by any cause over the course of the study was reduced by  for seven or more portions of fruit and veg up to around  portions a day  Fresh vegetables had the strongest protective effect followed by salad and then fruit Fruit juice conferred no benefit while canned fruit appeared to increase the risk of death  possibly because it is stored in sugary syrup say the researchers Lead investigator Dr Oyinlola Oyebode said The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat the less likely you are to die  at any age She said the size of the effect was staggering but added that eating a few portions a day was still better than nothing Fruit and vegetables could have a protective effect against disease as they contained antioxidants which repair damage to cells she said Dr Oyebode added that both fruit and vegetables contained micronutrients and fibre both of which are good for health She said a portion meant about g oz meaning one large fruit or a handful of smaller fruit or veg But some experts said the work was not conclusive and that other lifestyle factors may have influenced the results Prof Tom Sanders at the School of Medicine Kings College London said it was already known that people who said they ate lots of fruit and vegetables were health conscious educated and betteroff which could account for the drop in risk  You cannot extrapolate from this kind of information to make sensible pronouncements about what people should eat Prof Naveed Sattar of the University of Glasgow said promoting a sevenaday message would be really challenging  It would require governmental support such as subsidising the cost of fruit and vegetables perhaps by taxing sugarrich foods and making available high quality products to all in society he said  Dr Alison Tedstone of Public Health England said the study was interesting but it seemed premature to raise the recommended fruit and veg intake because two thirds of people were not eating five or more portions a day She said people tend to understand this fiveaday message adding I think we should keep it simple and stay as we are We are working very hard to improve the availability of fruit and vegetables as we see it as absolutely integral to somebodys health to choose those five a day she said Victoria Taylor senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation said people were still struggling to meet the existing target of at least five a day  While you may not be getting your five a day theres no reason to give up and stop trying as this study showed there were health benefits for every extra portion of fruit and veg people ate she said  In Australia the governments advice is two plus five a day  encouraging people to eat two helpings of fruit and five portions of vegetables
