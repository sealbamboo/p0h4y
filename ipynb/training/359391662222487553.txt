The woman who suffered a fatal fall from a Texas roller coaster last week is the latest death associated with an amusement ride but researchers say no one really knows how many people are hurt or killed on such attractions every year  from the Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas which bills the story foot ride as the worlds steepest wooden roller coaster  Such deaths typically attract highprofile media coverage but outside of news headlines theres no way to track deaths  or injuries said Dr Gary A Smith director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio  We dont have a really good system for catching all of these said Smith who published a study this year tracking kids younger than  who are hurt on roller coasters carnivals and kiddie rides Many of these go unmonitored and unaddressed About   on such rides thats up to  kids a day in the peak season between May and September Smith found No similar study has been conducted to assess adult amusement park injuries mostly because the research required a linebyline review of data from US emergency department reports  If we started looking we would find similar numbers Smith said  Smiths data didnt include amusement ride deaths either because the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System only includes injuries There were  deaths tied to amusement rides logged between  and  according to a  report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission  But the agency no longer tracks the data so its up to websites like RideAccidentscom to post headlines detailing deaths and injuries reported in the media  The problem of course is that without data on the frequency site and cause of injuries and deaths theres no way to prevent them Smith said Lack of monitoring is exacerbated because theres no state or federal agency responsible for enforcing amusement park safety CPSC has no jurisdiction over socalled fixedsite amusement parks the large theme parks The agency only has authority over mobile amusement rides that travel from community to community  In addition  states have no agency responsible for inspecting amusement rides Six Flags Over Texas will lead its own investigation into AyalaGoanas death in the absence of an outside authority  Officials with the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions or IAAPA note that about  million people both adults and children safely rode  billion rides in the US in  The chance of being seriously injured on a ride at a fixedsite park in the US is about  in  million  But Smith said that basic tracking should be a nobrainer in an industry that attracts so many with the lure of thrills Hed like the CPSC to change the way amusement injuries are coded so that they categorize ride injuries separately from other park injuries so that  We should have a better way to monitor these types of injuries so when we see a pattern we can address them he said  Related stories
