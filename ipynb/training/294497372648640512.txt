Finally I have a word about Manti Teo the star Notre Dame linebacker Heisman trophy runner up who says he was the victim of an ugly hoax where someone  probably a male friend of his  created an online identity of a young women with whom Teo says he fell in love although he never met her Can I just ask you Is it okay that I cant work up a lot of outrage about this Yes lying is bad Teo  who just had an interview with talk show host Katie Couric  admits he   lie at least briefly because he repeated the story in an interview at least once after he knew it wasnt true Overall though he insists he was the victim not the perpetrator of a hoax His family and Notre Dame officials agree especially after the university hired investigators to check the story out  If its all the same to you though Id like to save my outrage for a different story on that campus What happened to a   girl who died not a fake one Lizzy Seeberg This is a good place to mention that what I have to say next isnt for everybodys ears   According to   columnist Melinda Henneberger  herself a Notre Dame alumna  who has reported on this extensively Seeberg was  years old a freshman at St Marys College which is nearby Notre Dame Two years ago she took her own life after she reported to campus police that a Notre Dame football player sexually assaulted her and nothing happened Well not nothing according to Henneberger After Lizzy Seeberg went to campus police a friend of the player in question sent her a series of texts telling her that Messing with Notre Dame football is a bad idea and Dont Do Anything Youd Regret But investigators didnt even interview the accused until  days after the report and five days after shed died Henneberger writes about another incident where a girl claimed shed been assaulted by a player and received text messages telling her to keep her mouth shut In neither case has there been a disciplinary or criminal sanction I will leave it to others to decide whether Notre Dames official attitude toward sexual assault  at least where football players are concerned  takes its cue from the Taliban where anything that happens to a woman is somehow her fault But I want to save some outrage for the rest of us the adults out here who have really left our young people impossibly muddled messages about sexuality This is not to excuse violence or even irresponsible behavior by any means But it is to say that our messages as a culture to young people are utterly incoherent The traditionalist message about sex No Stop Dont Quick Get married To someone of the opposite sex  absolutely ignores the reality that there is for most people these days a very long ramp to adulthood That marriage at  or  or  isnt the norm That different people love differently and it can take time to figure that out And that there is a deep desire for both physical and emotional intimacy during that long ramp to adulthood that No Stop Dont does not address In Teos case is it really hard to understand why a young man being held to certain expectations might satisfy that desire with an online relationship with a girl he never met But the hyperliberal message about sex Whatever Its All Good doesnt do it either Whatever doesnt describe or explain the deep power of sex or the reality that not everything that feels good is good for you Dont get me started on a culture that tells girls to own their inner vixen while still punishing the victim when it all goes wrong Dont get me started on a culture that claims everybodys equal but still tells boys  like sportscaster Brent Musburger did recently  that   reward for being successful at something say football is that they get the girl as if shes a giftwrapped present So yes lying is bad But lets be mad at ourselves because we are lying to young people everyday by refusing to tell them what we know is true Sex is big powerful and complicated And the time and place to find that out should not be in a locker room at a kegger on the Internet or god forbid at the police station
