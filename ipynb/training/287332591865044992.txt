Old Aristocracy Hill isnt a part of Springfield Ill that draws a lot of attention The quiet neighborhood dates back to before the Civil War its historic homes now carefully preserved by proud business owners But outside a stately funeral home a large blackandchrome Harley Davidson motorcycle trike pulls out of the parking lot towing a matching casket in its glasssided trailer Its not something you would expect to see but its exactly what yearold Lew Bird says his friend Dave Rondelli wanted one last ride Our generation the baby boomers have really taken to motorcycles Were retiring and we can afford to do that kind of thing Bird says He loved it He retired and he rode his bike a lot You know guess if youre going to go out go out the way you like to go Chris Butler director of Butler Funeral Home says he bought the motorcycle funeral coach because his customers are increasingly seeking a highly personal and unique experience Funeral customs and rituals he adds tend to evolve with time and reflect the culture in which theyre practiced Today people are wanting very much for their ceremonies to reflect their life the meaning of their life Butler explains So we can offer families the traditional as well as unique options for remembering their loved one He also says posting an obituary on his companys Facebook page is another option to get funeral information out to the community quickly But not everyone in the business agrees its a good idea Randall Earl former president of The National Funeral Directors Association which tracks trends in the industry has been in the business for  years and holds concerns about some of the innovations including utilizing social media in the funeral planning and grieving process It can be very harmful if you have family members who are angry with other family members and they have a death Earl says He maintains that its just too difficult to control whats said and done by mourners on social media platforms I would say were just trying to protect our business as well as the families we serve and I do not have a Twitter or Facebook for those reasons Earl explains Others like Greg Young argue that protecting families and social media dont have to be mutually exclusive The yearold entrepreneur who left his job at IBM five years ago to launch   maintains that careful use of social media can vastly improve a memorial experience while upholding an appropriate level of privacy Every funeral home needs to have their own strategy theres no cookiecutter approach Young says There may be some times that you do not want to post the obituary and we do have those cases that we work with Youngs company sells Web mobile and social media marketing and believes that like so many other things the future of funeral planning will rely on tablets and smartphones As families scatter across the globe he says that often the best way for his clients to connect with mourners may well indeed be online Were really starting to push webcasting which has been out there for years but funeral homes typically have not accepted it Young explains We think its very important to preserve that moment so that generations to come can easily come back and access that information and learn more about their ancestors All of the recent innovations  webcasting for genealogy Facebook pages for grieving families mobile devices to plan a funeral or find an obituary even a motorcycle hearse  may or may not stand the test of time But whats clear is that whatever changes endure will likely be those sought by baby boomers who continue to drive consumer trends in life and in death
