The fourhour AE waiting time target should be downgraded as it is distorting priorities experts say The call by the Nuffield Trust comes as one of the most difficult winters for years is coming to an end with all four parts of the UK missing the target The think tank said the fixation meant other bottlenecks such as ambulance delays and waits for beds were not getting enough attention It said using a range of measures would give a more balanced picture The Nuffield Trust suggested long waits for beds  known as trolley waits  ambulance delays the numbers leaving AE without being seen and patient satisfaction surveys could also be used to assess performance It said waiting times for treatments would still be measured as part of this more comprehensive monitoring regime It comes as the latest figures show a slight worsening of waits in AE in England  In the week leading up to Sunday  of patients were seen in fours down from  last week The think tank which has produced a briefing document on the pressures facing the system said hospital managers were spending too much time and effort trying to meet a target which for many hospitals was proving very difficult Overall the target has not been hit on a weekly basis since September but once the minor units such as walkin centres and minor injuries are stripped out the major units  known as type ones  have not achieved the target since July  Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said The fourhour target has come to loom over every other measure of how well patients with urgent needs are being cared for Nobody denies that it really matters to people But there are a lot of other things that matter in emergency healthcare  Politicians and regulators need to stop micromanaging this target and should instead examine how to put the fourhour target on an equal footing with other critical indicators The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said it was broadly supportive of the suggestions The fourhour standard has reduced the amount of time patients spend in the emergency department though it is clearly only one measure among many which should be used to measure the performance of departments a spokesman added A spokesman for NHS England said health leaders were already being encouraged to use a richer range of data to monitor performance  We welcome contributions such as this that will help us to identify how we can work more efficiently
