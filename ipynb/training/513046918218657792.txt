All his adult life Paul Ward heard his parents say they wanted their bodies given to a medical school after their deaths They felt that training a new doctor would be a gift to society he said In  his yearold father Ralph suddenly took ill and entered hospice care So Mr Wards wife Maureen Arrigo undertook to arrange a donation Giving a body to science proved more difficult than expected however Ms Arrigo first called the University of Southern California No go You had to be within either an hours drive or a certain number of miles she recalled The nursing home where Ralph Ward was dying was too far away Next Ms Arrigo tried nearby Loma Linda University School of Medicine It required a form signed by the donor himself not a family member even one with power of attorney Her fatherinlaw by that point was well beyond being able to sign anything she said Loma Linda advised however that other schools would accept donations by family members It would make my motherinlaw very sad not to be able to do this last thing for him Ms Arrigo said I was frantic to make it happen Her third call to Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona Calif which trains many kinds of health care professionals brought success The university emailed a simple document collected Ralph Wards body after he died and asked whether his widow wanted the cremains returned to her or scattered at sea She chose the latter option And her son made sure that she signed her own gift document so that the university can receive her body when she dies Though many of the nations  medical schools have begun to supplement their anatomy labs with digital instruction all still use cadavers for some aspect of their medical education said Richard Drake director of anatomy at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and a board member of the American Association of Anatomists Its still one of the best ways to learn anatomy Programs that train dentists physical therapists and nursepractitioners use cadavers too so do researchers developing new surgical techniques and other experimental procedures But while the need continues  particularly in places with lots of medical schools and research facilities like New York City  donating a body can take both planning and documentation Under the    its most recent version introduced in  has been adopted by  states  any individual can sign a document of gift donating his organs and tissue or his full body for transplantation therapy or for research or education Organ donation draws far more attention partly because we have all heard and read about transplants lifesaving potential but perhaps also because federal law requires hospitals to refer families and patients to an organ procurement organization Youre less likely if a relative is near death or has just died to hear anything about donating his or her body Nobodys there making a pitch said Sheldon Kurtz who teaches health law at the University of Iowa College of Law and was the principal drafter of the  act The law says that if the donor didnt arrange during his lifetime to donate his body family members can do so on his behalf unless he signed a form refusing donation Family members can do so even without holding power of attorney A spouse children parents or grandparents  its an inclusive list Mr Kurtz said  Heres the rub While organs for transplantation go through a national allocation system body donations usually must be arranged through specific schools and they have considerable latitude to set their own policies As with any gift the recipient has to agree Mr Kurtz said They tend to be a little picky For example as the WardArrigo family discovered some schools will not consider a nextofkin donation Dr Drake said  even though the act allows it You have to register yourself Many dont want to collect bodies from distances greater than  to  miles His program at the Cleveland Clinic also sets a size limit a body mass index of  A large obese body unfortunately is not the best educational material for students learning anatomy Dr Drake said Some schools are stricter Nor will schools or research facilities accept bodies of people with infectious diseases like hepatitis HIV MRSA or C difficile Most wont accept an autopsied body either A few states  Indiana Florida Maryland and Illinois among them  make things a bit simpler with state anatomical boards that distribute bodies to schools where they are needed But the best way to avoid make a grieving family scramble for a school willing to accept a donated body is for the donor to make arrangements ahead of time Its a fairly straightforward matter with minimal paperwork when she does Make sure your whole family knows about this Dr Drake said The family has to notify his school that the donor has died otherwise I might never know What happens to bodies after students or researchers are finished with them Theyre cremated and the ashes can be returned to families or buried in a cemetery sometimes on the school campus Most medical schools have some sort of memorial service to honor those individuals with family members often invited said Carol Aschenbrener chief medical education officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges The memorial circles back from the notion of the body to the notion of the person who made the decision to donate she said Its a way of saying thank you
