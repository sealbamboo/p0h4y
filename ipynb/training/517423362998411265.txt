Always remember to use protection is a fairly straightforward message for sexually active teens But young women have a lot of options when it comes to the types of protection they can choose to use This week the American Academy of Pediatricians   longacting reversible contraceptives such as IUDs and contraceptive implants as the best line of defense against teen pregnancies The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has backed longacting contraceptives for teens since  as have various womens health groups saying that these methods are safe and more effective than other forms of contraception The problem is most teens dont know much about IUDs and implants and doctors sometimes hesitate to prescribe these methods says   an epidemiologist at Washington University in St Louis Besides using condoms   of teens who use birth control use the pill But when practitioners told teen women about all their contraceptive options from most effective to least effective  percent chose longacting options according to a   by Secura and her colleagues published Wednesday in the   The researchers enrolled more than  teens in the study as part of the larger   designed to promote the use of longacting contraceptives All of the participants were given contraceptive counseling and provided whatever form of birth control they wanted for free Over a threeyear period the pregnancy rate among the girls enrolled was much lower than the national average   per  compared with the national rate of  per  sexually active teens And the rate of abortion among the teens in the study was a quarter of the national rate I think we thought we would see really low pregnancy and abortion rates but this is startling Secura says Moreover whereas teen pregnancy rates tend to be higher among minority women the pregnancy rates for white and black teenagers in this study were around the same That Secura says suggests that providing all teens with access to good health care and free or affordable contraceptives is the best way to reduce racial disparities in contraceptive use The big hurdle Secura says is getting more doctors to suggest IUDs and other longacting methods for teens Some doctors are hesitant because older versions like the Dalkon Shield IUD which was marketed in the s were found to raise the   And in some cases providers dont trust teens to know what they want Secura says We see things like providers saying Shes just going to change her mind and want the device removed  Secura says And its a real bummer Teens tend to understand whats best for them says   a pediatrician at the Childrens Hospital at DartmouthHitchcock in Lebanon NH who wasnt involved in the study She says she was a little surprised that so many teens opted for longacting contraceptives I think many teenagers know their limitations pretty well she says They know its hard to take a birth control pill every single day Shubkin says she supports the pediatricians new guidelines Now one of the biggest barriers to their use is getting the message out there she says Doctors as well as teens and their parents could use a bit more education about IUDs and other longacting options she says When a teenager makes the decision to have sex we want her and her partner to know about all the contraceptive options
