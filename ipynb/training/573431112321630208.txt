Who hasnt complained about the time it takes to work out For those days when time is about as precious as a Birkin handbag theres a class that cuts the time in half without cutting the sweat At a cozy little studio in Studio City I spent a halfhour pushing and pulling muscles on a Da Vinci BodyBoard a contraption that can be used in various ways to get the most out of your time The long board which sits just a bit off the floor has stretchy bands and ankle straps to boost the effort and provides a lowimpact cardiopumping workout that aims to provide an even workout for all the muscles Floery Mahoney created the board three years ago after she gave up her career making chocolates   Riverside Drive Studio City  The studio is tiny with mirrors all around and a smalltown feel Its about challenge balance and improvement Not perfection says studio coowner Lora Pavilack  Half an hour Each exercise  including jumping jacks and pushups  is done for just one minute sometimes with second breaks in between How hard can that be Hard it turns out  Supportive and encouraging Anythings possible for  seconds right Keep it going this is the end Blast out the cardio the teacher encouraged as the exercises grew in difficulty and the students decreased in oomph   for a single class but packages available Pilates and other classes are also available
