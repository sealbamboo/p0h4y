When a new strain of bird flu cropped up in China last winter the billiondollar question was whether the deadly virus could transmit between people Now Chinese scientists offer the first clear evidence that the bird flu is indeed contagious although only slightly A father who became sick in March passed the HN virus to his daughter   in   the   But the risk of transmission is still quite low they say And at this point the   virus still doesnt look like a threat to go global Since HN first appeared in February China has recorded  cases and Taiwan one  people have died from the virus Throughout the outbreak there have been signs that the virus might spread between people Most notably some people in the same families got sick One of these clusters was a father and daughter who both died of organ failure induced by HN The father  is thought to have caught the virus at a poultry market But the daughter  hadnt been exposed to birds or poultry before getting ill She did however take care of her father while he was sick and come in close contact with him So it looked like the woman caught the bug from her dad To demonstrate that conclusively scientists at the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention sequenced the genomes of the viruses taken from both patients The two genetic codes were almost identical the scientists report indicating that the bird flu did spread from father to daughter Does this imply that HN has come one step closer towards adapting fully to humans infectious disease specialists James Rudge and Richard Coker   linked to the study Probably not Crucially there is still no evidence of sustained transmission among humans The other  people who came in close contact with the father and daughter pair never caught HN Rudge and Coker point out even though one of them also helped to care for the father Furthermore the virus isolated from these patients doesnt look like it has an increased ability to infect people when compared with other strains Since early May the number of new HN cases has abruptly slowed China has   just one case of HN in June and July But the threat of HN isnt gone Rudge and Coker write Researchers expect the virus to return later this year when the weather is right for transmission
