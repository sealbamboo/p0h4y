hat makes an expert According to author Malcolm Gladwell its   It could be argued that clinical expertise takes a lot longer to hone Expertise comes at a considerable investment in time and energy but its application in healthcare is vital No one wants a surgeon who dabbles in heart surgery do they Its not just technical expertise thats needed in healthcare but also expertise in areas such as managing care or good communication in sensitive situations Expertise is vital but can too easily be lost by organisations that fail to manage talent Ive spent the last year with safety critical industries Despite the current economic climate they appear to make tremendous efforts to keep expertise on both their frontline and in leadership positions If you ask them why its for two simple reasons  safety and efficiency One petrochemical company will never allow its rookie engineers those with less than two years experience to account for more than  of its frontline staff This is for sound economic reasons  rookies make more mistakes and need more support from the frontline technical experts Its seen as a principal human factor in managing the high risks associated with safety critical industries such as aviation nuclear aeronautics and petrochemical Most industries make strenuous efforts to keep technically expert and experienced people at all levels of the organisation They see it as a good return on investment Contrast this to healthcare where a very different model prevails Instead of experience and expertise being seen as an asset it is implied that costly expert staff drain the resources of organisations and solutions need to be found Nowhere is the lack of talent management in terms of retaining clinical expertise more prevalent than nursing   is seen as a semiskilled activity  a series of tasks of varying degrees of technical skill Expert and experienced nurses are vigilant They detect early warning signs and deal with problems Unfortunately vigilance is not seen as an asset by decision makers Another attribute of the expert nurse is organisation and management of care  making sure everything happens when it needs to and patients see who they need to see This takes experience expertise confidence and good communication Research suggests that the key to safety is to be vigilant Another key aspect is anticipation and preparedness the ability to anticipate and be prepared for problems This is something expert nurses do constantly and yet it is rarely seen The Royal College of Nursings RCN   earlier this year identified a loss of almost  experienced nursing posts since  The RCNs head of policy Howard Catton said Not only is this a dangerous loss of experience and skills that are essential to ensuring patient safety and driving up standards but it will also have a significant impact on how we support and develop future generations of nurse specialists and leaders and could result in nurses leaving the profession early as they see the opportunities for career progression demolished Kim Pascoe has been a nurse for  years and is experienced in nursing older people There seems to be a myth that we should be able to provide a gold star service with no need for better resources or education The demographic has changed with frail older people with more complex needs Expertise and talent need to be retained and invested in if our aim is to have safe efficient and highquality healthcare now and for future generations The cost model drives healthcare workforce planning without recognising the benefits and yet the real cost of poor healthcare can be catastrophic As the famous   once said If you think its expensive to hire a professional to do the job wait until you hire an amateur
