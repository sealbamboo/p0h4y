Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didnt go through the approval process asked Dr Steven Nissen the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic whos testified to Congress about device safety problems Devices need to be regulated more vigorously This is really disturbing  In a statement Olympus said it didnt think needed the FDAs permission to sell the device but now at the request of the agency it has applied for that permission That application is still pending  Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE  also known as carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae  from October to January according to hospital officials Two of those patients died The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak  The medical center has contacted  others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria Four other patients at CedarsSinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope according to a statement released by the hospital The medical scope was used in all four patients between August and January  Sixtyfour other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail out of an abundance of caution According to FDA rules a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device The TJFQV duodenoscope used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system includes a modification to the exact part of the device thats been implicated in the superbug outbreaks  With this new model Olympus sealed up that part of the device known as the elevator channel hoping to make it more impervious to infection  The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer but it seems to be that it wasnt safer Riley said  Last year at the FDAs request Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope That application is still pending  Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving so the agency doesnt want to take them off the market   More than  of these procedures are done every year in the US and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very very low she said We believe the benefits outweigh the risks In its statement Olympus wrote The emergence of drugresistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with duodenoscope procedures   Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers Pentax and Fujifilm did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus TJFQV  Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned  and so far its not going well  Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of  of all microbes on the scope  the FDAs standard for disinfection  Were still working with them to get good data she said  Riley said she doesnt know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission  Diana Zuckerman a device safety expert said they should  Its like with kids How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave she said
