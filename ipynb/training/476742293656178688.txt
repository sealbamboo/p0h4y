The closely watched takeover struggle in which Valeant Pharmaceuticals is doggedly pursuing Allergan has become a proxy for the intensifying debate over the extent to which drug makers can continue to spend big bucks on research and development. And for good reason – Valeant has grown by slashing R&D spending, notably early-stage projects.. There is a larger question, though. What effect might deep cuts in early-stage R&D spending have on improving health? If others follow the Valeant model, the discovery and development game will be played by far fewer companies with the kind of significant resources needed to place big bets on experimental medicines.
