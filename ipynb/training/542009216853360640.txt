Studies have suggested that antibiotic use in pregnancy and childhood may increase the risk for asthma but a large Swedish study has found strong evidence that there is no such connection Researchers followed  children including  siblings from the start of their mothers pregnancies to school age More than  percent had been exposed to antibiotics in utero and  percent during childhood Over all  percent had asthma The study   initially found an apparent link between antibiotic use and later asthma but the association disappeared when researchers looked at siblings They found no difference in asthma development between siblings who had taken antibiotics and those who had not suggesting that other environmental or genetic factors are at work  Asthma they write may be misdiagnosed as a respiratory disease and then treated with antibiotics When asthma later appears the antibiotics are incorrectly identified as the cause Researchers also found no association between asthma and antibiotics given for urinary tract or skin infections  The study did not test other possible reasons for the development of asthma We havent looked into other factors said the lead author  Dr Anne K Ortqvist of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm But we think that previous results may have been biased by shared genetic and environmental factors within families
