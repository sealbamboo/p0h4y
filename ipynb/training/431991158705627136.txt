Former England captain Lewis Moody was given the nickname Mad Dog during his rugbyplaying days such was his fearless commitment to club and country Yet at the same time unbeknown to his teammates friends and coaches the England flanker was committed to fighting another very different foe  Moody was diagnosed with an inflammatory bowel disease called   in  but kept his condition secret while continuing to play toplevel rugby Now retired he wants to raise awareness of the   charity which helps around  people in the UK with this type of disease He admits that his battle against colitis has been extremely difficult In  I had a really bad flareup I lost kg lb of weight in about  days I was losing blood I felt awful and I just wanted to sleep the whole time I couldnt leave the house Getting out of the front door was a challenge in itself The disease was making life really difficult By that stage he had got used to rushing to the nearest toilet several times on the way to training and found himself regularly walking out of the tunnel at the start of a match only to run back down it again to find the facilities Moody even moved house to be closer to the training ground because of his feelings of urgency which are common to sufferers of both ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease Other symptoms can include diarrhoea pain anaemia fatigue and sometimes inflammation of the joints skin liver and eyes When he did eventually talk to players and coaches about his condition they already knew something was wrong and he felt relieved to be able to talk about it Using medication Moody had been able to keep his colitis under control but after years of taking painkillers and antiinflammatories for rugby injuries he felt like a walking medicine cabinet  and stopped taking everything He decided to strip his diet right back to alleviate his symptoms and then reintroduce different foods a week at a time to work out what his body could tolerate Eating oily fish and boiled chicken and carrots for an extended period wasnt pleasant he says but he did learn that cutting out red meat dairy spicy foods and caffeine meant he did not have to start taking medication again  he has reintroduced some dairy produce into his diet without any problems Im lucky I managed to find a way to control it but everyone has got their own way and their own regime he says Manchester United footballer Darren Fletcher who joined Moody to launch   in aid of the charity Crohns and Colitis UK  Everybody has a different form of inflammatory bowel disease says Sarah Rogers from Crohns and Colitis UK and that is why it is so awkward to treat If youre lucky you can manage it on a diet alone  by avoiding foods that cause a flareup But if unlucky you may need to take a form of antiinflammatory for the rest of your life or have an operation Even surgery is no guarantee of a cure Many people with the disease end up severely ill and housebound because they are petrified of having an accident It can also have a significant impact on their work and social life Around  people are affected by Crohns and colitis in the UK and there are up to  new cases a year It is particularly common in developed countries New research is focusing on what could trigger the disease in individuals and on the role of bacteria in the gut At present scientists think that both Crohns and colitis are caused by a combination of factors including the genes we are born with how our digestive systems react to bacteria in the intestine and a set of unknown triggers which could include viruses stress and diet Moody is proud that despite his debilitating illness he never missed a game and still wanted to train Ive dealt with lots of injuries before and needed a determined mindset to get through them With this it was the same I didnt want to let it beat me I didnt want to be defined by it It was just another hurdle to overcome he says Englands Mad Dog knows no other way
