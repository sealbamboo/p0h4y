Medicare the federal health insurance program for about  million senior and disabled Americans is simultaneously one of the most popular and imperiled programs in America Its participants  and their relatives  tend to   with the generous health benefits it provides But some  million baby boomers are now   for the program at a rate of an estimated  every day The   earlier this month in Denver had an entire segment devoted to the subject of health care And its almost certain to come up in tonights debate in New York But it wasnt the  health law that the candidates brought up first in the last debate It was Medicare Specifically each candidate went after what he saw as the weaknesses of the other candidates plan Heres what President Obama had to say Romney countered with a critique of what President Obamas health law would do to Medicare Independent fact checkers including     with exactly how the candidates described each others plans But the outlines are basically accurate President Obamas plan fundamentally relies on   Romney meanwhile would dramatically   Hed change it from one thats largely run by the federal government to one thats largely run by private insurers I know my own view is Id rather have a private plan he said in the debate Id just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get Id rather be able to have an insurance company If I dont like them I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company But the bottom line is that both candidates are walking a political tightrope On the one hand says Drew Altman president and CEO of the   its Medicare not the health law that could help turn the election Thats what the foundations   found The voting issue in this election if health care is a voting issue is much more Medicare than it is the Affordable Care Act Altman says And seniors are important  not only because they   than other voters but also because theyre a key voting bloc in swing states like Florida and Ohio But Altman says the same poll last month that found seniors are making Medicare a voting issue also found something else  that they pretty much like Medicare the way it is now The verdict is very clear especially with seniors he said Theyre anxious about changing the traditional program Now a prudent politician would say OK lets just not touch Medicare After all they dont call it one of   for nothing But thats no longer an option not with those  baby boomers turning  every day for the next two decades We as a society are not willing to put the resources in to let Medicare go along as its going along says Jonathan Gruber a health economist at MIT and an architect of both the health plan passed by   under thenGov Romney and the Affordable Care Act To keep Medicare solvent over the long run would require taking the current Medicare payroll tax which is about  percent and taking it up to  percent or more of payroll And were just not willing to do that That means that Medicare spending will have to be reined in somehow Gruber says he likes the way the    with a variety of approaches They include not only reducing some payments to health care providers but also experimenting with ways to provide financial incentives for higherquality care Its a balanced approach Gruber says Its basically saying Look theres lots of different things we need to do for Medicare to make it work better We dont really know which one is the ultimate longterm solution But we need to move forward  GOP candidate Romney meanwhile says he prefers the power of the marketplace This is an idea thats been around a long time he said at the debate about the concept known as   which is saying Hey lets see if we cant get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost better quality I believe in competition But clearly when it comes to Medicare both candidates also share the belief in using it   in an effort to scare seniors Thats something thats been true for several elections now and its shown no sign of changing this year either
