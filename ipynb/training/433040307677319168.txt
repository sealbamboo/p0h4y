Warning Owning a television may be hazardous to your health Ditto for owning a car though not quite as much And the less money you have the more dangerous the devices become according to a new study In the United States Canada and other wealthy countries increasingly sedentary lifestyles are blamed for contributing to the rise in obesity and Type  diabetes Instead of walking to school we take the car Instead of working on our feet we sit at our desks Instead of preparing our own meals we hit the drivethrough on our way home Researchers set out to see whether these patterns were repeated in countries where TVs cars and computers were not yet ubiquitous They analyzed data from the   or PURE which tracks  people in  countries that represent a range of economic conditions At one end of the spectrum are residents of Canada Sweden and the United Arab Emirates at the other are citizens of Bangladesh India Pakistan and Zimbabwe Researchers visited study participants in their homes in mobile clinics and in community centers Among other things they measured the volunteers height and weight allowing them to determine their body mass index They asked them about their diet and their physical activity They also asked whether they owned a television car and computer The researchers found that  of all households owned a television though that was more common in rich countries where more than  of homes had a TV than in poor ones where only  of rural households had one In addition about  of all households had a car and  had a computer again these were more common in rich countries Overall owning a TV was associated with a  greater risk of obesity and a  increased risk of diabetes on average In addition people who owned cars were  more likely to be obese on average Ownership of these devices was linked with spending more time sitting getting less physical activity consuming more calories and having a higher body mass index The poorer people were the stronger the link between owning a TV or a car and the risk of developing these health problems In the full sample of volunteers there was no statistical link between owning a car and the risk of diabetes or between owning a computer and the risk of either obesity or diabetes But when residents of lowincome countries were considered on their own owning any of the devices was a risk factor for obesity and diabetes the research team found Compared to owning none of the three modern devices owning one was linked with a  increased risk of obesity and a  increased risk of diabetes Owning two device raised the obesity risk to  and the diabetes risk to  Once again the acquisition of a device made the biggest difference to the poorest people the researchers discovered In lowincome countries the risk of obesity jumped from  for people who owned no devices to  for people who owned all three Similarly the risk of diabetes rose from  for those with no devices to  for those with all three Meanwhile in highincome countries the risk of obesity and diabetes was basically the same for everyone no matter how many devices they owned Though the statistical analysis showed a correlation between ownership of TVs and cars health risks tied to being sedentary the study doesnt prove that the devices caused obesity or diabetes Still it doesnt seem farfetched to believe that as more countries come closer to the US standard of living they will pay for it with US levels of these chronic conditions Exposure to household devices in the low income countries has only recently begun and therefore the negative effects of their ownership are more acute and may increase as ownership increases the research team concluded Their   was published online Monday in the Canadian Medical Assn Journal    and like   on Facebook
