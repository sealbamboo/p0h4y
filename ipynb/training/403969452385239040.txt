Sarah Moser a program director for a fundraising organization in San Francisco is planning to host her first Thanksgiving meal It will feature sweet potato latkes with cranberry applesauce from her mom Blair and a key lime pie with a matzoh crust Its a notsotraditional menu but it is fitting because this year cranberry sauce and menorahs are joining together for the rare convergence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah which   Next Thursday on the second night of Hanukkah Jews across the United States will be lighting menorahs after their feasts playing the dreidel game between forkfuls of pumpkin pie and exchanging gifts after the football game is over  I dont even like Thanksgiving that much but this year its just plain fun said Ms Moser Samantha Ettus who writes about parenting and working mothers from Los Angeles plans to celebrate the convergence of the holidays by making charitable gifts that day in her childrens name in lieu of tangible presents They will consist of donations to a childrens entrepreneurship organization for her yearold daughter an artsbased charity for her yearold daughter and a bookgiving charity for her yearold son  The jury is still out to see if my yearold will appreciate it she said  The last time the two holidays overlapped was in  when Jews lit one menorah candle on Thanksgiving night and it wont happen again until Nov   So whether it is a Jewish twist on a Thanksgiving standby or adding some fall flavors to your Hanukkah menu now is the time to create memories that can last the next  years Paula Shoyer author of The Holiday Kosher Baker is using the occasion as an excuse to get extra creative at her holiday table Its fun to experiment and see what works whats too silly and whats truly delicious she said  On Hanukkah is it customary to eat foods fried in oil to commemorate the historical event when the Jews won their land back in battle After their victory they wanted to rededicate their temple but only had enough oil to burn for one day However that small bit of oil miraculously lasted for eight days  For her table which she plans to decorate with a blue and orange color scheme to bring both the Hanukkah and Thanksgiving colors to the forefront Ms Shoyer is planning a traditional Thanksgiving meal complemented by both plain potato latkes and sweet potato latkes God gave me one day to eat fried foods so Im going to use it she said She also recommends apple latkes a light twist on the potato latke that can be served as a side dish or dessert and also plans to serve pumpkin donuts and maybe some pumpkin churros For those looking to avoid excess oil Ms Shoyer has also created a chocolate cranberry mandelbread  She is looking forward to using the converging holidays as an opportunity to have a thematic conversation with her family It will be nice to talk with my children about being Jewish Americans and the rewards and challenges of it she said Ms Moser will set her table with place settings for her  or so guests accompanied by packages of chocolate Hanukkah gelt And her cake will be accessorized with  Hanukkah candles Did Ms Moser forget to mention that Thanksgivukkah is also her birthday  If anyone wants to bring me gifts they are more than welcome she said
