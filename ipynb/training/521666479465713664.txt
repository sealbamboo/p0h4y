Even people who swear they dont abide beans find pleasure in the distinctive profound flavor of lentils Lentil broth is as comfortable with Mediterranean seasonings from every corner of the Mediterranean basin as it is with Indian or even Mexican spices  Lentils are at home in a salad a soup a stew a dal and a pilaf They work well with  meat particularly cured pork products and vegetables equally and they are also wonderful alongside a piece of salmon This is one legume you should always have in your larder I consider lentils a convenience food so quickly do they cook If you are using lentils for a salad and want them a little bit on the al dente side they can be done in  minutes though I usually let them go for  just to be sure that all of them cook through For stews and soups  to  minutes will suffice Lentils never need to be soaked and for those of you who are sensitive to beans you will be happy to hear that they dont contain sulfur the gascreating compound present in most beans This week I made a couple of lentil salads one of which I served cold and the other hot I made a lentil and quinoa pilaf filled with herbs that I had intended to use as a stuffing for grape leaves but ended up eating it on its own because it was so good I used up the last of my ripe summer tomatoes in a simple lentil and tomato stew and used the leftover stew to fill an amazing Greek phyllo pie an idea I came across when I was reading about all the things Greeks do with lentils in Diane Kochilass The Greek Vegetarian I used brown lentils for most of my recipe tests this week though the salads are also good  perhaps even better because the lentils tend to be firmer  with green or black lentils The flavors of all three are similar enough to make them interchangeable in most recipes but brown lentils are usually less expensive
