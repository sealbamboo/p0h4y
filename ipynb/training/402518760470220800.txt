The calculator released by the  and the  is a tool to evaluate a patients year risk of a heart attack According to the new guidelines if a persons risk is above  he or she should be put on a statin However in a hastily called telebriefing Monday morning members of the committee who developed the calculator and guidelines said that they knew about the risk of overestimation before rolling out the assessment tool and that they welcome more information to help refine it The tool they said is only one part of evaluating patients treatment options  something that can only be done with the help of a doctor No one should be mailed a prescription based on the results of the assessment tool said Dr Neil Stone committee chairman Theres got to be a physicianpatient discussion  Weve put the physician back into crucial decisionmaking However I cant speak to whether the calculator is valid or not Dr Robert Eckel cochair of the American Heart Association committee that wrote the new guidelines and the associations past president told CNN That needs to be determined We trusted that the calculator worked he said We trusted that the calculator is valid Concerns about the calculator were first raised according to the Times report by Harvard Medical School professors Paul Ridker and Nancy Cook  In an analysis to be published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet a copy of which was obtained by CNN Ridker and Cook write they calculated year risks using the tool and compared the data to event rates using three large previouslypublished studies in which participants characteristics such as age and smoking status were known The calculator systematically overestimated observed risks by  to  percent roughly doubling the actual observed risk they wrote  CNNs Elizabeth Cohen said when she used the calculator putting in a yearold man with normal cholesterol levels and no risk factors  normal blood pressure no diabetes and a nonsmoker  the calculator said he needed statins  Ridker and Cook had pointed out the issue a year earlier when drafts were sent to them for review as the guidelines were under development the Times said  Researchers apparently did not receive the professors responses Dr Donald LloydJones chairman of the committee that developed the equation told the Times But LloydJones told reporters Monday Theres nothing wrong with these equations Committee members were aware there could be overestimation of risk in some populations he said  On Saturday night members of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology held a meeting with Ridker Officials said Monday they await more information from the professor LloydJones said Monday he looks forward to getting details of Ridkers data But he said I suspect hes looking at extremely healthy cohorts Were looking at representative cohorts The truth he predicted is somewhere in the middle Our risk assessment guideline doesnt tell you what to do  It just evaluates risk he said  The analysis by Drs Ridker and Cook is very concerning said Dr Steven Nissen chief of cardiovascular medicine at the   Since the risk calculator was not previously published it now makes sense to halt implementation of the guidelines so that independent physician scientists can evaluate the accuracy of the risk calculator Nissen told CNN in an email We have waited many years for these guidelines It seems prudent to wait a little longer to make certain that the guidelines function as intended Attempts by CNN to contact Ridker and Cook on Monday were not immediately successful  The new treatment guidelines call for a focus on risk factors rather than just a patients cholesterol level  At the time Nissen called them an enormous shift in policy as it relates to who should be treated for high levels of cholesterol The four questions to ask to determine risk include Do you have heart disease Do you have Type  or Type  diabetes Do you have a bad cholesterol level of more than  And is your year risk of a heart attack greater than  According to the new guidelines if you can answer yes to any of those four questions you should be on a statin
