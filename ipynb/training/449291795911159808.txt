Oregon residents will have until the end of April to apply for health insurance because of ongoing technical problems with the state’s health insurance website, Cover Oregon.. The website, which opened for enrollment in October, hasn’t been fully functioning.  Although residents can apply online, the application must be processed manually by state workers. Still, more than 50,000 people have been enrolled in a private insurance plan in Oregon and almost 123,000 people have been enrolled in the state’s Medicaid system.
