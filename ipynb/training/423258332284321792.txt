At the center of a dispute over whether a Texas hospital can keep a braindead woman on life support is a weekold fetus Marlise Munoz was  weeks pregnant when her husband Erick discovered her lying unconscious on their kitchen floor in the middle of the night The yearold woman was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where doctors informed Erick that Marlise had lost all activity in her brain stem and was for all purposes brain dead according to a civil court petition filed Tuesday in Tarrant County That was on Nov  In the seven weeks since the hospital has kept  Munoz on life support  against the wishes of her family  in the hope that she may still deliver a healthy baby The hospital says it is compelled to do so by the Texas Advance Directives Act which says in part A person may not withdraw or withhold lifesustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient Erick Munoz Marlises parents and several medical and legal experts agree that the state law doesnt apply on the grounds that Marlise is not a patient because she is dead As the tragic case of yearold Oakland girl   brought to light brain death  defined as the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem  qualifies as a legal death Erick Munoz has filed suit to force the hospital to remove Marlise from the machines sustaining her body But if her body is kept going until her baby can be delivered what are the odds of success Thats impossible to know but there is   that offers some clues Researchers from Heidelberg University in Germany scoured the medical literature for cases of pregnant women who were kept on life support after being declared braindead They were able to find details on  such cases that were reported from  to  Twelve of those fetuses were delivered by caesarean section and survived for some period of time after birth One of the babies born prematurely after just  weeks of gestation died of an infection at the age of  days Six of the others were developing normally as of the time that case reports about them were written at ages ranging from  to  months though a few of them had suffered from infant respiratory distress syndrome The condition of the other five babies was unknown Another five of the fetuses died in utero and a sixth died at  weeks gestation after a miscarriage The last fetus was delivered by caesarean section at  weeks gestation but whether it survived birth was not known Among these  cases there is one fetus that was  weeks old when its mother was declared braindead  the same age as the fetus in the Munoz case That  case involved a woman who was killed in a traffic accident in Germany Its not clear how long the woman remained on life support but the fetus died in utero Two other cases involved a fetus that was  weeks old One of them in Ireland in  died in utero eight days after its mother suffered a blood clot in the brain The other whose mother was in an accident in Germany in  survived for  days before dying as a result of miscarriage There were also two cases involving fetuses that were  weeks old when their mothers died One of the fetuses died in utero  days after its mother suffered catastrophic bleeding in the brain in Italy in  The other remained in utero for  days  more than  weeks  after its mother suffered a traumatic brain injury in the US in  That baby boy was delivered by Csection at  weeks he weighed  pounds had Apgar scores of  and  scores lower than  indicate a newborn needs medical attention according to the National Institutes of Health and was developing normally  months after his birth The fetus in the Munoz case has been developing in utero with a braindead mother for  days so far Six of the cases described in the study involved a fetus that remained in utero with a braindead mother longer than that In five cases the babies were delivered by Csection one of them died after  days and the other four survived No information was available on the sixth All of these cases involved a fetus that was older the Munoz fetus at the time of its mothers injury The important question is from which gestational age onward should the pregnancy be supported the study authors wrote At present it seems that there is no clear lower limit to efforts to support the braindead mother and her fetus But the authors of the study cautioned that their data were incomplete and could not be used to determine the likelihood that a fetus could survive after its mother became braindead The percentage of successful cases cannot be determined because there are no reports describing failure of intensive maternal support from all medical centers they wrote The   was published in  in the journal BMC Medicine    and like   on Facebook
