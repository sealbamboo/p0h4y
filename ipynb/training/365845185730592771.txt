A few weeks back Sharon Roberts who had been diagnosed with endometrial cancer last year tweeted The yearold teacher in Houston was surprised when   a Twitter account created for customer assistance by the insurance company Aetna quickly responded Through Twitter and subsequent phone calls Aetna clarified that she didnt need to take the more expensive test and then figured out that she had been charged double by her hospital for other treatments If I hadnt put out that snarky tweet about the BRCA test back in July I would have probably just set up a payment plan to the hospital and paid out that bill she said The experience appears to bring new meaning to the companys catchy   featuring the tagline Aetna Im glad I met ya The aetnahelp Twitter feed is an example of how insurance companies are increasing their social media presence to deal with customers The accounts also help companies manage their brands and do quick damage control for complaints The accounts which include     and several accounts for various Blue Cross Blue Shield companies around the country are often separate from larger company accounts that focus on marketing and general health care news Social media gives us a tremendous opportunity to learn what the community needs said Carissa OBrien social media director at Aetna She works with six people to address the approximately  people who seek help through social media with claims or other services each month OBrien said the team tries to respond within an hour to users Last year Aetna made news when CEO Mark T Bertolini engaged in an extended Twitter conversation with colon cancer patient Arijit Guha who said his insurance didnt cover his treatment At the end of a publicized debate and Guhas campaign which he dubbed Poop Strong Bertolini directed Aetna to pay Guhas medical bills and   The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it Guha   OBrien said the social media team learned from the case and that it eventually reinforced their commitment to interacting with our customers and members on the channels where they already are Guhas case was out of the ordinary The daytoday fare doesnt earn personal responses from the CEO Questions come in about financial woes or health plan coverage And there are more than a few complaints In both cases the companies responded to these queries with resources or further contact information to resolve the issues Though companies are accustomed to fielding feedback and questions from their customers the public nature of a platform like Twitter or Facebook can also be a call for accountability said Ini Augustine head of   Social media acts as a public documentation of how you resolve the situation she said Its more than a marketing tool Augustine predicts that the implementation of the health law in the coming months will spur the companies to use their platforms further from organizing Twitter chats to engage customers to answering questions about Obamacare for a new demographic While insurance companies are hoping to connect with their customers through social networks they arent dropping call centers Teeing off on Twitter is often just a gateway for a phone call or private message since many personal questions cant be answered through a public forum Nevertheless OBrien said the company learns more about their customers through this medium allowing them to respond more efficiently whether it is through the phone or interview She said there is an added benefit of using the platform to educate and inform their community about health and wellness especially during a time of many changes in the health care system Even so OBrien said its just the beginning If were looking to focus a plusyearold company on social media thats massive cultural change she said
