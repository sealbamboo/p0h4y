Just off Tubman Boulevard  Monrovias busy main thoroughfare  stands a plywood hut with a large blackboard at the front in three panels On them  written in clear bold white chalk lettering  is a form of newsreel miniarticles and editorials as well as graphics and illustrations The creator of Daily Talk  this Liberian journal with a difference  is Alfred Sirleaf Hes  and has been writing the news since  three years before the civil war ended You know Daily Talk is like giving birth to a child and the child benefits the nation Sirleaf says Thats the idea of Daily Talk Its not about Alfred Sirleaf But its about you and its about me Its about all of us Sirleaf  updates the board maybe once or twice a week depending on whats happening in Liberia In the battered postwar country where many cannot afford televisions or newspapers and may not have access to radios he hopes that his newsboard keeps them informed Except during a heavy downpour when hell close the board until the rain subsides He often writes in Liberian English or simple English as its called here to ensure that all Liberians can understand and follow Daily Talk Its a fulltime job for Sirleaf He says he does not have any significant source of revenue or funding and uses his own money and some donations to keep the Daily Talk going When theres a particularly hot topic he chalks out two squares with scores So if the topic is the governments handling of the Ebola outbreak the score might be Ebola  Government  When the topic was elections  whether to hold them as scheduled on Dec  or postpone them  the score was zerozero reflecting the divided opinions of Liberians There are those who are saying that elections should not be held because of the Ebola crisis in Liberia he explains And there are those who are saying no despite the Ebola crisis we can still have elections and people can conglomerate and have political rallies and what have you We are playing the role of the referee he says We are are only waiting to publish the score Right now hes waiting on the Supreme Courts ruling about whether the elections should go on Sirleafs newsstand attracts all sorts of readers people in cars or passengers on motorbike taxis who can easily read the meticulous white lettering from afar But also students teachers professionals idlers and petty street traders selling everything from smoked fish to garish plastic bangles for children They all hover around the hut Victoria Kimba is racing off to work but wants to get up to date with the news as she sets out Once in a while when Im passing like today she says I glance at the board Some might call Sirleaf a news junkiecumevangelist He says hes just passionate about the information hes sharing with Liberians in the hope theyll be better placed to play their part in a fragile burgeoning democracy after the yearcivil war shattered and divided the nation And now  Ebola Despite the difficulties he says that keeping Monrovia informed keeps him on his toes Oh I have fun doing it Sometimes when I put up the stories I see the argument from both sides This is my work I love it I have the passion for it to inform the public Sirleafs Daily Talk carries considerable influence Back in the war years his critical writings so enraged former rebel leaderturnedPresident Charles Taylor that Sirleaf was detained and jailed The Daily Talk news hut was ripped down Some of the reasons that I got from them was that I was coming down too hard on Taylor you know says Sirleaf But I believe I was just doing my work giving the public exactly just what they need to see and to hear After a brief stint in exile Sirleaf returned to Liberia But he says he wont be cowed  by politicians or critics  and will continue writing the news He hopes to someday set up Daily Talk blackboards throughout the country
