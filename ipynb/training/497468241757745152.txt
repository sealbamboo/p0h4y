Diabetes can affect how your body uses blood glucose commonly called blood sugar Glucose is the brains main source of fuel and provides critical energy for the cells If you have diabetes it means that eating too many carbohydrates can spike blood sugar leading to health issues But what if there was a natural product that effectively reduced blood sugar and calories and could be added to the food supply Thats the premise behind Emulin a patented formulation of compounds found in fruits like grapefruit and berries Emulin a tasteless additive blocks the absorption of sugar by more than  percent the manufacturer claims By having it in the food supply we will see a rapid reduction in obesity and diabetes rates said Joseph Ahrens chief executive officer and director of scientific affairs for ATM Metabolics which created the product Emulin is added to sugar called Sugir by some manufacturers the company is working to add it to beverages breads and cereals A product with Emulin called GCX is available at GNC Each count bottle for  represents a day supply Though small independent studies have been conducted there is no published research on the efficacy or safety of Emulin The largest trial which included  people and was financed by ATM Metabolics has been submitted for publication in the International Journal of Medicinal Foods Ahrens said The weeklong study found that those receiving both Emulin and the drug metformin had lower fasting blood sugar levels than those who received no medication or metformin alone Emulin consisting of three compounds myricetin quercetin and cholorgenic acid may work by shutting down one metabolic pathway and stimulating absorption by the muscle tissue Ahrens said Its not a sugarreplacer like Splenda Instead its a carbohydrate manager so it prevents absorption of sugar to the small intestine and diverts the sugar that is in the blood to the muscles instead of the fat tissue Ahrens said Susan Percival a professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Florida said that diversion doesnt cause any problems as sugar is the preferred source of energy for the muscle Nature intended for these compounds to be in our foods Ahrens said Weve inadvertently removed it by eating refined products Still theres a red flag A lack of any published peerreviewed research Its pretty important to do these studies in humans under normal eating circumstances said Percival who called Emulin a very interesting albeit secretive product Experts also say that its a bad idea to eat sugary foods in general even if the body is absorbing less sugar Highsugar foods generally dont provide much nutrition vitamins minerals protein or fiber said Susan Weiner a New York Citybased registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator Selecting vegetables whole grains and fruits as carb choices will allow people with diabetes to better manage their blood sugar levels she said Spreading carbs throughout the day eating adequate lean protein healthy fats fiber and monitoring blood sugar levels will help control diabetes  and obesity  more than consuming a diabetesfriendly sugar product with unknown longterm side effects Weiner said It will never be a substitute for a nutritious diet and a lot of physical activity in the management of diabetes
