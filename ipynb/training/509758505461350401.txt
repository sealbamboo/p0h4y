We are seeing a double to quadruple increase in the number of children with respiratory infections says Dr Andi Shane hospital epidemiologist at Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta More than  states around the Midwest and Southeast have reported seeing similarly high numbers of hospitalizations for children with severe respiratory illnesses The virus has sent more than  children a day to a Kansas City Missouri hospital where about  of the youngsters were placed in intensive care health officials said Doctors say they think the increase is due to a bug called   an uncommon type of enterovirus that seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma But nailing down the culprit and tracking the number of cases is easier said than done  Childrens Healthcare like most hospitals around the nation tests samples from children with respiratory illnesses to determine if they have a viral infection But the tests dont distinguish between the rhinovirus which is the most common cause of the common cold and enteroviruses which can cause a variety of symptoms  Once hospitals noticed this upward trend in severe respiratory illness cases they requested help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in identifying the specific virus at fault Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta is working with the Georgia Department of Public Health to submit specimens to the CDC which is already testing samples from states like Alabama Utah and Michigan  Six states  Colorado Kansas Kentucky Illinois Missouri and Iowa  have confirmed cases of EVD Yet even in those states not all samples came back positive for this specific type of enterovirus  Nineteen of the  samples sent from Childrens Hospital Colorado were EVD said Dr Christine Nyquist medical director of infection control Kentucky submitted  samples five came back positive In Missouri  of  specimens sent to the CDC were confirmed to be EVD The problem is that there are more than  enteroviruses that are known to infect humans   these viruses cause an estimated  million to  million illnesses each year Symptoms can range from the sniffles to stomach issues to a severe respiratory infection  The average healthy adult gets two to three colds a year the CDC says children usually get more Theyre more at risk because their immune systems havent had a chance to build up immunity to these common viral infections The CDC doesnt require state health departments to track these types of infections since they are usually dealt with at home and patients recover with a little TLC So getting a firm count of the number of people infected  or what other states may be at risk  for EVD is difficult  CDC is watching this situation closely the public health agencys   states
