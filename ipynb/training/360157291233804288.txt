Many businesses that dont offer health insurance to all their employees breathed a sigh of relief earlier this month when they learned theyd have an extra year to comply with the new health care law or face stiff penalties President Obama   for businesses with  or more employees after complaints that the plan was too complicated to implement by the original deadline January  Now the restaurant industry which employs a lot of parttime employees is weighing strategies for how to respond At a California Tortilla restaurant in downtown Washington DC managers say theyre still figuring out what strategy to use to comply with the new laws mandate to provide health insurance for all workers who put in at least  hours a week whether they should trim hours hire more parttimers or leave things unchanged But management at another fastfood chain has made a decision White Castle decided it will not fire fulltime employees or cut benefits as a result of the new health care law says Vice President Jamie Richardson These fulltime employees who make up roughly half of White Castles member workforce are already covered by the companys health care plan If youre fulltime at White Castle youre going to stay fulltime at White Castle Richardson says But as White Castle looks into the future after the new law takes effect Richardson says the company is considering hiring only parttime workers The reason is simply cost he says If we were to keep our health insurance program exactly like it is with no changes every forecast weve looked at has indicated our costs will go up  percent he says The profit per employee in restaurants is only  per year says Richardson much lower than in most other industries So he says adding health insurance as a benefit for all employees over  hours as the health care law requires isnt feasible But for another restaurant owner the calculation is very different Jeff Benjamin has four restaurants in the Philadelphia area and is planning three more This past spring he invited a dozen restaurateurs from other cities to meet in Chicago to brainstorm strategies to respond to Obamacares employer mandate Adding more parttime workers less than  hours a week was one idea but Benjamin says it didnt get traction I really only think one or two of the folks in the room suggested it he says All of them kind of agreed that there are too many fixed costs to having an employee to make it worthwhile to go the parttime route Having two parttimers instead of one fulltime employee doubles the cost of things like training scheduling and uniforms Benjamin says Im a big fan of the idea that fulltime employees give you fulltime work he says And sometimes as you lower peoples hours they may not be as committed So I love to be able to give someone a fulltime job But Benjamin acknowledges that his staffing needs and profit margins are different from a fastfood chain like White Castle and thats why they have different calculations about hiring parttimers A number of big fastfood chains have said theyll use the strategy of increasing parttime workers although one Darden Restaurants which owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster has reversed course Part of the reason was a public backlash to the decision that hurt their business  from the US Chamber of Commerce found that half of the small businesses responding said they will reduce hours or add more parttimers in response to the law But there are no hard data so far showing the industry moving to more parttime employees says Scott DeFife a spokesman for the National Restaurant Association Theres no big strategic parttime shift he says In fact data shows that in the past year average hours per employee is going up The National Restaurant Association hopes that Congress will use the oneyear delay to make the law less burdensome to employers DeFife says But that would mean theyd provide fewer of their workers with health insurance
