Does endurance cycling help you live longer Take one look at cycling legend Brian Robinson and you may have your answer    Brian aged  is a bona fide British cycling legend the first Briton to finish the Tour de France in  and the first to win a Tour stage in  He still lives in the village of Mirfield in West Yorkshire where he was brought up and still cycles twice a week I do have a healthy lifestyle he says I can recommend cycling They say it gives you an extra  years of life  another decade would do me fine  You can get a sense of just how good Robinson was from his victory in the   of the  Tour de France from Annecy to ChalonsurSaone    He finished the mile km etape a full  minutes ahead of the next rider  one of the biggest winning margins in the history of the Tour There is some glorious blackandwhite footage of the race highlights showing Brian raising his arms aloft as he crossed the line   There was plenty of time for him to pose for photos kiss the local beauty queen and perhaps have a spot of lunch before the rest of the riders showed up Brian has passed on his passion for cycling to his yearold grandson   Jake Womersley already has a sponsorship deal and hopes eventually to ride the Tour At the moment I do it simply for the love of racing says Jake but looking at Granddad I know it will keep me fit and healthy in years to come Both men are understandably delighted by the prospect of the Tour de France coming to Yorkshire The promotional body Welcome to Yorkshire beat off competition from Scotland Florence and Amsterdam to secure the first two stages of the  Tour  will be in Leeds on  July taking a mile route to Harrogate    The second stage is  miles from York to Sheffield and will feature many of the hills that Brian Robinson trained on over the decades    The third stage is a mile sprint from Cambridge to London   When the riders reach the Champs Elysees on  July they will have ridden  miles in  days of cycling  making the Tour the most gruelling of all major sporting challenges The elite riders are among the fittest individuals on the planet  But for every Chris Froome Sir Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish there are thousands of amateur cyclists who dream of emulating their heroes Many of these are what have become known as Mamils  middleaged men in Lycra riding bikes Brian Robinson could only have dreamed off when he was a professional I confess to being one of them although I have so far resisted the lure of a fullcarbon dream machine  Last year I did the mile   in Wales taking in stunning scenery and quite a few decent hills This year my target is the   a stunning route on closed roads  around the Surrey hills and finishing on the Mall in central London After cycling with Brian and his grandson my camera team filmed me making a rather slow ascent of Cragg Vale one of the many hills that the Tour riders will tackle this year   Its not especially steep but at more than five miles long is reputed to be the longest continuous gradient in England   Those who are not road cyclists may often wonder why amateurs put themselves through the agony of climbing hills   Im not sure I can answer that except to say that when you get to the top it feels like a kind of victory   So what is the evidence for cycling and more specifically intense endurance cycling and health   The problem with most of the research is that they are observational studies which can be confounded by other factors and so can show only an association between endurance cycling and longevity  compared  cyclists who rode the Tour de France from the ss and found that they lived on average eight years longer than the general population     examined all  French competitors in the Tour from  and found they lived on average six years longer  Dr Xavier Jouven of the European Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris who led the analysis said We should encourage people to exert themselves If there was a real danger in doing highlevel exercise then we should have observed it in this study That study did find that the Tour riders were at higher risk of fatal traumatic injuries no doubt as a result of cycling accidents   Also many of the noncycling people used for comparison in both studies will have had underlying health problems so that may have skewed the findings  Some   tried to get round this problem by comparing cyclists For  years they tracked the health of  men and women who cycled every day in Copenhagen  They found that those who did intense cycling  enough to be out of breath  lived longer than those who simply pootled along at a pace where they could have a conversation    For men the extra life expectancy was five years and for women four years       While none of this is conclusive it adds to the growing body of evidence that highintensity exercise may yield significant longterm health benefits  This comes with the caveat that unfit untrained individuals or those with underlying health problems should proceed with caution One of the best measurements of cardiovascular health is the    This shows the maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume during exercise so it involves being tested to the point of failure As we age heart muscle tends to stiffen and so VO max will decline The School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Kent compared trained cyclists with untrained but physically active individuals  the older trained cyclists were able to preserve much of their VO max and so delay the decline in their cardiovascular health So while noone can prevent the process of ageing they can hold back the years James Hopker the lead author said several hospitals were using a VO max test called a CPET test to assess patients risk level for major surgery He said The better a patients VO max the more likely they are to survive major surgery and the quicker they recover Perhaps foolishly I was filmed having my VO max tested as part of my report on cycling and health   My score was  mlkgmin  pretty good for my age   But the tests also showed that I have a powertoweight ratio of just  Wkgmin which apparently is not very good at all     It may explain why I climb slowly up the hills
