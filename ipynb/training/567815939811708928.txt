Pacemakers have long been a lifesaving device for people whose hearts dont keep the right beat  but they can sometimes come with complications Now a team of researchers at the CedarsSinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles have managed to transform regular heart cells in pigs into pacemaker cells  cells that naturally keep the hearts rhythm in step The experiments described in the journal Science Translational Medicine mark the first study of this gene therapy in a large animal  one on par with human scale The research could help lead to therapies for people who have to have their electronic pacemakers temporarily removed because of infection  and could one day remove the need for surgically implanted pacemaker devices altogether The heart beats to the sound of its own drum It relies on a smaller number of specialized pacemaker cells in a tiny region of the heart called the sinoatrial node  they are the metronome for the heart But sometimes the heart cant hear its own timekeeper It beats too slowly or irregularly  and this can lead to dangerous consequences from fatigue to circulatory collapse The researchers found a way around this problem Create new pacemaker cells in a different part of the heart The therapy centers around a gene called TBX which is known as a transcription factor  a type of gene that creates a protein that turns other genes on and off The researchers knew that the TBX gene was temporarily turned on in the area of the sinoatrial node as an embryo develops and then it shuts off That gave us a clue that maybe TBX is important in shaping the biological the endogenous pacemaker to begin with said team leader Dr Eduardo Marbn director of the CedarsSinai Heart Institute The researchers loaded the gene into a virus and injected it into normal heart cells in pigs that suffered from complete heart block which is when scarring keeps the electrical signals from the pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node from getting through to the rest of the heart They injected them into a different area of the heart outside the sinoatrial node In a matter of days the injected pigs hearts were beating faster without the help of a pacemaker  and without any obvious adverse side effects Nothing fancy needs to be done to see if the treatment is working said study coauthor Dr Eugenio Cingolani And though the study only lasted  days it could point the way to longerlasting  even permanent  biological pacemakers If all goes well clinical trials on humans could start in three years One day he said patients could potentially be cured of the slow heart rate forever In the meantime there are a number of more specialized applications for such a gene therapy For some fetuses with congenital heart block  many of whom develop severe heart problems that end in stillbirth  a biological pacemaker could be a lifesaver since an electronic one cant be surgically implanted in the womb Roughly  patients in the US get a pacemaker every year and about  of them develop infections Marbn said A significant portion of those people need to have their implants taken out and fixed or changed while the body heals which could take several The biological pacemaker could be one way to keep their hearts beating properly in the meantime The lack of clinically adverse effects in the study is encouraging Eric Olson and Dr Nikhil Munshi researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who were not involved in the paper wrote in a commentary in the journal Science But they added that after a twoweek study little is known about the longterm consequences pointing out that the virus also ended up causing lowlow level infections in the lung and spleen Still they wrote the findings represent a critical step toward potentially filling an important clinical niche and provide an encouraging indication that a biological pacemaker might eventually be ready for human translation
