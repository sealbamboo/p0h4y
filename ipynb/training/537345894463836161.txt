In these early days of the holiday season as cooks begin sifting through recipes rich in spice and sugar consider this small warning from toxicologists Measure your nutmeg carefully  Very carefully Of all the wellloved seasonal spices nutmeg stands out for its long and slightly twisted history In the Middle Ages it was used to end unwanted pregnancies More recently desperate prisoners embraced it as a rather miserable drug substitute So on occasion have teenagers some of whom   A couple of years ago a man in Sweden claimed that nutmeg     Its not that nutmeg cases are that common said Leon Gussow an Illinois toxicologist who publishes a blog for professionals called   But toxicologists do recognize it as one of the more interesting spices in the kitchen  As Dr Gussow noted recently in Emergency Medicine News awareness of the spices poisonous and exotic side effects   Nutmeg is the seed of an evergreen tree   native to Indonesia although now cultivated widely The spice mace comes from a thin protective layer that encloses that seed  The spice trade first brought nutmeg to Europe in the th century where it rapidly   as a seed of unusual potency strong enough to fight infection including the Black Plague stimulating enough to bring on menstruation poisonous enough to induce an abortion It also earned shady credentials for inducing a kind of hazy druglike high that could include hallucinations The effect was potent enough that nutmeg mythology eventually became part of prison culture even into modern times In the  book The Autobiography of Malcolm X the activist describes purchasing it from inmates in prison concealed in matchboxes and stirring it into water A penny matchbox full of nutmeg had the kick of three or four reefers he wrote  Toxicologists say that description is somewhat misleading an overly romantic account of nutmegs generally unpleasant effects It takes a fair amount of nutmeg  two tablespoons or more  before people start exhibiting symptoms These can include an outofbody sensation but the most common are intense nausea dizziness extreme dry mouth and a lingering slowdown of normal brain function Dr Gussow said nutmeg experimenters   People have told me that it feels like you are encased in mud said Dr Edward Boyer professor of emergency medicine and chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Youre not exactly comatose but you feel really sluggish  And your remembrance of events during this time period is incomplete at best The main chemical culprit in nutmeg is called   which forms naturally in the seeds and in other plants occurring in trace amounts in carrots Myristicin belongs to a family of compounds with psychoactive potential that occasionally are used to make much stronger psychotropic drugs It has been   And it is chemically related to another compound safrole also found in nutmeg which is sometimes used in the synthesis of the street drug Ecstasy  Of course this doesnt mean that the natural compound acts like these synthetic drugs But  a junior chemist might think that you are going to end up with a similar effect Dr Boyer said And he suspects that is one reason many of the poisoning cases seen in the United States involve teenage home experiments  Still nutmeg incidents are rare  at least those reported to the authorities We do see a few pediatric cases where parents left an open spice jar where a child could reach it said Dr Patrick Lank an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University  Dr Lank was a coauthor of a recent paper tracking  years of nutmeg poisoning as reported to Illinois poison control centers  The authors    were accidental and  were deliberate Of the deliberate cases most involved young people between the ages of  and  who were mixing nutmeg with pharmaceuticals Of that group one had such a bad reaction that he ended up on a ventilator Adolescents can have really bad effects when they mix nutmeg with other things Dr Lank warned  A study in California   reached a similar conclusion although the authors found a higher level of deliberate abuse  In that case  percent of the poisoning cases involved intentional use Abusers were significantly more likely to require medical evaluation than nonabusers the authors noted But as with the Illinois study they reported no fatalities  Dr Boyer said he has seen just two cases of nutmeg poisoning that required hospitalization in  years and both of those were teenagers looking for a high They recovered more slowly than we expected and then the nutmeg story crept out he said   The rarity of the cases means that even though nutmeg information is available online there is enough information about the negative effects that most people appear to avoid it anyway  Its clear that the stories on the Internet have not led to large numbers of nutmeg abusers turning up in emergency rooms Dr Boyer noted The usual holiday samplings of nutmeg  the dusting on eggnog or a cocktail the quarterteaspoon sprinkle that goes into a pie or cake  is not a risk to revelers In those doses the woodsy sweet flavor should simply be enjoyed
