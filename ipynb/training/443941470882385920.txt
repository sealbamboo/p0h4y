A childrens heart surgery unit that was temporarily closed last March owing to fears over a high number of patient deaths is safe a review has found Surgery was suspended for two weeks at Leeds General Infirmarys paediatric heart unit after data suggested a higher death rate than average A yearlong NHS England review has concluded the unit does not have an excessive mortality But it also found that some families of very sick children received poor care Operations at the hospitals unit were suspended on  March  after NHS England raised concerns about data on mortality rates at the centre The suspension came just a day after a decision to stop childrens heart surgery at the hospital  as part of an Englandwide reorganisation of services  was quashed in the High Court Operations were allowed to resume at the unit on  April last year after an investigation revealed the mortality data was flawed A twopronged review was launched by NHS England one part examining the units mortality rates and the other looking at the experience of  families who felt they had been let down by the unit That review has found mortality rates focusing on the  children who died after surgery between  and  show the unit does not have an excessive mortality Mike Bewick NHS Englands deputy medical director told Radio s Today programme that although services at Leeds were found to be safe he was devastated by some of the findings of the review He apologised to the families of sick children who were found to have received poor care and insisted healthcare was moving towards a much more compassionate type of medicine Politicians needed to work more closely with the medical profession to align whats best practice he said Sir Roger Boyle the previous head of the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Nicor resigned as Englands socalled heart tsar when Nicor flagged concerns about Leeds last year He later said he would not send his own child there He told the Today programme the behaviour of politicians who had campaigned to save the unit had been downright disgraceful and that children should be cared for in an atmosphere that was caring and compassionate He said there had been an overwhelming consensus in about  that the NHS needed fewer larger child surgical centres that could provide a comprehensive and safe service Michelle Elliot whose daughter Jessica was left with brain damage after her treatment at Leeds said changes still needed to be made There are numerous recommendations for the trust to work on as part of that report Ms Elliot said  So its very unfair I feel to say it has a clean bill of health because it doesnt Her daughter had a stroke as she awaited a heart transplant and remains in a wheelchair Were the lucky ones Shes still with us Ms Elliot said There are many families in the group whose children and babies have died She added there had been a lack of kindness a lack of action a lack of belief in the parents One parent who has not been named told investigators they were given no support by staff after their daughter had died We were given a leaflet they said Nobody asked how we were getting home in the early hours of the morning Another parent described how a book had gone missing in which their son had been writing about his experiences before his death A fourth a mother described how she felt pressurised into having an abortion which was against her beliefs as a Muslim Julian Hartley chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said he was so sorry for those families and offered them a heartfelt apology He said Although we treat  children a year and do  operations one poor experience is one too many A number of actions had already been taken to improve service at the unit Mr Hartley said These included the appointment of three permanent consultant surgeons a full review of how complaints are handled and the opening of a new m childrens intensive care unit We commit to making sure we derive every ounce of learning from their experience said Mr Hartley Sharon Cheng of the Leeds Childrens Heart Surgery Fund a charity giving support for children and adults born with congenital heart defects and their families said she was surprised to read the critical comments The trust has learned from this I know things have been put in place since to address these issues and my sympathy goes out to those families The whole country has to learn from this But Fragile Hearts a group representing parents who have lost children or seen them suffer medical harm as a result of heart surgery said the report was evidence the culture which exists at LGI heart unit takes no account of the emotional psychological or spiritual needs of children or parents In a statement Fragile Hearts said its members did not believe the changes introduced at the unit went far enough We believe that the changes required are not only in the skill and care provided but in the attitude of those care providers  We therefore call for systemic changes within the unit but above all we hope that nobody else ever has to walk in our shoes The Childrens Heart Foundation said other concerns which it had raised with the Care Quality Commission in  had been totally missed from the report Chief executive Anne KeatleyClarke said These include the quality of heart surgery and repeat operations along with the morbidities of children who had received treatment at Leeds General Infirmary
