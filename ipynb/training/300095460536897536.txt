 Many teenagers want a toned physique and some use unhealthy tactics to get one new research finds A survey of about  Minnesota teens found that nearly all boys were doing something to   Most often that meant exercise But  percent said theyd used steroids in the past year while almost  percent used some other muscleenhancing substance such as creatine or DHEA Girls were also keen on getting toned researchers report in the December issue of   published online Nov  Almost twothirds said they exercised specifically to gain muscle at least sometimes Nearly  percent reported using steroids while a similar number said they took other muscle enhancers The findings are concerning said lead researcher Marla Eisenberg an associate professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis Steroid use is obviously risky side effects range from acne and unwanted body hair to heart attacks and liver disease But Eisenberg said even exercise or diet changes can be negative if kids do it just to adhere to a certain body ideal We specifically asked whether they were doing those things to increase muscle mass or tone Eisenberg said If a kid is often exercising for that reason it might point to bodyimage concerns A researcher not involved in the study agreed Its important to remember that the kids in this study are not saying they exercise for fun or to be healthy said Linda Smolak a professor emerita of psychology at Kenyon College in Gambier Ohio who focuses on child development and eating disorders Some teens may want to build muscle to get a certain look Others may do it for a sport Smolak pointed out In this study students playing team sports were more likely to be trying to add muscle   for example were twice as likely as other boys to use protein shakes or powders And whats wrong with protein shakes Not necessarily anything study author Eisenberg said But it could be an unhealthy behavior if theyre using protein shakes to replace real food Eisenberg said Kids who down protein supplements may be overly focused on gaining a certain body type The findings are based on surveys of  middle and highschool students in the Minneapolis area They were a diverse group  percent were black  percent Asian and  percent Hispanic Among boys more than  percent said they exercised specifically to boost muscle mass including  percent who said theyd often done so in the past year Fortyfive percent said theyd altered their diets with the goal of bulking up at least sometimes while  percent used protein supplements sometimes or often Of the girls about  percent had changed their diets and  percent had worked out to boost muscle sometimes or often in the past year About  percent had used protein supplements sometimes or often Those figures are slightly higher than some other recent studies have found the researchers say And since the students came from one urban area its not clear whether the numbers would reflect all US kids Nor is it known why so many kids want more muscle The researchers did not ask about that Eisenberg said But in general she noted its hard not to notice that sports figures and celebrities are bigger or more toned than they used to be  and that we are surrounded by images of them Whats not clear is whether todays kids are any more muscle conscious than past generations were Studies have only looked at that question in the past decade or so Similarly its only in recent years that studies have looked at boys bodyimage issues at all Smolak at Kenyon College pointed out But she said some studies have suggested that when you look at all forms of    not just the quest for thinness but for a toned athletic form too  boys are just as affected as girls Parents should be concerned Eisenberg said if they see signs that their child is overly interested in physique Those signs include constantly checking the mirror suddenly shifting to a highprotein diet or excessively working out Smolak also warned against placing too much importance on your kids sports achievement since they may think they need a certain body type to excel We all have different bodies she said It is not a great idea to try to fit into a stereotype or a socially prescribed ideal even for a sport
