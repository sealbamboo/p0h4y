Having a stroke increases the risk of another and recurrent strokes have a higher death and disability rate because parts of the brain injured by the first stroke may not be as resilient according to the    On January  just after Id finished dinner at home with my family my second stroke hit  I thought I knew a lot about stroke but I had no idea that my sudden loss of vision meant I was going down that road again   One of the tricky things about stroke is that no two strokes are alike said Jim Baranski chief executive officer of the National Stroke Association Each one is uniquely different Therefore the signs and symptoms can be different One of the things that all of them have in common is the suddenness  One minute I was standing up and the next I was buckling telling my husband Toby that I couldnt see Yet I foolishly thought this would pass and told Toby that I just needed to lie down   I asked Toby to call my father who had guided me through a   that temporarily paralyzed me more than  years earlier Only about  of strokes are hemorrhagic strokes  Of course my dad agreed that I needed to go to the ER My husband drove me and our terrified yearold daughter to the closest hospital St Jude Medical Center in Fullerton California which happens to be a designated stroke receiving center   Im embarrassed to admit that none of us thought about calling  And that was a mistake Weve spoken to many stroke survivors who had some of the classic signs and symptoms of stroke but didnt recognize that they were symptoms and unfortunately didnt get to the hospital in time to receive proper stroke treatment Baranski said  Classic signs and symptoms include facial drooping arm weakness and impaired speech This is a  matter Its not something where you can take an aspirin lie down and hope it goes away according to Baranski Within minutes of arriving at the hospital I was on a bed with nurses bustling around me starting IVs and covering me with a warm blanket I heard someone mention stroke  Given my history doctors didnt know whether this stroke was connected to the first one a bleed caused by an   an abnormal tangle of arteries and blood vessels in my brain Im  now but I was born with that malformation and that tangle is still there  But it soon became clear that this was an   a stroke caused by a blood clot Most people who have strokes have strokes caused by clots  Because Id already had a hemorrhagic stroke it was too risky to give me   that if given within three hours of stroke symptoms can help limit damage Thats why youll hear that time is crucial when it comes to stroke Youll also hear that when it comes to stroke you need to   And because of that pesky first stroke my doctors decided against prescribing blood thinners a standard treatment for strokes caused by clots Just recently however my neurologist said it would be OK for me to take a baby aspirin every day  Aspirin or any blood thinner is not going to cause the AVM to rupture said one of my doctors Dr Amit Balgude comedical director of neurointerventional radiology at St Jude Medical Center  But he added if I did have another bleed it would be much harder to control if I were taking those medications You are very unusual in that you have an AVM and then you suffered an ischemic stroke  So unusual in fact that my neurosurgeon is recommending second third and possibility fourth opinions before we decide whether to pursue  on the arteriovenous malformation or do nothing both of which have risks  I may be unusual but Im also lucky The second stroke affected only my vision Within two days I had it back Im still plagued by extreme fatigue but Im in no position to complain  I still dont know why this happened and I suspect that I never will I dont have any obvious risk factors But after undergoing an unpleasant test in which a scope was guided down my throat and into my esophagus to check out my heart doctors found a tiny hole in my heart a    Its not certain that the hole caused my stroke but the condition is associated with an increased risk of stroke Balgude said In some ways my second stroke has been liberating Ive carried the fear of it with me for  years I can let that go now Its happened and it wasnt nearly as bad as my first I just dont want a third  Baranski thinks its important that people speak out about stroke  Theres a stigma attached to strokes that prevents people from talking about it he said What I would say to survivors what I want them to know is to never give up hope Just because you have a disability resulting from the stroke doesnt mean it is necessarily permanent Also I think stroke prevention starts with your primary care physician Balgude said Risk factors include high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes smoking and physical inactivity Those are some of the risk factors you can control  Not long after I was released from the hospital I ordered a bracelet with two simple words on it Be brave When my daughter asked about it I told her that the bracelet was a reminder to have courage I explained that the dark red cord was chosen to represent stroke awareness  She later told me shed asked a friend to make her a red bracelet for stroke awareness She never takes it off even when she showers  Gestures like that remind me just how fortunate I am
