In many communities the local school district is the largest food provider filling thousands of hungry bellies every day But trying to feed healthful food to some of the pickiest eaters can result in mountains of wasted food Now many schools are finding that giving kids a say in what they eat can cut down on what ends up in the trash Its a lesson you can see in action in the lunchroom of Harris Bilingual Elementary School in Fort Collins Colo Kindergartners in lightup tennis shoes and pigtails march singlefile into the cafeteria sliding small trays along a salad bar Alison   Oh broccoli   says Kate Kosakowski a teachers assistant at the school She gives the pigtailed kindergartner a pat on the back and places several florets on the tray Kids speak in both English and Spanish throughout the school week at Harris Poudre School District which includes Harris elementary serves almost  meals a day The salad and fruit bar is a staple of this lunchroom In  the US Department of Agriculture   mandating more fruits and vegetables on students trays So when one kindergartner tries to sneak past without taking a vegetable Kosakowski swoops in Oh lets try something new today Kosakowski says grabbing a hold of the boys tray Pick one to try He relents and grabs some carrots But theres nothing that says that picky kid has to eat what he takes The school can provide the choices but some kids just will not eat Nationwide the National School Lunch Program feeds more than  million students each year Food waste has always been a problem for large institutions like school districts   that kids throw away anywhere from  percent to  percent of the food on their trays But there was particular angst over these latest healthy lunch standards Conventional wisdom says kids dont like vegetables and that by mandating more veggies on trays waste was going to go up Our goal as a department and a district is to make sure the last kid has the same choices as the first in the variety and the quality says Craig Schneider director of nutrition for the Poudre School District But we also dont want to have so much food out there that its being thrown away Conventional wisdom doesnt give kids enough credit Schneider says   found that after the new standards went into effect kids ate better and the increased portions of fruits and vegetables didnt cause waste to go up   noted that many school districts have complained about increased waste but it acknowledged a lack of data and summarized those notions of trash cans piled high with wasted veggies as anecdotal Few studies have been published that compare plate waste from before and after the introduction of the new standards The key to cutting down on waste in the lunchroom is choice according to researchers By allowing kids to make their own food decisions rather than asking lunch ladies to load up trays you disarm their pickiness Food is money Schneider says So we really want to manage that cost But also we just dont want to be throwing away food Its just that simple But waste in schools is still a huge problem A Colorado State University research team   the average student throws away more than a third of the food on the tray most of that being fruits and vegetables Thats a higher percentage than food wasted at home Its really tough for the schools because theyre dependent on their clients the students says CSU nutritionist Leslie CunninghamSabo who led the study And I think its really tough to balance healthy food with the taste preferences of the clients CunninghamSabo says school districts can make subtle changes with big effects on food waste She says when some schools have inverted lunch and recess putting play   the cafeteria food waste was cut by  percent Theres a lot of evidence to support having recess before lunch she says And the kids get out there they get to play they get to socialize they burn off some energy and they come in hungry for lunch  can change student attitudes about fruits and vegetables Schools shouldnt be afraid to get creative and can rebrand vegetables as things kids would actually clamor to get their hands on says dietitian Stephanie Smith Try calling it Super Power Cauliflower she says or instead of green beans Laser Beans Involve the students Let them help set the menu Get them more involved Smith says That way they have more buyin their school lunch participation increases and hopefully waste decreases Back at the lunchroom at Harris elementary in Fort Collins Colo fourthgraders clean their trays before raising their hands to be dismissed from the cafeteria They ate everything But we as a society usually dont We waste roughly  million tons of food a year If consumers are really going to cut down on food waste well all have to start eating our vegetables
