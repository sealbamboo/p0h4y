Doctors have been recommending bed rest to women with highrisk pregnancies for centuries  Every year about one out of five pregnant women in the United States is placed on bed rest usually to help prevent complications like premature birth hypertension and miscarriage But in a group of studies published in the latest issue of Obstetrics  Gynecology researchers argue that confining pregnant women to bed for long periods is not a practice based on good evidence  and it may potentially be harmful  In   researchers followed  pregnant women at high risk of delivering preterm About  of the women were ordered to restrict their activities to lower their risk But the study found that nearly  percent of those women ended up delivering preterm about double the number that were not confined to bed  Another   could not find enough evidence to support the practice in preventing miscarriage pregnancyinduced hypertension or low birth weight The researchers also noted known downsides of bed rest like maternal weight loss  bone and muscle atrophy and an increased risk of blood clots  Because of the lack of evidence and the potential for harm the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises against bed rest for the prevention of preterm deliveries   one expert Dr Joseph R Biggio Jr of the University of Alabama at Birmingham argued that doctors should limit its use in general until clinical trials prove it has benefit Until then he wrote physicians should contemplate whether the riskbenefit ratio justifies prescribing it Bed rest is widely recommended in highrisk pregnancies But there is little evidence to support it and in some cases it may cause harm
