If youre bringing home the bacon you may have noticed a price tag inching upward Consumers are paying nearly  percent more for pork at the supermarket than they were this time last year   the US Department of Agriculture A deadly pig disease is partially to blame Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv has killed more than  million piglets in the past year and the number of cases is on the rise Many hog producers are worried about how to keep their farms immune from a disease that has no proven cure The disease is very serious and if it hits a farm there is near  percent mortality for piglets below a certain age which is a significant loss on any farm says Michael Yezzi who raises about  hogs a year at   in Shushan NY And while it doesnt kill the older pigs it impacts the growth of the pigs remaining on the farm PEDv first appeared in the US in April  Since then the virus has infected more than  farms in  states Scientists do not believe the disease can be transmitted to humans But research is ongoing about the origin of the virus whether previously infected sows can catch the disease more than once and exactly how PEDv is spread Its a delicate balance because you dont want to raise peoples concerns because that could have a negative impact on the market You dont want to raise peoples concerns because export activities could be impacted Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on the   But Vilsack said the continued spread of the disease and newly detected strains of the virus moved the USDA to take a more aggressive stance In early June the department announced that it would spend  million to eradicate PEDv The USDA   the use of a vaccine that may protect piglets from the disease even though its still being tested in commercial settings and issued a   requiring hog producers to report new cases of PEDv or of the related disease porcine delta coronavirus And farmers are being urged to put commonsense biosecurity measures in place like disinfecting facilities and trucks and ensuring workers are wearing clean clothes PEDv has been pretty devastating to the industry but we have very strict biosecurity standards said Bob Ruth president of   which raises  million hogs a year in Pennsylvania Ohio and Indiana One of the things were looking to do is isolate the trucks we use to haul the animals On the Clinton Corners NY farm where he raises show piglets Clayton Stephens requires visitors to wear disposable plastic boots over shoes and doesnt permit visitors to enter his barn if they have recently been on other hog farms Its not a matter of if hog producers are going to get it its when theyre going to get it says Stephens I think everybodys going to end up having it Theyre trying to keep it out as long as they can More than a dozen state fairs across the country are also taking measures to slow the spread of the disease We did make the recommendation to the state fair that they not have nursing piglets with sows this year says New York State Veterinarian Dave Smith We do know that PEDv is devastating to piglets under  days of age and we really do not want to see a bunch of sick and dying piglets at the fair Its an exhibit that no one needs to see Other states including Virginia South Dakota and Ohio have canceled certain hog shows or are requiring that pigs be taken to the slaughterhouse right after the fair But it remains to be seen whether tightening up biosecurity will keep piglets from dying from PEDv They dont know where this disease is coming from says Yezzi Even closed operations that arent getting pigs in from the outside have gotten this even with the strictest biosecurity situations So everybodys at risk Meanwhile economists predict that farmers will reduce the size of their herds this year to minimize costs should PEDv infect their operations Consumers can also expect pork prices which now average almost  a pound to continue to rise during the second half of
