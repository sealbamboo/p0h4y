Bullies may gain health benefits that last into adulthood from their behavior researchers said Monday And in turn children who are bullied can suffer longlasting inflammation Our study found that a childs role in bullying can serve as either a risk or a protective factor for lowgrade inflammation William E Copeland one of the researchers and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine said in a statement Enhanced social status seems to have a biological advantage Lest readers think the researchers are suggesting children be raised to be bullies Copeland added However there are ways children can experience social success aside from bullying others The work was published online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The researchers used the Great Smoky Mountains Study which has gathered information from  people from  North Carolina counties for more than  years The researchers looked at a marker of inflammation called Creactive protein They participants were interviewed and provided blood samples Creactive protein is affected by conditions such as poor nutrition lack of sleep and infection But weve found that they are also related to psychosocial factors Copeland said The researchers looked victims pure bullies and children who were both Bullying involves repeatedly mistreating another person to improve or retain ones status Earlier studies have shown that victims of bullies suffer socially and emotionally into adulthood including increased levels of depression and anxiety Such children the researchers said also report physical problems such as pain and susceptibility to illness But the study said little is known about how the experience of being bullied is biologically embedded to influence health status One potential mechanism is chronic lowgrade inflammation In adults a high social status including income or education level is associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers the researchers wrote The finding of lower increases in creactive protein levels for pure bullies intro adulthood is novel the researchers said adding that previous work tended to focus on the those who struggled through adversity
