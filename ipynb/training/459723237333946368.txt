A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has recommended banning devices that deliver electric shocks to kids and adults with autism and other developmental disorders taking aim at a school where the shocks are given to students with special needs Such electrical stimulation devices were used at the   a special needs school in Canton Massachusetts which came under criticism after  video surfaced showing a student being shocked  times A hearing on the devices turned emotional on Thursday as some recounted experiences with the devices akin to torture while others begged health officials to keep what they say is a lifesaving treatment The device is designed to administer a current that immediately stops people from behaviors ranging from eyegouging to sexual assault but some former JRC students told the FDA they were shocked for minor disruptive behavior  and occasionally by accident I was never shocked for aggressive behavior It was for saying no messing around with a boy Ian Cook a yearold former student at the school told NBC News Cook who now lives as a man arrived at the school as a girl named Hillary just before turning  For several months Cook received behavioral rehearsal lessons and was restrained in a device day and night given shocks that were so painful they were almost like giving birth Cook never knew when the shock would come and was in constant fear of it I now suffer from a fear of authority a fear of being controlled and panic when presented with either Cook of Gardner Massachusetts told the panel Former teacher Gregory Miller testified that he left the school because his students were in pain Another former student testified that she has recurring nightmares and flashbacks about the devices If I hear certain noises like the Velcro that used to keep them closed I freeze said Jennifer Msumba I feel like its about to happen to me The school says its aversive therapy is delivered in twosecond shocks to the skin that feels like a hard pinch but is otherwise harmless and is reserved for extreme cases with the consent of a parent and a court Without the treatment program at JRC these children and adults would be condemned to lives of pain by selfinflicted mutilation psychotropic drugs isolation restraint and institutionalization  or even death the school said in a statement Aversive shock therapy is completely different from   in which doctors jolt the unconscious patients brain with an electrical charge to stop unhealthy activity in the brain The FDA says the JRCs skinshocking electrical stimulation devices are only known to be used at this school According to the agency the center has been using illegally modified devices that can shock three times greater than the FDAapproved limit The FDA previously cleared milder versions of the device for use on patients with behavioral problems but the school says they received an exemption from the FDA in  to use a higher current on their students The FDA now says that exemption was a mistake and the panel recommended banning the devices altogether The FDA isnt required to carry out the recommendations of its advisory panels But the agency is looking into whether all versions of the devices cause more harm than good for students whose conditions include mental retardation autism and severe behavioral disorders Some parents defended the treatment as a last resort for severely disabled students Sharon Wood of Charlottesville Virginia testified that the treatment saved her profoundly autistic sons life Before this he was covered in bruises and constantly bleeding from open wounds said Wood describing how Joshua  would constantly bang his head and jaw against concrete as medications failed and he grew too big to restrain Another parent testified in a written statement that the shocks were the only treatment that worked for her daughter who had previously gone blind from a selfinflicted attack At the hearing expert panelists pointed out that conflicting anecdotal evidence and outdated research complicate the discussion of a ban For example while a former patient testified that the shocks he received felt like a bee sting the  surveillance video showed another student collapsing to the ground screaming in pain That video was the subject of a lawsuit brought against the center by the mother of student Andre McCollins and settled out of court in  Cheryl McCollins told the FDA her son suffered from burns catatonia and PTSD after receiving  shocks in one day His torture all began because he refused to take off his coat said McCollins This is not about therapy This about control abuse and torture A United Nations liaison has investigated whether possible international human rights violations occurred at the school When asked about the video by the panel Judge Rotenberg Center Executive Director Glenda Crookes said the McCollins case is not reflective of a typical shock treatment thats intended to prevent selfharm That was a very rare incidence Andre had done very well at JRC said Crookes noting that up until then he had received a total of  shocks over his two year stay That day his treatment did not work for whatever reason Panelists noted that despite the lack of concrete evidence available on the devices the FDA may be unable to conduct extensive tests given all of the ethical concerns The Judge Rotenberg school said Friday that it would work with the FDA to address its concerns There is no more important issue in the world to the students and families who rely on this treatment to maintain their safety the school said
