I began running about a year ago Id just moved to New Delhi after living in the United States for  years The stress of the move was getting to me and I desperately needed exercise But finding a regular route wasnt easy Running on the sidewalk is next to impossible here in Delhi Every few seconds I had to get off the sidewalk to avoid bumping into a street vendors cart or a patch of sidewalk claimed by Indian men to pee on Then there are the stares At every street corner there seem to be groups of men whose only preoccupation seems to be staring at women A woman running on the sidewalks seems to make the number and intensity of stares shoot up And of course running outdoors meant breathing in Delhis utterly polluted air Exercising outdoors often feels like a health hazard Eventually though I discovered that the city has some wonderful parks including a beautiful one thats a tenminute walk from my apartment I geared up to make running a regular ritual even if a somewhat lonely one Then earlier this year a friend whod also lived in the US suggested we do a K race together Just to force ourselves to run more regularly When I started searching for a race I was surprised at how many choices we had easily more than  all over the country each year from walkathons to Ks to full marathons I was surprised because  I hadnt seen many runners in the city yet and  When I was growing up there were no such races in India Long distance running just wasnt part of the culture Yes there were the occasional morning joggers Yes we all had sprinting competitions in school But the average Indian could not have been less interested in running In fact my own personal philosophy was that Id run only if a tiger was chasing me down for lunch Why I wanted to know had things changed How had ordinary Indians decided to become runners I started by asking Souvik Das Gupta whom I met during my K race back in March Das Gupta is  works as a web designer and took up running two years ago after watching the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon which draws more than  people every year Until then hed always thought of running as something for the naturally athletic Im exactly the opposite of a sports person he says But the race inspired him So many people are doing it let me just give it a shot These days Das Gupta runs regularly In  alone hes run at least  half marathons and  or  Ks he says He doesnt enjoy the act of running but what keeps me going is the crossing the finish line and looking back and seeing oh my god what have I done Then there are those who do enjoy a jog like Radha Krishnaswamy  who took a nearly threehour flight from Chennai to New Delhi two weekends ago to run the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon Krishanswamy has always been an athlete She took up long distance running over a decade ago when age started to slow her down It became natural Instead of running faster I was running slower but longer Her motivation for running is that she has a gift and likes putting it to use Not everybody can run she says I cant sing I cant dance although I wish I could But I can run She says running took off in India about a decade ago First running enthusiasts like her teamed up with other runners and formed neighborhood running groups When people started gathering together and enjoying it she adds then more people started doing it Running also helps connect people at a time when everyone is living busier more isolated lives People work late hours she says When they come home theyre at the computer Running is a way to do something together She has also seen a rise in the number of women running In Chennai couple of husbands who run with me started dragging their wives to run she says Running has given many of these women mostly housewives a sense of freedom they didnt otherwise have Even though youre running in a group at least youre not sitting at home cutting vegetables or cleaning the kitchen table says Krishnaswamy She attributes this boom in running partly to a greater awareness about health issues due to growing rates of chronic illnesses like diabetes hypertension and cancer Whatever the personal motivation Krishnaswamy says running couldnt have become this popular without the help of big companies like the Airtel and Standard Chartered Bank The corporate world has played a tremendous role agrees Rahul Varghese who runs a company called   which organizes smallerscale races around the country including the K I ran back in March Once the corporate world started pitching in and movie stars like  and   started promoting running people said Wait its actually pretty sexy he says  Still the trend seems restricted to the elite and upper middle class Because for people whore poor their main concern is how theyre going to get three meals a day a roof over their heads says Krishnaswamy Look at the demographic of the participants in races and you see that most people have some money and time to spare Or look at the stuff that runners use Running shoes cost at least  to  still out of reach of most Indians Not to mention the gadgets  mobile phone arm bands knee supports and hydration packs that seem part of peoples running routines Its still in the early days says Varghese As the market grows youre going to have products that fit peoples budgets He may be right Just as the number of women runners has risen there may come a time when running will appeal to people from all walks of life Perhaps they will be able to afford it too Id be happy for the company on my morning runs
