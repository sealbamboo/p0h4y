I felt a huge burden of expectation on my shoulders before Id even set foot in my office at Basildon university hospital for the first time  September  was the date I dont think I was the only person who had made a note of it in their diary Hospital staff patients our regulators and our MPs were all watching closely to see whether this would be the beginning of a new positive chapter They were desperate in the hope that a new chief executive and a new board would be able to make a difference to an organisation which had been in the spotlight for so long and for all the wrong reasons But with this weight of expectation I sensed an enormous opportunity What I found was that people were willing to invest their support in me  they wanted the hospital to succeed What we needed to do very quickly was to give people something to be optimistic about some concrete evidence that things were about to change We did this for patients and particularly complainants by talking to them  and listening We needed to do the same for local politicians One of my first meetings was in Westminster organised so that I could listen to what our local MPs had to say Sitting alongside Ian Luder my new chairman I heard about an organisation in denial unwilling to accept that it had been failing its patients Not unreasonably our MPs wanted significant change and real accountability And they wanted to see true leadership On the whole the MPs supported our vision We went on the front foot opening our doors to them and inviting them to see first hand some of the improvements we were making whilst being realistic that dramatic change was not going to happen overnight We asked them to come to open new facilities launch new services and appear on hospital radio I gave them my mobile phone number so that they would have direct access should any issues arise We made sure they received all of our press releases and were alerted to bad news in advance so that they didnt hear about things in the media first When reports were published about the performance of Basildon hospital I called our local MPs personally in advance to talk through the headlines I did the same on the day we were put into special measures as part of the   Openness honesty and transparency needed to be at the heart of everything we did Not just in our dealings with politicians but in our relationships with regulators and our local partners in the health service One of our main objectives was to better manage the politics of the local health economy too We were still accountable to our regulators and needed to win back their confidence To do that we had to live up to our promises  if we said we were going to do something by a particular time or date we needed to do it whether that involved us sharing good or bad news We put a lot of focus on achieving the deadlines we were set  for reports performance updates or ministerial queries  and responding to requests from the system which were various and multiple Our poor historical performance meant we were in no position to be obstructive or tardy  we needed to deliver on requests from our regulators if we were to show them we were serious about turning things around In a short space of time we built strong working relationships with the Care Quality Commission CQC Monitor and our local clinical commissioning groups CCGs We used their expertise to help us improve care for patients Regular communication and delivering on or ahead of deadline built confidence and trust This was reflected in the shift we experienced  from being challenged to being supported Soon Basildon and Brentwood CCG was conducting informal unannounced inspections to help us test our performance This was  and still is  an immensely useful part of our improvement process Our hospital is certainly heading in the right direction in June this year we were the first to be taken out of special measures after being rated good by the CQC For the first time in a very long time we are operating without any regulatory intervention If we can maintain strong relationships with our critical friends I am confident we can keep it that way
