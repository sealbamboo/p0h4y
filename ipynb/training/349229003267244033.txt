For many people the foodinduced stupor that often follows a big meal is a good excuse for a nap But for some a brief walk shortly after eating is a quick way to burn some calories and aid digestion Over the years researchers have found that a postmeal walk as short as  minutes can in fact help with digestion and improve blood sugar levels In   German researchers looked at what happened when people ate a large meal and then consumed either an espresso or an alcoholic digestif  like brandy or flavored liqueur  or walked at a slow pace on a treadmill Walking they found sped the rate at which food moved through the stomach The beverages had no effect In other studies researchers have found that walking has a significant effect on blood sugar after meals Blood sugar typically rises and then falls after eating but large spikes and variations can   and potentially signal diabetes In a   researchers found that a minute walk about  minutes after dinner led to lower postmeal blood sugar levels in people with Type  diabetes than either a walk before dinner or no walking at all Another study   found that in older adults who were overweight and sedentary walking for  minutes shortly after each meal improved daily blood sugar levels to a greater extent than a single minute walk in the morning Researchers say that a postmeal stroll helps clear glucose from the bloodstream in part because more of it is taken up by the muscles Heading for a brief walk instead of the couch about  minutes after a meal may improve digestion and blood sugar control
