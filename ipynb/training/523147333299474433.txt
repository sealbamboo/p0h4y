Extra funding designed to boost sport in primary schools could be used to tackle childhood obesity says Ofsted  The watchdog looked at how  schools identified as having good PE provision were spending the governments Primary PE and Sport Premium  The mayear fund was introduced in all Englands primary schools last year to build on the  Olympics legacy  Overall the inspectors said schools were making good use of the money and pupils PE skills were improving  Many were using the cash to employ sports coaches or specialist teachers improve training to teachers and extend the range of sports on offer says  Some also forged links with local sport clubs and other schools to boost sporting opportunities     However the report adds heads would benefit from clearer guidance from the Department for Education on how best to target the funding  Some heads said lack of guidance meant they were not initially confident about how to use the money Schools should consider better ways of using the cash to improve pupils health and wellbeing particularly to tackle obesity say the inspectors  The report notes that a few schools are already using a small part of the funding to promote better lifestyles and help overweight or obese pupils   However overall this was not done well enough in the majority This is an area where head teachers feel that more guidance and support would be helpful  The report highlights the example of Springfield Junior School in Suffolk which used some of the premium to employ a nutritionist to work with a small number of overweight pupils and their parents on diet and lifestyle  The school said pupils increased their levels of physical activity and were more confident about joining in  Other recommendations include activities aimed at the brightest pupils and efforts to encourage nonparticipants to take part in extracurricular sport  Sean Harford Ofsteds national director for schools policy said Sport has the power to transform young lives It is encouraging that schools are using the Primary PE and Sport Premium effectively  This may unearth a future Olympic star but more importantly it is allowing all children to fully take part in PE and enjoy a greater range of sports This is an obvious boost to their health but it also helps to form good character too I have found that the best schools know that sport is not an addon to the timetable but is an integral part of a schools ethos Emma Boggis chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance said it was good to see the Primary PE and Sport Premium was fulfilling the job  Ms Boggis welcomed evidence of schools being quite creative about how they choose to spend their money in order to inspire young people to take up a sporting habit for life
