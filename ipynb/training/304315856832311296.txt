 Betablockers seemed to reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimers disease according to a study in older JapaneseAmerican men Autopsies on  men showed that those who had taken betablockers for hypertension had significantly fewer microinfarctions less brain atrophy and fewer Alzheimers lesions in the brain than those who had been treated with other medications according to Lon White MD of the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute in Honolulu and colleagues Although betablockers alone were superior to other forms of treatment any drug treatment was better for dementia and Alzheimersrelated damage than no drug treatment according to an abstract of a study that will be reported at the American Academy of Neurology meeting The researchers noted that a systolic blood pressure  mm Hg in midlife predicted the population attributable risk of dementia in  percent to  percent of cases The study looked at the relationship between brain lesions at autopsy with betablocker treatment compared with other antihypertensive drugs The participants ages  to  were enrolled in the HonoluluAsia Aging Study from  to  Of the   had been hypertensive or treated with antihypertensive drugs Among those receiving treatment  percent received only a betablocker  percent received a betablocker and one or more other medications and the remaining  percent received other blood pressure medications Results were adjusted for age baseline blood pressures baseline cognitive test score followup interval age at death diabetes apolipoprotein E genotype midlife hypertension and whether or not midlife hypertension was treated Participants who received only betablockers had significantly fewer microinfarctions and Alzheimer brain lesions than those who received no treatment or nonbetablocker treatment Those who received betablocker therapy in combination with other blood pressure drugs had an intermediate reduction in numbers of brain abnormalities Patients who received betablocker therapy  alone or in combination with other blood pressure drugs  had significantly less brain atrophy than those who received no or alternative treatment The study showed a congruent amelioration of cognitive decline or impairment associated with betablocker use the authors concluded However the relationship may not be causal noted Mary Sano PhD of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City I think we have to recognize that its possible that people who needed only one drug  the betablockers  may have had less disease to begin with said Sano who was not involved in the study They may look like theyre better not because of the drug but because of a less severe underlying condition I think that the important takeaway message is to put together the best treatment for the condition at hand she added Source
