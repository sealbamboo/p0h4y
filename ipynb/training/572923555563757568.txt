Adults catch real flu about once every five years scientists calculate based on a field study in China  Although many of us will feel ill more often than this other flulike infections are to usually blame the international team says  The scientists tested blood samples from  volunteers aged between seven and  to gauge how often flu infections strike  A similar study in the UK will test if the findings apply to British people   Gathering this sort of lifespan data  which the researchers say has not really been done before  should help experts better understand who is at risk of infection and how often as well as how far the disease spreads through communities The study in the journal PLoS Biology looked at nine main strains of flu known to have been circulating around the globe between  and  These were all types of influenza A HN virus  The researchers from Imperial College London and institutes in the US and China checked the volunteers blood for the presence of antibodies  to reveal whether they had ever been infected with the viruses and how often They found that while the children got flu on average every other year flu infections became less frequent with age  From the age of  onwards flu infections tended to occur at a steady rate of about two per decade in the people that they studied The researchers point out that their findings may not apply to other populations but conceivably could  Dr Steven Riley senior author of the study from the Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial said The exact frequency of infection will vary depending on background levels of flu and vaccination He said the flu that they had studied included strains that had spread widely and quickly around the world including Europe and the US For adults we found that influenza infection is actually less common than some people think he said In childhood and adolescence its more common possibly because children mix more frequently with other people  Prof Ron Eccles of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University said This is an interesting study  There is much confusion between colds and flu and influenza He said some infections were also silent  they might only show up if you went looking for them in blood Colds and flu are caused by viruses but it can be tricky to tell these diseases apart based on just subjective symptoms Both can cause a temperature and sore throat plus coughs and sneezes  which is how they spread from person to person What one person considers to be flu another may call a heavy head cold for example  With a common cold the symptoms tend to come on gradually are usually milder and affect mostly the nose and the throat Flu is a more severe illness that normally makes the individual want to take to their bed The symptoms include aches and pains as well as a blocked or runny nose Flu is unpleasant but not threatening for most fit and healthy adults but it can cause serious complications in the elderly and people with other chronic health conditions such as asthma  This is why experts recommend atrisk groups get a flu jab every year to protect themselves  In the UK this year flu has been circulating at its highest level for three years The virus is a strain of influenza type A HN This years choice of seasonal flu vaccine   after studies found the jab stopped only three out of every  vaccinated people from developing symptoms  The flu virus is constantly mutating which makes it difficult to predict which strain to vaccinate against each year
