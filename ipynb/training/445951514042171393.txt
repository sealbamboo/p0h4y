All it took was a map to convince health economists Stephen Hinshaw and Richard Scheffler that it must be some kind of policy issue driving a recent explosion in cases of ADHD And a convenient natural experiment  in the form of the federal governments No Child Left Behind  provided the answer the two experts argue in a new book Its school testing they say When you look at that you get the closest thing there is to a smoking gun says Richard Scheffler of the University of California Berkeley who coauthored the book The ADHD Explosion which was just published this month But its not necessarily a bad thing the authors say if children are being diagnosed properly and if theyre getting the Theres no question theres been a huge increase in the number of kids diagnosed with Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder or ADHD The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about  million kids aged  to  or  percent of that age group were   as of  And CDC documents a steady increase from  percent in  to  percent in  and to  percent in  a rate of  percent a year It looks for all the world like a growing epidemic says Stephen Hinshaw a professor of psychology at Berkeley who wrote the book with Hinshaw But ADHD wasnt even something people noticed until recently he says It started about the same time in history that we made kids go to school Hinshaw told NBC News in an interview Then come the s and a crisis of falling test scores What happened is that a number of states began to pass accountability laws Hinshaw said In the early s the CDC began tracking ADHD diagnoses Hinshaw and Scheffler looked at the maps showing the rates of ADHD and compared them to a map that showed which states had passed accountability laws By the turn of the century  states had passed accountability laws They tended to be Republicanleaning states in the South such as North Carolina In   percent of all children in North Carolina had been diagnosed with ADHD at some point including nearly one in three teenage boys This was more than twice the rate in California with a  percent rate But this was just a correlation Hinshaw says Just because two things happen together in time doesnt mean one caused the other They looked at differences in culture ethnicity in the number of doctors per capita and at possible other causes Nothing really explained the different rates of ADHD in different states Then No Child Left Behind became federal policy in  One of the first official acts of President George W Bush after he took office was to ask Congress to write and pass the law It called for standardized testing to show if schools were in fact educating students Local state laws often held teachers and principals directly responsible for the results Now what happens is a natural experiment says Hinshaw The other states raced to write accountability laws requiring schools to show they are actually educating children Hinshaw and Scheffler compared ADHD rates in the  states that had been requiring testing with the  states that had to play catchup Rates of ADHD diagnoses soared Children ages  to  living in lowincome homes and in states without previous consequential accountability laws went from a  percent to a  percent rate of ADHD diagnoses once No Child Left Behind started they wrote Thats a  percent increase over four years Californias current rate posttesting Its  percent North Carolinas rate actually fell slightly to  percent in  When you incentivize test scores above all else there is probably pressure to get kids diagnosed with ADHD Hinshaw said We know from our own research that medication not only makes you less fidgety but also can bump up your test scores That would be the benign interpretation that testing has encouraged parents to get their kids in to see specialists for muchneeded medical care But theres also a more sinister possibility and one that Hinshaw and Scheffler say is at work in some states If you can identify the children with ADHD you can take them out of the pool that measures how schools are doing says Scheffler He says some districts  he wont say where  do seem to have been doing so State school officials and the federal Department of Education did not respond when contacted by NBC News No Child Left Behind ties federal funding to test scores Scheffler points outYou can see the incentive for schools to get kids diagnosed with ADHD he says Either way Scheffler and Hinshaw say the increase in ADHD cases is real and its not just affecting kids Recent studies show  are on the rise too Although often ridiculed ADHD represents a genuine medical condition that robs people of major life chances they write in the book Scheffler doesnt see the increase in adult ADHD diagnoses as surprising This has nothing to do with the schools This has to do with global competition and performance he says People are under pressure to perform better at work And news about adult ADHD in turn sends more people to their doctors and diagnoses spike even more Hinshaw adds Here are we are in  with evidence that medications can benefit Adult ADHD clinics spring up he says Thats not necessarily a bad thing says Hinshaw What is bad is if ADHD is not being diagnosed with the proper care Hinshaw says A minute pediatrician visit is not adequate for an ADHD diagnosis and certainly not as the basis for writing a prescription for a powerful stimulant such as Ritalin or Adderall to treat it Many pediatricians are not trained in the emotional disorders of childhood or not reimbursed for the time it takes Hinshaw said It is easy to pull out prescription pad at the end of a visit He calls the book a reality check and says parents providers educators and politicians should take note and make sure the right kids are being diagnosed and helped properly
