Saving money isnt really the point of hospice care Helping dying patients have the best possible remaining life followed by a good death is really the purpose  But whether hospice care saves money has prompted debate for years Most hospice patients die at home which is what the great majority of Americans say they prefer or in nursing homes Wouldnt that save money compared with the cycle of  calls and hospitalizations that characterize so many American deaths Studies of this question have been small and have reported contradictory results There hasnt been a lot of consensus said Dr Ziad Obermeyer an emergency physician and health policy specialist at Harvard Medical School There are people in the policy establishment who are still skeptical about whether the costs are lower He hopes the large study he and his colleagues at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston published recently in JAMA will finally put that concern to rest It matched two groups each containing more than  older Americans with metastatic cancer comparing patients who enrolled in hospice with those who had the same poor prognosis but didnt use hospice The researchers tracked participants in both groups until their deaths  The hospice patients had far fewer hospitalizations and less than half as many intensive care unit stays their Medicare records showed They endured half as many invasive procedures They were five times less likely to die in a hospital or nursing home And yes care in the last year of their lives   Costs for patients in the nonhospice group were  on average in the last year of life compared with  for those in hospice If extended nationwide the difference could save Medicare billions of dollars I hope this will be the last time someone asks the question Dr Obermeyer said For this population enrollment in hospice is associated with a large difference in costs His own experiences in a busy urban emergency room led to this research We see so many people with endstage diseases and theyre still getting very aggressive treatment he told me in an interview Im often the first person to discuss endoflife care with them even though theyve seen a whole list of doctors Such conversations often prove difficult but theyre particularly tough in an emergency room he pointed out when you might have a fiveminute window in which to make an important decision  like whether to put a patient on a ventilator In this study all the patients had the kind of poorprognosis cancers  primarily of the breast colon and lungs  that made them eligible for hospice a decision that generally does involve that kind of conversation Hospice and nonhospice patients with the same prognoses were matched by age the average was  sex length of survival and region because studies have repeatedly shown that geography is destiny when it comes to the amounts and kinds of medical care people receive From diagnosis to death both groups lived a median seven months The hospice patients had heartsinkingly short stays a median of just  days lower than the national median and a pity since hospice   Still the differences were stark During the period they received hospice care  percent of hospice patients were hospitalized compared with  percent of nonhospice patients during the same period More than a third of the nonhospice patients spent time in an ICU versus fewer than  percent of the hospice enrollees About a quarter of the hospice patients underwent invasive procedures though often those were related to comfort like a having catheter inserted to administer painrelieving drugs More than half of the nonhospice group had invasive procedures which were more likely to include intubation dialysis and CPR A key finding  percent of the nonhospice group died in a hospital or nursing home versus  percent of hospice patients Costs varied depending on length of hospice stay Those enrolled for five to eight weeks represented the greatest savings  compared with nonhospice patients Shorter stays meant lower but still statistically significant savings Only among the  percent who spent a year or more in hospice did costs exceed those incurred by nonhospice patients Because you can never randomly assign dying people to hospice care  it will always be their choice  this study measured associations not causes People who opt for hospice are different from those who decline it Dr Obermeyer acknowledged Hospice is the way people express their preferences about what kind of care they get  And the study looked only at people with cancer Thats still a leading hospice diagnosis but a greater proportion of hospice patients have other conditions and that could influence the costs Still greater hospice use  and for longer periods  looks like a moneysaver As the health policy specialist Joan M Teno   that really shouldnt matter Weve set up this notion that it must be costneutral or save money she told me in an interview Why cant it cost a little more if it provides high quality care Nobody questions whether ICU care saves money But perhaps seeing hospice as a way to save Medicare dollars will lead to   And this might too Dr Obermeyers next study will look at whether hospice reduces outofpocket expenses not just for the system but for patients and families he said We talk a lot less about costs for individuals True And wouldnt that be interesting to know
