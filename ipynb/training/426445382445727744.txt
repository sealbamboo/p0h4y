The prospect of a party frightened me  probably because the enforced isolation of cancer treatments has rendered me hypersensitive It was raining outside and festivities would not begin until after  pm But my husband and I had promised to attend the celebration of a book publication So we dragged ourselves to Judith and Aidans house where I hoped to find a comfortable chair in which I would not look like the battleax at Mrs Dalloways party whom everyone had thought long dead The house crowded with people clutching drinks pulsed with their robust vitality Before the cancer diagnosis I would have moved around the room schmoozing with a series of acquaintances while getting a tad tipsy Now I was determined to have a drink but I would need to sit down and I could not control who might sit with me or indeed whether anyone would Still sit I had to do while dealing with a hideous mix of nostalgia jealousy and selfpity Exhausted by five years of surgeries and drugs I have spent too much time alone and have nothing to exchange in return for tidbits of gossip      My colleagues kind people took turns as sitters Unfortunately the atmosphere of jollity only underscored my worries fears that thinning hair would not hide my scalp qualms about not recalling the names of graduate students I recognized but could not place The cumulative effect of treatment also left me bereft of the prevarications and censors that ease everyday interactions The membrane between internal feelings and external expressions on which I used to rely has worn thin  I have neither the time nor the energy to maintain buffers between me and the limited world I inhabit Cancer has made me porous and susceptible to others  those I know personally and those I do not A friend in mourning or runners and spectators maimed in Boston reduce me to tears Have other patients experienced this permeable sense of self when the barrier between the person we present in public and our private sentiments erodes With few filters I really do not belong in polite society        Just when I decided to give my husband a signal for us to up and leave two guests started to sing in a corner of the room I settled down pleased at not having to make chitchat with my current sitter a very young woman with a crew cut A succession of musicians followed producing that vivid vibrancy only live music in an intimate space can create By the time Jason Fickel stood up to sing accompanying himself on his acoustic guitar my exhilaration knew no bounds Live music should not be reserved for memorials Musicians ought to be allowed to play in infusion centers hospital rooms and hospices Or so I think as my body feels sprayed and bathed plumped and pumped by the rhythms of a melody that comes from Jasons mouth and hands but courses through me like currents of energy  The wine helps undoubtedly but it is the thrumming strings and the wry yet sonorous voice that delight me galvanizing my attention and quickening my spirits I sense the vibrations on my skin in my bones massaging the synapses of my brain music sweet music music everywhere Let there be trombones and guitars flutes and pianos singing and especially cellos for the sick and the dying During my mothers last months in assisted care she would have loved to have heard a string quartet harmonies returning her to pleasures displaced by old age and disease         Awash and exultant as the music ends I recall a line of poetry  we feel that we are greater than we know and turn to the girl on my right I did not remember her because apparently I had never met her before But she explained carefully she works out with a member of my cancer support group  in a special class A beat a pause and I understand The crew cut has to do with cancer I shake her hand to wish her well Her fingers are icy A surge urges me on the need the palpable urgency to pay tribute to her resolute stamina I clasp both her frozen hands and kiss them overwhelmed that someone so young has had to go through what she has gone through though I scold myself too for these eruptions of extravagant emotion are sure to make me look like a fool  By the time Don and I got home I realized that there are liabilities but also benefits of being thinskinned At the party I had felt the beauty felt the fun Lucky lucky lucky I thought as I drifted off to sleep
