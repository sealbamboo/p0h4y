When a pharmaceutical company stops making a drug what happens to the patients who think it saved their life  Peter Franklin from Plymouth in southwest England has been told a cancer drug  which he says has kept him alive and healthy for the past five years  is to run out He was given the drug as part of a trial But Pfizer the company which makes the drug says it has not proved successful enough to continue developing so no more is being made Mr Franklin is now desperately hunting an alternative Doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London told the yearold that supplies of the drug figitumumab will run out in October It was being trialled in lung breast prostate and colorectal cancers but was also offered to patients such as Mr Franklin who suffers from Ewings sarcoma a rare and very aggressive bone cancer that affects young people and teenagers He said It is not good news It is very frustrating from a personal point of view and very sad that a drug that can effectively control my disease in a number of people be it a very small number of people can be withdrawn when there are very few conventional drugs which will cause a good response I was expecting it to happen as its been mooted a couple of times in the past that the drug has not been successful in the majority of patients and would therefore be discontinued  but it adds a huge amount of uncertainty to our future plans Last year Mr Franklin married his longterm girlfriend and the couple were looking to the future But their plans are now on hold as Mr Franklin tries to find out what his options are once the drug runs out The chartered accountant was diagnosed with cancer when he was  and was treated with chemotherapy   But the cancer returned So in the summer of  he started having monthly infusions of the Pfizer drug as part of a clinical trial After just a few months the cancer and a tumour in his back disappeared and he has been able to live a normal life ever since Mr Franklin hopes the cancer has gone for good but believes the drug has been holding it at bay and is concerned it will return if he stops taking it  Doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital have suggested that if the cancer does come back he could try to find another trial of a drug that works in a similar way but there are no guarantees any will be open or that he will qualify to take part A spokeswoman for Pfizer said Pfizer discontinued development of figitumumab in January  based on the negative outcome of a number of randomised clinical trials However for a small number of patients globally who in the medical judgement of their individual physicians benefited and tolerated it well Pfizer continued supply through a compassionateuse process She said the company could not comment on Mr Franklins individual case but said the company had clearly communicated with doctors in  and again recently that it no longer produced the drug and could only supply it until the shelf life of the research supplies expired Pfizer advised doctors to look at other research into similar drugs A spokeswoman for the Royal Marsden Hospital said it could not comment on individual cases
