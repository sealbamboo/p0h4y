The reality of the height and speed at which I was traveling didnt hit me until almost halfway through the ziplining course    Joel Hunt my yearold guide told me that the fourth and highest line  the one I was about to ride  was known as the most spinetingling    I quickly found out why After easing off a wooden platform secured to a Douglas fir I sailed through a cluster of treetops and then watched as the ground gave way below me Suddenly I was  stories in the air hurtling toward a mountain the oaks and pines and streams that litter the floor of the San Gabriels smirking up at me the Mojave Desert on my left Hunt just a tiny faraway speck on the side of a massive cliff toward which I seemed to be careening at  to  miles per hour   Ziplining In the March  Saturday section an article about Southern California opportunities for ziplining should have made clear that the Flightline Safari ziplining course is at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park not the affiliated San Diego Zoo  I had to remind myself that this is what I signed up for this was the whole point of the day Spinetingling indeed The thrillridecumnature tour I was on has its roots in a strategy developed by environmental scientists in Costa Rica so that they could move easily between trees in the rain forest to study the ecosystems It has since turned into a mustdo for adrenaline junkies with zipline tours for the masses sprouting up from Australia to China to South Africa In the US there are more than  courses  up from about  a decade ago says James Borishade executive director of the Assn for Challenge Course Technology Some are popping up in unexpected places one was erected at the Super Bowl this year another was installed in  over downtown Las Vegas presumably not as a way to study the surrounding vegetation Borishade suggests finding a course that was built by someone who is accredited or one thats visited annually by an accredited inspector Safety standards for zip lines are set by the ACCT which also offers accreditation for companies and individuals that build courses requirements for meeting those standards vary from state to state Navitat Canopy Tours where I was opened in July in Wrightwood about  hours northeast of Los Angeles joining a handful of other zipline courses in Southern California It offers a hour airborne tour of the forest The course designed and installed by Bonsai Design Inc looks like something out of a Berenstain Bears book Curved tree branches form neat stepladders that give way to pristine rope and wood bridges I half expected to see a bird alight on someones shoulder and begin chirping out a Disney melody As we made our way between the treetops and along the few hiking trails that are laid out on the ground our other guide yearold Sean Hennessy pointed out various natural features sugar pines that smell like cocoa butter incense cedars brooks that attract deer and mountain lions and tree branches that are sometimes populated by redtailed hawks The goal of the course he explained is not just to introduce visitors to the thrill of hauling themselves off a platform and flying at massive speeds from one tree to another but also to acquaint them with the intricacies of the mountain from a vantage point that doesnt involve a car window and a steering wheel We want you to see the forest he said from a different perspective
