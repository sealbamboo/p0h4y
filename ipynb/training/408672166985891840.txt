Usually there are about  cases of measles in the United States in any given year But this year we saw  reported cases in the first  months  all ultimately linked to people who brought measles to the United States from abroad  Although most of us dont realize it because it is so rare in our country measles is a serious disease Worldwide on an average day  children   every hour  die from measles and its complications  Measles is so contagious that if one person has it  of  people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected Todays interconnected world means were all linked by the air we breathe the water we drink and the food we eat Global travel speeds the rate at which infectious disease threats such as measles can be delivered to our doorstep  Some think infectious diseases are no longer a problem in the industrialized world But the fact is that infectious diseases continue to be with us Thats why prevention is the key  The threat from measles would be far greater in the United States were it not for the development of the measles vaccine and its widespread use in childhood immunization programs around the world  This week we celebrate the th anniversary of its creation  Since  a global partnership that includes CDC has vaccinated more than  billion children Over the past decade these vaccinations have prevented more than  million deaths The worldwide effort to prevent deaths from measles will leave behind an important global health infrastructure that will continue to make the world more secure Improvements overseas such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems training disease detectives and building facilities to investigate disease outbreaks make the world  and the United States  safer and healthier  Measles is just a plane ride away It can be brought here by US travelers and visitors from other countries We must continue to be vigilant about measles transmission here at home  Parents should protect their children by making sure theyve had two doses of measles vaccine And all of us should make sure were uptodate on vaccinations particularly prior to overseas travel  These steps will protect the United States from measles until the world becomes measlesfree
