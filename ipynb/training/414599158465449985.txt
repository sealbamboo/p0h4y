For centuries the brain was a mystery Only in the last few decades have scientists begun to unravel its secrets  In recent years using the latest technology and powerful computers further key discoveries have been made However much remains to be understood about how the brain works Here are five important areas of study attempting to unlock the last secrets of the brain  When we think move speak dream and even love  it all happens in the grey matter  But our brains are not simply one colour White matter matters too  Much of the research into dementia has focused on the telltale plaques of beta amyloid and tau protein tangles which occur in the grey matter  But one British scientist   says the white matter  and its blood supply  may be equally important The white colour results from fatty sheaths around the axons  which are extensions of the nerve cell bodies and help the cells to communicate  He is using   in Oxford and Sheffield to analyse white matter for potential triggers such as leaking blood vessels Some of the cases had an MRI or CT scan and that information can help give more clues about whether there was disease in the white matter  and what its basis might be says Dr Hainsworth  If leaking blood vessels in white matter do play a key role in the development of dementia then it may offer up a another potential route for new drug therapies  For years caffeine was used to enhance alertness But popping a pill to get straightAs may soon become the norm  At Cambridge University neuroscientist Barbara Sahakian is investigating cognitive enhancers  drugs which make us smarter  She studies how they can improve the performance of surgeons or pilots and asks if they could even be used to make us more entrepreneurial  But she warns that there is no longterm safety information on these drugs and as a society we need to talk about their use  She says the scientific and ethical challenges created by drugs which affect the production of brain chemicals like dopamine and noradrenaline   which induce pleasurable or fight or flight responses  need to be debated in order to decide whether drugtests become routine before taking an exam  Dr Sahakian adds I frequently talk to students about cognitiveenhancing drugs and a lot of students take them for studying and exams  But other students feel angry about this they feel those students are cheating  People need to be on top of their game when mastering skills like playing a musical instrument or detecting a bomb  But research suggests that our unconscious can be harnessed to help us excel  Repeatedly playing a tricky piece of music obviously helps develop a familiarity with the bits that are most difficult But cellist Tania Lisboa whos also a researcher in the Centre for Performance Science at Londons Royal College of Music says it also helps to send the trickier parts of a piece from her conscious to the unconscious part of her brain  After hours of practice a fluent musicians brain stores how to play the piece in an area at the back of the brain called the cerebellum  literally the little brain   Neuroscientist Prof Anil Seth of Sussex University says It has more brain cells than the rest of the brain put together  It helps to promote fluid movements So the conscious effort of learning how to bow a cello is moved from the cortical areas which are involved when its new or difficult over to the cerebellum which is very good at producing unconscious fluent behaviour on demand  Music and defence may not appear to have much in common but the unconscious can also help detect potential threats whether its a suspicious person in a crowd or the presence of an improvised explosive device The unconscious brain is really good at spotting patterns  a skill which Paul Sajda at Colombia University in New York exploits  right at the boundary of the conscioussubconscious I can flash  images a second and if one of those images has something out of the ordinarythat will essentially cause me to reorient my brain to that image  but Im not exactly aware of what that is   Brain activity is monitored whilst the analyst looks at images so that researchers can later see which images triggered reactions Its just  years since   first noted the telltale rapid eye movement or REM sleep which we now associate with dreaming   But our fascination with dreams dates back at least  years to ancient Mesopotamia when people believed that the soul moved out of a sleeping body to visit the places they dreamed of     REM sleep  which occurs every  minutes or so  begins with signals from the base of the brain which eventually reach the cerebral cortex  the outer layer of the brain which is responsible for learning and thought   These nerve impulses are also directed to the spinal cord inducing temporary paralysis of the limbs   Prof Robert Stickgold from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for Sleep and Cognition in Boston believes that dreams are vital for processing memory associations  He has asked the subjects of some of his sleep studies to play Tetris  and then noted their descriptions of how they floated amongst geometric shapes in their dreams  Hes an admirer of    where the scientists could read the dreams of subjects as they had MRI scans  But he says its hard to get people to sleep in a noisy expensive scanner  And the future I would like to see research which reveals the rules for dream construction  and how it relates to the larger concept of memory processing during sleep   One even more elusive goal how to dream just happy dreams and ditch the bad ones especially nightmares  Excruciating chronic pain is one of medicines most difficult problems to solve  Untouched by conventional treatments like painkilling drugs surgeons are now testing their theory that deep brain stimulation could provide relief  It is a brain surgery technique which involves electrodes being inserted to reach targets deep inside the brain  The target areas are stimulated via the electrodes which are connected to a batterypowered pacemaker surgically placed under the patients collar bone  One of the pioneers of this technique is Prof Tipu Aziz at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford  Deep brain stimulation has been used in the past for Parkinsons disease and depression and is now being trialled on obsessive compulsive disorder patients as well as those in chronic pain  One of his patients Clive has suffered from terrible pain for nearly a decade after an operation to remove a disc in his neck  Sometimes I thought that if I had an axe Id chop my own arm off if I thought it would get rid of the pain   The doctors explained to him that his brain was getting signals from his arm to his brain confused and that the electrodes could help  In Clives case this was an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate  A week after his surgery he was one of the fortunate  of patients for whom the deep brain stimulation provides relief Its great to be out of that pain now Since having the implant I can sit down for longer I am able to walk further everything is an improvement Prof Aziz is treating medical conditions But he is aware of ethical dilemmas which could arise if the technique was applied to other areas Putting electrodes in targets to improve memory  Or you could put electrodes into people to make them indifferent to danger and create the perfect soldier
