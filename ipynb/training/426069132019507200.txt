Soon after his wife was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia Bill Floyd consulted a neurologist who had been a member of his church People with this illness dont know they have it the doctor warned They dont understand that anything is wrong This littleknown yet common consequence of this kind of dementia Alzheimers disease and other brain disorders is called anosognosia and it leaves people unaware that they are compromised by illness  Imagine someone who survives a stroke and is paralyzed on the left side of his body but is convinced he can walk without assistance A less extreme example Someone with moderate memory deficiency gets lost on the road or has accidents but thinks she is driving just as well as ever This is not denial said Sandra Weintraub a professor of psychiatry and neurology at Northwestern University Its a lack of insight and awareness she said Everyone else around them is aware theyre not the same and they are not Sometimes anosognosia is selective An aging parent may realize she has a problem with one kind of activity but is oblivious to other difficulties But in other cases the lack of selfawareness is more extensive According to some estimates up to  percent of people with early Alzheimers disease     And as dementia progresses the symptoms also advance evidence suggests  Trying to make someone with this problem understand that they have changed and need to accept new limits often is an exercise in frustration Dr Weintraub said Reasoning and evidence make little difference to these patients   Brain studies suggest that the lack of awareness may be linked to the deterioration of the frontal lobes especially on the right side which play an important role in problemsolving planning and understanding the context and meaning of experiences and social interactions  Some studies also point to   Really as of yet we have no idea whats going on Dr Weintraub said   Mr Floyd  a professional photographer in Evanston Ill spoke publicly about his experience as a caregiver at   sponsored by Northwestern University that I attended late last year My wife never ever acknowledged she had this disease and to bring it up was painful he told the audience  Connie Floyd died in September at age  She was an accomplished woman Mr Floyd said in an interview a director of childrens programs at her church for over  years Theirs was a deeply satisfying marriage until July  the first time he suggested his wife needed to see a doctor For several years close friends had been telling him privately that something didnt seem right  And several months before she sought help a physician who knew Mrs Floyd well had confessed that he was worried she might have a brain tumor an aneurysm or dementia There had been signs at home times when Mrs Floyd would seem to forget how to make the bed or would start talking when she and her husband were praying in bed at night She forgot to hold a soup spoon steady while bringing it to her mouth and pushed her chair out several feet from the dining room table  When Mr Floyd suggested she move in closer she would push the chair to the side      But when Mr Floyd tried to raise his concerns with his wife she was shocked  The problems werent significant and there were explanations for all of them she insisted  She couldnt see what he was worried about and felt like she was being unfairly criticized From that day on Mr Floyd said she saw him as her accuser  In prepared remarks for the Northwestern conference he wrote She seemed to feel that if she could hide the symptoms the disease wouldnt be there he told me adding that she didnt want anyone to know about her illness I kept telling her this journey would be so much easier with other people at our side but she just didnt see it that way Any time Mr Floyd tried to point out her difficulties and offer assistance his wife would take offense  She couldnt make the connection between her symptoms and herself he said  How do you try to help someone in these circumstances Mr Floyd decided to confront his wife only when her safety or that of other people might be compromised Otherwise he would let things slide or take care of them on his own Mrs Floyds condition took a sharp turn for the worse last spring and by the beginning of September it was clear she was dying Unable to swallow or talk she was living in a nursing home and entirely dependent on others Nonetheless she looked alarmed and startled when her daughter suggested that Mrs Floyds own mother would be waiting for her with open arms in heaven Mr Floyd recalled  Even at the very end she had an absolute failure to recognize what was going on he said  Mr Floyd was never able to say a real goodbye to his partner of  years he said a woman he loved with all his heart
