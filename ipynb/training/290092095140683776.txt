 Children exposed to   while in the womb face a higher risk of developing behavior problems a new study suggests These problems can include depression anxiousness and attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder   the researchers report This is the only study on methamphetamine that looked at children at birth and followed them into childhood said study author Linda LaGasse a clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Brown University School of Medicine Mothers prenatal use of methamphetamine over and above other bad things that cause trouble with children has an effect on behavior LaGasse said The stimulant drug is thought to be even more potent than cocaine because it lasts longer in the body she explained Methamphetamine goes right into the placenta and affects the brain she said The report appears online March  and in the April issue of  Dr James C Garbutt professor and medical director of the Alcohol  Substance Abuse Program at the University of North Carolina said that these data suggest that exposure to methamphetamine in utero might lead to   and this is something that needs to be noted and considered for future research This information is another reason for women and men to avoid methamphetamine or if addicted to become sober Garbutt said Of course there are many other reasons not to use methamphetamine including its serious consequences for physical and mental health and its overall destructive power for individuals and their families he added LaGasses team tested  children of mothers who used methamphetamine during pregnancy comparing them to  similar children who had not been exposed to the drug To determine that results were truly related to methamphetamine use and not other factors the researchers took into account tobacco alcohol and marijuana use among both groups of mothers Researchers also looked at the extent of their mothers methamphetamine use age and other environmental risk factors Childrens caregivers filled out a checklist that researchers used to assess behavior when they were  and again at age  At both assessments methamphetamineexposed children were more emotionally reactive that is nervous and disturbed by change as well as anxious and depressed LaGasse said By age  these children also showed signs of ADHD and other actingout behaviors Moreover children whose mothers were heavy methamphetamine users had both types of problems at both evaluations Dr Bruce Goldman director of substance abuse services at Zucker Hillside Hospital part of the North ShoreLIJ Health System in Glen Oaks NY commented on the study The finding is not overly surprising he said Its only commonsensical that with women who are using methamphetamine through pregnancy that there would be some longterm impact on their babies Thats   he said We need to reach out to women of childbearing age and help educate them about the longterm consequences of the continued use of methamphetamine during pregnancy Goldman said Children of drug abusers have a high lifetime risk of becoming substance abusers themselves  as much as four times higher he added The earlier intervention can start with these children the better chance of preventing these longterm consequences Goldman said Study author LaGasse agreed You have children who are already vulnerable coming into a household that may also be vulnerable and you see that by age  behavior is getting off normal LaGasse said These behaviors are worthy of addressing especially in highrisk families she said If nothing is done these are some of the kids who end up taking drugs as adolescents and having other problems Parents and teachers need to pay attention to these kids
