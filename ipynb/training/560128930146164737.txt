The color of your plate may influence how much you eat according to a  Cornell University   The researchers discovered that when a plate and the food on it had a low colorcontrast like pasta with Alfredo sauce on a white plate people at a buffet served themselves  more than when there was a higher colorcontrast like pasta with red sauce on a white plate or pasta with Alfredo sauce on a red plate The study conclusions suggest that if you want to eat less select plates that have a colorcontrast to the food youre eating for dinner Or if you want to eat more healthy foods like a bigger salad eat greens from a large green plate or bowl
