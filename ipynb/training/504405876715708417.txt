The hormone erythropoietin EPO could prevent brain injuries in very premature babies a study suggests Brain scans show EPO  used illegally by athletes to boost performance  may help infants when given after birth The study published in the   involved almost  babies born between  and  weeks in Switzerland The researchers are calling for wider trials of the hormone which is already given to some babies to treat anaemia Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells  Synthetic EPO is used to treat conditions such as anaemia where there are fewer red blood cells than normal It may also be given to premature babies to reduce the need for blood transfusions In the Swiss study a team at the University Hospital of Geneva found that premature infants had a reduced risk of brain injury as assessed by brain scans  when given three doses of EPO shortly after birth Babies given EPO had lower rates of injury to both the brains white matter  compared with  in the control group and the grey matter  versus  We found that the brains of the children who had received the treatment had much less damage than those in the control group who had been given a placebo said Dr Russia HaVinh Leuchter coresearcher of the study This is the first time that the beneficial effect of the EPO hormone on the brains of premature babies has been shown The researchers are calling for wider clinical trials of EPO to see if it may help protect the brains of premature babies in the critical weeks after birth Dr Jane Hawdon a consultant neonatologist at Barts Health NHS Trust who was not involved with the study said any treatment that may reduce long term problems in preterm babies warranted further review  We should note that the authors are not recommending immediate inclusion of this treatment into routine practice she said  It is also important to note that the majority of preterm babies do not sustain significant brain injury
