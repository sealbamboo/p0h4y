A new screening test for Downs syndrome is still not available across the Welsh NHS six years after guidelines said it should be In  the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE said all pregnant women should be offered the ultrasound scan and blood test But currently only patients in north Wales are offered screening The Welsh government said introducing the test across Wales had been challenging The guidelines recommended that all pregnant women are offered a combined ultrasound and blood test which identifies the risk of having a baby with a genetic condition caused by abnormal chromosomes including Downs syndrome Dr Bryan Beattie a consultant in foetal medicine at the University Hospital of Wales Cardiff said he expected the combined test to be rolled out across Wales from September to November He said It has been incredibly slow A lot of mothers who have given birth to a baby with Downs syndrome over the last six years would not have had an opportunity for a combined test The other even sadder thing is that some mothers unnecessarily miscarried a healthy baby after an amniocentesis  They would not have been wrongly flagged up as a high risk if they had had the combined test Jane Fisher director of Antenatal Results and Choices Arc said Were alarmed that its taking so long to roll out in Wales North Wales Conservative AM Antoinette Sandbach said While I am pleased for my constituents that finally the ultrasound test has been introduced in north Wales patients in the rest of Wales still face the same dilemma either to go private or face an outdated and far more invasive test on the NHS she said In a written answer to Ms Sandbach Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the screening was being introduced in a phased manner   Implementing this screening test is complex and has proved challenging for health boards he said  Mr Drakeford said the additional work required more from midwives obstetrics and radiology departments together with upgraded radiology information management system software   Downs syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from an extra copy of one chromosome This generally causes some level of learning disability and a range of distinctive physical features In the UK  babies are born with Downs syndrome each year and screening tests are available for pregnant women There are an estimated  people in the UK living with Downs syndrome There are two types of tests available on the NHS to test for conditions caused by a fault in a foetuss chromosomes The recommended test involves an ultrasound which measures the thickness of fluid at the back of the babys neck and is known as a nuchal transparency scan If the fluid is thicker than the norm it can be an indicator that the foetus has a chromosomal defect although not all higher readings will mean this At the same time a blood test is done measuring proteins in the mothers blood which are associated with pregnancy An abnormal level can also indicate problems This is carried out between  weeks and  weeks If the combined test is not done a woman can have a different blood test known as the quadruple test at between  weeks and  weeks Both types of test are combined with the mothers age to produce the individual chance of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality for example  in  The only two ways to diagnose Downs Syndrome and other genetic conditions is to either have a procedure known as chorionic villus samplin from  weeks or an amniocentesis test from  weeks both of which involve passing a needle into the womb and either removing a sample of the placenta or amniotic fluid
