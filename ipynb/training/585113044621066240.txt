Its a warm afternoon in Miami and yearold Emanuel Vega has come to Baptist Health Primary Care for a physical exam   shakes his hand with a welcoming smile Vega a strapping man with a thick black beard is feeling good but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should She even made the appointment It is free to him under his insurance policy with no copay as most preventive care is   Vega is one of   Americans who is taking part in a medical ritual  visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam But theres little evidence that these visits actually do any good for healthy adults Caruso listens to Vegas heart and lungs checks his pulse in his ankles and feels around his lymph nodes He also asks Vega about his exercise and sleeping schedule and orders blood and urine tests If everything checks out all right Caruso says Vega should return for another exam in a year Vega says he definitely will It was a positive experience for both doctor and patient But many other doctors think the annual physical is unnecessary and can even be harmful I would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical says   a primary care physician and professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School Patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong Mehrotra says or if its time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy He realizes popular opinion is against this view When I as a doctor say I do not advocate for the annual physical I feel like Im attacking moms and apple pie Mehrotra says It seems so intuitive and straightforward and its something thats been part of medicine for such a long time But he says randomized trials going all the way back to the s just dont support it The Society for General Internal Medicine even put annual physicals on   doctors should avoid completely for healthy adults One problem Mehrotra says is the cost Each visit usually costs insurers just  but with so many people getting them that adds up fast We estimate that its about   which is more than we spend as a society on breast cancer care Mehrotra says Its a lot of money Then theres the risk that a doctor will run a test and find a problem thats not actually there Its called a false positive and it can lead to a cascade of followup tests that can be expensive and could cause real harm   is another primary care physician and a health researcher at the Cleveland Clinic He tries to   I generally dont like to frighten people and I dont like to give them diseases they dont have Rothberg says I mostly tell my family if youre feeling well stay away from doctors If you get near them theyll start to look for things and order tests because thats what doctors do Back in Miami Caruso is also well versed in the research on annual physicals but he still believes in them I think having a look at somebody is worth its weight in gold he says Its an important part of developing a relationship with a patient he says and there have been countless times over his career when hes found real problems during an exam just like the one he gave to Emanuel Vega What if Mr Vega had had a lump or bump that wasnt right Caruso says What if when he had his shirt off Mr Vega said Oh yeah I forgot to mention this spot on my chest and it ended up being a melanoma we discovered early And Vega did end up needing a little help he has a bad back thats landed him in the emergency room several times Caruso was able to link him up with a back specialist to help him manage the problem
