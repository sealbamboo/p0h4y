I get up at am and get into work for am Its early but it gives me the chance to get through my paperwork in the morning and catch up on emails before all the patients come in After that most of my morning is spent in the outpatient clinic seeing people who have had a bone marrow transplant Its a busy clinic and normally Id see about seven or eight patients in a morning For people with leukaemia and other blood cancers and disorders their bone marrow transplant has given them a chance of life they would never have had but sometimes this can also come with some late effects which can vary hugely between patients Some are more straightforward so its just a case of checking in quickly Others are more complicated  their effects might be physical such as a condition called graft versus host GVH disease which can affect the gut lungs skin and other organs or even psychological or social issues around work education and finances Whatever their concerns and wherever they are in their journey I sit down with them to find out whats been going on and try to get them the help they need The issues people face immediately after a transplant are very different from those who are experiencing longerterm effects in the same way that young patients might have very different experiences from older patients so I tailor my support to the individual At two years posttransplant if someone is still having chronic issues it may have come to a point where this is going to be their life and its about supporting them through that realisation helping them to adjust to their change in lifestyle and find a new normality with the support they need On the other hand a month after a transplant ordinarily the patient would still be in hospital but were starting to see more recent recipients as outpatients  this could be because of advances in the supportive care theyre getting and the way were looking after them Im an honest and tactful person so I try to prepare people from the beginning for the journey ahead and let them know how we can help them Its not just about supporting patients and families through difficult times its also about educating and empowering them to look after themselves and getting their lives back on track We have a late effects clinic where patients attend for their annual checks and monitoring of their chronic GVH Part of my role is to ensure all post transplant patients get revaccinated and are closely monitored for potential longterm side effects of treatment such as osteoporosis and early menopause In the afternoon I go round visiting the inpatients Most of these patients are people who have been admitted for their transplant so they have no immediate problems but its good to introduce myself early and get that rapport so they know who I am after theyve been discharged I also catch up with the inpatients who have already had their transplants and who have been readmitted for complications One of my patients is currently in with GVH disease in his gut so he is struggling to eat or drink normally Another is here because he has fatigue caused by the transplant and is struggling at home so Ive been working with social services to get him into a nursing home Hes a prime example of why having this new posttransplant role is so vital in future Ill be able to identify these kinds of issues earlier so we can get a plan in place for the patient before their transplant Another patient has relapsed and we are now organising hospice care to make sure the patient and their family have comfortable dignified and highquality palliative care in these last weeks Because Im now in a dedicated posttransplant role it means we can have a more holistic personal approach to patients and the people around them Before   introduced the new posttransplant specialist role the nurses on the ward would have had to do all of this so of course there would be different nurses handling things according to what shift they were on I usually get home about pm when I get to have some time with my son Tom who is in year three at primary school before he goes to bed It can sound like a cliche but it really is a constant juggling act balancing family life and a busy career but Im so passionate about both I trained hard to become a nurse and its who I am but it isnt always easy Its worth it though  the way I see it we have a responsibility to be here for everyone throughout their journey Were keeping people alive which is incredible but the effects of the treatment affect their quality of life and its not good enough just to save a life and say our jobs done Weve got a commitment to see our patients through to the end of the journey and help them live their lives
