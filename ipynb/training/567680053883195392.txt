The USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service granted its approval  based on a final plant pest risk assessment that finds the GE genetically engineered apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the United States  and deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment The Food and Drug Administration is not required to approve genetically engineered crops for consumption Most companies engage in a voluntary safety review process with the FDA and Okanagan is doing that Scientists working on genetically engineered plants and animals typically add  rather than remove  genes to formulate more desirable variations of their products For example a GMO salmon engineered by AquaBounty Technologies is mostly Atlantic salmon  with a Pacific salmon gene added to make it grow faster plus an added eel gene to make it grow year round To create their Granny and Golden varieties Okanagan turned off an enzyme that causes apples to turn brown But what else did they turn off These are called nontarget effects and Im comfortable and confident this hasnt happened says Carter Weve had them in the ground and have been watching them grow for  years compiling data and statistics The trees produce flowers and fruit of the same composition and analysis as conventional apples But not everyone is convinced Mira and Jayson Calton the husbandandwife authors of Rich Food Poor Food   two years ago to Say NO to GMO Apples We sounded the alarm back in  and hoped people would understand what a slippery slope it is to have all of these foods that are genetically modified says Mira Calton Obviously we cant say without a doubt that GMOs are dangerous but we can say that not enough human studies have been done We dont want to be the guinea pigs This particular food is very upsetting because we give it to our children says Mira Calton Its the symbol of health here in America An apple a day keeps the doctor away  What you might not realize is that some genetically modified foods are likely part of your diet already In November the USDA approved a genetically engineered potato developed by the JR Simplot Company which uses a similar technique to prevent browning Still most of the genetically modified foods we eat are processed containing ingredients made from bioengineered corn or soybeans The majority of GMOs have been modified to fend off insects or survive being sprayed down with weedkillers but the benefits of these new apples are geared toward the consumer Where Carter sees apples that dont turn brown opening opportunities for more varied and prolonged use of the fruit the Caltons see a conundrum How will we be able to know when the apples have gone bad if theyre no longer turning brown Weve got some time to mull it over It takes two years to build a nursery and another two years to get fruit says Carter Were saying  acres of trees in the ground this spring will produce a small amount of fruit by fall  When that time comes Carter doesnt feel his company should be forced to use a GMO label Weve spent time and money on five years of regulatory work to prove and to demonstrate our product is as safe as any other he says Label it just like any other apple Well have information at the point of sale and were very transparent on our website Let the consumer decide
