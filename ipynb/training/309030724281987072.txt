Federal officials warned Tuesday that an especially dangerous group of superbugs has become a significant health problem in hospitals throughout the United States These germs known as carbapenemresistant   or   have become much more common in the last decade according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention And the risk they pose to health is becoming evident Whats called CRE are nightmare bacteria   director of the CDC tells Shots Theyre basically a triple threat First of all they are resistant to virtually all antibiotics including the ones doctors use as a lastditch option Second these bugs can transfer their invincibility to other bacteria The mechanism of resistance to antibiotics not only works for one bacteria but can be spread to others Frieden says Third the bacteria can be deadly Infection with the bacteria have a fatality rate as high as  percent Frieden says Although the resistant bacteria potentially pose a risk to anyone people whose immune systems are weaker such as elderly people children and people who have other health problems tend to be most susceptible to infection If the drugresistance starts to spread from bacteria that are usually a problem in hospitals to much more widespread causes of infections the risk could rise even more If it spread to things like   which is a common urinary tract infection it would be a very serious problem Frieden says The CDC sounded the alarm because of   that show the proportion of bacteria that have this resistance to many drugs has quadrupled in the last decade or so CRE cases were reported by  percent of hospitals in  up from about  percent from about a decade earlier according to the report In longterm care hospitals the situation is even worse  about  percent have reported cases the CDC says In addition the proportion of   bacteria that were resistant increased from  percent in  to  percent in  the CDC   And thats for the whole family says   the CDCs associate director for health careassociated infectionprevention programs When we look at one member of this family a bacteria called   which is the most common type of CRE that we see in the United States resistance there has gone from about  percent to over  percent So a dramatic increase in the frequency with which these organisms are being seen in our hospitals in the United States Infectious disease specialist   of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at the HarborUCLA Medical Center likens the situation to the Titanics illfated voyage Were not talking about an iceberg thats down the line he says The ship has hit the iceberg Were taking on water We already have people dying Not only of CRE but of untreatable CRE So far these infections are still relatively rare And they have been seen only in hospitals The big fear is that theyll start to move out of hospitals and into the communities around them If CRE spreads out of hospitals and into communities thats when the ship is totally underwater and we all drown Spellberg says To prevent that from happening the CDC and others are calling on hospitals to contain CRE We can nip this in the bud But its going to take a lot of effort on the part of hospitals Frieden says The first thing hospitals need to do is test patients to see if they have these bugs The basic steps are finding patients with CRE and making sure they are isolated so that they dont spread it to others Frieden says That includes commonsense things like keeping them away from other patients and sterilizing everything they come into contact with We know that this can stop outbreaks It has helped in Florida Its helped in other countries Frieden says And the good news about this is that it still hasnt spread so widely that we cant stop it And doctors have to use antibiotics more carefully to prevent more germs from developing into dangerous superbugs
