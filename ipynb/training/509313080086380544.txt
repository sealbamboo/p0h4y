Dr Paul H Crandall a UCLA neurosurgeon who pioneered now widely used techniques for diagnosing the source of epileptic seizures in the brain and removing the offending cells died March  from complications of pneumonia at Santa MonicaUCLA Medical Center He was     Crandall who founded the UCLA Department of Neurosurgery was the father of UCLAs epilepsy program Dr Neil Martin the current chairman of neurosurgery at UCLAs Geffen School of Medicine said in a statement His clinical work laid the foundation for our current strategies to treat epileptic seizures and his scientific research informs neurosurgeons treatment of epilepsy today    Epilepsy can be treated with drugs in about  of cases Surgeons have been attempting to cure other seizures with brain surgery since at least the late th century but doctors often removed massive amounts of tissue without having any understanding of where in the brain the seizures were actually originating    Researchers in France had attempted to implant electrodes in the brain to record brain activity during seizures but the electrodes were left in only during the operation itself and provided only minimal information    Crandall and Dr Richard Walter then head of neurology at UCLA perfected the ability to implant electrodes in the brains of epileptic patients and leave them for extended periods Beginning in the early s patients were brought into the laboratory each day and hooked up to an EEG machine that recorded electrical impulses on paper strips producing mounds of paper But the researchers failed to capture any seizures    Crandall happened to be watching one of NASAs early Gemini orbital missions on television when he heard mission control announce the astronauts heart rate Intrigued he called NASA and asked how they did it He was told that the agency used a newly opened FM radio band putting several channels of information on an FM frequency that was then beamed back to Earth He immediately asked for one of the devices    After nearly two years of negotiations NASA sent him an FM telemetry device which allowed him to hook up a patients brain electrodes to a small transmitter The signal was then recorded on a reeltoreel tape recorder allowing hour monitoring Crandall captured his first seizure in  Later the team added video recording to correlate patient behavior with brain activity    By embedding the electrodes at the same sites in every patient Crandalls team was able to gradually focus on groups of cells where abnormal activity was occurring allowing removal of the cells and mitigating seizures And by removing clumps of cells intact researchers were able to study in the laboratory how interactions of the cells produced seizures    His team developed the protocol and the nomenclature that is still used by neurosurgeons to treat epilepsy Phase  a normal EEG with surface electrodes to diagnose epilepsy Phase  use of implanted electrodes to localize affected cells and Phase  surgical removal of the cells    His contribution is not just what he found but also the approach of how to go about doing this said Dr Gary Mathern a UCLA professor of neurosurgery    Paul Herbert Crandall was born Feb   in Essex Junction Vt the youngest of seven children He received his bachelors degree from the University of Vermont in  then joined the US Army where he was chosen to attend medical school receiving his medical degree from Vermont in  After a residency at the University of Chicago he rejoined the Army Medical Corps in  serving two years as chief of neurosurgery at a military hospital in Frankfurt Germany    In  he arrived at UCLA where he was one of three founding members of the neurosurgery division which was upgraded to a department in  He retired in  but continued his research    Crandall served on the US Department of Healths National Commission for Epilepsy from  to  Because his work had demonstrated the value of longterm monitoring of seizures and of his procedures for managing difficult cases the commission recommended the establishment of specialized epilepsy centers in major urban areas a recommendation that was subsequently implemented    His work also helped extend surgery to children for controlling seizures    In  Crandall performed surgery on yearold Alfonsina Nina Davies whose parents had searched futilely for a cure for her severe epilepsy The surgery halted the seizures and Nina completed college earning a doctoral degree in education and becoming an assistant superintendent for the Santa Ana Unified School District Unfortunately she died in  of a condition known as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy a rare outcome of the disease    In October  her parents Thomas and Nadia Davies donated  million to UCLA for epilepsy research endowing a chair in Crandalls honor    Crandall is survived by his wife Barbara a UCLA professor emeritus of pediatrics and genetics four children and three grandchildren
