The health challenge left in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan is vast and daunting  As well as clearing dead bodies and responding to the immediate injuries and trauma there are many regular health needs to be met  Its expected that  babies will be born this month in the affected areas  People with illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease will need to get their regular medication even though many transport routes have been destroyed With tens of thousands of people now homeless there is mounting concern that crowded living conditions and contaminated drinking water could lead to outbreaks of infectious diseases The peak danger period for this is between  days and one month after the event according to the World Health Organization  Unsafe food and a lack of access to safe water lack of facilities for personal hygiene and safe sanitation arrangements all create a breading ground for infections such as cholera  With another tropical storm expected to hit the Philippines later this week the need for shelter safe water and sanitation is critical  WHO is working with other humanitarian organisations to secure urgently needed water purification tablets Special diarrhoeal disease kits with medicines and supplies to treat  cases of acute diarrhoea are also en route  contaminated water is a frequent cause of diarrhoea  Medicines and supplies to cover the basic health needs of  people for a month have been deployed  And work has begun to strengthen an early warning system that can rapidly detect disease outbreaks and other public health threats WHO says the next steps will be critical  It is how the survivors rather than the dead are managed that determines if and when an epidemic may occur There has never been a documented case of an epidemic occurring after a natural disaster that could be traced to exposure to dead bodies  Providing the most basic of needs  safe food clean water medicine and shelter  is what will make the difference now
