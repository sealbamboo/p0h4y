If youre a parent youve probably heard remarks like this during dinner I dont like milk My toast is burnt I hate vegetables I took a bite already Whats for dessert It can be daunting trying to ensure a healthy diet for our children So its no wonder parents often resort to dinner time rules In our new poll with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health  percent of families tell their children to eat everything on their plate and  percent report setting restrictions on the types of foods eaten Increasingly common are rules like clean your plate as well as newer strictures such as no second helpings of potatoes no dessert until you eat your vegetables and sodas and chips only on special occasions This is all wellmeant advice But does it work   who directs the   at Yale University says No By demanding that children eat things like vegetables before they have a dessert it makes it seem like theres something wrong with eating vegetables and that you have to swallow medicine before you get to the good part Brownell says Not only that but rules like this can backfire according to   a registered dietitian at Texas Childrens Hospital and a spokesperson with the   Some of the   have shown us that when they were put in a situation where somebody is saying finish this or finish that the kids actually had more negative responses and actually consumed   of the food than the kids who didnt have that reinforcement of you need to finish  The better option King says is creative negotiation Take for example what she calls Try It Tuesdays On a Try It Tuesday parents along with their children pick out a new food to sample It helps to involve the kids in preparing the dish as well she says This investment in the new food increases the likelihood that the child will try it and even enjoy it If they still say no King suggests nothankyou bites  something her friends made up for their yearold daughter It goes like this The child just has to take a bite and if she doesnt like it she can say no thank you and thats that But typically in this family the no thank you turns into a thank you as the yearold watches her parents eating and enjoying the food You see her little hand reach across to the fork and it kind of goes over into the vegetable King says The next thing you know you turn around and shes eaten the entire vegetable And it turns out  as with most other behaviors  your kids are watching you King says I had a parent who came into clinic not too long ago and I said OK whats our goal for being here today And he looked at me and said Make him eat vegetables And my question back was Well do you eat vegetables And his answer was No I dont like them  Dad mentioned he loved grilling so King suggested he try that with vegetables By their next visit hed become an avid veggie griller Zucchini and squash and carrots and eggplants and onions and tomatoes  you name it he was grilling it says King Its a dietitians dream  getting an entire family involved in eating more healthy foods As for dessert Yale Universitys Brownell says theres nothing wrong with an occasional treat That doesnt mean that the only options are things high in sugar or fat or salt There can be wonderful combinations of things like sorbet sherbet fruits  things like that can make outstanding desserts and be really good for people Some parents worry that having only healthy foods at home will lead kids to overdo it with junk food when they head off to college But Brownell says theres no evidence to support this worry And in fact the reverse is probably true Even if the young adults indulge in unhealthy foods at first theyre far more likely to return to the healthy foods they grew up with Having only good foods around the house makes all the sense in the world and research supports this he says So Brownell says fill your kitchen with healthy food dont buy junk food and watch what   eat Your kids will follow your lead
