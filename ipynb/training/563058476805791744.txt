Bucking the emerging belief that females are more vulnerable to concussion a new study finds that irrespective of the severity of initial concussive symptoms girls and women whove suffered mild traumatic brain injury recover faster than do boys and men In a group of  men with concussions who were tracked tested and brainscanned immediately after their diagnoses and followed until they were fully recovered the average time to symptom resolution was  days with a median of  days Among the  female patients with concussions the average recovery time was  days with a median of  days While subjects in the study ranged from  to  years old the average age of male and female subjects did not differ significantly and neither did the severity of their earliest postinjury symptoms The principal difference between the genders was the speed with which they were able to shake off such problems as headaches dizziness irritability or concentration or memory difficulties The gender difference that appears to play a crucial role in concussion recovery lies at the heart of the brain in the uncinate fasciculus a hookshaped bundle of neural cables that connect the brains primitive limbic system with its seat of higher reasoning the frontal lobes In female subjects who sustained blows to the head a brainscanning technique called diffusion tensor imaging revealed that the uncinate fasciculus was far less likely to be stretched torn and frayed than was the case in male subjects with concussions Male or female a subject whose uncinate fasciculus showed clear signs of shearing was in for a longer recovery time the researchers found But even with concussive symptoms just as extreme braininjured females were less likely than their injured male peers to show such damage The researchers also compared the integrity of the concussion victims uncinate fasciculi with that of a control group of healthy subjects In concussed males that bundle of connective tissue was dramatically more torn and frayed than it was in healthy controls comparing that tissues integrity in healthy female control subjects with concussed women they saw little differerence Past research has suggested that when women suffer concussions they initially report more symptoms than do men But scientists have long suspected that progesterone a female reproductive hormone believed to protect the brain during stroke or injury should make women more resilient after concussions than are men Observational studies that have relied on subjective reports have yielded inconsistent results on which sex fared better The current study published in the journal   appears to be among the first to offer an objective measure of concussion injury that bypasses social expectations and subjective reports It zeroes in on the most promising means of gauging such injury  by diffusion tensor imaging And it give physicians trying to predict a patients prognosis a specific place in the brain  the uncinate fasciculus  to look for injury While researchers have been focusing increasingly on white matter as a measure of concussion injury there are many such tracts to assess The potential of DTI to predict outcome after concussion has great clinical impact said study author Dr Saeed Fakhran of the University of Pennsylvania Currently we are heavily reliant on patient reporting and patients may have ulterior motives such as wanting to get back to play he added But you cant trick a magnetic resonance scanner
