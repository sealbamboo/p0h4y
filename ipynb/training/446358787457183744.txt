It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster Villains bent on chaos set their sights on a food company  an easy target  with plans to lace its products with a chemical or pathogen The hero finds out in time to save the day Sound farfetched Not according to US regulators who have been pondering such scenarios Under   from the Food and Drug Administration food processors and manufacturers  both domestic and companies abroad that ship food to the US  would need to take steps to mitigate a potential terrorist attack Few documented incidents of malicious food contamination exist though which raises the question Is food terrorism fact or fiction In the aftermath of Sept  the US government spent years and billions of dollars fortifying various industries against possible terrorist attacks And since then the United States has seen its fair share of terrorist attacks including the April  Boston Marathon bombing While the food system has remained relatively untouched weve certainly studied it since  to assess what the potential impacts might be says Don Kraemer deputy director of the FDAs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition And they can be catastrophic he says The FDA rules   in food processing and manufacturing in an attempt to ferret out where the vulnerabilities exist The rules mostly apply to facilities in charge of bulk storage or handling of liquids for human consumption  think dairy plants where milk is stored in big vats Another area of concern Facilities like large industrial bakeries where lots of ingredients are mixed together A lot of food processing manufacturers dont practice rigid biosecurity says   a terrorism analyst with the Rand Corp a policy think tank Many food companies fail to take even the most basic precaution he says Owners dont padlock warehouses or engage in sufficient surveillance Or they hire a lot of transient workers without performing background checks So actually introducing a contaminant  salmonella botulism mercury  into the food chain would not be particularly difficult Chalk says The weak links though havent really been tested The last big bioterrorist attack in the US happened in  in The Dalles Ore Thats when members of a cult infected salad bars with salmonella more than  people were sickened Since then the American food system has grappled more with unintentional outbreaks like the   that killed  people in  Would the FDAs proposed rules keep us safe Chalk says the vulnerabilities go well beyond whats covered in the proposal Producers could be at risk as well he says It would be relatively easy to deal a devastating blow to the countrys livestock industry with a virus in a vial An act of agroterrorism like that keeps some food experts up at night If a terrorist wanted to deal a devastating economic blow to the US all it would take is a calculated release of footandmouth disease on the nations livestock Unintentional outbreaks in Europe and South America have haunted economies there as trade is shut down and whole herds are culled to quarantine the disease The impact of a deliberate outbreak in the US could be huge One risk assessment from the Department of Homeland Security found that if a pathogen like footandmouth disease were let loose among Great Plains ranchers total damages could exceed  billion Exports and trade could be cut off and consumer demand would very likely take a huge hit When US troops raided an alQaida storehouse in Afghanistan in  they found   to deal a blow to the US economy Still no attack has materialized in the  years since Agriculture is critical infrastructure in a country says Keith Roehr Colorados state veterinarian How would we eradicate the disease We dont know  We know there would be steps we would take Do we know exactly what these would be No we dont Yet few livestock owners consider their operations targets of terrorism Roehr says And that mindset could leave them vulnerable Experts suspect that the bigger reason the US has avoided a largescale attack on food and farms is that an attack like that doesnt carry the same weight as a suicide bombing or mass shooting It lacks a visible point for the media to latch on to except for the possible images of burning cows Chalk says Really it doesnt have the same blood lust appeal of carrying out a suicide attack in a shopping mall Still its a risk that government regulators want the food industry to consider more seriously in case what seems like a grisly fiction turns into reality
