Just over a year ago Medicare quality improvement organizations QIOs across the country began a practice known as immediate advocacy These governmentfinanced organizations have long   and other facilities or who had serious complaints about the quality of medical care But these complaints often took months to investigate and resolve Now for issues that dont require a review of medical records staff at a state QIO will listen to a seniors concerns get in touch with the health care provider and try to work out a solution within a matter of hours or days That can be a godsend for older adults or caregivers who get the brushoff when they try to get a provider to respond to a problem  When the QIO calls action usually follows There are    Dr Adrienne Mims president of the American Health Quality Association which represents QIOs and medical director of Alliant GMCF the QIO in Georgia recalled the case of a woman in her late s who needed physical therapy for a back injury she suffered during a car accident She didnt have a car and could only get a ride to the physical therapists practice in the morning Dr Mims said  But office staff refused to give her an appointment before noon they said that time was reserved for people with private insurance This woman called us and our nurse reached out to the provider Dr Mims remembered   She asked Are you discriminating against a certain portion of the population And that question was enough They made arrangements to see her in the morning after that QIOs dont have legal authority to require medical providers to comply with their recommendations But we serve as a convener and we do have the authority to have these conversations said Patricia Merryweather executive director of Telligen the QIO in Illinois and Iowa  If a provider refuses to engage in discussions it moves to the complaint phase Complaints require that a hospital doctor and other provider make available medical records which are reviewed by an independent expert   If the allegations in a complaint are confirmed the QIO will contact the provider and propose a quality improvement plan  For instance a hospital may be asked to examine why wrong medications were ordered for a patient and to put in place a system that will prevent it from happening again  Or a nursing home may be asked to conduct extra training for aides if the QIO finds that patients with bed sores arent being turned and repositioned every few hours contrary to recommended best practices What we wont do is take an institutions license away or try to shut down a facility or help someone who intends to sue over a medical problem said Nancy Borgstadt director of review services for CFMC Colorados QIO In other words the problem you experienced may lead to improved care for other patients who come after you but it may not make things right for you  If thats your goal you may want to pursue other alternatives to the QIO complaint process The most   in New York gives a sense of the kinds of concerns these organizations handle   Of  complaints brought to the organization between Aug   and July  the largest number  had to do with a failure to develop appropriate treatment plans for patients while  dealt with the failure to deliver accurate diagnoses or medical assessments Altogether  percent of complaints were substantiated by independent reviewers Of that group the failure to document in the medical record items affecting patient care was the most common substantiated complaint  percent followed by the failure to coordinate care across disciplines  percent and the failure to appropriately assess or act on laboratory or imaging results  percent
