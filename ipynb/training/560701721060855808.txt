The idea that American women would benefit by having fewer mammograms  and having them less frequently  remains controversial A new study tries to help women and their doctors understand why less can be more when it comes to breast cancer screening The US Preventive Services Task Force was pilloried for   that doctors were ordering too many mammograms to screen their patients for breast cancer So far the expert panel hasnt changed many minds But in the fourplus years since that controversial recommendation   have   A   in Wednesdays edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn should help women and their doctors understand why screening mammograms arent the cureall that many people take them to be In fact after reviewing hundreds of studies on mammograms published since  the study authors conclude that the benefits of the test are routinely overstated while the harms are understated Yes mammograms do save lives when used to screen women for breast cancer but the benefit is modest write Drs Lydia Pace and Nancy Keating both physicians at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston To understand the imperfect nature of screening mammograms they suggest that doctors emphasize these points to their patients Some cancers will be missed and some women will die of breast cancer regardless of whether they are screened Many cancers will be found but most women diagnosed with breast cancer will be cured regardless of whether the cancer was found by a mammogram Some cancers that are found would have never caused problems That last point refers to a problem known as overdiagnosis A woman who has been overdiagnosed is treated for breast cancer through some combination of surgery radiation and chemotherapy  and by definition none of that treatment is necessary Based on the most recent studies available Pace and Keating estimate that about  of women diagnosed with breast cancer fall into this category The problem they acknowledge is that theres no way to tell which patients are properly diagnosed and which are overdiagnosed Thats why all of them get treated In the JAMA article Pace and Keating recommend that doctors share some statistics to help their patients understand the benefits of mammography which vary by age If  women were to get regular mammograms throughout their s about five of them would be saved from dying of breast cancer If those women were in their s about  of them would avoid death and if they were in their s about  would avoid death They also recommend that doctors tell their patients If you do decide to have a mammogram you can anticipate that you will have at least one falsepositive finding for which you are called back for additional images and perhaps a biopsy Most of these findings are false alarms Instead of fighting about mammograms it would be more useful to focus on the fact that better breast cancer screening tests are needed especially ones that could identify the cancers that are harmless and dont require treatment Pace and Keating conclude In   that accompanies the study two more physicians  Dr Joann Elmore of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Dr Barnett Kramer of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Md  are more blunt in their critique of mammograms as a tool to screen for breast cancer The benefit of mammography is less than once hoped and the potential harms are greater than anticipated Most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not die of the disease even if their tumors are detected without mammography they write However many women diagnosed with latestage disease who were not screened recently wrongly blame themselves encouraging others not to make the same mistake Others attribute their survival to screening mammograms received even when this is unlikely to be the case Indeed breast cancer awareness campaigns have made women feel obligated to get mammograms as often as possible Doctors are part of the problem too since they order nearly  billion worth of the tests each year In a survey of patients published in   of women recalled their doctor discussing the benefits of mammography but only  said their doctor mentioned the drawbacks Elmore and Kramer note    and like   on Facebook
