Meiler of Shelburne Vermont and more than  other seniors are taking their athletic prowess to Cleveland this weekend for the  National Senior Games CNN spoke with Meiler about her love of the long jump her favorite world record and why other people thinks shes well a little nuts The following is an edited version of that interview  Have you been active your whole life or is this a new development Oh I think Ive been pretty active but more active since I took up track and field at age  Believe it or not Im more active now  How did you get into the sport so late  I was playing tennis  singles doubles and mixed doubles with my husband  for the senior Olympics and my training partner now Barbara Jordan came over and said We need people in track and field desperately and I think you would be good at it  And I said Well dont look at me Ive never done track in my life She said When youre done your tennis come over and try the long jump So thats what I did  and I fell in love with it immediately The year afterwards I competed for the first time in track and field and I did the long jump I came in fourth out of  women And in the high jump I tied for third Dont you think that didnt motivate me laughs For being a track and field person for the first time So that got me going And my training partner is a real gogetter and very hard worker We both have broken all kinds of US and world records We challenge each other  but if one wins gets a better score its fine Were always in agreement and were always good friends What is it about track and field that you like  Track and field is very challenging My training partner she excels more in the  and  sprints and stuff I like the pole vault and the hurdles  theyre more challenging for me  What do you like about pole vaulting  People think Im a little nuts I think laughs I was  when I first took it up I was at a senior meet and I saw some ladies doing it and it didnt look like they were going very high I always like challenges and I said Boy this looks like a real good challenge for me Thats why I took it up Its the most difficult sport and its also the most challenging Its the most rewarding I think  Believe it or not in the womens andover group I have the world record I have that under my belt and that is a fantastic feeling The height was  and a quarter but Ive done  before Not too bad  That must take a lot of upperbody strength  Its mostly upper core You have to have a strong upper core and very strong arms because all the strength is in your arms and the upper part of your body  Whats your training schedule like  On Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I do a lot of track Some days we will do meter sprints then we will increase to  meters Then well go up to  meters several times Then we might do a few meter runs We change our training daytoday On Wednesday we might practice our hurdles  Barb doesnt do a lot of the throwing events and I do so on some other days Ill do the shot put Like this morning I did my javelin few times and then I did my hammer And I only took up hammer maybe four years ago but I really enjoy it And then my discus  I really enjoy discus too  On Tuesdays and Thursdays Ill do weights with the machines And I play tennis also And do some pushups at home  theyre the womens pushups not the mens pushups  It takes a lot of training You have to be very very devoted Whats the hardest part about keeping up with it  In the wintertime when its about  degrees outside and youre underneath the covers and you say Oh Id love to sleep in for another couple hours But I know that my training partner is waiting  and I cant not go I have to be there  Were very fortunate that we can train together I always recommend that if someone wants to take up new sport or any other activity they should do it with a friend because it is so much more enjoyable because you help each other You encourage each other  Are there any events you dont particularly like  Im not too keen on doing the  and meter runs  but I do them all Sometimes I do the pentathlon and thats five events You have to do that in two days Thats quite hectic  Barbara and I and two other girls from the US at the  world meet in Sacramento we set a world record in the x relay so that was quite an accomplishment  You have so many Whats your favorite record  I really enjoyed getting the world record in the meter hurdles in Albuquerque New Mexico It was an indoor meet I barely beat my training partner laughs We were neck and neck  What is your diet like What do you eat to stay healthy and active I take a healthy nutrition shake every morning Its made with orange juice and its got all good nutrients in it And then I just eat a regular lunch and dinner I eat almost anything and I do cheat once in a while I do like those French fries once in a while laughs  I have a downfall for chocolatecovered almonds I watch my weight When I gain  pounds and I can tell on me right away and I dont feel comfortable   What advice would you give to other seniors out there who might want to try something new I keep telling them that its never too late If I can take up track and field at  anybody can take up another sport at age  and up I recommend anyone who really looks at wanting to be healthy they have to get going get off the couch One of the recommendations I have been mentioning is go to their senior center My friends go for yoga and there are a lot of other things they offer If they really want to improve or do something more athletic the center will have the resources to help them find what they should do and how safe it can be  Speaking of safety have you ever been injured on the field Oh Ive had a few injuries Ive had a few hamstring pulls But with a couple visits to the physical therapist I heal very quickly I think its because Im in such good physical condition  The more severe one I got was splitting my knee open on the barrier when I was doing the steeplechase I got maybe a dozen stitches there But I healed up within a couple weeks and I was right back doing the same thing Youre a little hesitant though after you get  stitches You say Uh oh you better be careful
