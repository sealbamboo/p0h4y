When it comes to the best way to brush your teeth experts do not agree British researchers surveyed  dental association guidelines in the United States Britain Japan and seven other countries searched the dental literature for studies recorded information by toothbrush manufacturers and read  dental textbooks searching for advice on how how long and how often to brush The review   found no randomized trials of brushing technique and very little agreement on how to go about cleaning teeth Some sources like the American Dental Association recommended the Bass technique  holding the brush at a degree angle to the gum and making very short backandforth movements Others preferred the Fones technique which requires large sweeping circles over the teeth with the toothbrush at right angles to the tooth surface  At least three other variations were suggested by other sources Some said to brush for two minutes some for two to three and others for at least three minutes Some experts said twice a day others said three times at least Despite all the techniques described by experts theres no evidence to suggest that any of them is more effective than a simple scrub said the lead author John Wainwright a dentist in Doncaster England Expert opinion is worth something but its low on the hierarchy of evidence
