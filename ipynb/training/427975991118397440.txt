Exposure to a once widely used pesticide DDT may increase the chances of developing Alzheimers disease suggest US researchers A study published in JAMA Neurology showed patients with Alzheimers had four times as much DDT lingering in the body as healthy people  Some countries still use the pesticide to control malaria Alzheimers Research UK said more evidence was needed to prove DDT had a role in dementia  DDT was a massively successful pesticide initially used to control malaria at the end of World War Two and then to protect crops in commercial agriculture However there were questions about its impact on human health and wider environmental concerns particularly for predators It was banned in the US in  and in many other countries But the World Health Organization still   to keep malaria in check DDT also lingers in the human body where it is broken down into DDE The team at Rutgers University and Emory University tested levels of DDE in the blood of  people with Alzheimers disease and compared the results with  healthy people of a similar age and background The results showed those with Alzheimers had  times the level of DDE However the picture is not clearcut Some healthy people had high levels of DDE while some with Alzheimers had low levels Alzheimers also predates the use of DDT The researchers believe the chemical is increasing the chance of Alzheimers and may be involved in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain a hallmark of the disease which contribute to the death of brain cells  Prof Allan Levey the director of the Alzheimers Disease Research Centre at Emory said This is one of the first studies identifying a strong environmental risk factor for Alzheimers disease The magnitude of the effect is strikingly large it is comparable in size to the most common genetic risk factor for lateonset Alzheimers Fellow researcher Dr Jason Richardson added We are still being exposed to these chemicals in the United States both because we get food products from other countries and because DDE persists in the environment for a long time  Dr Simon Ridley the head of research at the charity Alzheimers Research UK said Its important to note that this research relates to DDT a pesticide that has not been used in the UK since the s  While this small study suggests a possible connection between DDT exposure and Alzheimers we dont know whether other factors may account for these results  Much more research would be needed to confirm whether this particular pesticide may contribute to the disease
