Jane Fonda has led many public lives Theres Fonda the antiwar activist Fonda the fitness enthusiast grapevining her way across a studio in a tiny leotard and tights and Fonda the actress who has starred in more than  films Now the yearold Renaissance woman has added to her rsum by releasing the sixth in a series of home workout DVDs geared toward baby boomers Jane Fonda Prime Time AMPM Yoga for Beginners features several short yoga workouts to be done in the morning and the evening Fonda talks about what inspired her to make the DVD and how she thinks yoga can help her generation be as fit as possible as they enter their golden years This is a yoga DVD for beginners and older people who have to move slower and cant turn themselves into pretzels like I used to be able to do I wanted to make a video that I could do with a couple of minute segments for the morning and a couple for the afternoon I started my new Prime Time label about three years ago and Ive done about six DVDs so far There was a gap in what I had touched on I hadnt done yoga and this is kind of yoga marinated in Pilates rather than pure yoga Yoga is good for everybody But staying flexible and strong  because yoga also makes you strong  is part of the threelegged stool of fitness strength aerobic capacity and flexibility Those are critical components and theyre particularly good for older people because they help with healthy joints and bones A lot of the DVDs that are out there are just too hard In fact the demographic that Im addressing is left out of most exercise programs that are put out on DVDs these days I would say the No  most important thing for healthy aging is to stay physically active and thats why I decided to make a video for boomers I started when I was in my s I started with Ashtanga yoga and I did it for about four years until I dreaded it and then I moved to Iyengar I cant do everything I used to do but I lift weights I do aerobics and I do this video Ive been doing yoga longer than Ive been meditating I work with a woman who is extremely experienced in teaching older people I wanted to be with someone who has a lot of experience who knows what is good and safe and popular for older people Each minute segment is a very wellorganized wellcoordinated series of movements I think its important to do one minute workout in the morning and one at night The DVDs also ensure that you work all different parts of the body Now I do about a halfhour of fitness and resistance training a day Sometimes its with weights sometimes its with a band Then I do about  minutes of walking and cardiovascular exercise I also do this video
