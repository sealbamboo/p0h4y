About  years ago when I was codirector of the Noninvasive Cardiology Laboratory at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach performing heart ultrasounds and exercise stress tests I got a call from an internist who told me that one of his patients had just suffered a   He was puzzled because this patient had recently passed an exercise stress testadministered by me I was very upset by this news and rechecked the test results to see if I had made any mistakes After careful review I couldnt find any errors in my analysis The   was normal and the patient had shown excellent exercise capacity I remember feeling very frustrated We were working with the best technology available yet it wasnt good enough to detect a heart attack that was only weeks away Today we do have other noninvasive tests that are much better at predicting the likelihood of a future heart attack A normal stress test does not mean there arent any potentially lethal soft plaques growing inside the lining of your coronary   that could rupture and cause a heart attack at any time All it means is that the blood flow to your heart was fine on the day you took the test Unfortunately that doesnt mean that the blood flow will still be fine tomorrow Recently I was at a dinner party when another guest upon hearing that I was a cardiologist turned to me and said My friend just passed his annual physical with f lying colors Two days later he had a heart attack How could this happen Im sorry to say that I hear stories like this almost as often today as I did  years ago The fact is back then we had an excuse We didnt know any better Today we do We know that someone can look great on paper  pass a standard exercise stress test with f lying colors have good cholesterol scores and never have had a sick day in his or her life  but still have arteries that are a diseased and potentially lethal mess Today we have access to cuttingedge diagnostic tests that can identify these highrisk people early enough to prevent them from having heart attacks in the first place The problem is that many patients destined for heart problems dont get the benefit of our most accurate tests including presidents of the United States Many seemingly perfectly healthy people are suddenly getting heart attacks because their arteries are   perfectly healthy and they dont know it With the proper noninvasive tests these diseased arteries would have been identified and the heart attacks wouldnt have happened Learn more in the Everyday Health
