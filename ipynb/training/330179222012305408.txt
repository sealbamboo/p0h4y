Sofia Vergara is among the most recognizable women in Hollywood  an Emmynominated actress and star of the hit ABC television show Modern Family But one of the roles she is lesser known for is that of cancer survivor Ms Vergara had her thyroid removed and underwent radioactive iodine therapy at the age of  after discovering she had thyroid cancer Now  she takes medication daily to control the symptoms of hypothyroidism She recently became the face of a new campaign   which promotes screening for thyroid disease and encourages those who have it to play an active role in their treatment About  million Americans have some form of thyroid disease  most of them women  though an estimated   Recently we caught up with Ms Vergara to ask her about her approach to diet and exercise How did cancer affect your outlook on health and fitness When it first happened it was very scary I went into shock I was  and I wasnt smoking I wasnt doing many things that are unhealthy You start thinking What are the things that give you cancer And you get really paranoid of everything I thought from now on Im going to eat everything organic everything healthy everything different I was doing shots of spinach It was insane But then after the first three months you realize that you cant live your life like this because its exhausting Some studies suggest that physical activity improves quality of life for people who have had the disease Do you work out and if so how often Now that Im older I work out more I try to do something at least three times a week if Im not working Whats your typical workout routine I have a trainer and I train with him when Im in LA But I dont really like to get obsessed with it I do it when I can Sometimes I work out with my trainer or I do spinning or Pilates Do you have trouble fitting exercise into your life because of your schedule Yes I do Especially for someone like me who doesnt enjoy exercise For me its punishment Its not like Oh let me relax and go to the gym Its not my me time or my fun time No Its my torture time So of course I try to avoid it or make excuses every time But I do try to do it at least three times a week if Im not shooting I wish I loved it Believe me I wish Do you follow a special diet No Im very lucky I love healthy eating I love fish I love eating vegetables and I love salads But I also love desserts So I try to eat everything but in moderation My hobby is to go out to dinner to different places I try to eat healthy during the day so that when I go to dinner I can kind of eat whatever I want I dont go too crazy during the week But on the weekends I completely order whatever I want I especially love sushi and I love Middle Eastern food Has your approach to exercise changed over time and if so in what ways Well now I have accepted that its good for me for my health and for antiaging When I was in Colombia there wasnt a culture of working out for women I dont remember any woman in my family ever going to the gym So I started late when I moved to the United States and I think it does make a difference You see it in women my age who work out and in women who dont work out You see the difference physically Is there anything youd like to change or improve about your fitness routine I wish I could be more passionate about it because when I dont have a trainer I sabotage myself I just dont know how to push myself I need somebody to push me to be able to do it I wish I had that more Does your trainer give you specific things to do or is he just there for motivation He has to force me and put me inside the machines But I try to manipulate the situation or Ill try to answer my phone and tell him its an emergency Whats your advice for people trying to build more regular exercise into their life I think its important to accept that its part of modern life  that its been proven that it helps you with everything Its going to improve the way you look the way you feel the way you age everything If there are women out there like me who dont love it you have to make a conscious decision to do it if you want to age well and live longer
