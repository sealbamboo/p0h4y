Want to know how many people have signed up for private insurance under Obamacare Like the health care law itself the answer is complicated The Obama administration is tracking the number of plans purchased on HealthCaregov and on the state exchanges and this month reported that it had exceeded expectations by signing up   people In addition federal officials have said that  million people have enrolled in Medicaid this year But whats often overlooked is that enrollment in private health plans outside the marketplaces is also booming The federal government hasnt been counting the number of people who buy new plans directly from insurance carriers  and that number could be substantial When Alaskan insurance broker Joshua Weinstein wanted to sign someone up for health insurance this year he asked one key question  would they qualify for a federal subsidy If they did it was worth signing them up through HealthCaregov to make sure they got that substantial reduction in their monthly premium But if they made too much money to qualify for subsidy he says he steered them away from HealthCaregov If you can avoid that whole level of bureaucracy and get a good plan  not necessarily at a good price but at the same price  and theyre not eligible for a subsidy were going off the marketplace Weinstein says One of those clients is Oliver Korshin of Anchorage Weinstein and Korshin worked together to enroll Korshins wife Rachel in a new health plan She didnt qualify for a subsidy so they went directly to the insurance firm   The actual enrolling wasnt difficult at all Korshin says Weinstein estimates that about  percent of his clients are signing up for insurance outside the exchanges He says enrolling directly with insurers is easier because they dont need the financial information thats required on HealthCaregov With private insurance companies signing up means basically gathering demographic information  name address phone number Social Security number Weinstein says Once the client decides which plan they want and how they want to pay the monthly bill they just sign the application he says and off you go Alaskas two main insurers say more than  percent of their customers in the recent open enrollment period bought plans from them directly But these customers arent being tallied by the Obama administration  an insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation says theres a lot of focus on the  million people who signed up through the  state exchanges or HealthCaregov But the offexchange number is just as essential to gauging how well the law is working he says I think its probably the case that there are more people insured in the individual market off the exchange than on the exchange right now In fact a new survey from RAND Corp   that  million people nationwide bought health insurance between September and midMarch directly from a carrier
