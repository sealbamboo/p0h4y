Three years later Rias exploration of fruit flies and organic foods has not only raised some provocative questions about the health benefits of organic eating it has also earned the yearold top honors in a national science competition publication in a respected scientific journal and university laboratory privileges normally reserved for graduate students 
 While the results cant be directly extrapolated to human health the research nonetheless paves the way for additional studies on the relative health benefits of organic versus conventionally grown foods Fruit fly models are often used in research because their short life span allows scientists to evaluate a number of basic biological effects over a relatively brief period of time and the results provide clues for better understanding disease and biological processes in humans For her original middleschool science project Ria evaluated the vitamin C content of organic produce compared with conventionally farmed foods When she found higher concentrations of the vitamin in organic foods she decided she wanted to take the experiment further and measure the effects of organic eating on overall health She searched the Internet and decided a fruit fly model would be the best way to conduct her experiment She emailed several professors who maintained fly laboratories asking for assistance To her surprise Johannes Bauer an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas responded to her inquiry We are very interested in fly health and her project was a perfect match for what we were doing Dr Bauer said Although he would not normally agree to work with a middleschool student he said Ria performed on the level of a college senior or graduate student The seriousness with which she approached this was just stunning he said  Ria worked on the project over the summer eventually submitting the research to her local science fair competition The project was named among just  finalists in the prestigious  national science competition Dr Bauer following his labs policy of publishing all research regardless of outcome urged Ria then  to pursue publication in a scientific journal Dr Bauer and an SMU research associate Santharam Kolli are listed as coauthors on the research Now a sophomore at Clark High School in Plano Tex Ria said she was excited to see her work accepted by a scientific journal I had no idea what publishing my research meant said Ria who last week was juggling high school exams a swim meet and a sweet party My mom told me This is a pretty big deal Ria has continued to work in Dr Bauers lab For her thgrade science fair project she created a model for studying Type  diabetes in fruit flies The work will be presented in a few weeks She plans to build on that research by studying the effects of alternative remedies like cinnamon and curcumin found in turmeric on diabetes in fruit flies Ria said she was only just beginning to think about applying to colleges and is intrigued by Brown University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology although she has not ruled any school in or out Dr Bauer said that he was happy to have her working in his lab and that her biggest problem was that she has too many ideas for her own good Meanwhile Dr Bauer said the study of organic foods and fruit fly health has raised some important questions that he hopes can be answered in future research The difference in outcomes among the flies fed different diets could be due to the effects of pesticide and fungicide residue from conventionally raised foods  Or it could be that the organicfed flies thrived because of a higher level of nutrients in the organic produce One intriguing idea raises the question of whether organically raised plants produce more natural compounds to ward off pests and fungi and whether those compounds offer additional health benefits to flies animals and humans who consume organic foods There are no hard data on that but its something wed like to follow up on he said Dr Bauer said hed love to keep Ria around SMU but realizes that she would have her pick of colleges around the country She is really extraordinary he said If she was a graduate student in my lab she would be tremendous While far more study needs to be conducted to determine the possible benefits of organic foods on human health the debate has been settled in the Chhabra household where Rias parents no longer argue about the cost of organic food All of our fresh produce is organic she said
