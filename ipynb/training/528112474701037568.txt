Theres now free software for your iPhone that lets you check for early signs of certain eye diseases The idea for the app comes from a Baylor University chemist named   We   you to Shaw late last year Shaws son Noah was born with a rare form of eye cancer known as   Shaw saw signs of his sons cancer when the baby was just  days old there was a white reflection coming from Noahs eyes in flash pictures taken with the familys digital camera The flash was reflecting off tumors at the back of Noahs eyes Trouble is Shaw didnt learn the significance of that white reflection until doctors diagnosed Noahs condition months later If I would have had some software telling me Hey go get this checked out that would have sped up my sons diagnosis and the tumors would have been just a little bit smaller when we got to them says Shaw There might have been fewer And maybe doctors wouldnt have had to remove Noahs right eye to prevent the cancer from spreading Since the software didnt exist Shaw worked with Baylor computer scientist   to create some Hamerly and several grad students wrote a   that uses whats called   to spot a white reflection in photos Machine learning is about training the computer to do things by example Hamerly explains White reflections from the eyes pupil called   can also be indicative of a cataract an infection or other disorder Hamerly needed lots of pictures of children with retinoblastoma to train the computer Luckily Shaws wife Elizabeth is a shutterbug so there were lots He also received pictures from other parents of children with retinoblastoma who   on NPRs   and read about it in Shots The researchers also trained the computer to recognize what normal eyes look like Finding pictures of normal eyes was much easier We just go out and gather images on the Web that are public domain Hamerly says and we can get thousands millions of images of eyes They have now turned a version of their whiteeye detection software into a free   When I caught up with Shaw last week at a conference he pulled out his phone and showed me how the app works The easiest thing to do is to search your photos for the white eye he told me You just hit the button search photos and boom  it starts a search of all your photos on your device and itll let you know if it sees anything Theres also something called screening mode Shine the iPhones light in someones eyes and the software will use the phones camera to search for a white reflection Shaw knows its critical that the software be as accurate as possible If the app makes a mistake  suggesting a small child has white eye who really doesnt  that could needlessly freak out parents Thats what I would be worried about says   a pediatric ophthalmologist at Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston who has not been involved in the project At this point its still not clear just how many mistakes the software will make But if it can routinely get the diagnosis right Edmond says it could be a useful screening tool She says the real value of the app may be in countries that have lots of cellphones but not a lot of hospitals or clinics Think about places that have no doctor she says Its no substitute for a doctor but is it better than nothing Well yes Bryan Shaw is hoping the new app will be a lot better than nothing
