If this sounds familiar its because duodeonoscopes were also the cause of recent   But Allens patients in Minnesota were infected in   and now doctors and members of Congress say theyre concerned the Food and Drug Administration might have missed the problem for decades  This problem has been known since at least  said Allen   It certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long On Thursday the   that in addition to following the manufacturers cleaning instructions they should meticulously clean by hand the specific portion of the device believed to harbor the bacteria  According to FDA spokewoman Leslie Wooldridge this is the first time the FDA communicated such advice for duodenoscopes  On Monday Rep Ted Lieu DCalifornia called for congressional hearings  For the life of me I dont understand why the FDA didnt issue this advice until now he said I want to know what the FDA knew and when did they know it   deputy director of science and chief scientist at the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health said it wasnt until  that there was convincing evidence that duodenoscopes could harbor antibioticresistant infections even when the manufacturers cleaning instructions were followed properly and the agency issued the advisory last week after doing research so we felt we understood the issue sufficiently  Over the years the FDA also received   about infections from duodenoscopes  We receive a million adverse event reports on various devices each year and we evaluate the reports based on the information thats provided he said  But outside the FDA there was significant concern before  that duodenoscopes  in particular a small mechanism called the elevator wire  were difficult if not impossible to clean thoroughly  In  safety expert Lawrence Muscarella published an article in the journal Endoscopy calling for special attention to the elevator wire and in    that automatic cleaning processes didnt always effectively disinfect duodenoscopes and so manual cleaning should be performed  But some experts question whether even the most meticulous and diligent manual cleaning will get all the bacteria  After an outbreak in  a   tried to get the highly   CRE out of a duodenoscope and failed according to Allen  They really went to extremes but they still couldnt decontaminate the scope and they finally had to just destroy it   now the clinical chief of digestive diseases at Yale School of Medicine  Doctors hope that manufacturers will come up with a plan soon  I do think it will take a redesign of the scope to solve the problem or new sterilization technology said Dr Bret Peterson a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the  guidelines from the medical societies  Olympus which manufactured the scope used at UCLA did not respond to CNNs requests for comments specific to this story  This is clearly a matter that needs addressing said Dr John Greene an infectious disease expert at the   who published an article in  on a duodenoscope   We really should have done this sooner
