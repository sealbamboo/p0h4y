I really married the most sweet wonderful compassionate man in the world He never made me feel bad about it so I think I felt more guilty said Tarver  a highschool agriculture teacher who lives in the Fort Worth Texas area She remembers thinking Why arent you taking the initiative This man loves you for who you are  She had never had the body she wanted By that November she had had enough She was done being just the outgoing funny girl She was done being heavy I found myself crying in bed one night over my weight and my husband told me that he thought I was beautiful but if I was so unhappy I should do something about it   This triggered something in me The very next day she said she began monitoring her calories and walking or riding the stationary bicycle six days a week After two months she was brave enough to step foot inside a gym That was January   Soon after she signed up for her first Zumba class It was the beginning of her new life  Tarver started sampling every available evening dance class As the daughter of an aerobic dance instructor the movements came easily By the third week she wanted to be there all the time dancing to exhaustion under the club lights in the gyms group fitness room She supplemented classes with one to two nights working out on the elliptical machine and lifting weights  My instructors were amazing and made me feel like they loved having me there she said I was having a blast exercising for the first time in my life  One of her instructors now a close friend found her on Facebook and would message her if Tarver missed a class She also offered to make her CDs with music she noticed Tarver liked in class  After  months Tarvers teacher encouraged her to get certified to teach her own classes Tarver has been teaching Zumba and other classes that combine fitness and dance for the past four months in addition to the classes she takes You really feel like youre in a club dancing with people but you dont have a hangover in the morning At the end of it you feel awesome youre exhausted and you can go back and do it tomorrow if you want Its good for your soul if you ask me   Tarver knew exercise wasnt enough to really get healthy She had to change her eating habits too She didnt follow a particular diet but stuck to a few principles  The first few months she rarely ate out if at all and cut out fast food in favor of salmon or grilled chicken with vegetables At school she ate a protein shake or bar for breakfast a banana apple pear or some clementines for a snack more fruit and a lowcalorie frozen dinner for lunch She used a calorie counter app on her phone to track her intake sticking to about  to  calories per day based on how fast or slow she was losing weight She also cut out dairy which was probably the hardest sacrifice I could drink a whole gallon of whole milk in two days I really really liked cheese and milk a lot she said It was difficult at first because I was so conditioned to eating cheese but I felt better After a couple of months she allowed herself one cheat meal a week  two bacon and egg taquitos from her favorite fast food chain every Tuesday She still has that ritual but is a little freer with her diet on the weekends When Tarver started her weight loss journey in November  at  pounds she wore size  pants and was about  body fat Within  months she was down to  pounds a size  and  body fat Her back pain is almost completely gone she has her dream body and is the happiest I have ever been I cant believe how easy it was  how fast the weight came off when I was doing the right thing she said Im thrilled out of my mind with my body Her husband Tom Tarver says Roni has always been beautiful but its clear to him how much better she feels  Im very proud of her and I would choose the way she feels now over however she looks he said Shes happier and she is just a fun person to be around Its the kind of person you want to be married to  Tarver fluctuates between  and  pounds and considers herself to be in maintenance mode she carries around some extra skin from the weight loss but will happily accept the extra skin over the extra weight If I could give one piece of advice to anyone struggling with their weight it would be to find something active that you love doing and dont give up Tarver said Consistency is key to making any lifestyle changes Find a support system and tell people what you are trying to do for yourself When you say it out loud you become accountable
