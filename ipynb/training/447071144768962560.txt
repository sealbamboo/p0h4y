To study the impact of everyday chemicals on fertility federal researchers recently spent four years tracking  couples as they tried to have children One of the findings stood out while both men and women were exposed to known toxic chemicals men seemed much more likely to suffer fertility problems as a result  The gender gap was particularly wide when it came to phthalates those ubiquitous compounds used to make plastics more flexible and cosmetic lotions slide on more smoothly Women who wore cosmetics often had higher levels of phthalates in their bodies as measured by urinalysis But only in their male partners were phthalate levels correlated with infertility Its the males in the study that are driving the effect said Germaine Buck Louis an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and lead author of the report  in Fertility and Sterility Theyre the signal 
 Phthalates belong to a group of industrial compounds known as endocrine disruptors because they interfere with the endocrine system which governs the production and distribution of hormones in the body The chemicals have been implicated in a range of health problems including    But it is their effect on the human reproductive system that has   A growing body of work over the last two decades suggests that phthalates can rewire the male reproductive system interfering with the operation of androgenic hormones such as testosterone that play key roles in male development That mechanism some experts believe explains findings that link phthalate exposure to changes in everything from testicular development to sperm quality  I wasnt surprised at all by this finding   a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Texas and editor in chief of the journal Endocrinology said of the new report We see the cell studies the animal studies and now the human epidemiology work and they are all showing us a similar picture  The focus on male fertility dates back to the early s when researchers in the United States and Europe published a paper suggesting   One of the authors Niels Skakkebaek a reproduction researcher at the University of Copenhagen has since suggested that an increase in malformations in male reproductive systems which he calls testicular dysgenesis syndrome may be   More recent studies in the United States have also suggested   in men The findings are supported by a host of animal studies particularly in rats which have shown that the compounds   and result in odd    They interfere with how testosterone is made explained Heather Patisaul a biology professor at North Carolina State University who is studying the effect of endocrinedisrupting compounds during puberty Anything you can think of thats testosteronedependent is likely to be affected   Women also have androgenic hormones but to a lesser degree and according to some theories this accounts for the smaller but still observable effects of phthalates on female fertility Testosterone for instance is part of the cascade of hormones   There are plenty of uncertainties in this picture The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that while studies suggest that phthalate exposure is widespread in the US population its difficult to know what those levels are Health effects from very low levels    While the evidence for an effect on male fertility is compelling said Tracey Woodruff director of the program on reproductive health and the environment at the University of California San Francisco its still difficult to gauge the impact We are still pulling the tricky aspects together There are different kinds of phthalates complicating the picture some seem to have a much larger effect than others And these are far from the only factors chemical and otherwise that influence human fertility Dr Buck Louiss group is looking at a broad range of industrial compounds including heavy metals like lead and cadmium that tend to accumulate in the body  Phthalates by contrast tend to be metabolized within a few hours Their impact would not be so profound if it were not that people are constantly exposed from multiple sources  These include not only cosmetics and plastics but also packaging textiles detergents and other household products Phthalates are found in the tubing used in hospitals to deliver medications in water flowing through PVC pipes enteric coatings on pills including some aspirin materials used to create timerelease capsules and countless other products In  the government banned them   and the European Union is also moving forward on restrictions  The WHO called them pseudopersistent in one report Dr Woodruff said because continued exposure keeps phthalates in the body But heres the silver lining the transient nature of these compounds also means that consumers   to reduce their phthalate levels  One is to read the labels on cosmetics and other personal care products and to choose those without phthalates Another is to be cautious with plastic food containers and to avoid using them to heat food and drink as the phthalates in them may get transferred to what you consume  These compounds leach from plastics Dr Buck Louis said You can switch to glass for drinking You can cook your frozen dinners on paper plates  Studies have shown that these kinds of actions do make a difference experiments have found measurably lower levels within several days in people who make these changes  Lifestyle has an important place here said Dr Buck Louis
