
 The longawaited   will change how we approach patients with high blood pressure Here are three things you should know about them  You may be familiar with the idea that hypertension should be treated when your blood pressure is higher than  mm Hg Now based on studies the experts suggest starting drug therapy only when the reading is  or higher In fact the authors some of the most prominent experts in the diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure said that the goal of drug treatment is to lower the blood pressure below   This recommendation immediately puts many people who had drug treatment started because of mild elevations in systolic hypertension in an overtreatment category Many people currently on drug treatment would not have been recommended for treatment under these new guidelines including those who had highnormal values and were being treated for socalled prehypertension a condition never officially sanctioned for treatment  Let me repeat that After all these years of studying people with high blood pressure the panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for this large segment of the population  Now that did not stop the authors from expressing an opinion that we ought to stay with the current threshold of a blood pressure lower than  for those younger than  They argued that there was no reason to change what we have been doing  even though it has been based on opinion and not evidence My take here is that the evidence for this threshold is weaker than most people might believe  and decisions about treatment need to acknowledge this uncertainty and defer to the preferences of patients  The authors of the guidelines similarly also stated that we lack evidence for the right target for patients with kidney disease and diabetes Given the lack of evidence the authors settled on a recommendation of a goal of less than  for patients for people with kidney disease and also those with diabetes This is a change for many people because many doctors have been seeking a systolic blood pressure goal of less than  but the authors noted that such a recommendation is not supported by any clinical trial  Meanwhile they do indicate that the diastolic blood pressure the bottom number should be less than  and for people age  and older there is evidence to support that recommendation What we discovered in studies was that treating mild elevations of blood pressure with drugs does not reliably improve patients health Although there is no question that drug treatment of very high blood pressure levels is beneficial we now have several studies that failed to reduce risk by lowering blood pressure from mildly elevated to lower levels Several studies sought to reduce risk by lowering blood pressure from mildly elevated to lower levels  and the surprising finding was that there was no benefit  What this means is that drugs have many effects and their effect on a single risk factor does not capture all they are doing and cannot convey their net effect on someones health We have so many examples of trying to change risk factors with drugs and doing no good  or even harm  even as we make a single risk factor look better  The authors of the guideline were influenced by these studies and did not default to the idea that more treatment is better They reflected on what we know from studies that tested specific treatment strategies which led them to be more conservative in their recommendations than previous guidelines    While they focus on drug treatment they do emphasize the importance of a healthy diet weight control and regular exercise They make separate recommendations for black and white patients They steer people away from betablockers for the treatment of high blood pressure They steer black patients away from ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers They steer all people toward thiazidetype diuretics and calcium channel blockers  In summary this is a large paradigm change The authors state that they did not intend to redefine what constitutes high blood pressure but in effect they have now set it at  for the purpose of drug treatment of the general population They have illuminated the weakness of our current body of evidence and made sensible recommendations given what we know  The new guidelines are a reason for people being treated for high blood pressure to start  with a discussion with their doctor particularly if they started drug treatment for mildly elevated blood pressure As always all decisions about your treatment should reflect your own preferences about whether the benefits are worth the risks What these guidelines reveal is that many decisions about blood pressure treatment are being made with less evidence than we need This is a call to action for studies that can equip patients facing decisions about treatment with the information they need  Harlan Krumholz is a cardiologist and the Harold H Hines Jr Professor of Medicine
