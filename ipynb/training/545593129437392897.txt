Between the rugged terrain and the constant terrorist threats vaccinating Pakistani children against common diseases hasnt been easy Mountains make it hard  at times even impossible  for vaccinators to reach people in the north In the south health workers have to use fourwheelers and camels to travel through Pakistans harsh deserts The Taliban also stands in the way Since  the Taliban has gunned down at least  health workers and policemen who were guarding them The attack this week on a school in Peshawar that killed at least  children and teachers is a reminder how the group can wreak havoc with the countrys sense of security Still Pakistan has been making strides in vaccinating children In  the country saw between   immunization coverage against diseases like measles tuberculosis polio and meningitis In  the rate was almost zero Weve seen the death of children occurring even  years ago cut down by half because of the vaccines says   a retired professor of pediatrics at Dow Medical University in the Pakistani city of Karachi Akram  now serves as the honorary chairman of   a nongovernmental organization providing primary health care in Karachi Akram stopped by NPR to talk about the successes  and challenges  of routine immunization programs in Pakistan I do not think that this would affect the routine immunization or the polio campaign because we understand that this is retaliation by the Taliban against the army I hope that it would not in any way compromise the routine the immunization activities going on there That is a very difficult area Since June of  nobody was allowed to get in there to give vaccination So that area became a pocket of disease and illnesses of children that could have been easily prevented This was a political move on part of the Taliban Presently in the last  months the military has opened it up and allowed vaccinators in to Taliban controlled areas But there are still pockets where the military has not reached Let me give you a bit of historical perspective When I was growing up we just had the smallpox vaccine Sometimes when there were epidemics of typhoid there was a typhoid vaccine Other than that we grew up totally exposed to common childhood infections So we did not even dream that one day our children would be protected against common infections like pneumonia diarrhea and measles With GAVIs The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations help our immunization program got accelerated and we could procure vaccines that were not accessible because of the price During my lifetime as a teacher I saw diseases disappear I saw outbreaks of measles disappear I have seen isolation wards where we used to keep cases of tetanus closing down A couple weeks ago I was visiting my old hospital where I used to teach and we were taking rounds in the ward The professor there  who used to be my student  asked me to look into a case that she thought may be diphtheria She said I have not seen diphtheria in my life But I had seen it growing up So this is a very visible impact of the vaccines As of now the measles vaccine because measles decreases the immunity of children It kind of eats up the vitamin A which is a major micronutrient that protects against infections So we used to see outbreaks of measles followed by outbreaks of tuberculosis vitamin A deficiency and blindness We definitely are still seeing measles outbreaks but these are in pockets whereas we used to see outbreaks running throughout the country Hopefully in the future the most important vaccine to decrease mortality in children would be the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines which would decrease the two major killers of children under  in Pakistan Pneumococcal vaccine was introduced just over a year and a half ago and the rotavirus vaccine will be introduced next year We have a population that is scattered theyre in areas where there are no roads especially in the deserts and mountains We have a poverty level of  to  percent and they do not have easy access to health care facilities In addition weve had disasters the earthquake in  and the floods in  and  which displaced over a million people and caused epidemics of diarrhea pneumonia and various infections Then we have manmade disasters like terrorism which plagues us almost every week Were always in fear as to where its going to hit us next Youre right In cities like Peshawar  a bustling metropolis  and in Karachi which is the industrial hub there are pockets where even now we cannot go to immunize or to give health care because of the fear of insurgents attacking us But that does not apply to the major part of the country it applies to isolated pockets in the north of Pakistan and in Karachi
