The subject line of the email usually says something like funeral notification or perhaps your friends memorial service It appears to come from a funeral home maybe even a real funeral home When you open the email the message extends condolences and provides a link to use to learn more about the celebration of your friends life or similar wording It doesnt mention a name but the phrases themselves are enough to make you wonder Who died Alert from the Federal Trade Commission   recently hatched and circulating widely Clicking on the link loads malicious software onto your computer allowing the scammers to steal personal information and passwords to gain access to accounts and to spam others on your list of contacts Delete the email and dont  dont  click on the link Even veteran monitors of scummy attempts at fraud  some of the FTCs staff got phony funeral notices  describe this as some sort of record for stonyheartedness How low can you be to prey on someones fear of losing a loved one asked Nat Wood an assistant director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection Its despicable The commission hasnt seen evidence that the email targets seniors in particular The scammers approach this as an exercise in volume Mr Wood said They send these to as many people as they can betting that at least some will bite But Im passing the warning along here thinking that older adults could be particularly vulnerable Who else goes to as many funerals sadly Losing ones peers is one of the tougher parts of aging And theres some evidence that   and less able to spot deception though the research recounted by my colleague Judith Graham was based on visual cues not bogus email So be careful and warn the older computer users you know If theyre wondering whether someone they care about has actually died theyd be better off checking with the funeral home or with someone who would have knowledge of a person Mr Wood advised Those already victimized by these digital thieves will have to run antivirus programs to cleanse their computers The FTC offers advice on how to do that
