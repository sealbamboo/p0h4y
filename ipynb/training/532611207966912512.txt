A few short weeks ago Ebola was public enemy No  About  people were being monitored by health officials Several schools in Texas and Ohio shut down because of a single patient who boarded a plane A cruise ship was refused permission to dock in Cozumel off Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula President Obama appointed an Ebola czar Polls showed a majority of Americans were concerned that Ebola would spread out of control in the US On Tuesday a fully recovered Dr Craig Spencer was released from Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan The US was now Ebolafree for the first time since Sept   a milestone that barely seemed to register with a oncefrenzied public How did we get here from there Angst and anxiety gave way to calm as the days ticked by and no new patients were diagnosed Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities upped their game after Thomas Eric Duncans arrival at a Dallas emergency room revealed major gaps in the public health system Its hard to say definitively why the public thinks anything but this is a welcome return to normalcy said Andrew Noymer a professor of public health at UC Irvine Spencer was the ninth person in the United States to be treated for Ebola and the eighth to survive The only fatality was Duncan who contracted the virus in his native Liberia Ebola is suspected of killing nearly  people in West Africa but so far public health officials have made good on CDC Director Thomas Friedens pledge to stop the virus dead in its tracks in the United States They instituted medical SWAT teams prepared to help local hospitals deal with potential Ebola patients and upgraded guidelines for personal protective gear Officials also designated several regional hospitals with expertise in treating highly infectious diseases as Ebola care centers and routed all inbound flights from West Africa to five airports with enhanced passenger screening But the initial response left much to be desired When Duncan first sought care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept  the emergency room staff failed to make the correct diagnosis delaying necessary care by three days After two of his nurses became infected medical workers openly questioned the CDCs advice on protective gear and other protocols In cases where quarantines were imposed it became clear that few had considered the logistics of providing food or disposing of trash for those affected Panic began to spread October was a rough month for stigma and fear said Doug Henry a medical anthropologist at the University of North Texas in Denton The cruise ship that was denied entry into a port kids who werent welcome at school parents who kept their own kids home  things got really bad here in Dallas To further complicate matters the crisis occurred in the home stretch of the midterm election campaign Some Democrats accused Republicans of stoking Ebola fears for political advantage At the same time nurses unions denounced hospital administrators saying they failed to properly train and equip nurses to face Ebola Training and personal protective equipment remain topics of heated labor negotiations in California where  nurses at Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics mainly in northern parts of the state began a twoday strike Tuesday From the start CDC and local health officials said triedandtrue public health measures such as rapidly identifying those who had been in contact with infected individuals would prevent the virus from spreading widely in the United States Weve demonstrated that if there is a case of Ebola in the United States taking prudent measures  like tracing contacts and isolating people if necessary  makes a difference said CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds New York health officials were quick to adopt such measures after Spencer fell ill on Oct  a few days after returning home from Guinea where he volunteered for Doctors Without Borders Epidemiologists swooped down on a bowling alley a coffee kiosk and a restaurant that Spencer had visited before he became ill His diagnosis also triggered a wave of mandatory day quarantines imposed by anxious state officials New York Gov Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said voluntary measures werent strong enough to force symptomfree Ebola health workers to remain isolated in their homes while waiting for the virus threeweek incubation period to expire Several other states followed suit angering healthcare experts who said mandatory quarantines had no basis in science and would discourage volunteers from going to Africa Containing the outbreak overseas is the best way to protect Americans at home they agree Nurse Kaci Hickox forced a legal showdown in Maine by refusing to abide by a quarantine order there A judge eventually ruled in Hickoxs favor but only after she spent two days in a barebones tent in Newark NJ after her arrival from West Africa Spencers care at Bellevue underscored the fact that Ebola isnt a death sentence if it is caught early and treated properly Medical experts said it was the simple things that saved him His quick diagnosis set the stage for the rapid launch of supportive care in a stateoftheart hospital The yearold also received experimental antiviral drugs and plasma from another Ebola survivor aid worker Nancy Writebol On Tuesday a pale and smiling Spencer thanked the medical staffers who cared for him as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio gathered him in a bear hug Nobody mentioned the word quarantine though it was on their minds There is no need for anyone to be treated with anything but respect and our thanks for treating people in need said De Blasio who called Spencer a hero for his overseas work De Blasio also praised New Yorkers for the way they responded to news of Ebola in their city They understood that Ebola is very very hard to contract he said The citys  million residents just went about their lives
