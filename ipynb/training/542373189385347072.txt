Almost one in four AE departments in hospitals in England fill more than  of their senior staff vacancies with agency doctors or locums  The reliance on freelance staff to fill senior posts costs hospital trusts more than m a year  Some trusts have far higher rates of vacancies filled by locums with three trusts running at rates of more than   and the highest at   The information comes from a Freedom of Information request made by the BBC Locum or agency doctors are routinely used to plug gaps in rotas not just in AE departments but generally across the health service But the BBC has found that many hospitals are routinely using locums to fill the two most senior roles in Emergency Departments consultants who run the teams and senior registrars We approached  hospital Trusts in England that run large Emergency Departments known in the NHS as Type  AEs Of those nearly  responded to our request for information about how many of the senior roles were filled with locums and how much that was costing The AE at North Manchester General is one of the busiest and best performing in the country  But consultant Dr Jim Butler spends only around  of his time caring for patients The rest of his day is taken up with paperwork and in particular finding locums or agency doctors to fill gaps in the rota He says its not an unusual situation I was doing admin all week last week and in the past Ive had periods where I think I went a month without seeing a patient because I had so much admin to do Given a shortage of consultant and senior registrar grade doctors working in emergency medicine Dr Butler says the use of locums is an expensive but unavoidable way of making sure AE departments are properly staffed Last year I think this department overspent by an enormous sum  a m or m overspend on agency locums  We have a lot of vacancies that were filling so we have no choice Locums offer hospitals a flexible way of managing their workforce in response to demand When drawn from other specialties or departments they can also help spread best practice and the latest knowledge But AE consultant Prof Suzanne Mason of the College of Emergency Medicine the professional body for senior AE doctors says there are significant downsides to relying so heavily on locums They often will provide different levels of care and perhaps not such highquality care as we would come to expect as a specialty  That may be due to a lack of knowledge of the local systems but it may also just be due to just a general lack of clinical experience But at present hospitals have little choice over their use of locums according to Bill McMillan from the NHS Employers organisation Tonight at AE you need to be able to deal with the patients who turn up You cant say to them Youre in the wrong place we cant do anything for you So hospitals are obliged to try and fill those rotas as best they can with the best quality people they can You can hardly blame the patients for turning up You always get a certain amount of flexible workforce in any industry and the health service is no different  The question is making sure we recruit locums who are also of the best quality doing the work we are asking of them paying the right pay for that Those are things I think hospitals find really difficult at the moment Locum use is not just an issue in England Earlier this month BBC Scotland revealed the NHS north of the border spent a record m on locum doctors last year A spokesperson for the Department of Health in England said  AE doctors are at a record high in the NHS with  more than in  including  more consultants Weve given the NHS m this winter to help it respond to the pressure of an ageing population with more doctors nurses and beds and plans in every area to manage extra demand But Labour says the situation has got worse under the coalition  Andy Burnham shadow health secretary said David Cameron has trapped AEs in a downward spiral and as doctors leave in their droves the problems are only getting worse  He must urgently get to grips with the AE crisis take action to bring down the bill for locum doctors and ensure all hospitals have enough doctors to get safely through the winter
