Imagine a job where about half of all the work is being done by people who are in training Thats in fact what happens in the world of biological and medical research In the United States more than  temporary employees known as postdoctoral research fellows are doing science at a bargain price And most postdocs are being trained for   Academic institutions graduate an overabundance of biomedical PhDs  and this imbalance is only getting worse as research funding from the National Institutes of Health continues to wither The funding squeeze presents an enormous challenge for young scientists like   who is trying to make a career in biomedical research HubbardLucey is  years old After earning her PhD a few years ago she first worked as a researchtechnician in a cancer lab then accepted a postdoc position at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center on Manhattans East Side   who is trying to understand the causes of inflammatory bowel disease By definition a postdoc is temporary mentored training where you are supposed to acquire professional experience in order to pursue a career of your own choosing HubbardLucey says the key word being temporary But increasingly these lowpaying temporary jobs can stretch on for years Many people go on to do many postdocs she says Thats because if you want a career in academia its almost essential as a postdoc to make a splashy discovery and get the findings published in a top scientific journal HubbardLucey is working on an experiment that she hopes will be her ticket to a professorship  or at least to an interview for an academic job Whether she succeeds or not shes part of a shadow workforce made up of highly qualified scientists who work long hours for comparatively little pay considering their level of education about  a year American science couldnt survive without this shadow labor force of some  postdocs But   will get tenuretrack jobs heading a lab like the one where HubbardLucey works today This was not at all what she expected when she started down this path a decade ago  I remember an adviser saying You know funding is kind of tough now but things are going to be better when you finish graduate school  HubbardLucey recalls She says her adviser assured her that the situation would improve so I said OK In fact the situation hasnt gotten better Its worse Support for biomedical research has declined by more than  percent in real dollars over the past decade And even in good times postdocs had a raw deal The entire system is built around the false idea that all these scientistsintraining are headed to university professorships Thats obviously unsustainable says   who heads the postdoc program at the NYU Medical Center You cant have one manager training  subordinates who think they are all going to take over that boss position someday Thats mathematically impossible But weve grown so dependent on this relatively cheap seemingly inexhaustible supply of young scientists who do great work Micoli says From the standpoint of dollars and cents theyre a great investment Even the lucky few who do land academic jobs find it increasingly difficult to get federal funding to run a lab Theres simply not enough money to go around given the number of scientists working in academia today Why go into an academic career when you know youve little chance of success Micoli muses Funding gets tighter and tighter Its diminishing returns This is very much on the minds of todays postdocs Immunologist   grew up in modest circumstances in Brooklyn She says her dad struggled with health issues for many years and I saw how troubling it can be being a patient and being a patients family And I wanted to do something to help But after getting a PhD at Brown University and now working in   she knows she may not end up working to cure diseases  What would I do instead I would love to work with inner city youth and show them different careers that are available to them Ruiz says I came from a poorer community so I would love to go back and give back to the community But she may not advise them to pursue careers in biomedical research  still holds out that hope Hes a neuroscientist who landed a lucrative consulting gig after earning his PhD from Harvard But the job didnt inspire him So he says he took an  percent pay cut to   as a postdoc We will see if its a foolhardy decision after a few more years he says But passion trumps everything for now Im very excited about really understanding how brains work how brain circuits work both in health and in disease he says Is there a way we can slowly figure that out and unpack that so we can get a better handle on whats up in our skull  Its really one of the most fascinating organs to me But Kuchibhotla knows the systems stacked against him I sometimes like to think of it like medical residents he says Medical residents do need a few years of training before they can become attending physicians The difference is theres not always a job on the other end for the postdoctoral researchers There actually  jobs  in industry consulting government and   Biomedical postdocs rarely end up unemployed But many cant pursue their academic dreams and they are often in their late s or even older before they realize that And despite those long odds Vannessa HubbardLucey was also holding out hope on the rainy spring day when we first talked You have a PhD HubbardLucey she told me Its supposed to be the highest degree you can get so you feel like well Ive worked this hard Ive done so much when am I going to get something good out of this Im sort of at the point where Im hopeful that my papers going to go in and its going to get published she says and at least Ill have something to show for it A published paper then maybe an interview in academia she was hoping and at the end of that rainbow a job running her own research lab from the honchos office not the lab bench The boss occasionally comes out and wants to know whats going on but hes mostly holed up in his office trying to write grants she says That may not sound glamorous but I would love to actually be telling other postdocs what to do That would be the best part The worst part The boss spends a huge amount of time in his office writing grants because money is so tight these days even many topflight ideas dont make the cut Nearly  percent of grant proposals get rejected Rejections a little hard she admits You have to get used to rejection That first conversation took place in May Later in the summer while HubbardLucey was still working on her scientific paper she heard about a job where she could make good use of her PhD She wouldnt be running a lab or working in academia But she would be advancing cancer research at a nonprofit institute She got the job And now she says shes happy with the new path shes chosen
