veryone working in mental health will welcome the new NHS waiting times for talking therapies They will require the   to provide facetoface therapy to  of patients within six weeks and  of patients within  weeks I embrace these targets because they make an important statement about mental health and its equal status with physical health But underlying any waiting times target approach is the assumption that expanding access is difficult and expensive We need to be a lot more ambitious about treating people with common mental illnesses We need to look not at the cost of treating people but the cost of not treating them We also need to be aware that the new targets are not far off what the NHS has been doing already According to the NHS   of referral and  had one within  days  Would you want to wait that long if you were depressed It is not good for individuals their families or wider society NHS treatment has to be rationed and sadly there is not enough healthcare to go round Treatment is expensive and it is a precarious balancing act trying to expand access in one area because this affects other areas with their own fierce and justified need But this may be the wrong way of looking at this particular problem It was an economic argument that led to the launch in  of   the NHSs umbrella term for facetoface therapy services and more recent estimates have put the total cost of mental ill health to society at over bn Similarly there is a strong economic argument for treating people with common mental illnesses immediately This is because making them wait leads to costs quite apart from any treatment they might ultimately receive They impose a background cost on the NHS by for example visiting their GP more frequently  Academics at the University of Sheffield have estimated these costs Their figures show for example that a severely depressed person costs the NHS  a month more than someone with moderate depression Even someone with mild depression costs the health service over  more than someone with no mental illness Calculating the total cost of waiting for the plus patients that entered treatment in  would be tricky There is no record of patients by severity band and only about half would have recovered But we can be fairly certain the costs would run into the millions Not only should we treat people earlier  we can Things have changed in the world of therapy Human connection the basis of psychological healing is in much more abundant supply in the era of the internet Accredited psychotherapists deliver internetenabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy via computer smartphone or tablet using online textbased conversations  This approach is proven to work as well if not better than facetoface therapy   of our patients achieve recovery compared to the average across Iapt therapies of  We think this is partly explained by the disinhibiting factor of communicating through writing rather than having to speak to a therapist facetoface which can be offputting for many people Access to treatment is fast Once you leave your GP you can go home and log on straight away A therapist is then assigned  usually immediately but always within  hours  and you can arrange a first session at your earliest convenience  Were already commissioned in  CCG Clinical Commissioning Group and are rapidly heading towards treating  NHS patients per month At the moment the goal is for Iapt services to treat just  of people with common mental illnesses That means a vast number of people with untreated illness exerting enormous background costs on the NHS  Technology enables us to radically improve access in a way traditional delivery methods do not We can do it so lets get on with it Lets stop wasting resources by keeping people waiting and leaving them to suffer because we tell ourselves it is too difficult to expand access  it isnt Its within reach to make waiting times for mental health redundant
