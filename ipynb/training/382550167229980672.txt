
 Like many adults who survived childhood cancer Karen Cormier always assumed she would never get pregnant Ms Cormier  developed a rare form of kidney cancer when she was  years old Chemotherapy helped cure her of the disease but her doctors warned that the treatments would damage her reproductive organs almost certainly leaving her infertile Ms Cormier who works in online advertising and lives in Mendon Mass saw a fertility specialist when she and her husband were ready to start a family about eight years ago hoping there was a chance she had survived her early ordeal with her fertility intact But after two years of trying to conceive without success they ended the fertility treatments and turned to the adoption process finding their son Luke in  Then three years later the unthinkable happened Ms Cormier discovered she was pregnant I was in complete and utter shock she said I couldnt even get the words out to tell my husband Ms Cormier gave birth to a son Ryan  months ago He is a walking biological miracle she said I am just so happy to have two kids I thought wed never have For children with cancer chemotherapy and radiation treatments are a doubleedged sword one that is lifesaving but often toxic to the fast growing cells of the reproductive system Many children who live through cancer struggle to conceive once they reach adulthood Clinical infertility the failure to conceive after a year of trying is particularly common among adults who received pelvic radiation and a class of chemotherapy drugs called alkylating agents In some cases when   transplants and especially high doses of radiation are used children may be left completely sterile At one time oncologists rarely worried about the reproductive side effects of treatment because so few pediatric patients survived But as more children with cancer live into adulthood  death rates have plunged  percent since the s  the landscape of fertility has changed Doctors are offering patients preservation options at the time of diagnosis and researchers are finding that for many survivors the odds of overcoming clinical infertility are surprisingly good Last month a large study   found that about two thirds of female survivors who sought out fertility treatments as adults ultimately became pregnant  a rate of success that mirrored the rate among other infertile women Other recent   that many men who experience low sperm counts after pediatric cancer a side effect in two thirds of boys who receive chemotherapy can undergo procedures that harvest viable sperm allowing them to father their own children Doctors say that while there is no doubt that childhood cancer increases the likelihood of infertility the ovaries and testes of young cancer patients may be more resilient than they had previously thought When we see   survivors as adults depending on how late they are in their reproductive years radiation and chemotherapy tends to have a pretty suppressive effect on their future fertility said Dr Hal C Danzer a reproductive endocrinologist at the Southern California Reproductive Center But this speaks to the fact that the ovaries and sperm production are more resilient in young individuals Its very encouraging But if fertility treatment is to be successful time is of the essence Normally for example women under  are encouraged to attempt getting pregnant for at least a year before seeing a fertility specialist For those with a history of cancer however the new message should be Dont wait said Dr Lisa R Diller the chief medical officer of the DanaFarberBoston Childrens Cancer and Blood Disorders Center The ovaries after childhood cancer have taken a hit and they are almost aging more quickly than someone of the same chronological age without cancer said Dr Diller the lead author of the Lancet study In the setting of having had childhood cancer if a woman is  and has been trying to conceive for six months then I would say see a specialist Typically childhood survivors tend not to address fertility issues until they are in a relationship and their treatment is many years behind them said Dr Aarati D Didwania the director of the STAR survivorship program at the Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University A lot of young women will come in and say Im married weve been trying for six months is this related to my treatmentÂ  she said Traditionally the fertility discussion has involved finding out which cancer therapies patients received and what their hormonal status is like so doctors can estimate their likelihood of being infertile Then they can talk about their options Dr Didwania said and whether they need to resort to things like surrogacy using donor eggs and sperm or adoption But the new goal in the field of cancer fertility or oncofertility is to be as proactive as possible said Dr Teresa K Woodruff chief of the division of fertility preservation at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Oncologists are increasingly making a point of bringing up the subject of fertility at the time of diagnosis discussing options like freezing eggs sperm and embryos before treatment In younger patients who have not gone through puberty some fertility clinics offer the option of freezing ovarian and testicular tissue which can be reimplanted when patients get older  that up to two thirds of young patients are now counseled about fertility before starting their cancer treatment Today  percent of kids will survive Dr Woodruff said Now that patients are thriving and have decades of life ahead of them fertility is a high priority for them But cryopreservation procedures are expensive typically starting at around  Some fertility clinics offer discounted rates to cancer patients and nonprofit programs like   and   can provide financial assistance and free fertility medications Brian Regan who is  and lives in Dunstable Mass was told by his doctors earlier this year that he would likely develop a low   that could become permanent after undergoing chemotherapy for a rare form of   They recommended that I at least look into sperm banking he said His insurance carrier Harvard Pilgrim covered most of the costs At Northwestern Dr Woodruff and her colleagues helped start a program called the Oncofertility Consortium which assists cancer patients with their fertility options and brings together doctors and researchers around the country Dr Woodruff is looking forward to a day when fertility will not be a casualty of cancer treatment She and her husband Thomas OHalloran a chemist at Northwestern are working on a new delivery system for   that delivers drugs in microscopic bubbles or nanobins that dissolve once inside the acidic environment of a tumor sparing the reproductive organs In animal studies the   and it   Clinical trials in humans are not expected for a couple of years Dr OHalloran said Most of the chemotherapy and drug development community has not been thinking about this because weve been hell bent on the path toward killing this disease in any way we can he said But to have a treatment plan that preserves fertility is really critical Youre giving back a whole life he added as opposed to in some cases a compromised life
