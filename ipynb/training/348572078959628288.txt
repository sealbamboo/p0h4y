An yearold woman on a tandem skydive slipped from her instructors harness then held on for life while rocketing toward Earth An Alabama man busted his ankles trying to ride a bull A Missouri man smashed his body  and his new motorcycle  minutes after buying the bike  All were attempting items on their bucket lists those rare experiences that people  particularly Baby Boomers folks  years old and up  ache to taste before kicking the bucket But as injuries and close calls from these sacred agendas mount some emergency workers want the bucketlisters to tone down their chosen adventures  or at least better prepare for such feats  If youre going to build a bucket list dont fill it with  different versions of Russian Roulette said Dr Ryan Stanton an emergency physician in Lexington Ky He treated the something man who recently wrecked his new motorcycle in the stores parking lot breaking several bones in the crash Fill your bucket list with things that are actually safe and enjoyable  or at least prepare for them sufficiently if youre going to enjoy them Stanton said You dont want your bucket to be full of the first bucket of dirt for your grave Baby boomers have become the bucketlist generation aiming to complete and cross off dozens of adrenalinedrenched exploits before their bodies fade or their time ends says an official at the American Association of Retired Persons  Boomers are really known for this phenomenon called Boomeritis which is We are weekend warriors and we go out and try to squeeze all our activities into the weekend said Gabrielle Redford editorial projects manager for AARP the Magazine She believes so many plusers have inked bucket lists because they came of age amid the aerobics and jogging crazes and because theyre more active than their parents generation  Typical bucket lists may include marathons triathlons and lately   and Spartan Races  along with pursuits like ziplining rock climbing and scuba diving  We set our sites on a race and just go all out to get in shape for that race But then we go out too fast and too long and we end up with the plantar fasciitis and the Achilles tendon pull Redford said We just end up with all these wear and tear injuries we might not have had if we werent quite so ambitious Some bucket lists can lead to close calls with the hereafter To celebrate her th birthday and notch her bucket list Laverne Everett went tandem skydivingtwo years ago above Lodi Calif After she paused in fear while perched in the planes hatch she went airborne but partially slipped out of her partners harness A fellow jumper filmed the plunge and   I had watched watched people jump and it looked like such fun just sailing in real smooth you know It didnt work out that way Everett  said in a phone interview Thursday My partner kept telling me Hold on Hold on Thats where my mind was just holding on He was just holding me I was just barely holding on with my legs I couldnt see anything My clothes were rolled up over my face There was pinhole of light thats all I had So I didnt know what was what Im very thankful I didnt know added Everett who suffered some doozy bruises and a scraped knee when she landed otherwise intact after their chute opened Terry Hatfields lifelong dream of riding a bull resulted in his breaking both ankles and an arm In  the yearold Huntsville Ala man climbed on to a pound animal that began bucking before they exited the starting pen causing the injuries Hatfield said later that moment had been   Some emergency medical technicians believe a lot of bucketlisters could attack their ventures far more safely  though many EMTs are similarly adrenaline junkies and they grudgingly respect the daredevil efforts of the oldsters  We talk about it They could stretch or hydrate or train properly  they could have done things to prevent blownout knees and ripped hamstrings said Roy Poteete vice president of the US First Responders Association and a retired firefighter and EMT who lives in Missouri  But arent bungee jumping parachuting and mountain scaling simply hobbies that exceed the technical knowhow and physical skills of some folks  You are correct sir Poteete said  In fact there currently are no medicalpractice guidelines as to which bucketlist items are considered safe or age appropriate so advice often comes down to the intuition of individual physicians said Carl Foster director of the human performance laboratory at the University of Wisconsin Lacrosse He recently chaired an American College of Sports Medicine symposium of doctors discussing the perils of bucket lists  A lot of people identify with the concept of Geez I havent done this in my life and Im willing to take the risk Thats really the guts of this thing If you look at  which the term came from it gets at Im close enough to the end and Im making the active choice Foster said  By the same token the people who have to take care of them who have to bail them out of bad situations probably wish they prepared or had thought better of it As for Everett shes still scratching lines off her bucket list Last year she rode shotgun in a NASCAR vehicle for several laps at a California racetrack  I figured we were doing  mph at least she said When we got out I told the driver I could have gone faster
