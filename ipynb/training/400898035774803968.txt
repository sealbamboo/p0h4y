The world needs to be prepared for unpredictable pandemics from viruses making the leap from animals to people scientists in Taiwan say Their warning follows the first reported case of a common bird flu HN being detected in a woman earlier this year  The patient recovered and no other cases have been detected But the   said intensive monitoring of bird flu was needed In May  the first human case of an HN bird flu was detected in a woman in Taiwan One of her neighbours bred ducks geese and chickens  although the precise source of the infection has not been detected Many subtypes of influenza such as those that cause seasonal flu or the swine flu pandemic are known to infect people but HN is not one of them  The report by the Centres for Disease Control in Taiwan said The occurrence of a human case of HN infection shows the unpredictability of influenza viruses Our report highlights the need for influenza pandemic preparedness  including intensive surveillance for ever evolving avian influenza viruses Prof Wendy Barclay from Imperial College London said these infections may have happened in the past but improved technology had meant this one had been discovered She said  Is this a truly new thing or are we now just better at seeing it She told the BBC she expected far more of these cases to be reported in the next few years as more hospitals were geared up to look for novel bird flus  Prof Barclay added This is a single case with no evidence of human transmission but as always we should keep an eye on it and do studies to see how close it is to being able to spread between humans
