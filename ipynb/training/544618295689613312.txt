Dr Kent Brantly considers himself a lucky man He was diagnosed with Ebola five months ago while working with Christian aid group Samaritans Purse at a hospital in Liberias capital Monrovia He became so sick that he thought he was going to quit breathing After  days of hospitalization in Liberia and  days at Emory University hospital in Atlanta Brantly was released on August   Ebolafree His doctors told him that itd take one to three days for every day he spent in the hospital to fully recover Another three months went by before he began to feel like himself again Im pretty fortunate to be back to normal that quickly Brantly told NPRs Melissa Block during an interview Monday on   Anytime a person is critically ill for that long it takes the body a long time to recover But that doesnt mean hes been taking it easy During those months Brantly has traveled to conferences and seminars mainly in Washington DC speaking of what needs to be done to combat Ebola Here is an edited excerpt of his conversation with NPR For about three weeks after my release from the hospital I felt bad My mind felt good and so I would try to be active After a day of activity I would be totally wiped out Id be dizzy nauseated even felt a little feverish at times I was incredibly fatigued The last time    that was the first week of activity where at the end I said Hey I dont feel bad I still didnt feel great but I didnt feel bad and that was a big step forward Im sure thats possible for some There are a lot of health care providers in this country who have a very deep sense of service and compassion for the suffering of others who are motivated to go to West Africa despite the risks of infection and death And doctors and nurses face those risks every day regardless of their setting We need to remove all the barriers we can to allow them to go serve I think fear of Ebola is one of the factors preventing some from going to West Africa to help but I dont think its the biggest barricade To a lot of people its fear of how theyll be treated when they come back  not knowing whether their job will be secure or whether their family and friends will look at them differently Its understandable Ebolas a terrifying disease But the level of hysteria was unnecessary I think its similar to the fear we see in West Africa just a different permutation In West Africa how fear is expressed is that people deny they have Ebola or that Ebola is real They try to come up with other explanations for the problems around them In this country it was kind of the opposite We were afraid that everything was Ebola or that everyone was going to get Ebola But both of those responses are out of fear instead of knowledge Its a good thing that this is still a conversation in our government and in our public People are still dying every day in West Africa from Ebola and that sense of urgency I expressed back in September is still very much there I appreciate what   magazine has done putting Ebola fighters back in the news and keeping the outbreak in the headlines We run the risk of going from hysteria to a sense of indifference And I think that is even more dangerous than our fear  when we stop caring about whats happening on the other side of the world This outbreak is a threat to the health of the world in a way we havent seen in recent decades And its bringing to light the fact that there is no wellorganized international response for something on this scale Hopefully those lessons will not be learned in vain I think every day about going back but I feel like Ive been given a platform through my experiences to be a voice here in this country for people in West Africa If I were in West Africa right now Id be treating  or  patients a day Hopefully through my activities here I can have an impact that will benefit thousands of people Eventually when all this is over well go back to the work we were doing before My yearold son prays every night for his best friend who is the same age  our next door neighbor in Liberia a little Liberian boy Dear God please dont let him get Ebola Im proud of him for thinking about his friend and praying for him but thats not a prayer that a yearold should have to consider  We do He and his mother are doing okay for now We still have a lot of friends and colleagues who are in the trenches working night and day in Liberia to fight this outbreak We pray for them every day A lesson Ive learned through all of this is that we need to worry about the people we dont know just as much as we worry about the people we do know
