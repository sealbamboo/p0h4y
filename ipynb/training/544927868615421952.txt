WASHINGTON—The Senate confirmed Vivek Murthy as U.S. surgeon general on Monday, despite opposition from antigun-control groups concerned about his comments that gun violence is a U.S. public health issue.. Dr. Murthy’s nomination was opposed by both Republicans and some Democrats over the gun issue, opposition that stalled his confirmation vote for months, leaving the public-health post unfilled while the U.S. government wrestled with issues such as the global Ebola outbreak.
