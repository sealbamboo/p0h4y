Flip open any cycling magazine and you might think only skinny goodlooking white people ride bikes But increasingly that doesnt reflect the reality Communities of color are embracing cycling And as a fastgrowing segment of the cycling population theyre making themselves far more visible Theres a story that Veronica O Davis likes to tell about why she started a cycling group for black women She was pedaling past a public housing complex near her Washington DC neighborhood one day when a young black girl shouted to her mother Mommy mommy its a black lady on a bike At first I was like Why is she so excited And I realized Im probably the first cyclist that she saw who looked like her said Davis That one small experience led to a Twitter message which then led to a Facebook group Two years later and now  women strong   is a fullblown cycling movement And its not alone Minority cycling groups are sprouting all over the country Theres the National Brotherhood of Cyclists We Bike NYC in New York and Ciudad de LucesCity of Lights in Los Angeles A recent report by the League of American Bicyclists cites people of color as   Bicycle commuting rates in those communities are growing too The leagues Hamzat Sani says thats not surprising Youll see a lot of thirdshift lateshift folks or restaurant workers engaged in cycling because public transportation doesnt work when they get off of work But those arent the cyclists wed see in a magazine right said Sani With Black Women Bike DC Davis works to change the perception of just who is a cyclist Its not just spandexclad weekend warriors riding speed carbon fiber bikes Its moms who want to ride with their kids Its women who are training for their first triathlon And its utilitarian commuters like her Davis bicycle commutes  miles to and from work nearly every day Todays ride to downtown DC is a little breezy Nothing she cant handle though People joined for different reasons Some people joined with the message of I thought I was the only one Or Hey Ive been thinking about biking but I didnt have anyone to bike with  Davis said Part of their mission is to make cycling more accessible whether its for fun fitness or transportation That means addressing big issues like cycling infrastructure and street safety or more trivial personal issues like how to prevent helmet hair which can become a barrier for some minority women Its always a big issue The secret to biking and having good hair is a satin scarf It cannot be any other type of scarf For a lot of black women we sleep in satin scarves Davis said More and more groups like Davis are popping up around the country These groups are part cycling club part social movement Sani recalls a group ride in Atlanta with Red Bike and Green an AfricanAmerican cycling collective It was very powerful to have a group like  or  riders who were all black rolling through a predominately black community on a bike Sani said In many innercity neighborhoods there arent even bike shops  and cultural barriers remain Sani has heard time and again from his peers in the black community that black people dont bike If you look at the history its just not true Sani said And there are new groups emerging that are really pushing and changing the face of cycling as we see it Marc Sani no relation to Hamzat is the publisher of   a trade publication Primarily cycling has been mostly a white sport much like skiing in that sense he says Regardless of roadblocks groups like Black Women Bike DC are trying to raise the profile of bike riding in minority communities And as the number of black Latino and Asian cyclists in this country grows more riders will be able to see themselves reflected as they pedal around town
