This hamburger patty recipe will make you a burger pro in no time. In just six steps you’ll learn the ins and outs of making the perfect hamburger patty. Starting with ground chuck and making sure not to overwork the meat will yield juicy results.  This will give you the low-down on grilling burger patties, but if you’re staying indoors and don’t have a grill pan, get a stainless steel skillet nice and hot, add a little oil,  and sear the patties to your preferred doneness. . To make 4 succulent beef patties, start with 1¼ pounds of ground chuck (85 percent lean or less). Then heat your grill to medium-high.. Divide the meat and gently form it into 4 balls. (Don’t overwork the meat or it will become dry and tough.) . If you are making cheeseburgers, add your chosen cheese 2 minutes before the burger is done and cook with the grill covered.. To get that oozing, melted effect everyone craves, be sure the cheese you’re using is properly prepped. Firm cheeses (Cheddar, Swiss, American) should be sliced or grated; soft cheeses (fresh goat, Feta, blue) should be crumbled.
