From the selfaffirmations of Stuart Smalley on  to countless videos on YouTube saying nice things to your reflection in the mirror is a selfhelp trope thats been around for decades and seems most often aimed at women The practice were told can help us like ourselves and our bodies more and even make us more successful  allow us to chase our dreams Impressed but skeptical I took this selftalk idea to one of the countrys leading researchers on body image to see if its actually part of clinical practice  is a psychologist and clinical director at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania He says that in fact a mirror is one of the first tools he uses with some new patients He stands them in front of a mirror and coaches them to use gentler more neutral language as they evaluate their bodies Instead of saying My abdomen is disgusting and grotesque  Sarwer explains hell prompt a patient to say  My abdomen is round my abdomen is big its bigger than Id like it to be  The goal he says is to remove negative and pejorative terms from the patients selftalk The underlying notion is that its not enough for a patient to lose physical weight  or gain it as some women need to  if she doesnt also change the way her body looks in her minds eye This may sound weird Youre either a size  or a size  right Not mentally apparently In   from the Netherlands scientists watched women with anorexia walk through doorways in a lab The women they noticed turned their shoulders and squeezed sideways even when they had plenty of room Their internal representation  their brain perspective on their body  is that the body is much much bigger than in fact it is says   a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania He says studies like this one arent actually new At least as far back as  for example the aptly named Dr Henry Head and Dr Gordon Morgan Holmes  two neurologists  published a   exploring the bodybrain connection But they didnt look at people with anorexia They used an example of the kind of hats that were then in vogue which were these big hats with big feathers at the top says Coslett Holmes and Head noticed that when women who habitually wore the big hats walked through doors they ducked  even when not wearing the hat Coslett says Their mental self was wearing the hat even if their physical self wasnt  just as anorexic women in the Netherlands study saw themselves carrying a bigger body Neuroscientists are still trying to understand exactly how this works Its clear that we all have an internal representation of our own bodies Coslett says We need that very specific sense of ourselves to understand how much space we take up  so we can walk and not bump into things or perform simple tasks like reaching out a hand and picking up a coffee cup Studies show that this internal sense of oneself is a powerful thing Research on what neurologists call   indicates that the same neurological networks are used both to   movement and to actually move And   over and over can have the same effect on our brains as practicing it physically  as well as lead to similar improvements in performance What Coslett wants to understand  and hes just starting to study this now  is how people with eating disorders get their mental image of their body so wrong adding inches to their thighs butts and bellies By understanding exactly how this misperception works he hopes to gain insight into how to bring closer to reality the mental body image of someone struggling with anorexia or bulimia  or just a poor selfimage So far evidence that the words you say to yourself could change the way you see yourself is still limited to the selfreports of patients and the effect on brain physiology hasnt yet been studied But Coslett thinks selftalk probably does shape the physiology of perception given that other sensory perceptions  the intensity of pain for example or whether a certain taste is pleasing or foul or even    can be strongly influenced by opinions assumptions cultural biases and blind spots So maybe selftalk   more than a confidence booster From a neuroscience perspective it might be more like internal remodeling But to get the benefit the specific words you use seem to matter too it turns out Research   this year suggests that talking to yourself and using the word I could stress you out instead of bringing on waves of selflove and acceptance Psychologist   of the University of Michigan led the work studying the pronouns people use when they talk to themselves silently inside their minds What we find Kross says is that a subtle linguistic shift  shifting from I to your own name  can have really powerful selfregulatory effects In other words it changes the way you feel and behave Kross had this idea when he was driving in the car and did something not smart he says  like running a red light And I immediately said to myself Ethan you idiot  he recalls But because hes a psychologist Ethan you idiot turned into Huh thats interesting Why did I talk to myself in the third person using my own name He soon noticed other people doing the same thing When LeBron James for example talked about his decision to leave Cleveland for the Miami Heat back in  Koss noticed that James created distance from himself in his use of language I wanted to do what was best for LeBron James the star athlete said and what LeBron James was going to do to make him happy Take a look  did the same thing in an interview with  s John Stewart when she recounted around  minutes into   wrestling internally with her decision to speak out against the Taliban Koss decided to do an experiment to see what would happen if nonfamous people were instructed to try the same technique He asked volunteers to give a speech  with only five minutes of mental preparation As they prepped he asked some to talk to themselves and to address themselves as I Others he asked to either call themselves you or to use their own names as they readied their speeches Kross says that people who used I had a mental monologue that sounded something like  Oh my god how am I going do this I cant prepare a speech in five minutes without notes It takes days for me to prepare a speech  People who used their own names on the other hand were more likely to give themselves support and advice saying things like Ethan you can do this Youve given a ton of speeches before These people sounded more rational and less emotional  perhaps because they were able to get some distance from themselves I actually tried this And I noticed when I talked to myself using my own name I got some   distance in my minds eye As I talked I actually saw myself in the room where I was sitting from a flyonthewall perspective The same thing happens to other people Weve done studies that look at exactly that phenomenon says Kross And your experience is borne out by our data Its almost like you are duping yourself into thinking about you as though you were another person Being an outsider in this way has real benefits As LeBron James might tell you with some distance its a lot easier to be kinder to that   person  series
