Starting just after midnight residents of Sierra Leone will be confined to their homes for a threeday lockdown Its the latest government plan meant to stem the tide of Ebola cases which    last week in Sierra Leone But the plan has not won the support of the international medical community  and is causing concern among Sierra Leoneans as well Everyone is rushing to the markets and stores to stock up on food to get ready for these three days when theyre not going to be allowed to leave their houses says NPRs Anders Kelto reporting from Freetown the capital city Stephen Gaojia head of the Ebola Emergency Operations Center in Sierra Leone bristles at the word lockdown He says  volunteers have been recruited and trained to go doortodoor throughout the country educating families about Ebola Earlier this month the governments health ministry said it would actively seek out Ebola patients but now it says it wont This process is not a lockdown neither is it a shutdown neither is it a rootout exercise Gaojia told   Wednesday This is more a psychoeducational exercise Instead Gaojia says its a time for people to stay together to do some reflection engage in prayer generate some kind of family discussion about Ebola A   from the Emergency Operations Center called it a housetohouse Ebola talk or Ose to Ose Ebola Tok in Krio a local language We want to help rebuild public confidence and trust in the public health care system Gaojia says International medical professionals think the plan could backfire Large scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers Doctors Without Borders said in a statement earlier this month when the government first announced its plans This is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems In response to such criticism Gaojia says The risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of doing something But a quarantine in a Liberian slum neighborhood in August   And says Doctors Without Borders in their statement Without enough beds to treat patients who have Ebola we will fail to stop it spreading even further What Sierra Leone and Liberia urgently need are more beds in case management centers and they need them now Gaojia says the Emergency Operations Center estimates the country will see a surge of about  to  percent of the cases that we have had  anywhere between  or more nationwide But even with   Red Cross facility in Kenema the countrys third largest city there arent enough beds at treatment centers Instead there are holding centers which many people view as places where suspected Ebola patients go to die alone These holding centers are very bare bones says Kelto They dont have IVs they dont have saline solution to keep people hydrated they dont have medicine to treat diarrhea or to stop vomiting So essentially its no different than just lying at home in your own bed In the meantime the prospect of a lockdown has caused a spike in food prices in Freetown Everything is so expensive double the price says Miriam Kallom a shopper in Freetown Thats a problem in one of the worlds   where many live on daytoday wages The health ministry plans to send over  teams of four people each to go doortodoor throughout Sierra Leone to disseminate information on Ebola virus and enlist family and community support to participate in the response process Gaojia says Each team will include a healthcare worker community volunteer and possibly a youth within the community Gaojia says that they will be using an encouragement approach telling people who may be ill or who have ill family members to call a hotline so a rapid response team can transport them to a holding center where they can be tested for Ebola Military people police and soldiers are not the face of this campaign at all says Gaojia Of course the police and military will be in readiness in the event of any lawlessness The volunteer teams are set to work between  am and  pm In the evening people will be able to move three to four doors from their homes Vehicular movement will still be restricted We dont expect Sierra Leoneans to refuse Sidie Yahya Tunis communications director for the health ministry of Sierra Leone   BBC earlier this month You follow or else youll be breaking the law If you disobey then you are disobeying the president Initially the plan was for the volunteer teams to reach every single house in the country of  million Now their aim is to visit  million households each of which will get a bar of soap The only protective equipment the volunteers will carry Gaojia says is rain gear
