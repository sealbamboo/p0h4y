One of the worlds top universities is taking a smoking ban a step further this week as Stanford University prohibits the sale of tobacco as well as smoking on campus Campus shops at the Californian university will have to end the sale of all tobacco products from  March Parts of the university already have an outdoor as well as indoor smoking ban The university says allowing tobacco sales is inconsistent with its work on promoting health It means that retail outlets such as the students union and a petrol station will have to stop selling tobacco  including cigarettes ecigarettes and chewing tobacco This highprofile US university which has been a launch pad for many Silicon Valley industries is the latest US university to tighten its prohibitions on smoking The university in Californias Bay Area has nearly  buildings and occupies more than  acres It regularly appears in the top fives of global university league tables The smoking rules at Stanford were updated three years ago so that as well as an indoor smoking ban it was not allowed within m of a building and was not allowed at outdoor athletic events There is a total ban on outdoor smoking at the universitys school of medicine The latest restrictions will mean that from next week it will no longer be possible to buy tobacco in any form at the university The university is an advocate for the health and wellbeing of its entire community and tobacco sales are inconsistent with our many programmes that support healthy habits and behaviours said assistant vice president Susan Weinstein Professor Gerard Hastings of the Centre for Tobacco Control Research at Stirling University says he is not aware of any similar sales bans at UK universities but it is a natural progression from smoking bans As well as reducing the availability of cigarettes it also makes a symbolic statement he says We should be asking questions about anyone who wants to sell this stuff says Prof Hastings In the UK the most recent debates about smoking on campus have been about whether ecigarettes should be included in smoking bans But there are also rules about how close smoking is allowed to university buildings For example Exeter University says that smoking should not take place within m of university buildings However the university does permit smoking in staff residential accommodation Warwick bans smoking including ecigarettes inside all its buildings and university vehicles and has a m exclusion zone from the entrance to buildings Sussex and Surrey universities allow smoking within m of buildings and Surrey also makes an exception for performers where the artistic integrity of a performance makes it appropriate Simon Clark director of the smokers group Forest warned against Stanford taking the war on tobacco to such extreme lengths It sends the message that American colleges are increasingly illiberal preferring prohibition to education which is bizarre he said If they wont defend peoples right to buy a legal product it also calls into question their commitment to defend other rights like freedom of speech or assembly Banning the sale of tobacco wont stop students smoking It could make it cooler because the university is effectively driving it underground
