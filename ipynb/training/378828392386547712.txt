Timmy ONeill is guiding Steve Baskis through ancient yellow pines that almost touch the sky Theyre hiking all day to base camp in Californias Yosemite National Park  feet up in Little Yosemite Valley Taking Baskis by the hand ONeill traces the distant ridge of Half Dome a bald rock rising almost a mile from the valley floor Thats tomorrows challenge Baskis cant actually see the peak Four years ago a bomb blast in Iraq took his eyesight So ONeill is guiding Baskis along the trail providing directions and warning him away from steep drops When they reach the base camp ONeill guides Baskis right into the Merced River for a bracing dip Much of the nation marked the th anniversary of Sept  with the reading of victims names or moments of silence But Baskis and a group of  fellow veterans commemorated the date in a less solemn way  by climbing two peaks at Yosemite ONeill is a pretty famous rock climber Hes cofounder of an adaptiveclimbing nonprofit called Paradox Sports which helps people with disabilities enjoy outdoor activities The veterans climbs of Half Dome and El Capitan are this years highlights Coming out here and climbing  You put together a team youve got objectives and a mission maybe summit a peak and to come home alive Baskis explains So youve got gear youve got friends teammates I guess I attach it to the military somewhat but its camaraderie Baskis continues I feel less disabled when I go do this stuff Because hes blind Baskis   to do this as part of a group  but its more fun when its a group of vets Its awesome to go with other veterans who have similar experiences and to share the wilderness and then share stories  about how you survived and how youve overcome your injury he says Sharing those stories seems just as important as reaching the peak Army veterans Nate Watson and Andrew Sullens talk all the way Both men served in Kapisa Province Afghanistan Thats where Sullens got as he describes it blown up  and lost his right leg Hes hoofing up the mountain on a prosthesis and hes in a bit of a hurry I dont expect that Im going to live a long long healthy life Ive treated myself pretty rough If Im gonna get anything done I feel like Ive got a little bit narrower time frame to get it done When Im  or  that stump may not be able to take it So might as well get it done now Watson also got shot in Afghanistan through his left arm It left his hand partially paralyzed Some vets on this trip have less visible wounds  traumatic stress and brain injuries from explosions But no matter their wounds by days end each one of the hikers has reached base camp The next morning Sept  the group breaks camp at  am Andrew Sullens and Nate Watson strap on headlamps Allowing for wrong turns in the dark its four hours to the west face of Half Dome Army Major DJ Skelton the other cofounder of Paradox Sports is climbing with them During the second assault on Fallujah Iraq an ambush left him with one eye and bullet scars all over his body Sometimes Skelton says the harder the climb the better At some point along the way  Im sure we all got there yesterday  it just sucks Skelton says You gotta reach deep  Its too much to take it all in so well just take it bit by bit  Well welcome to life At the base of the slab everyone clips into ropes Timmy ONeill the professional climber coaches them Youre going to go to your right and then step down and hang he instructs Watson Perfect The vets find tiny hand and footholds in the rock The cliff reaches straight up more than  feet overhead Halfway up Sullens ties his prosthetic leg to his belt after it nearly slips off from all the sweat Watson is using his bad arm just for balance  he cant grip with it Skelton brings up the rear Slowly methodically the men creep up the face of the rock It takes hours And then theyve made it Theyre at the top  and already thinking about what to climb on Sept
