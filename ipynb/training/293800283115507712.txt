Tuesday marks the th anniversary of   the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion But in some states access to facilities that perform abortions remains limited In part that stems from another Supreme Court ruling from  years ago that let states impose regulations that dont cause an undue burden on a womans abortion rights Texas for instance requires that a woman seeking an abortion receive a sonogram from the doctor who will be performing the procedure at least  hours before the abortion During the sonogram the doctor is required to display sonogram images and make the heartbeat audible to the patient The law went into effect on Feb   Carolyn Jones had an abortion two weeks later It thrust her into the complicated world of abortion politics and led her to write an article in the  titled  Following that articles publication Jones wrote a series for the   examining the impact of cuts to family planning services in Texas Jones reported that since the state Legislature voted in  to cut Texas family planning program by twothirds  clinics lost state funds and more than  of those clinics closed Jones talks about these cuts with   Terry Gross and tells the story of her own encounter with the sonogram law Pregnant with her second child Jones went for a routine sonogram and was told by her doctor that he was worried about the shape of her babys head A second sonogram that day at a specialists office revealed a problem that was preventing her sons brain spine and legs from developing correctly The specialist warned that if the child made it to term he would suffer greatly and need a lifetime of care Jones and her husband decided she would have an abortion Although shed had two sonograms that day the new Texas law required that she get another administered by her abortion doctor and listen to a statemandated description of the fetus she was about to abort Four days after that sonogram the state issued technical guidelines for its new mandatory sonogram law indicating that if a fetus has an irreversible medical condition as Jones did the pregnant woman does not have to hear a description of the sonogram In her article Jones asks What good is a law that adds only pain and difficulty to perhaps the most painful and difficult decision a woman can make Jones tells Gross The politicians wanted women to have the sonograms so that they can see the life of the child that they are about to end so its an entirely ideological justification for why a woman would have to have a sonogram
