It costs  for an American to have a hip replacement in Belgium in the US its closer to  Americans pay more for health care than people in many other developed countries and Elisabeth Rosenthal is trying to find out why The   correspondent is spending a year investigating the high cost of health care The   in her series Paying Till It Hurts examined what the high cost of colonoscopies reveals about our health care system the   explained why the American way of birth is the costliest in the world and the   published this week in   told the story of one man who found it cheaper to fly to Belgium and have his hip replaced there than to have the surgery performed in the US Rosenthal has also been investigating why costs for the same procedure can vary so much within the US  by thousands of dollars in some cases  depending on where its being performed Before becoming a journalist Rosenthal trained as a doctor and worked in the emergency room of New York Hospital now part of New YorkPresbyterian Hospital She joins  s Terry Gross to talk about why American medical bills are so high and what needs to change The purpose is to make Americans aware of the costs we pay for our health care Because so many of us have insurance and we dont see the bills we tend to think of health care as free Why not get that colonoscopy It doesnt cost anything Whats the difference if my hip replacement costs  Im not paying But in fact were all paying And as we know health care is a huge cause of individual bankruptcies now Copays and deductibles are going up and the nation  because it pays for a lot of medical care and subsidizes a lot of medical care  just cant afford the way were doing this anymore In Belgium he paid  for everything That included his new hip implant the surgeons fees the hospital fees a week in rehab and a roundtrip plane ticket from the US soup to nuts Now if he had done that surgery in the US it wouldve been billed at somewhere between  and  at a private hospital  So theres a huge difference In fact this gentleman Mr Shopenn was a great consumer and he tried to have it done in the US and he priced out joint implants and found that the wholesale joint implant cost  was  So in the US for that  he could get a joint  a piece of metal and plastic and ceramic  whereas in Europe he could get everything You would think that if five different companies were making candy bars that would drive the price of candy bars lower But if five different companies are making joints and trying to sell them at  a piece its really in no ones interest to say Hey guess what guys Im going to sell mine for  because thats what it really costs me to make it Because then everyone loses money the whole industry kind of implodes Its hard to get the companies to say standardize the equipment  so you can use a generic system to implant any brand of joint Its not in their interest to do that Its like saying to Apple and Microsoft We want all of your programs to be completely interchangeable At some level at a business level you want your brand distinct and you want to keep people in the universe of your brand In many ways its a business decision as much as a medical decision Routinely for most procedures in other countries patients stay in the hospital longer their hospital bills are much less They tend to see things as a package I think one of the most striking things when you look at the Belgian hospital bill as opposed to the US one is on the US hospital bill for a joint replacement you see things like operating room fees recovery room fees And those were on one of the bills I looked at operating room fees  recovery room fees  facility fees xthousand dollars If you look at a European bill those things dont exist And you know in fact it was kind of funny when I started on this series  although sad in another way  when I would call some of the European hospitals and say Well whats your facility fee on that Whats your operating room fee and there was this puzzled pause at the other end of the line where they said What do you mean an operating room fee You cant do the surgery without an operating room Thats a part of our day rate for the hospital Its all included  Because we pay one by one by one we have this kind of moreisbetter attitude or Why not check and see if the baby is in good position Why not check and see if the baby is growing Whereas in most other countries the care of a pregnant woman is kind of dictated purely by medicine what needs to be done So its not that in these European countries they arent getting their prenatal testing and theyre not getting their prenatal scans  they are theyre just not getting as many as we do Because we kind of tend to use a lot of them for liketoknow rather than needtoknow and again that gets very very expensive Every part of the system needs to rethink the way its working Or maybe what Im really saying is we need   system instead of   components each one having its own financial model and each one making a profit
