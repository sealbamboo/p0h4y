A little selfcriticism is a good thing It can be a reality check that spurs you to be a better person But there is a vast difference between I need to work out more which sparks your motivation and Im a jiggly blob Excessive selfcriticism tends to backfire because it leads us to focus on our socalled failures instead of the small ways that we could have improved says psychologist Tamar E Chansky PhD author of   And over the long term studies show self trashtalk is associated with higher stress levels and even depression Happily there are many ways to muzzle that inner critic for good When were beating ourselves up a tiny blunder is inflated into an epic typhoon of failure So the next time a negative thought intrudes take a few deep breaths and then quickly narrow it down and put your problems into the smallest box possible Chansky says If you think you screwed up in a meeting instead of saying Im an idiot I ruined my career say Man I used a poor choice of words Visualizing that box can really help Seeing a tiny box in your mind shows the actual size of the problem and helps you feel more confident that you can take it on We feel a lot of pressure to turn it all around and make it positive Chansky says But research has found that when youre down and out and force yourself to say positive things to yourself you end up feeling worse Thats because our internal lie detector goes off She suggests a technique called possible thinking which involves reaching for neutral thoughts about the situation and naming the facts Im a fat cow becomes Id like to lose  pounds I know how to do it The facts give you a lot more choices and directions you can go in Lets say in a meeting you blurt out that your Spanx are too tight You think Ive just made the biggest fool of myself Challenge your version of the story Did everyone really recoil in horror or were most of them actually tapping on their BlackBerrys under the table Make the choice to be kind to yourself by questioning your initial thoughts which is key to slowing down that voice says Amy Johnson PhD a psychologist and life coach The more followups you ask yourself the more you dilute the shameful moment A simple semantic tweak can actually change your outlook Chansky says Instead of telling yourself Im so disorganized Ill never get anything done train yourself to say Im having a thought that Im not going to get it done It may sound silly but this little change of wording gives you distance and reminds you that your low selfesteem moment is just that a moment I always tell people that saying Boy did I feel stupid rather than I am so stupid may seem like a nuance but theres a significant difference Young adds because the former describes how you feel not who you are A quick way to puncture nasty selftalk is to think of someone you trust and imagine what she would say to you Which is probably Oh please was it really that bad notes Chansky Did you really ruin your career in the meeting Another rule If you wouldnt say it to your friend dont say it to yourself You would neverat least we hope you would nevercall your friend a total slob for dribbling tomato sauce on her blouse Preferably a silly one Its hard to take that inner voice seriously when you call it The Nag Here comes The Nag again Bren Brown PhD a research professor at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work and author of   calls hers The Gremlin Chansky prefers The Perfectionist Naming it something goofy adds a bit of levity  she says which helps break through the emotional hold that anxiety has on you Over time this short circuits the whole anxious cycle Johnson likes to call these inner harangues   I love calling some tirade the my friends are better than me story or the I dont get enough done story she says Instead of feeling like its some kind of valid feedback this highlights how consistent the stories are We have pretty much the same thoughts today that we had yesterday which should clue us in to the fact that theyre habits not necessarily truths Shame only works if we keep it secret Brown says So if I get in the car after a party and thought I said something stupid I pick up the phone and say OK Im in a total shame downward spiralheres what happened She laughs At that moment youve basically cut shame off at the knees So find the courage to do the counterintuitive thing and tell someone what happenedinvariably those conversations end with laughter Its enormously freeing not to mention a huge stress reducer to stop holding yourself to insanely high standards Perfectionism is so destructive Brown says Ive interviewed CEOs and awardwinning athletes and not once in twelve years did I ever hear someone say I achieved everything I have because I am a perfectionist Never What she hears instead They credit their success to a willingness to mess up and move on
