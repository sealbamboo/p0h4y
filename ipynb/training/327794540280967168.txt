Dr Medha Munshi director of the geriatrics program at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston hears these and other gripes from her patients children all the time And theyre right to worry about diabetes which affects   Older diabetics face higher risks of such complications as heart attacks kidney disease and blindness theyre more likely than other seniors to wind up in nursing homes But Dr Munshis response often startles anxious relatives You can relax a little she often tells them Sometimes quality of life is more important than achieving a certain number Treatments and their risks and benefits play out differently in the elderly population she noted in a recent interview Diabetes is rarely the only ailment affecting people in their s and s most must cope with several chronic conditions along with their associated medications That makes keeping blood sugar at reasonable levels a complicated business Moreover treating diabetes too aggressively can make seniors more prone to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar For frail older people with multiple conditions the condition can be more dangerous than high blood glucose readings If it goes too low it can aggravate existing medical conditions like heart disease and cognitive disability Dr Munshi said Depending on which medication is prescribed it can make people dizzy so it increases the risk of falls and fractures A yearold who falls will probably get up uninjured she said while an  yearold can be harmed by the treatment of the disease itself The   which alerts doctors and patients to questionable and overused tests and treatments made the same point in February The American Geriatrics Society participating in the campaign cautioned against prescribing medications to reach tight glycemic control which the group defined as below  on the commonly used Ac test Dr Munshi assures family members that a  or  reading isnt as risky as it might appear The serious complications of diabetes   So while younger diabetes patients should work hard to prevent them for seniors with fewer years ahead we are not looking at tight control to prevent complications in  years she said You dont want to harm people today to avoid things that might not happen tomorrow Another reason to treat diabetes differently in older people They may find it increasingly difficult to manage the daily monitoring medications and dietary requirements No other disease requires as much selfcare Dr Munshi said Cognitive impairment that affects decisionmaking and memory depression that makes patients less able to handle selfcare worsening eyesight that makes it harder to use glucometers or syringes  all can make diabetes routines more challenging If we give patients complex regimens they wont be successful and will make errors Dr Munshi said In fact The New England Journal of Medicine just published data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Emory University and the National Institutes of Health showing that among diabetics over  without complications only about twothirds maintained target glucose levels when the Ac goal was  but   Among those with complications more than  percent met an  percent Ac target Older people generally did a better job at meeting their targets than younger groups by the way The trick is in understanding the barriers Dr Munshi said If patients are alone at home and likely to forget midday medications for instance her team may devise a different schedule or prescribe a combined insulin dose in the morning using a longeracting formulation Exercise is crucial but older patients have more trouble getting outside or to gyms and they may fear falls They think they have to walk fast for  minutes Dr Munshi said She urges them to start by walking inside their houses for five minutes before each meal Geriatric medicine involves compromises and balance It may not be the best way to treat diabetes but its the best way to treat the patient she said As for those occasional illadvised snacks Dr Munshi is fairly tolerant of those too If they want to eat something let them she said of her elderly patients Its not just one disease theyre dealing with Its life
