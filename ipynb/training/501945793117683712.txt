Many people who run or walk with their dogs treat them like human running partners offering them sips of Gatorade or half of a sports bar during a workout But the latest science about performance nutrition for canines underscores that dogs are not people They have more fur and cellular mitochondria the small structures in cells that generate energy lower body weights and fewer fecalrelated inhibitions than their human companions each of which affects their nutritional needs To learn more about sports nutrition for dogs I spoke recently with Dr Joseph Wakshlag a professor of clinical nutrition and sports medicine at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca NY and the author of a comprehensive new review about nutrition for active dogs   in Veterinary Clinics of North America Small Animal Practice Among its many tidbits of knowledge the article notes that dogs are endowed with more endurancerelated muscle fibers than cats making them better running companions competing in a Frisbee or agility competition is for a dog glorious fun but relatively little exercise requiring only about  percent more calories than lying on a rug and consuming sports drinks tends to cause dogs to empty their intestines soon afterward often with little warning This is all useful information as were Dr Wakshlags replies to my questions What follows are excerpts from our conversation How much exercise qualifies a dog as an athlete and do canine athletes have special dietary needs Its similar to human athletes There are sprinters acrobats marathon runners all with different nutritional considerations On the one hand you have earthdogs  the dachshunds and such  designed for fast short sprints and then there are sled dogs that run  miles or more Your typical running companion would be somewhere in between In general Id say that if a dog is running continuously for more than  minutes you should probably take a look at its diet in terms of performance Does that mean feed it like a human runner No Humans and dogs fuel exercise very differently When we run we start out burning mostly glycogen which is stored carbohydrates Dogs dont partly because they have more mitochondria in their muscles than we do Dogs burn fat as their primary endurance fuel and carbohydrates are not very important for them So theres no reason to give a dog a sports bar which is full of carbohydrates during a run No Same for those gel packets I see people sharing them with their dogs The dog may like it but its not helping its running Fat is the fuel for performance dogs So should an athletic dogs diet contain lots of fat Thats a good question For dogs jogging along with you for  minutes a few times a week a normal commercial dog food containing about  or  percent fat should be fine But if you and your dog run five or  miles a day that dog likely needs a slightly higherfat diet  There are special highperformance dog foods now that contain as much as  percent fat Or you can just add a teaspoon of olive oil to your dogs kibble That increases fat intake by  or  percent which can be plenty On the other hand fat is somewhat indigestible and can lead to greater fecal mass So if you increase your dogs fat intake be prepared to carry an extra plastic bag or two when you go running What about protein How important is it Vital Athletic dogs need protein to build and maintain muscle In general their diet should consist of at least  percent protein preferably from meat In one study dogs fed plantbased soy protein experienced far more musculoskeletal injuries than dogs consuming meat protein And treats Are they a good idea It depends on what else your dog is eating The biggest health problem for most dogs is overweight If you took your dog for a twomile walk and reward him with a MilkBone youve just given him more calories than he burned A pat on the head would be healthier Do you recommend rawfood diets which have become popular for dogs The rawfood diets available at pet stores are fine if expensive I do not recommend that people create their own rawfood diets at home Its difficult to include all of the necessary nutrients and there can be foodborne illnesses Any advice on hydration for exercising dogs Dogs dont sweat like we do They pant to cool themselves But they do lose fluids during activity On the other hand they are much better than most people at rehydrating We did a study with searchandrescue dogs working in degree heat They replaced their fluid losses almost drop for drop  My advice would be to make sure that water is available if youll be running with your dog for more than  minutes But dont share your Gatorade Dogs dont need carbohydrates or electrolytes and the only study I know of that tested sports drinks in dogs found that the main outcome was gastrointestinal distress
