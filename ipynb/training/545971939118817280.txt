Most of us dont remember our first two or three years of life  but our earliest experiences may stick with us for years and continue to influence us well into adulthood Just how they influence us and how much is a question that researchers are still trying to answer Two studies look at how parents behavior in those first years affects life decades later and how differences in childrens temperament play a role The   published Thursday in   found that the type of emotional support that a child receives during the first three and a half years has an effect on education social life and romantic relationships even  or  years later Babies and toddlers raised in supportive and caring home environments tended to do better on standardized tests later on and they were more likely to attain higher degrees as adults They were also more likely to get along with their peers and feel satisfied in their romantic relationships It seems like at least in these early years the parents role is to communicate with the child and let them know Im here for you when youre upset when you need me And when you dont need me Im your cheerleader  says   a psychologist and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Delaware who led the study Raby used data collected from  people who participated in the   All the participants were followed from birth until they turned  Researchers went into these kids home at times Other times they brought the children and their parents to the university and observed how they interacted with each other Raby tells Shots Of course parental behavior in the early years is just one of many influences and its not necessarily causing the benefits seen in the study While tallying up the results the researchers accounted for the participants socioeconomic status and the environment in which they grew up Ultimately they found that about  percent of someones academic achievement was correlated with the quality of their home life at age three Later experiences genetic factors and even chance explain the other  percent Raby says And a childs psychological makeup is a factor as well The second   also published in   found that childrens early experiences help predict whether or not they end up developing social anxiety disorder as teenagers  but only for those who were especially sensitive and distrustful as babies For this study researchers from the University of Maryland observed how  babies interacted with their parents When separated from their parents some got upset but quickly recovered when they were reunited Other babies had a harder time trusting their parents after a brief separation and they werent able to calm down after being reunited Those extrasensitive babies were more likely to report feeling anxious socializing and attending parties as teenagers So what does this all mean For one it means that human development is complicated according to   a professor of human development at the University of California Davis who was not involved in either study We know that our early experiences likely affect all of us to a certain extent Belsky says And we know that due to variations in psychological makeup some people are more sensitive to environmental factors than others But that doesnt mean people cant recover from bad childhood experiences For some therapy or medication may help Belsky says And its interesting because theres now other evidence suggesting that the very kids who succumb under bad conditions are the ones who really flourish under good ones
