Most of us have heard of the braineating amoeba You know the little guy that crops up in   and backyard swimming holes every now and then Now let me introduce you to its cousin the guteating amoeba This nasty critter can wreak havoc in your intestinal tract and cause a dreadful case of food poisoning that may last months or years Now scientists have figured out how this amoeba makes us sick Its tactics are more nefarious than we thought The singlecell animal bites off tiny chunks of intestine chews on them for a while and then spits them out microbiologists   Wednesday in the journal   Thats right folks the little parasites  called    dont even have the courtesy to kill your cells before they take a bite They dont even digest the parts they eat Internist   and his team at the University of Virginia caught all the treachery under the microscope They filmed a bunch of the amoebae munching down on both gut and red blood cells And they watched as the parasites used the chewandspit method to dismantle an intestinal wall The team named the process   from the Greek   or to nibble Pathogens have many options when it comes to upsetting our stomachs   and cholera secrete toxins Other protozoa hoard all the nutrients or trigger inflammation  thats how the braineating amoeba damages tissue So why does   choose such a vicious and wasteful strategy The microbiologists still dont know But one hypothesis is that the nibbling creates a more spacious environment for the amoeba to invade the intestine Petri and his team write They hope their findings will lead to better drugs against   one day Unlike braineating amoebae this parasite is common It causes   of cases of dysentery and colitis each year in tropical regions and developing countries
