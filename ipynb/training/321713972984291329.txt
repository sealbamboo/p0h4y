Theres lots of science trying to connect a babys birth date to health later in life Its usually about serious diseases that have no clear cause like schizoprenia autism and multiple sclerosis And its almost all junk science the medical equivalent of astrology Thats because though studies have shown a  between season of birth and disease for MS and other disorders theyve never been able to show how seasonal differences in peoples bodies or the environment could   disease Scientists in England say theyve taken a step closer to that showing that babies born in May have lower levels of vitamin D in their blood at birth and more circulating immune cells than do babies born in November Im convinced says   that the lack of vitamin D is a risk factor for   Ramagopalan is a researcher at the University of Oxford who led the study Hes been trying to find genetic and environmental causes of MS which damages the covering on nerves and can cause problems with movement vision and thinking Muchloved former Mouseketeer  had MS for decades and died of the disease this week at age  She was born on Oct  so wouldnt fit the springbaby scenario MS researchers have been looking at birth season and vitamin D because the disease is much more common in latitudes with little sunlight in winter such as Scandinavia the United Kingdom and Australia Less sunlight for Mom means less vitamin D in her blood for the baby in the works A low level of vitamin D could affect the developing immune system The researchers tested blood collected from  newborns in hospitals around London The researchers measured T cells immune system cells that are formed in the thymus gland They found that the May babies had twice as many T cells in their blood as did the November babies and  percent less vitamin D Ramagopalan speculates that some sort of imbalance or lack of regulation of the T cells might increase the risk of developing MS later in life These could potentially trigger a response against myelin in the brain he told Shots The   were published in   But there are lots of dots that remain to be connected here Theres no proof that the lower levels of Vitamin D could be causing the immune cell differences for instance But multiple sclerosis researchers and patients have become increasingly interested in lack of vitamin D as a potential cause Theres been a lot of buzz in the community says Nicholas LaRocca a vice president at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society A    in Australia found that lack of vitamin D and lack of sun exposure were both risk factors for nerve damage which can be an early symptom of MS The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is now funding a randomized  to see if giving  IU or  IU of vitamin D to people with MS can slow progression of the disease Vitamin D has been the it supplement of late with partisans suggesting that large doses of it can   a host of diseases including cancer and heart disease But US authorities including the Institute of Medicine and the US Preventive Services Task Force have been more cautious saying that theres little evidence of any effect Ramagopalan admits that theres a lot of hype around vitamin D and disease prevention I dont think its linked to everything But he thinks that healthy adults should be taking  international units a day of D just in case We need that much vitamin D he says Thats far more than the  IU a day for adults  by the Institute of Medicine in  and above the institutes  IU upper limit So this is definitely one of those stay tuned issues With luck the increased interest in vitamin D and disease for MS and many others will shake loose funding for randomized clinical trials that will do a better job of finding out if D is really a factor
