British scientists have made a major step forward in developing a blood test to predict the onset of Alzheimers disease Research in more than  people has identified a set of proteins in the blood which can predict the start of the dementia with  accuracy  The findings published in the journal Alzheimers  Dementia will be used to improve trials for new dementia drugs Experts warned that the test was not yet ready for doctors surgeries  Research into treatments for Alzheimers disease has been plagued by failure Between  and    Doctors believe the failure is down to treating patients when it is already too late since symptoms appear around a decade after the start of the disease Identifying patients earlier is one of the priorities for dementia research  The research group which combines university and industry scientists looked for differences in the blood of  healthy people  with mild cognitive impairment and  with Alzheimers disease They were able to tell with  accuracy which patients with mild cognitive impairment would go on to develop Alzheimers disease in the next year  We want to be able to identify people to enter clinical trials earlier than they currently do and thats really what weve been aiming at said lead researcher Prof Simon Lovestone from the University of Oxford However he said it may find a place in doctors surgeries in the future As long as there is no treatment one can question the value of a test but people come to the clinic because they want to know whats happening to them and I currently cant tell them He said he was forced to tell patients to come back in a year and see if their memory problems were any worse  Prof Lovestone added Thats grim its horrible you can only imagine what thats like for patients Although I have some real reservations about doing a test all I can say is there are some people who come to clinics asking precisely that question  Dr Ian Pike chief operating officer at Proteome Sciences said Having a protein test is really a major step forwards  It will take several years and need many more patients before we can be certain these tests are suitable for routine clinical use that process can start fairly quickly now Dr Eric Karran director of research at Alzheimers Research UK described the study as a technical tour de force However he warned the current accuracy levels risked telling healthy people they were on course to develop Alzheimers which may lead to anxiety and depression It is unlikely that the test would be used in isolation if it eventually makes its way into clinics A positive result could be backed up by brain scans or testing spinal fluid for signs of Alzheimers However Dr Karran did argue this was a step towards making Alzheimers a preventable disease  I think it does but not immediately This gives a better way to identify people who will progress to Alzheimers disease people who can be entered into clinical trials earlier I think that will increase the potential of a positive drug effect and thereby I think we will get to a therapy which will be an absolute breakthrough if we can get there  Its not a simple journey We all wish it was
