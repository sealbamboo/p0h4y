When she was just  Emily Gorospe became very tired and sick The spunky girl now  developed a fever that wouldnt go away and red blotches appeared across her body Shes got so much energy usually says Emilys mother Valerie Gorospe Just walking from one part of the house  she was drained The little girl was also very pale She just didnt look like herself Valerie recalls Emily who lives in Delano in Californias Central Valley was eventually diagnosed with   also known as coccidioidomycosis Shes one of an estimated  people nationwide who get the fungal disease every year There is no cure and no vaccine Valley fever is a fact of life in parts of California and Arizona Tiny fungal spores live in the soil throughout much of this arid region When the spores are disturbed they can be inhaled into the lungs  the medical director of infectious diseases at Childrens Hospital Central California says most people feel nothing or experience symptoms similar to the flu Common symptoms include fever night sweats weight loss chest pain cough and sometimes skin rashes Valley fever can be a very serious disease for some people McCarty says It can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body like the central nervous system bones or skin It can be lifealtering or even fatal About five out of  patients will develop pneumonia McCarty said Then in about one out of  patients valley fever will spread outside of the lungs and go to other parts of the body In recent years valley fever numbers have soared so high that some health officials are calling it an epidemic The disease has become   in Californias prisons The state is being ordered to move inmates at highrisk of contracting the illness from two prisons where the fungus is rampant The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the total number of valley fever cases nationwide rose by nearly  percent from  to  Researchers dont have a good explanation for the dramatic increase Even when accounting for growing populations throughout the Southwest the numbers are still staggering Whats really interesting  is that the number of cases  the incidence of these cases  increased steadily throughout this time period and really accelerated over the last few years says Benjamin Park a medical officer at the CDC Relatively little is known about valley fever No one knows how much exposure to the fungus it takes to contract the illness or why some people die and others never know they have spores in their lungs Its also unclear why the illness seems to strike AfricanAmericans and Filipinos harder than the rest of the population Researchers do know this People who work outside  like workers in construction and on farms  are at higher risk  a winemaker in Paso Robles Calif was running a bulldozer about  years ago A few days later he became very sick Doctors said he had an ordinary form of pneumonia and recommended that he go home and eat chicken soup It took them a month to realize he had valley fever and to start him on antifungal medication By that time the fungal infection had spread to his central nervous system I think if they had caught it early it would not have been allowed to disseminate through my body and set up shop in my brain and spinal cord Schaefer says Thats the killer right there Schaefer is  hell take antifungal medication for the rest of his life The medication has horrible side effects One of the worst ones for a winemaker is that Schaefer cant drink his own wine while on the drugs The drugs are keeping him alive he says but not necessarily healthy The disease saps his energy and prevents him from working more than four or five hours a day Its an antifungal poison he says It doesnt kill it It just keeps it down to a low roar McCarty says if the disease is caught early physicians have a better chance of keeping it at bay We do see patients in whom theres been a delay in diagnosis and we believe this leads to more complicated and difficulttotreat disease McCarty says Researchers say most cases are misdiagnosed or missed entirely Thats in part because of a lack of training and attention in the medical community and because the symptoms are so varied Part of the problem is a lack of research and attention from policymakers Diseases that receive a lot of national attention tend to be diseases that occur in the East and where they read about it in the newspapers says Dr   of the University of California San Francisco But diseases that dont exist in that belt really fall off the radar screen he says and unfortunately valley fever is one of those diseases Diseases that dont have a high profile also struggle for funding Consider this In the past  years the National Institutes of Health has granted valley fever just  percent of the research funding it has directed toward   But valley fever has afflicted about four times more people than West Nile with thousands more going undiagnosed Valley fever has killed many more people too Since he contracted valley fever  years ago Schaefer the Paso Robles winemaker has continued making awardwinning pinot noirs But even as his boutique winery prospers his health is faltering Hes losing his memory and the doctor expects he will suffer strokes and seizures in the future This disease is  not a fairytale he says Its an absolute nightmare As the search for better treatments and eventually a vaccine continues people throughout the Southwest United States will suffer from valley fever
