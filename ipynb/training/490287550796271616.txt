The AIDS community is in shock over the news that dozens of its members were aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that was apparently shot down Thursday The sorrow is particularly widespread over the death of   a Dutch researcher and advocate who played a pivotal role in the AIDS movement for more than three decades Weve lost one of the giants in our field says Dr   who heads the Harvard School of Public Health AIDS Initiative Weve lost a voice that I dont think is easily replaced Colleagues of Lange said his career embodied some of the most important shifts in the way scientists have approached the fight against HIVAIDS He gave patients and advocates more of a say in setting the research agenda and he worked with governments and businesses to ensure that breakthroughs in treatment become available to even the poorest patients Langes lifes work didnt just reflect the changes in AIDS Marlink says He led those changes Dr   who succeeded Lange for a twoyear term as president of the International AIDS Society in  agrees He could connect the dots between the different aspects of the HIV fight says Gayle who is now president of the nonprofit   There are some people who are just clinicians or some people who are just researchers or just on the prevention and behaviorial side or the social side He really understood it all And he was truly a scientist with a heart Lange who was  and headed the department of global health at the University of Amsterdam began his work on AIDS as a doctor and clinical researcher in the s His earliest contributions were scientific He was the lead architect of many early trials of antiretroviral therapy and studied how to prevent HIVpositive pregnant women from transmitting the virus to their babies Gayle describes this work as groundbreaking But she and others say Langes true genius lay in realizing the need to translate scientific efforts into the broader realworld context Oftentimes people on the research side dont think about the impact of policies on people Gayle says And thats something Lange cared deeply about From the start Lange pressed for researchers to move beyond Europe and the US and work in lowincome countries where the AIDS crisis was most acute He pioneered efforts in Thailand and later in parts of Africa Lange was also among the first in the scientific community to recognize the importance of listening to and engaging with patients and activists The two groups initially had little contact recalls   an advocate who first met Lange in the mids He was deeply committed to involving people living with HIV and also broader civil society in his discussions and meetings says Mellors now executive director for Africa at the nonprofit International HIVAIDS Alliance When it became clear that the US government wouldnt allow HIVpositive foreigners to attend the  conference of the   originally planned for Boston Lange helped organize the conference in the Netherlands He was also instrumental in pushing the society to hold its first conference in an African country  South Africa  in  Mellors says On his frequent trips to Africa Mellors says Lange made a point of checking in regularly with people who were HIVpositive not as patients but trying to get a sense of what their issues were what their needs and desires were Mellors says Lange valued the importance of community voice and he championed that in the way he worked Lange often mentored activists whom he deemed promising  reaching out to Mellors for instance to explain the science behind the research He made me realize I didnt have to be intimidated by science Mellors says And that in order to be effective as an activist I needed to understand and question the science Lange also took to heart the corollary of that insight  that to be effective as a scientist Lange would need to be an effective activist Mellors says Most recently for Lange this had meant working to increase access to medical care not just for HIVAIDS but more generally He was the founder of the   which aimed to put more doctors and nurses in subSaharan Africa The nonprofit has spun off a health insurance fund for Nigerians Tanzanians and Kenyans Colleagues said Langes success as an activist was largely a tribute to his personality His humor was dry and a bit wry but his manner was gentle Stories of Langes kindness abound He insisted on making Gayles frequent layovers in Amsterdam comfortable even though she would often arrive at dawn Lange would pick her up at  am and take her to his house for coffee a stroll a shower or quick nap Id always say Oh Joep its too early And hed say No no Ill be there  It will be hard for anyone to replace Lange Gayle says But she is confident that Langes inclusive style will ensure that his work will continue even after his death The thing about a good leader is that they dont try to do it all by themselves Gayle says They build teams And Joep has built great teams wherever hes gone So there are people who are poised and ready to take on the work that he started
