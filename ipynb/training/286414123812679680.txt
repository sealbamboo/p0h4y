Being a little overweight may tip the odds in favor of living a long life according to a new analysis Researchers say there may be some benefit to having a little extra body fat This isnt the first time researchers have raised questions about the link between body weight and how long someone will live While theres no debate that being severely obese will raise the risk of all kinds of illnesses and even cut some lives short its less clear what happens to people who are less overweight When Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to answer this question she wanted to include as many people as possible in her analysis  from as many places around the world as she could find We searched all the literature thousands of articles found almost  articles with  million people that really addressed this question headon Flegal says And she concludes that being overweight is actually associated with a lower risk of death Its certainly not dramatic but about a  percent decreased risk Its statistically significant Flegal says The   in the latest   the   So who are we talking about here A lot more people than you might think About onethird of all Americans fall into this category of overweight And Flegal found that even among those who are technically slightly obese there was no increased risk of death At a time when were bombarded with weightloss messages Flegal says it isnt popular to suggest that heavier people may live longer In fact a few years back when she published a paper that came to a similar conclusion her findings were attacked Our article got called rubbish and ludicrous Flegal says so it really opens you to lots of criticism I discovered much to my sorrow that this is kind of a flashpoint for people One of the experts who takes issue with Flegals conclusions is epidemiologist   of the Harvard School of Public Health He has read her new paper and says hes not buying it This study is really a pile of rubbish and no one should waste their time reading it he says Willett says its not helpful to look simply at how   or BMIs influence the risk of premature death as this paper did without knowing something about peoples health or fitness Some people are thin because theyre ill so of course theyre at higher risk of dying The study doesnt tease this apart Also he says the analysis doesnt address the bigger more important issues of quality of life If an overweight person does live longer  is he or she living with chronic diseases We have a huge amount of other literature showing that people who gain weight or are overweight have increased risk of diabetes heart disease stroke many cancers and many other conditions Willett says For those of you who want to know whether your body weight is a problem Willett says rather than comparing your BMI to those around you think about what you weighed when you were  years old For most people our ideal weight if we werent seriously overweight at age  is about what we weighed then Willett says Thats why weight change is a good number to keep an eye on It can be an early warning sign that youre on the path to more weight gain Not everyone is convinced the new paper is rubbish Dr Steven Hymsfield of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La says there are a couple of scenarios in which extra body weight might help people live longer If you fall and you fall on vulnerable bone like the hip having a little extra fat there might protect you from hip fracture Hymsfield says Or he says if an illness leaves you unable to eat extra body fat could be useful Hymsfield acknowledges this is just speculation He says while this paper wont end the debate over whether a little extra body fat could be a good thing it does show that the relationship between weight and health may be more complicated than just a simple calculation In an   accompanying Flegals paper Hymsfield and a colleague wrote that determining a persons BMI is only one step in figuring out future health risks
