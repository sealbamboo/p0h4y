Everyone who thinks about the socalled work force problem for the elderly can see big trouble coming Whos going to provide care for the growing number of old people who even with enormous efforts from family members will most likely need more help Or who dont have families And who prefer overwhelmingly to stay in their homes For now the workers who take on home care represent a polyglot group They work independently or through agencies they are largely underpaid and lack benefits they do a tough job and have high injury rates they run the gamut from inadequately trained to professionally skilled Already we dont have enough of them See underpaid above That we are still waiting to learn if the Obama administration will honor its pledge and at least provide them   handily demonstrates the problem These lowwage aides most of whom are women lack economic or political clout Their counterparts in nursing homes and assisted living facilities at least earn the minimum wage and overtime pay But there arent enough of those to serve an aging population either A few weeks ago I reported on one idea for tackling this problem the brainchild of Janice Lynch Schuster who envisioned   Ms Schuster and supporters did not get enough signatures on their We the People online petition to draw a White House response but she has been conferring with interested advocates businesses and community organizations to draft a more detailed plan for a caregiver corps compensated with college tuition credits debt forgiveness or small stipends Now a group of Northwestern University and Johns Hopkins health care researchers has come up with another idea recently published in The Gerontologist Recruit family members who already provide the bulk of elder care   after their responsibilities end a euphemism for when the older people they care for have died The benefits could flow in both directions I see firsthand the link between illness and poverty said Melissa Simon the lead author and an obstetriciangynecologist who works in a clinic for lowincome women at Northwesterns Feinberg School of Medicine When a family member becomes ill or disabled if theres not enough money or no insurance coverage for someone whos paid then someone in the family has to take care of that person Dr Simon told me When a lowincome caregiver leaves the work force cuts back hours or leaves school to provide care its an economic hit to a household that already doesnt have much economic reserve a blow that can be hard to recover from even after caregiving ends On the job as a caregiver you actually learn a lot of skills  whether its giving medications on a schedule or learning to transfer your loved one or bathe them Dr Simon said You also learn how to interact with a health care team You learn how to navigate the system She and her colleagues envision programs that would help family caregivers turn those experiences into marketable job skills by assessing their abilities providing additional training and credentials and connecting caregivers with a health care industry that will need hundreds of thousands of new employees Though initially family members might transition into entrylevel positions as certified nursing assistants they could also train for more technical jobs  as Xray technicians or phlebotomists say  or work in insurance and billing Some might become community health workers or patient advocates or advance to nursing and social work programs Were interviewing folks about this right now Dr Simon said People are saying theyd be interested if there really was a pathway to employment Lets acknowledge that for now entrylevel positions in elder care remain economically unattractive to those who have other options But higher wages benefits and a career ladder that encourages advancement could make those jobs more desirable Indeed as the job market slowly improves its hard to see how to fill these slots without such changes Besides many people enjoy interacting with older adults another skill they have acquired as family caregivers and take satisfaction in helping them have good lives And as the countrys ethnicity changes having skilled caregivers from many cultures who speak many languages represents a bonus While Dr Simon and colleagues continue to investigate how such programs might operate Ill ask those of you who have been in the elder care trenches Do people who have spent long periods as family caregivers really want to do more of it Perhaps make a career of it For now its just an idea But we are going to need lots of ideas
