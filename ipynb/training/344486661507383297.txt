Doctors are prescribing too many CT scans for children a study says even though they know that the radiation used in the tests increases childrens lifelong risk of cancer Choosing other tests and dialing back the radiation used in the scans would prevent  percent of related cancers according to   a biostatistician at the University of California Davis who led the study The use of CT or   scans which let doctors see soft tissue more than doubled in children under  from  to  The cancer risk is highest for children undergoing abdominal scans those were also the scans that involved the most radiation For girls  in  to  abdominal scans would cause a solid cancer later in life For boys the number is  in  to  The risk of getting leukemia after a head scan the most common form of CT for children is about  per  scans for children under age  the study found Doctors have long known that Xrays cause cancer and that children face a greater risk than adults But only in the past few years have they amassed evidence on how the huge increase in use of CTs is affecting health CT scanners use  to  times more radiation than a conventional Xray A   last year found that children who had a CT before age  had a slightly higher risk of leukemia and brain tumors Doctors do have alternatives Miglioretti says and parents should ask for them Ultrasound machines and MRI scanners can be as good as CT in detecting appendicitis she says Neither of those alternatives use Xray radiation the kind that can damage genetic material Plan old doctoring works too The most common CT scan in children is a head scan given after a blow to the head Miglioretti says Theres medical evidence that if you do a thorough exam and follow the rules you can avoid a lot of these scans for head trauma she says A lot of the CT scans used way more radiation than was needed Miglioretti and her colleagues found They discovered that by pulling  scans from patient records in group health plans a task she says was painful but necessary Reducing the highest  percent of doses could prevent  percent of CTcaused cancers the researchers say The   were published in   A slew of medical societies back the   which provides familyfriendly information on radiation doses and procedures Theres also a card parents can use to keep track of their childrens cumulative radiation exposure Among other risks scanning also raise the odds that doctors will finding something abnormal but not dangerous an editorial that accompanied the study points out These   can lead to more testing and treatments with no benefit and potential harm Parents should ask not only what a proposed imaging test is intended to detect but more importantly how such detection would help their child the doctors who wrote the commentary recommend The number of CT scans of children stopped rising in  which may reflect the fact that doctors are getting the message on the risks
