A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care a review by the regulator shows  The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission CQC of a host of data including death rates serious errors and patient surveys It found  out of  trusts fell into the two highest risk categories The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulators new hospital inspection regime which will see inspectors go into every trust by  The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first  will have been completed It will result in every trust being given a rating of either outstanding good requires improvement or inadequate as part of a shakeup in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal The CQC said the   was not a final judgement but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of screening He added Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts showing us where we need to focus our inspections The regulator has assessed each trusts performance against up to  different indicators Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic The number of risk scores they have  Bands one and two  those at highest risk  include  trusts and  trusts respectively The trusts in band one include the  trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates They are joined by Croydon Health Services which was rated high risk in  areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistleblowing Also in band one are Barking Havering and Redbridge which was rated high risk in  areas including AE waits and patient surveys and Aintree rated high risk in  areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon who is also a CQC board member said  It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients  The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball but it is a great start and will surely develop over time Dr Mark Porter head of the British Medical Association said publishing the data was an important step towards improving transparency across the NHS informing and empowering patients and identifying underperforming hospitals But he added Hospitals are large complex organisations so we need to avoid oversimplifying or reducing vast amounts of data to a simple band or rating Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said David Cameron should be ashamed that hes put so many of Englands hospitals in this position He siphoned bn out of the NHS frontline to blow on a backoffice reorganisation nobody voted for Hospitals were left on a financial knifeedge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos  But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Sadly under the last government a lack of transparency about poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long some times with tragic consequences for patients   This government is being honest with the public about the quality of care at their local hospitals and taking tough action where standards arent up to scratch  Patients and staff deserve nothing less
