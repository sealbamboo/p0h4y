WASHINGTONâ€”Some insurance plans available through the Affordable Care Act are breaking rules aimed at ensuring federal funds aren't used to cover most abortions, according to a federal report.. The Affordable Care Act bars the use of federal funds made available to consumers through subsidies and tax credits for certain abortions. The restriction doesn't apply to pregnancies that are the result of rape, incest or where the life of the pregnant women is in danger without an abortion.
