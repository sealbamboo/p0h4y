Many teens aspire to have lean bodies and big muscles like the professional athletes they so admire But they dont always want or know how to sweat to get them A new study finds a surprisingly high number of teens have used steroids to try to slim down and bulk up Six percent of teenagers say theyve used steroid drugs in the past year which is a lot higher than the  percent reported in a   And its not just boys who are trying to bulk up Girls say they are using steroids too although theyre using the illegal drugs less often than boys according to researchers at the University of Minnesota and Columbia University They surveyed  middle and high schoolers in the Minneapolis area in  and  Their   appear today in the journal   The students were most likely to have used steroids if they were on a sports team particularly if it involved a weightconscious sport like gymnastics or ballet But perhaps the biggest surprise is that a lot of the kids trying to bulk up werent necessarily jocks  they were overweight or obese And they weret just trying steroids About onethird of the teenagers said theyve tried   and shakes perhaps thinking incorrectly the products alone can transform fat into muscle Overweight girls were especially likely to try that Its an interesting finding especially given how many teens   these days The number of overweight kids and adolescents in the US has almost tripled since the s Teens of Asian ancestry were also more likely to turn to steroids than Caucasians The study authors said their  percent number might be higher because about  percent of the study participants were Asian Steroids pose a big health risk for teenagers because they can permanently stunt growth They also cause   like severe acne and jaundice The good news is most of the teenagers did also try the two proven and healthy ways to build muscle They exercised more and changed their eating habits Both parents and pediatricians need to be aware that teenagers may consider steroids a legitimate way to gain muscle Encouraging them to be active would be great the authors conclude but only if they focus on skill development fitness and general health rather than development of a muscular appearance
