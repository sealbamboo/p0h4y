Some of the biggest ski resorts anywhere lie in   Colorado district dotting the peaks of Summit and Eagle counties about a hundred miles west of Denver The area has a   people and also it turns out health plans that are much more expensive than similar plans in surrounding regions So expensive that Polis a Democrat has asked the federal government to exempt some of his constituents from the requirement to buy health insurance The way the pricing came in under the Affordable Care Act  was anything but affordable in Summit and Eagle counties Polis says Upwards of  to  a month minimum Whereas in other parts of my district  like Fort Collins and the Boulder area  the pricing is really good You can get a very strong good insurance program for  to  a month Colorados insurance commissioner   disputes the congressmans assessment of his district Ive been very pleasantly surprised to see that in some cases theyre able to get a lowercost plan than people with the same demographic information in Denver she says The health plan prices Salazar is talking about include subsidies that can lower costs for people making below a certain income Couples for instance can get a subsidy if they make less than about  a year But Salazars argument didnt impress people at a recent   she held in Summit County You try living in this county for two adults on  a year one angry constituent said You cant do it The median rent in Summit County is  percent higher than in Denver Gas and groceries are more expensive in Summit and so is health care Commissioner Salazar says thats why she approved higher insurance rates here So what youre saying is were screwed and theres nothing you can or will do to prevent that a woman said to Salazar at the public meeting Thats not what Im saying Salazar replied Well thats what were hearing responded another attendee People in the mountain communities are upset because insurance rates across the county line are dramatically lower They want to be added into a socalled   with the regions paying lower rates Ben Price with the   says insurers have to be able to charge people who live in different regions different prices If they cant he says youre asking that lower cost county to subsidize all the folks that live in the county that was more expensive Price says   up to  percent more per person for medical care in the mountains versus in Denver To give people in highcost counties a discount insurers would have to make up their loss by charging people in lowcost counties more which wouldnt be fair This isnt driven by the insurance industry Price says These different rates are driven by factual numbers about the cost of health care Insurance companies have long charged people living in different places different prices for similar policies And there have been pretty dramatic differences in what people pay from one side of any given state to another says   an economist at Washington University in St Louis Before the Affordable Care Act McBride says insurers were allowed to vary their prices according to a long list of criteria  including an applicants overall health for example or whether the person had a preexisting condition Now they can only vary what they charge according to a persons age whether they smoke and where they live Now after the passage of the Affordable Care Act McBride says in most parts of the country that variation across geographic area is probably better But not in Colorado Arguably price variation across the state hasnt gotten worse under Obamacare But more people are noticing price differences now since the law requires them to buy a minimum level of health coverage and old lowcost barebones plans are no longer allowed Rep Polis is working with Commissioner Salazar to bring down the high insurance rates in the mountains Theyre optimistic it will happen next year But people in the industry say they expect rates to be volatile for at least a couple of years  until insurance companies get a handle on exactly how the Affordable Care Act is changing their business
