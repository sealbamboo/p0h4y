As many as  workers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC may have been exposed to anthrax bacteria and are receiving treatment The US health agency said researchers in a highlevel biosecurity laboratory failed to follow proper procedures and did not inactivate the bacteria  The exposure occurred in Atlanta at the weekend and noone has yet shown any symptoms the CDC has said The FBI has told the BBC it is helping the CDC to investigate This should not have happened Dr Paul Meechan director of the environmental health and safety compliance told the Reuters news agency Were taking care of it We will not let our people be at risk Dr Meechan said it was too early to determine whether the transfer was accidental or intentional  Symptoms of anthrax exposure include skin ulcers nausea and vomiting and fever and can cause death if untreated Anthrax bacteria live primarily in inactive spores and are found naturally in the soil but people can ingest or inhale spores which can make the anthrax active  Not all will be sickened when exposed to anthrax but left untreated anthrax illness can turn very serious or lead to death A blood culture test is used to confirm anthrax exposure  Anthrax entered the US national consciousness in  when shortly after the  attacks letters containing powdered anthrax arrived at news organisations and the offices of US senators Twentytwo people were sickened and of those five people died In a statement the CDC said the anthrax samples were moved from a highsecurity lab to a lowersecurity one at their Atlanta headquarters Workers believing the samples were inactivated were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment while handling the material the agency said The unintentional exposure was discovered June  when the original bacterial plates were gathered for disposal and B anthracis colonies live bacteria were found on the plates Although the CDC believes about seven researchers had direct contact with the anthrax it is casting a wide net in who may have been exposed About  individuals are being offered a course of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as well as an injection with an anthrax vaccine The normal incubation period for anthrax illness can take up to five to seven days Dr Meechan told Reuters but there have been cases of illness occurring as much as  days after exposure
