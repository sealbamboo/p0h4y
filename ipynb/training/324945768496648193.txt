Is the occasional glass of wine or beer OK for momstobe According to a new   published in   there doesnt seem to be any measurable risk The study found that drinking up to two alcoholic beverages per week during pregnancy is not linked to developmental problems in children But even the studys authors caution that abstaining from alcohol is still best for motherstobe The research was done at the University College London using data collected as part of the Millennium Cohort Study The researchers looked at about  children born in the UK between  and  When the children were  years old they were given math reading and spatial skills tests And parents completed questionnaires about the childrens emotional and social development The researchers found that children born to women who consumed a little alcohol during pregnancy had higher test scores on some tests compared with children of nondrinkers But the researchers conclude that most of these differences were too small to be statistically significant While we have followed these children for the first seven years of their lives further research is needed to detect whether any adverse effects of low levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy emerge later in childhood professor   of the International Centre for Lifecourse Studies   at University College London and coauthor of the study said in a statement released by the journal The Department of Health in the UK recommends that pregnant women avoid alcohol altogether But if momstobe do choose to drink the governments advice is to not have more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and not to get drunk according to   UK government site Under the British governments definition a small ounce glass of wine is about oneandahalf units Experts on fetal alcohol syndrome in the US arent so convinced by the new findings Failure to see an effect doesnt mean that there isnt one or that drinking in pregnancy is safe says   director of the CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development at Wayne State University in an email to The Salt He explains that the ability to detect effects of low levels of alcohol exposure depends largely on whats measured Another shortcoming of the study is that people tend to underreport alcohol consumption when theyre questioned about it says   of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University And in this study women werent asked to recall how much alcohol they drank until their child was  months old so memories may not have been so clear Its not a convincing study says Garry If a woman has had some drinks in pregnancy I would reassure her that the childs development is likely to be normal writes Garry in an email to The Salt But overall he says drinking does pose a risk and should be avoided during pregnancy Robert Sokol agrees Its still the case that its safest not to drink during pregnancy Sokol says
