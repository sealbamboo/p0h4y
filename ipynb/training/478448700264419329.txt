An alarm sounds on Ed Damianos night stand in the middle of the night He jumps out of bed and rushes into his sons room next door His son David has Type  diabetes The yearold sleeps hooked up to a monitor that sounds an alarm when his blood sugar gets too low If it drops sharply David could die in his sleep The fear is that theres going to be this little cold limb and I screwed up Its all on me Damiano says But when he touches Davids hand hes warm Hes OK Damiano says Thats the moment of relief The father has been doing this night after night since his son was diagnosed with   when he was  months old But Damiano has done more than nightly monitoring to try to protect his son Hes an associate professor of   at Boston University and has shifted the focus of his career to developing a better way to care for people with Type  diabetes Its intimidating when you start considering the list of things that influence blood sugar he says Emotions and physical activity if youre healthy You cant possibly take into account and balance all those things And sometimes you get it right And often you get it wrong Damiano has developed a system he calls a bionic pancreas designed to help people better manage their blood sugar Hes racing to get it approved by the Food and Drug Administration before his son leaves for college in three years In tests with  teenagers and adults the device did a better job controlling blood sugar than the subjects typically did on their own The  were reported Sunday at an American Diabetes Association meeting in San Francisco and also   in the  At the moment Damianos system is basically a sophisticated app that runs on an iPhone The iPhone is connected wirelessly to the kind of   that many people with diabetes wear taped to their abdomens The app analyzes the data from the monitor and sends signals wirelessly to two pumps that are similar to   many diabetes patients wear to infuse themselves with insulin In this case one pump contains insulin and the other contains glucagon a different hormone that raises blood sugar when it gets too low The bionic pancreas is a device that automatically takes care of your blood sugars  Damiano says Its a device that comes to know you He is not the only one working on something like this Several groups in the United States and elsewhere are testing similar systems But Damianos system is one of the most advanced For example it is one of the few that uses both insulin and glucagon Diabetes specialists at the National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation both of which have provided funding for Damianos research say his system is promising But it remains unclear which approach will work best they say Damianos could for example turn out to be too complicated Because its more complex using a pump for each hormone it may also make it more challenging for the people using it if there is a failure of the system says   a program director at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases In the worstcase scenario someone could die from severe hypoglycemia if the device failed Based on the results of the last round of testing Damiano has gotten approval to launch a new round of testing Dozens of adult and adolescent volunteers will use the system on their own for  days The first volunteers start Monday This thing is going to take the worries about my blood sugar off my hands says Ariana Koster  one of the volunteers Koster has been struggling with diabetes since she was  During a recent dry run for the new study Koster tried the system for three days For the first time in years she says she did not have to obsess over her blood sugar She even snuck a cookie in the middle of one night and indulged in her favorite food pad thai I can already see how awesome it is Koster said There are not yet companies involved in developing the device Damiano hopes to win the FDAs approval just in time for his son Davids first night alone in his dorm room For his part David is confident his dads bionic pancreas will be ready in time My whole life Ive just known  just had this knowledge that my dad is going to have this bionic pancreas out when I go to college David says Im confident in him He works really hard  really hard
