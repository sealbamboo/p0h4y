Breast cancer survival is over all three years shorter for black women compared with white women mostly because their cancer is often more advanced when they first seek medical care new research shows While cancer researchers have known for two decades that black women with breast cancer tend to fare worse than white women questions remain about the reasons behind the blackwhite divide The new report from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania begins to untangle some of the issues by using an analytic method to filter the influence of demographics treatment differences and variations in tumor characteristics among other things The findings   suggest that while a significant number of black women still get inferior cancer care the larger problem appears to be that black women get less health care over all and that screening and early detection campaigns may have failed to reach black communities Using data from Medicare patients tracked in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database the researchers analyzed  breast cancer cases which included  black women The larger number of cases involving white women allowed researchers to find nearly perfectly matched controls against which to compare the outcomes of black women with breast cancer The findings were striking Over all white women with breast cancer lived three years longer than black women Of the women studied nearly  percent of white women lived at least five years after diagnosis while  percent of black women were still alive five years later The difference is not explained by more aggressive cancers among black women Instead the researchers found a troubling pattern in which black women were less likely to receive a diagnosis when their cancer was at an early stage and most curable In addition a significant number of black women also receive lowerquality cancer care after diagnosis although those differences do not explain the survival gap Something is going wrong said Dr Jeffrey H Silber a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Center for Outcomes Research at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia which studies disparities in health care These are huge differences We are getting there too late Thats why we are seeing these differences in survival The data show that black patients are twice as likely to never receive treatment The records of  percent of black patients did not show evidence of treatment compared with  percent of whites Black patients were also more likely to have at least a threemonth delay in receiving treatment Among black and white women with similar tumors  percent of black women had not started treatment after three months compared with just  percent of whites One notable finding of the report is that while the introduction of new treatments has improved the outcome for both white and black breast cancer patients since  those improvements have not narrowed the survival gap between the two groups But solving disparities in cancer care would not immediately have a major effect on overall survival for black women the study showed If black women began receiving exactly the same quality and level of breast cancer treatment as white women that would lengthen their lives by two to three months the study showed However two additional years of life could be gained among black women if their breast cancers were detected earlier and if their health were better over all as is the case with white women with breast cancer Among the black women studied  percent received a diagnosis of Stage III or IV disease when the cancer is far less likely to be cured Among the white women only  percent had latestage disease One reason may be that the black women studied were less likely to seek medical care for any reason Although all the patients in the analysis had Medicare coverage blacks were significantly less likely than white women to have seen a primary care doctor in the  to  months before diagnosis and they had far lower rates of cholesterol and colon cancer screening Black women also had far lower rates of breast cancer screening   percent had been screened  to  months before diagnosis compared with  percent of white women Black women with breast cancer were over all in poorer health than white women Of the black women studied  percent had diabetes compared with  percent of white women These patients have insurance Dr Silber said We need to improve screening for these women and improve their relationships with a primary care provider In   the authors who included Dr Jeanne S Mandelblatt of the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at Georgetown Universitys Lombardi Cancer Center said the rigorous study offered additional clues to the blackwhite differences in breast cancer outcomes However the authors wrote that the report may still understate the effect of lowerquality cancer care for black women in part because some treatment data are missing from the database it used Ratings of patientphysician communication and trust have been related to black womens but not white womens patterns of chemotherapy use the authors wrote These findings further reinforce the idea that black women may have different cancer care experiences than white women
