Most people who think they are allergic to penicillin in fact are not researchers said Friday Its something doctors have suspected for a long time but the researchers say they were surprised by just how many people werent allergic to the antibiotic it was  percent of them Dr Thanai Pongdee an allergist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville Florida and colleagues tested  people who said they were allergic to penicillin Tests showed  percent of them were in fact not allergic These patients were scheduled to undergo orthopedic general surgery neurosurgeryany type of surgery you can think of Pongdee told NBC News We probably expected a little over half of people would not be allergic based on the time frame when they were initially determined to be allergic but it ended up being a much higher proportion than that Its good news for the patients who can get cheaper more generic penicillinbased drugs such as amoxicillin or related drugs called cephalosporins These antibiotics generally cause fewer sideeffects than other antibiotics and they allow doctors to save the other drugs for penicillinresistant infections There are two issues these patients are put on other antibiotics which be less effective and potentially have more sideeffects said Dr James Sublett a family allergist in Louisville Kentucky who is incoming president of the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology ACAAI The other is cost A very commonly used substitute for example Levaquin is seven to eight times more expensive for a day course than a similar course of generic Augmentin a penicillin drug People usually believe they are allergic based on a reaction in early childhood that they cannot even remember says Sublett but that they were told about A patient will say My mom told me when I was  years old that I had a reaction to penicillin And theyre going  years without being retested he said We knew that the majority of people who list penicillin as an allergy actually arent allergic when they are reevaluated so if you can determine they are not you can avoid using more toxic and more expensive antibiotics Pongdee said Its an important issue The more widely an antibiotic is used the more likely resistant superbugs are to develop  and thats bad for everyone While allergies are a serious matter its a relief to know they are not as common as feared One of the first questions a patient is usually asked is Are you allergic to any medications Pongdee said The research being presented at the annual meeting of the ACAAI showed that it didnt matter how severe a persons first reaction to penicillin was They usually outgrew it It doesnt happen very often that a health care provider challenges the presumption that the patient is still allergic Many dont realize that this is something a person may lose over time Pongdee said Some dont realize there is really good allergy testing for penicillin he added Its a skin test It takes about  minutes to do
