Most people with diabetes are treated with drugs notably metformin that dont put them at risk of unusually low blood sugar or hypoglycemia a potentially dangerous side effect But as patients age and develop other chronic medical conditions it becomes more difficult for them to tolerate these medications So doctors often switch older diabetes patients to insulin or a class of medications known as sulfonylureas Brand names include Glucotrol Amaryl and Diabinese With these drugs hypoglycemia becomes a more serious concern When doses of insulin or sulfonylurea drugs are too high an older persons blood sugar can plunge depriving the brain of oxygen and leading to collapse loss of consciousness and even death But calculating how much medication a patient should get and on what schedule isnt always easy For older adults the process can be complicated by erratic meals vision loss depression dementia and other difficulties with selfcare A recent   by researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs notes that among adults aged  and older insulin and sulfonylurea drugs are the second most common medications associated with emergency department visits or hospitalizations and adverse drug events Thats just the tip of the iceberg experts believe How common is   and the related   No one is sure but the new study provides an important clue The researchers identified patients within the VA system at risk of developing hypoglycemia because of their age  years and older cognitive impairment and impaired kidney function Then they looked at a measure of blood sugar control known as the AC hemoglobin test About  of these patients had received therapy that was significantly more aggressive than recommended under VA diabetes guidelines the investigators found Although those guidelines suggest that an AC score of  to  percent is adequate for patients with limited life expectancies and other major illnesses about half had scores below  percent and more than one in  had scores below  percent The findings indicate that a large number of elderly veterans with diabetes are potentially being overtreated based on the most recent professional society and federal agency guidelines the authors wrote Dr Patrick OMalley division director of general internal medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences called the results scary and said they challenge the current paradigm that emphasizes tight control of blood sugar for diabetes patients While normalizing blood sugar sounds like its the right thing to do hypoglycemia is much more dangerous in the short term than hyperglycemia for older patients he added
