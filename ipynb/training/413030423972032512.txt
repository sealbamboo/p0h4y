Former NFL linebacker Jovan Belchers   so doctors can perform tests on the remains of his brain The family hopes to find out if a degenerative brain disease played a role in   when he shot his girlfriend then killed himself The tests probably wont give a lot of answers considering how long Belcher has been buried says   who runs a brain bank and is a professor of pathology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Im not at all certain the diagnosis can even be made on this specimen Perl tells Shots The disease that Belchers remains will be tested for is   At the moment doctors can only definitively diagnose CTE after a person has died though new research funded in large part by the NFL and   could change that someday CTE occurs in people with a history of concussions notably boxers and professional football players The brain trauma appears to cause a buildup of abnormal protein which is associated with memory loss bad judgment aggression and dementia The NIH will fund eight projects to study the longterm effects of repeated head injuries and to come up with better tools for diagnosing CTE and concussions The NFL is donating  million for the work Perl is working on one of those projects with brain imaging specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Washington University in St Louis The specialists will study brains with CTE under a microscope and with highresolution scans of the brain The researchers hope to identify find features of CTE that they can detect on brain scans in living brains One limiting factor is a lack of brains says   deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke A diagnosis can only be made after death so scientists have to study brain samples from people who donate them Were really stymied in our ability to make progress just because theres not that much brain tissue Koroshetz says Were really very dependent upon people who donate their brains The NIH has established   to help researchers get access to tissue samples Koroshetz says this problem   though he is confident of progress with time and more brains At the moment there are many questions Most notably scientists are unsure whether its an isolated problem among people who suffer from frequent head injuries such as professional football players or if it could be a wider problem that applies to   and even   and   There have been promising signs says   professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University He points to a brain imaging tool which identified the abnormal protein associated with CTE   He is   on  former NFL players as well as  athletes of the same age who play noncontact sports like swimmers The goal is also to come up with a way of diagnosing CTE among the living Were really getting close but were still two or three years away before theres a good way of diagnosing CTE while people are alive Stern says We really are at the infancy of our knowledge for CTE
