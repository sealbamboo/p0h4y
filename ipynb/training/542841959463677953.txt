Scientists have created a chemical that can be added to food to make people feel full Initial tests showed it helped people to eat less and slow weight gain It harnessed the power of a proprionate which naturally makes us feel full when it is produced by breaking down fibre in the gut Writing in the journal Gut the UK researchers said their chemical would have to be eaten regularly to have an effect The ingredient is a foultasting soluble powder but the team from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow are trying to incorporate it into bread and fruit smoothies  The tricky part of the research was finding a way to deliver the proprionate into the colon where it triggers the release of hormones that control appetite Adding it on its own to food would not work because it would be absorbed by the intestine too early So the team found a way to bind it to a natural carbohydrate found in plants called inulin Once bound the proprionate can safely make its way through the digestive system before being freed from the inulin by bacteria in the colon In initial tests  volunteers were either given inulin on its own or the new ingredient known as IPE and then allowed to eat as much as they liked from a buffet Those who had been given IPE ate about  less food In the next part of the study  overweight volunteers were either given IPE or inulin in powder form and asked to add g about a spoonful to their food every day After  weeks six of the  volunteers given inulin had gained more than  of their body weight while only one of the  given IPE had done so  Study leader Prof Gary Frost from Imperial College London said We know that adults gain between kg and kg lb oz a year on average and theres a real need for new strategies that can prevent this Molecules like propionate stimulate the release of gut hormones that control appetite but you need to eat huge amounts of fibre to achieve a strong effect Dr Douglas Morrison from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre at the University of Glasgow said the experiments had shown that propionate may play an important role in weight management Prof David Haslam chair of the National Obesity Forum said If they have brought this about without affecting taste or the bowels then I would welcome it
