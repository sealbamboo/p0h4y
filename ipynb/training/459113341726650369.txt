Two additional prominent medical institutions said Wednesday they are halting the use of a popular surgical device after the Food and Drug Administration warned last week that the instrument, which is used in some hysterectomies, can spread cancer.. Both Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania Health System said they are suspending use of so-called power morcellators in procedures to remove painful but common uterine growths known as symptomatic fibroids. About 40% of hysterectomies are performed to treat fibroids.
