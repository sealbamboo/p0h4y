One day in the fall of  composer   woke up and realized there was something horribly wrong with his hearing There was an enormous violent buzzing in my ears he says And I realized that my right ear had gone completely deaf Einhorn who lives in New York was experiencing a rare problem called sudden deafness He would never recover any useful hearing in his right ear because of a problem called   which makes even ordinary sounds intolerable Speech sounds like the worst sciencefiction robot screaming in your ear he says Its a shrieking horrible hideous metallic sound So Einhorn has to wear an ear plug in his right ear much of the time Hes created his own audio demos to give others a sense of what hyperacusis can be like First listen to Einhorn reading an early thcentury quote from Ludwig van Beethoven bemoaning his own increasing deafness Next listen to the way Einhorns hyperacusis distorts the same quote Unlike his right ear Einhorns left ear did get better though unamplified sounds remain very faint Its been a big change for a man whose ears werent just good they were golden I was the kind of person who would walk into a space clap my hands once and be able to decide whether or not I could record a symphony orchestra there and have it sound good he says After losing so much of his hearing Einhorn says he wasnt sure whether he would still be able to work as a composer So he began investing in technology that could help him make the most of the hearing he had left Einhorn bought a topoftheline digital hearing aid for his left ear He also went on to buy devices that help him hear what hes composing talk on the phone listen to live music and carry on conversations in noisy restaurants The solutions arent perfect Einhorn says But theyre pretty good I compose every day I see my friends I go to movies I go to concerts I do everything he says All that would have been a lot harder if Einhorn had lost his hearing just a couple of decades ago Back then most hearing aids were still analog devices with severe limitations But in the digital age hearing aids and socalled assistive listening devices have become smaller smarter and much more powerful The history of digital hearing aids goes back to the s says   a scientist at Gallaudet University who also directs the governments   Bakke recalls helping to build a device that was the size of a refrigerator But like all things digital it shrank fast By the s digital hearing aids had gotten small enough to wear behind the ear And theyve at least mitigated many of the problems that plagued earlier devices Bakke says In the old days with an analog hearing aid if something got too loud you got distortion Bakke says Not anymore Digital sound processing also has cut down on the annoying squawks caused by feedback And modern hearing aids are programmed to amplify only those sound frequencies a person has trouble hearing The latest units even know which direction a sound is coming from Bakke says Typically there is a bubble of amplification in front of you and some suppression behind you which mimics what our own ears do Bakke says Features like directional listening are possible because todays hearing aids are controlled by tiny computers that analyze and manipulate sound This allows them to do things like reduce the drone of an air conditioner while amplifying speech sounds Larry Medwetsky an   at Gallaudet lost most of his hearing when he was  He didnt get hearing aids until he was  And they were the analog type Medwetsky says these oldstyle hearing aids helped in quiet rooms But when things got noisy he had to turn them off And he says they didnt amplify the full spectrum of audible sound These days Medwetskys modern hearing aids do a much better job of reproducing sounds like music Im able to hear the instruments better he says Im hearing a richness that I never heard before Medwetskys hearing aids have ear molds that completely fill the ear canal Thats the best solution for people like him who have hearing loss that affects the entire range of sound frequencies But most people with agerelated hearing loss only need to boost high frequency sounds And they can use newer socalled openfit hearing aids that leave much of the ear canal open The openness allows lowfrequency sounds to enter the ear naturally Medwetsky says It also prevents sounds from getting trapped in the ear canal One of the big reasons people returned hearing aids in the past Medwetsky says is that they did not like how their own voice sounded  as though it were coming from inside a barrel Thats not a problem with openfit devices So this is a technology that has made a tremendous difference Medwetsky says and its become now the prominent type of hearing aid style Other hearing aid advances include units that can receive Bluetooth audio from a cellphone and waterproof devices that can be worn while swimming Also miniaturization has led to units that may fit entirely within the ear or even disappear into the ear canal But hearing aids still have their limitations Einhorn the composer says he misses the subtle everyday sounds he used to find comforting  sounds like the swish of a towel landing in a laundry hamper When I do hear them through a hearing aid they sound harsh and they sound tinny rather than comforting he says And hearing aids still dont work well in every environment We have huge expectations that hearing aids will solve all our hearing problems Einhorn says But for specific situations like restaurant listening like listening in a classroom to your teacher hearing aids need to be augmented with additional devices These devices include separate microphones that can be placed close to the source of a sound Einhorn says the problem with the microphones on hearing aids is that they are often too far away so background noise drowns out what you are trying to hear Hes made a recording to demonstrate the problem this causes when hes trying to have a conversation in a noisy place The woman you can just barely hear in this recording is Dana Mulvany who often writes about the challenges faced by people who are hard of hearing One solution hes found for noisy environments is a smartphone app that uses the phones microphone to capture and deliver amplified focused sound to highquality headphones When Einhorn has lunch with a group of friends he often uses an even better though more expensive solution He gives each of them a   to wear around the neck Those microphones are linked wirelessly to a device that blends the voices and sends the sound to his good ear But that sort of technology cant help in other situations like when hes trying to hear directions above a subways din from a booth attendant sitting inside the booth Fortunately New York subway booths have started using an old technology known as a loop system It takes sound from a microphone inside the booth and beams it to a receiver called a   or tcoil thats found in most hearing aids Tcoil technology is also available in some theaters Einhorn says the first time he tried it was during a performance of the musical   At previous musical performances hed tried listening the usual way through his hearing aids and the result had been painfully bad So basically I was expecting to have a miserable time and instead I was absolutely enthralled he says It was simply the first time in over a year that Id been able to enjoy a live musical performance and I was reduced to tears Tcoils can also help with cellphone calls but only if you choose the right cellphone says   an audiologist at Gallaudet The Federal Communications Commission   cellphone makers to indicate whether a particular phone is compatible with hearing aids and whether it works with tcoils she says One thing technology cant overcome is peoples reluctance to use hearing aids Roush says Many people still see the devices as an unwelcome sign that they are getting older or less able she says But as hearing aids have gotten smaller and able to do more things Roush says the stigma has diminished I see a lot of people coming in now that are just really looking for  the best they can have she says The best doesnt come cheap though Stateoftheart hearing aids can cost  each
