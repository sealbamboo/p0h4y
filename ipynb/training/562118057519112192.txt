The first largescale trials of two experimental vaccines against Ebola have begun in Liberia  The potentially preventative medicines were taken under strict security to a secret location in the West African country Scientists aim to immunise  volunteers including frontline health workers More than  people have died in the Ebola outbreak the vast majority in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone  The total number of reported cases is more than  In Liberia alone more than  people have died from the disease  But the number of Ebola cases in Liberia has been steadily decreasing with only four confirmed cases in the week leading up to  January According to the World Health Organization WHO the epidemic has entered a second phase with the focus shifting to ending the epidemic The trial which began on Monday involves injecting  volunteers with a vaccine that contains a small harmless fragment of the Ebola virus The aim is to trick the body into producing an immune response More volunteers will be immunised as the trial progresses However it is not yet clear whether the trial vaccines will offer protection against the disease Vaccines train the immune systems of healthy people to fight off any future infection They often contain a live but weakened version of the virus Correspondents say the trials are testing two vaccines created by two different drug companies who are hoping that the international community will eventually seek to stockpile large quantities of a working vaccine The first man to receive the vaccine was a middleaged Liberian the BBCs Mark Doyle reports from the Liberian capital Monrovia Asked how he felt after his jab he smiled and gave me the thumbsup our correspondent says The senior Liberian scientist involved in the trials Stephen Kennedy told the BBC the volunteers were safe There is no danger because the piece of the Zaire strain that has been put into the vaccine is a weak strain and it cannot and will not cause Ebola so it is impossible that any one of the volunteers will contract Ebola from the vaccine Mr Kennedy said The scientists are well aware of how important the support of local people will be if this trial is to work our correspondent says Community nurses are being trained in how to monitor volunteers in the months after they have their injections  Parts of the largest Ebola treatment centre in the world on the edge of Monrovia are being knocked down our correspondent says  Survival rate for the current outbreak is around  The scale of the outbreak has sparked a race to find a cure for the disease with many vaccines and drugs being fasttracked for human testing Safety trials for potential vaccines have taken place in the UK and in Switzerland and two potential drugs have been tested at Ebola treatment facilities run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres Doctors have also been trialling serum therapy a treatment made from the blood of Ebola survivors who have recovered
