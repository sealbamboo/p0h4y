Like it or not plastic packaging has become an ingrained part of the food system While its clearly wasteful to buy salad sandwiches and chips encased in plastic and then promptly throw that plastic away we take for granted how it keeps so much of what we eat fresh and portable And behind many of those packages that allow us to eat on the go or savor perishable cookies or fish imported from the other side of the globe is a whole lot of science and innovation The plastic revolution in food packaging began in the s says Aaron Brody a food packaging consultant and an adjunct professor of food science at the University of Georgia It took off because plastic was lighter than glass more protective than paper and relatively cheap But there is no such thing as the perfect plastic material Brody says So a lot of our packaging is made by combining different types of foodgrade plastic Take a bag of potato chips Its mostly made out of a plastic called oriented polypropylene Its an excellent moisture barrier Brody notes And thats key because potato chips first start to deteriorate by absorbing moisture People dont like soggy chips To further strengthen the material many chip bags have a thin aluminum coating on the inside A layer of polyethylene the stuff plastic grocery bags are made of is sandwiched between this inner layer and the outer layer which displays the brand and nutrition info Before the bags are all sealed up most companies fill them with nitrogen gas Brody says It keeps the chips from getting crushed he says And whereas oxygen would cause the fat in the chips to oxidize and taste funny nitrogen doesnt cause any chemical reactions that affect the flavor Food companies often spend a lot of time coming up with the perfect packaging to best preserve each product they sell Brody says So does the military As weve   the Army figured out how to package a sandwich that stays fresh for up to two years Like chip bags bags of readytoserve salad are made of polypropylene and packed with a bunch of nitrogen gas But unlike chips salad leaves need to breathe with a little bit of oxygen Thats why salad bags have microperforations Brody says The holes let oxygen come in and carbon dioxide get out And often the inside of these bags has a thin antifog coating Brody adds So theres no condensation and you can see the beautiful green leaves With a lot of packaging manufacturers have to worry not only about keeping air out but also locking in the moisture they want to keep in the food Thats a big one when it comes to packaging ice cream Brody says A tub of ice cream has to be easy to open and close but it has to have a tight seal to keep in the water that helps give ice cream its smooth texture Inside a freezer sublimation can sometimes occur  thats when water goes from a solid state directly to a gas The water is irreversibly lost Brody says And if you lose moisture the ice cream becomes sandy grainy Thats why paper tubs of ice cream are coated with polyethylene Brody says And the fancier tubs are made of thick sturdy materials Of course even after all the research and development most plastic packaging wont hold up in extreme environments says Herbert Stone a consultant for the food industry and a past president of the Institute of Food Technologists When food companies use a plastic container they have to be sure that it wont change the way the product tastes Stone says Plastic isnt an inert material he adds so it can react with other chemicals And unlike a lot of glass and metal it can let air through Have you ever left a plastic bottle of water in a hot car for too long Itll probably taste funny But despite what you might think thats not because chemicals from the plastic are leeching into the food Tiny amounts of air can pass though plastic  and when its hot the air starts moving faster Stone says Heat also speeds up chemical reactions And when chemicals inside the bottle react with each other or with chemicals from the outside environment your water can start to taste pretty funky he says Leave a bottle of soda in a hot car and the carbonation can quickly escape out of the container So you end up with flat soda Stone says Plastic is very convenient but its not perfect Beyond its technical limitations all the plastic packaging we use these days generates a lot of excess trash In  Americans generated  million tons of   from packaging and containers Because plastic doesnt biodegrade easily it sometimes ends up in our oceans where it   marine life and may even   And though were able to recycle many types of plastic all the nifty packaging that uses multiple layers of plastic is   since different plastics are processed separately at recycling centers But we are getting better at making effective and environmentally friendly plastics Stone says Were even figuring out how to take waste products like   and turn them into plastic
