For all its success enrolling tens of thousands in health insurance California is struggling to translate Obamacare into Spanish The states enrollment so far among Latinos is anemic  even though they represent more than half of Californias  million uninsured residents Only  of enrollees or fewer than  people in the first two months of enrollment are primarily Spanish speakers new data show The dismal results have drawn sharp criticism from supporters of the healthcare law They fault the Covered California exchange for strategic missteps and they fear that missing out on this relatively young and healthy population could threaten the viability of the state exchange Without a large pool of people and enough younger policyholders to balance out older sicker patients rates could spiral up and insurers may drop out of the staterun marketplace It is unacceptable that Latinos are getting the least amount of access to the benefits offered by the Affordable Care Act said state Sen Norma Torres DPomona Covered Californias strategy for Latino enrollment has not proven itself to be effective The success of this program and the affordability of health insurance in the future depends on Latinos signing up In the months leading up to enrollment exchange officials touted their plans to blanket the huge Latino market with advertising and station plenty of enrollment workers in their neighborhoods But not all those plans have materialized Covered California officials and healthcare experts cite a number of factors for the poor showing They say a shortage of enrollment counselors has affected Latinos more because so many prefer speaking with someone in person rather than signing up online or by phone Another glaring problem is that  weeks into enrollment the state exchange still doesnt have a paper application in Spanish Those problems have made it that much harder to overcome the general mistrust some Latinos have toward government amid fears that sharing family information to get health coverage could expose undocumented relatives to deportation Covered California acknowledges it must do better at signing up Latinos and representatives say they remain confident that people will show up by March  when open enrollment ends We are doing everything within our power to increase the number of Latinos enrolling and we know we will get there said Santiago Lucero an exchange spokesman We know we can do better The states current numbers may be undercounting Latino enrollment because many Latinos speak English primarily Many applicants dont give their ethnicity during the signup process and state workers sometimes forget to record that information so the exchange has focused on language as a measuring stick for now People who speak primarily Spanish account for  of Californias population but they represent only  of exchange enrollment The shortfall among Spanish speakers is surprising given the significant amount of marketing targeted at Latinos statewide In June President Obama came to California to praise a partnership among the state exchange the nonprofit California Endowment and major Spanishlanguage media outlets aimed at promoting enrollment The endowment alone is spending  million on advertising the benefits of the healthcare law much of it in Spanishlanguage outlets such as Univision Telemundo and La Opinion Covered California is spending millions on Latinotargeted advertising from its million marketing budget It has had a frequent presence on Spanishlanguage broadcasts with officials answering viewer questions and participating in televised town halls During a Telemundo show that aired in Los Angeles last week viewers were urged to call Covered California But Lucero the exchange spokesman said the response overwhelmed its call centers that weekday morning Overall the average wait time has grown to  minutes at the exchange frustrating consumers It wasnt the best thing for us Lucero said We are adding more bilingual people at our call center The exchange said it also hopes to have  enrollment counselors in place at the end of the month up from  now More than half of the current enrollment workers speak Spanish but delays in training and in completing background checks have hampered that outreach effort The states original goal was to have  enrollment counselors Demand is high but systems arent meeting that demand said Daniel Zingale a senior vice president at the California Endowment There are three points of entry online in person or over the phone and there has been instability in all three Katie Murphy supervising attorney with Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County said October and November were lost months with so few enrollment counselors available Many of the certified enrollment counselors the boots on the ground have only been certified in the last couple of weeks Murphy said Groups where theres a language issue or trust issues with the government will need the people in their communities to help them Covered Californias website has been available in Spanish since enrollment launched in October But patient advocates say that didnt help some Latinos who dont have online access or prefer reading over something on paper with their family The state exchange said a paper application in Spanish should be available next week It attributed the long delay to getting government approvals and feedback from outside groups The lack of a paper application in Spanish is huge said Sonya Vasquez policy director for the Community Health Councils in Los Angeles Theres definitely a digital divide when it comes to going online and applying for things she said Covered California will need to attract plenty of Latinos if it hopes to reach its goal of enrolling  to  people in subsidized health insurance by March  Through Dec  the state has enrolled  people in private health plans and most of them are receiving federal subsidies The state estimates that  million Latinos should qualify for subsidies which could help alleviate concerns about expensive premiums In California Latinos are among the strongest supporters of the Affordable Care Act A USC DornsifeLos Angeles Times poll published last month showed that nearly twothirds of Latinos in the state backed the law compared with  approval among registered voters overall State Sen Ed Hernandez DWest Covina chairman of the Senate Health Committee said the exchange has a compelling sales pitch to Latinos These enrollment numbers arent even close to where they need to be Hernandez said The state of California has to fix that
