Macaroni and cheese casserole is a great standby for a holiday table that includes picky eaters particularly children But it is not an option for children who cant tolerate foods with dairy  That was the dilemma for Long Island resident Julie Askew whose yearold son developed a dairy intolerance He was already a picky eater and his favorite food was macncheese   particularly the creamy extra cheesy kind  So Ms Askew set to work to create a dairyfree macaroni and cheese suitable for her picky son Perfecting this recipe though turned out to be a challenge The first time she tried making it the consistency of the cheese sauce was too watery and her son didnt like it  I think he threw a few tantrums along the way she said He made it clear that it was not the same Ms Askew knew she had to do something to change the texture so she added pured starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes and carrots which also helped give it the signature orange color It still lacked that essential creamy texture of a traditional macncheese made with butter milk and cheese  To make the dish more creamy she added cashews to the blender with the sweet potatoes and carrots creating the velvety consistency she was searching for She added sweet white miso as well as Dijon mustard to give it that combination of tangy salty and sweet taste that you normally get from cheese The culmination was a dish that her son couldnt resist and requests at least once a week she says Ms Askews quest to find dairyfree recipes for her son started her on a major culinary journey culminating in a career change to become a chef It was really hard to find recipes for kids that were plantbased Ms Askew said She now writes a food blog called   to help other parents who are trying to feed their children clean plantbased food For other moms whose children have food intolerances Ms Askew advises them to get their children involved in the cooking and meal planning process  She said her son now almost  happily chows down on salad and other vegetables and regularly helps her come up with new recipes  She said she reinvented the dish to become their mac n cheez adding This whole journey has really been about my son
