Few Americans question that smoking causes cancer But they express bigger doubts as concepts that scientists consider to be truths get further from our own experiences and the present time an Associated PressGfK poll found Americans have more skepticism than confidence in global warming the age of the Earth and evolution and have the most trouble believing a Big Bang created the universe  billion years ago Rather than quizzing scientific knowledge the survey asked people to rate their confidence in several statements about science and medicine On some theres broad acceptance Just  percent doubt that smoking causes cancer  percent question whether mental illness is a medical condition that affects the brain and  percent are skeptical theres a genetic code inside our cells More   percent  have doubts about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines About  in  say they are not too confident or outright disbelieve that the earth is warming mostly a result of manmade heattrapping gases that the Earth is  billion years old or that life on Earth evolved through a process of natural selection though most were at least somewhat confident in each of those concepts But a narrow majority   percent  questions the Big Bang theory Those results depress and upset some of Americas top scientists including several Nobel Prize winners who vouched for the science in the statements tested calling them settled scientific facts Science ignorance is pervasive in our society and these attitudes are reinforced when some of our leaders are openly antagonistic to established facts said  Nobel Prize in medicine winner Randy Schekman of the University of California Berkeley The poll highlights the iron triangle of science religion and politics said Anthony Leiserowitz director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication And scientists know theyve got the shakiest leg in the triangle To the public most often values and beliefs trump science when they conflict said Alan Leshner chief executive of the worlds largest scientific society the American Association for the Advancement of Science Political values were closely tied to views on science in the poll with Democrats more apt than Republicans to express confidence in evolution the Big Bang the age of the Earth and climate change Religious values are similarly important Confidence in evolution the Big Bang the age of the Earth and climate change decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises according to the poll Likewise those who regularly attend religious services or are evangelical Christians express much greater doubts about scientific concepts they may see as contradictory to their faith When you are putting up facts against faith facts cant argue against faith said  Nobel Prize winning biochemistry professor Robert Lefkowitz of Duke University It makes sense now that science would have made no headway because faith is untestable But evolution the age of the Earth and the Big Bang are all compatible with God except to Bible literalists said Francisco Ayala a former priest and professor of biology philosophy and logic at the University of California Irvine And Darrel Falk a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University and an evangelical Christian agreed adding The story of the cosmos and the Big Bang of creation is not inconsistent with the message of Genesis  and there is much profound biblical scholarship to demonstrate this Beyond religious belief views on science may be tied to what we see with our own eyes The closer an issue is to our bodies and the less complicated the easier it is for people to believe said John Staudenmaier a Jesuit priest and historian of technology at the University of Detroit Mercy Marsha Brooks a yearold nanny who lives in Washington DC said shes certain smoking causes cancer because she saw her mother aunts and uncles all smokers die of cancer But when it comes to the universe beginning with a Big Bang or the Earth being about  billion years old she has doubts She explained It could be a lack of knowledge It seems so far away Jorge Delarosa a yearold architect from Bridgewater NJ pointed to a warm  without a winter and said I feel the change There must be a reason But when it came to Earths beginnings  billion years ago he has doubts simply because I wasnt there Experience and faith arent the only things affecting peoples views on science Duke Universitys Lefkowitz sees the force of concerted campaigns to discredit scientific fact as a more striking factor citing significant interest groups  political business and religious  campaigning against scientific truths on vaccines climate change and evolution Yales Leiserowitz agreed but noted sometimes science wins out even against wellfinanced and loud opposition as with smoking Widespread belief that smoking causes cancer has come about because of very public very focused public health campaigns AAASs Leshner said A former acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health Leshner said he was encouraged by the publics acceptance that mental illness is a brain disease something few believed  years ago before just such a campaign That gives Leiserowitz hope for a greater public acceptance of climate change But he fears it may be too late to do anything about it The APGfK Poll was conducted March   using KnowledgePanel GfKs probabilitybased online panel designed to be representative of the US population It involved online interviews with  adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus  percentage points for all respondents Respondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed online People selected for KnowledgePanel who didnt otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them
