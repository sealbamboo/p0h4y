The UK has one of the most advanced health systems in the world but one of worst child mortality rates in Western Europe   In this weeks Scrubbing Up Dr Ingrid Wolfe of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and lead author of a report published this week entitled Why Children Die examines why the UK is lagging behind its European counterparts and suggests what we should be doing about it Around  children and young people die a year in the UK  Over twothirds of these are aged under five and the majority are under the age of one These statistics alone dont tell us much   However by looking at where the UK sits compared to other European countries we get a much clearer picture of how well were actually performing   reveals that the UK is bottom of the Western European league table when it comes to child mortality rates of underfives    We have higher rates than countries including Cyprus Greece Spain and Portugal and are more inline with Poland and Serbia than with the high performing countries such as Iceland Sweden and Germany  Even if you dont compare the UK to other individual countries and instead look at the Western European average the number of underfives deaths is around  higher in the UK   Perhaps even more worryingly despite overall child mortality rates declining in the UK the rate of improvement is slower than other Western European countries  The Lancet paper shows that by  well still be lagging behind other European countries So we know for a fact that we are performing badly and were not improving quickly enough   But why is the UK lagging behind   Is it the healthcare system and quality of care our children receive or are there lifestyle factors at play  What is it that makes other countries better than us In reality its a combination of factors but just because the causes are complex that shouldnt stop us looking for solutions  This week the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health launched a report  Why Children Die  that dug deeper into what it is children die from and which of these deaths can be prevented   Our overarching conclusion was that risk of child death disproportionally affects poorer families   When you compare Britain to the rest of Europe we are one of the most unequal societies with a growing gap between rich and poor   It is no coincidence that our child mortality rates are also the worst   of the causes of child deaths shows many deaths in underfives are due to risky behaviours such as smoking during pregnancy which is more common among women who are socially disadvantaged  Drinking during pregnancy is another risk factor as is children being around secondhand smoke and unsafe sleeping  all of which can contribute to premature death  So what do we want to see   The focus has to be on reducing the growing gap between rich and poor  put simply countries that spend more on social protection have lower child mortality rates  Social protection means things like helping poor families to make sure they have safe secure housing enough healthy food to eat and money to buy shoes for their children   But we also need to focus on improving health of mothers preventing babies being born too early and making sure all healthcare professionals who look after babies are better trained to spot early when a child may become seriously ill and act quickly  Our report Why Children Die recommends  Withdrawing the new cap on welfare spending and implementing a safety net so that the rising living costs do not hit families with the lowest incomes  Action across the health system to promote smoking cessation in pregnancy and before Targeted awareness campaigns for safe sleeping to prevent sudden infant death syndrome Better training for healthcare staff All frontline health professionals involved in the acute assessment of children and young people should be confident and competent to recognise a sick child and know what to do about it The messages are stark living in an unequal society raises the risk of children dying  Its time to put piecemeal policies aside and bring the UK up to standard of the best when it comes to the health of our children
