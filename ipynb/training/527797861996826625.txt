In Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking Glass Alice finds herself facing a difficult conundrum Shes running towards a distant hill yet no matter how quickly she runs her surroundings move with her effectively stranding her She meets the enigmatic Red Queen Now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place the Queen explains If you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that Chinas healthcare system suffers from the same problem  despite running at full speed over the past few decades it cant possibly move fast enough to keep up with the

and wealthier they are also burdened by a rise in pollution smoking obesity and other publichealth hazards creating   During the Mao era in the s through to the mids the countrys healthcare system was rudimentary but egalitarian entirely supported by the state Yet in the s reformer Deng Xiaoping dismantled the system leaving hospitals suddenly responsible for their own economic wellbeing The result has been rampant profitseeking overprescription of medications excessive testing and shocking efforts to cut corners Many Chinese hospitals dont keep soap in their public bathrooms Physicians are so underpaid that they often must supplement their salaries with kickbacks from drug companies and patient bribes The system is also deeply stratified A typical villager upon falling ill will first visit a local clinic  usually a concretefloored one to tworoom facility equipped with little more than intravenous drips and a small pharmacy If his malady requires further attention he will be forced to ascend through a hierarchy of institutions  to a county hospital then a provincial hospital then a specialised clinic in a metropolis such as Beijing or Shanghai Major institutions inundated with patients from afar suffer from chronic overcrowding It is common to see families sleeping overnight on hospital lawns to avoid earlymorning queues With the stakes so high tempers run hot when

tuberculosis TB and rising obesity   The government spent more than  of GDP on healthcare in  higher than the  recommended by the World Health Organisation WHO for a country of its socioeconomic status yet performed worse than comparable nations The historical legacy of colonialism and apartheid is still manifest in one of the most unequal societies in the world   and South Africa continues to labour under a twotier system The private sector consumes  of total health spending yet caters to only about  of the population The facilities are world class and less expensive than in Britain the US or Australia  fertility treatment for example attracts foreigners at a fraction of the cost  but are beyond the financial means of most South Africans Public healthcare struggles to meet the needs of the other  with often overcrowded facilities poor equipment and shortages of drugs Less than  of doctors dentists pharmacists physiotherapists and psychologists and just  of professional nurses work in the public sector Some essential services are provided free by the state TB treatment for example is not available in private clinics After diagnosing a patient with TB private doctors refer the patient to the public sector where everyone receives TB medicine free of charge The most striking success in free provision is the antiretroviral treatment programme for people with HIV initiated  years ago after the government accused of Aids denialism lost a landmark court case Today   has the worlds biggest publicsector HIV programme with  million people receiving treatment The countrys life expectancy has consequently increased from  in  to  in  But there are practical barriers Patients first point of contact are primary healthcare clinics where in serious cases nurses and community health workers can refer them to hospital These clinics are concentrated in cities and towns often inaccessible to people in rural areas who cannot afford transport Some  of children live in rural areas where only  of doctors and  of nurses work   Some villagers rely on an informal network of traditional healers and medicines Not everything in public hospitals is free and only an estimated  of South Africans are part of a medical aid scheme to cover the costs In addition staff shortages translate into long waiting times Critics say treatable conditions are not treated on time and preventable diseases are not prevented The government has admitted the need for a radical improvement in the quality of services and massive investment in buildings and equipment as well as fundamental changes in management The health minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi has been known to roll up his sleeves and work a night shift at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto the biggest hospital in the southern hemisphere He and his family   and in  he told the Mail  Guardian newspaper Its a selfdefeating prophecy to keep on saying we dont have the means There are good services in countries with fewer facilities and staff than us Nevertheless Motsoaledi has a big plan for healthcare reform a national health insurance scheme The aim is to provide essential healthcare for all irrespective of employment status and ability to pay as enshrined in the postapartheid constitution Anyone earning above a certain income will be required to contribute to the NHI Fund The plan has met resistance from the private sector But the government insists It will actually make the sector more sustainable by making it levy reasonable fees The intention of NHI is rather to make sure that citizens are able to use both the public and private sectors in such a way that they complement each other rather than one undermining the other At the moment private healthcare is only for the rich NHI is trying to blend the two in a more sustainable manner that benefits the population When Ria  an illiterate maids daughter suddenly developed a giant lump in her abdomen her mother knew better than to trust Indias publicly run hospital system Mazes of dingy corridors outdated equipment and filthy wards where linens are absent and rats run freely greet the desperately poor and sick patients seeking care India spends just  of GDP on healthcare   Every day patients from around the country some who have travelled for days can be seen queueing outside Indias biggest public teaching hospital the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS in New Delhi   Others push their way to the counters of crowded roadside medical shops to purchase not just bandages and surgical equipment but even lifesaving drugs and the pints of blood patients are often expected to provide At night dozens of patients and their relatives sleep under the bright lights of the closest bus shelter unable to afford

Australian doctor writing in the British Medical Journal of his experiences in a small Indian hospital blew the lid off   for referring patients for medical tests scans and even surgery Subsequently a group of doctors at AIIMS formed the Society for Less Investigative Medicine to counter corruption which is deemed widespread by many Indias new health minister has also   And the new prime minister Narendra Modi has further spoken of his vision for universal healthcare Partially inspired by   it would potentially be the largest scheme in the world and tackle such daunting silent epidemics as tuberculosis which claims  Indian lives annually But critics argue that such a private sectorled scheme will further marginalise the state system and leave Indias poorest citizens increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and substandard treatment especially in rural areas Ria successfully had a grapefruitsized tumour removed from her ovary Her mothers employer led the search for credible doctors interpreting their advice and helping to cover the roughly  in diagnostic and surgical costs Thankfully her tumour was benign According to a  study in the Lancet medical journal   a fact that possibly explains why even Britains imperfect and overburdened NHS seems like a dream to many here When more than a million protesters took to the street of   last year the woeful condition of the public healthcare system was high among their list of grievances Inequality and vast distances are the main problem According to the World Bank the country has  doctors for every  people  well below the  ratio in neighbouring Argentina and significantly below those of Mexico the US and the UK On paper however Brazil has one of the most comprehensive and generous public health networks in the world The Unified Health System or SUS as it is widely known is universal and free for everyone It has notched up impressive achievements Since the turn of the century life expectancy is up from  to  infant mortality is estimated to have fallen to  per  live births from  and the government says  of children are now fully vaccinated   Brazils healthcare spending was  of GDP in  But reflecting this very unequal society there is a huge gap between standards of private and public care In state capitals the one in four of the population who can afford private services benefits from almost double the doctorpatient ratio For those in the SUS there are insufficient beds and waiting times for basic diagnosis and treatment are long Regional disparities are even more glaring Residents of the poorest state   have barely a quarter of the spend per head as the inhabitants of wealthy Rio de Janeiro To address this problem President Dilma Rousseff last year launched a crash programme to fill the gap with thousands of primarily foreign medics The Mais Medicos More Doctors programme offers incentives to those go to medical schools in remote and poor areas such as the Amazon so that in the long term they can train a new generation of professionals So far  doctors have been dispatched and the plan is to increase this to  doctors by the end of  The vast majority have come from Cuba This is politically controversial because the Cuban government pockets about a quarter of their salaries When they arrived   and accused them of lacking the necessary qualification and language skills needed to do a good job While it is true that the normal diploma requirement has been waived for the Cubans the government says this is justified because they are only expected to provide primary care not surgery Mais Medicos is a success because it is serving the public with quality and because it is greatly improving health indicators throughout Brazil says health minister Arthur Chioro Fifty million people who did not previously have primary care now have exactly what they need most of all A few weeks ago   in northern Egypt Depending on who you believe the hospital either didnt have enough medics to tend to her  or they demanded money that she couldnt pay Hers was an extreme example of the problems with Egypts public health service particularly in provincial areas Thanks to a decree issued earlier this year all Egyptians should get free access to emergency hospital care for at least  hours But in practice some state facilities particularly in the countryside either cannot provide instant healthcare  or have to charge for it Due to a shortfall in government funding they have no other way of paying their staff And the problem goes beyond AE A staterun insurance scheme nominally provides subsidised nonemergency healthcare to children government workers and the families of those workers  a group that the government says totals  of the population But by the governments own count only  of those covered by the scheme actually use state facilities This in itself denounces the problem says Ayman Sabae a doctor and campaigner for healthcare reform at the   a prominent watchdog Both the service quality and access to the services are so limited that only  use them A government clinic that Sabae visited in rural Qena province last month exemplifies the problem Like about half of Egypts  state clinics this one is wellequipped and newly refurbished But according to Sabae there has not been a doctor here for the past four years Clinicians assigned here might only earn around  Egyptian pounds a month  about  or little more than Egypts average monthly wage  whereas they can earn around five times as much in the private sector So they opt for the latter Theres a couple of finance employees maybe a nurse says Sabae of the clinic But no doctors And thats very typical  you have a system that doesnt know how to manage itself You have the money to renovate the clinic but not the human resources to manage it As a result the half of the population who are eligible for free healthcare are often no better off than the half who arent Most end up paying for their care themselves  in fact  of healthcare spending in Egypt comes from peoples pockets NGOs charities and religious groups pick up some of the slack the nowbanned Muslim Brotherhood partbuilt their influence on their network of clinics Those who arent covered by the state healthcare plan can apply for another of statepaid treatment  the Program for Treatment at the Expense of the State But this is only for those with lifethreatening diseases who can show they are incapable of paying through other means As a last resort any patient can get free treatment at university training clinics and hospitals On the plus side the doctors here are often the best in the country On the downside students observe every operation the facilities are often unhygienic and the cost of basic supplies is frequently covered by the patients or the doctors themselves When I worked there as a doctor I was paid  Egyptian pounds about  a month and I would spend more per month from my own pocket to buy blood from other hospitals says Sally Toma another doctor who campaigns for healthcare reform Otherwise I was told I would have to choose who should get blood and who should not Italians by and large regard health as a priority And it shows up in one of the highest life expectancies in the world In  according to the World Bank the average newborn Italian could expect to live to the age of   the same as in Switzerland or Japan But like many things in a country of contrasts and disparities the provision of health services varies widely from one part of   to another Last year a report was published by the parliamentary committee that scrutinises what Italians call   literally bad health cases of extreme negligence on the part of doctors or hospital staff Out of  deaths attributable to malasanita between April  and December  more than  occurred in just two of Italys  regions Calabria and Sicily Italys Servizio Sanitario Nazionale was founded in  and modelled in large part on the NHS But right from the outset it was only to a limited extent national The central government fixes the overall budget determines minimum levels of care and for example negotiates drug prices with the big pharmaceutical companies But it is the regional governments that administer the system and there are huge discrepancies between them in levels of efficiency and integrity In parts of northern Italy patients receive attention as good as anywhere in   Customer satisfaction however falls off rapidly in the southern half of the country And the drop goes hand in hand with a fall in measures of efficiency In Sicily for example there are roughly  hospital doctors for every hospital bed In the northeastern region of FriuliVenezia Giulia the ratio is half that Discernible in the statistics are variations in the degree of corruption and the use of public services to distribute jobs and patronage Last years parliamentary commission report noted that in Campania the region around Naples  health officials had been taken on to the payroll without having to go through the bother of a selection process A persistent complaint among patients is of unfairness In the southern half of Italy especially they often move up waiting lists not according to the date on which their names were first entered nor by virtue of the seriousness of their condition but according to whether they can secure a   reference from someone with influence over the relevant surgeon By and large the state has been openhanded in allocating resources to health In  Italy spent  of its gross domestic product on the public health system That was less than was spent by the UK   or France But then Italys economy has scarcely grown since the turn of the century and is under growing pressure from European institutions to trim its spending Cuts have been made in recent years But the overall budget for this year of almost bn bn was still almost  higher than it had been in  When he announced the news that a doctor returning from Guinea to Harlem in New York had been diagnosed with Ebola in October mayor Bill de Blasio said that New Yorks had the worlds strongest healthcare system But the fact that he referred to the citys system rather than the nations is telling In fact while the US can boast some of the best doctors and most advanced medical technology in the world it doesnt really have a coherent healthcare system at all Healthcare in the US is private insurancebased and decentralised with most care providers owned locally by private companies and local and state governments controlling access to federal programs The private and public systems that overlap in some areas and leave gaps in others make the US the country that spends the most per capita and as a percentage of GDP of any country in the world but paradoxically consistently last among comparable nations in measures of quality of coverage such as infant mortality Because their cost is decided by private companies individual procedures can be extraordinarily expensive A single MRI scan in some parts of the country can cost as much as   an appendectomy as much as   and a caesareansection delivery as much as   according to a report by the International Federation of Health Plans Some procedures can be as much as eight times the price of the equivalent operation in the UK and a  study by NerdWallet   showed that medical bills are the biggest cause of bankruptcy in the US Some of the gaps are filled by government operations One of these is Medicare which guarantees health insurance for the elderly Another is Medicaid a lowincome program which the Obama administration has recently expanded  but state governments especially those controlled by rightwing Republican governors have consistently rejected the expansion leaving many poor residents without healthcare Yet another is the Veterans Health Administration which was hit by scandal in April  when it was revealed that at least  US military veterans had died while waiting for medical care Perhaps the core struggle of Barack Obamas presidency has been to pass his Affordable Care Act which would aim to use state online insurance exchanges to reduce the number of people without coverage But the bill has become a political football for the farright Tea Party who see any attempt to close the gaping holes in coverage as unacceptable government overreach The result has been that as of the beginning of  more than  of Americans still have no health insurance coverage at all Germanys healthcare system is best understood as a middle option between the British staterun and the American marketled model In principle healthcare cover is universal as in Britain treatment of the unemployed is covered by the state and ordinary patients rarely get presented with a bill after seeing a doctor Unlike in Britain however this universal care is not funded by a centrally collected tax but by socalled Krankenkassen or sickness funds  a system that goes back all the way to Otto von Bismarcks health insurance bill of  Signing up with a sickness fund is compulsory for every German citizen Once you have joined you pay a premium calculated according to your income half of it is paid by you the other half by your employer If you make less money you pay less If you are lucky enough to have a career that makes you a lot of money  and this is where Germany veers towards the US model  you can choose to ignore one of the  public nonprofit sickness funds and go with a private insurer instead One advantage in comparison with the British system is that you dont end up having to pay double  say for Bupa and the NHS In Germany about  of the population is covered by public sickness funds the remaining  are private One of the big plus points of the German system is that it gives patients a lot of choice you are not restricted to the nearest general practitioner in your postcode but can sign up with any GP you like GPs also have less of a gatekeeper function if you know you have a back problem you can go straight to see an osteopath Because the system is less centralised doctors and nurses dont have to stick to behavioural guidelines for foreigners some German doctors can come across as shockingly informal Practitioners enjoy a lot of freedom in Germany says Stefan Etgeton a senior expert of the Bertelsmann Foundation But therein can also lie a problem forcing through new medical standards can be arduous because some doctors are convinced that their way of doing things is still best In Germany the healthcare system does not attract the same unholy combination of vitriol and affection that the NHS does  it just about works so that both the left and the freemarketeers can see in the system what they want But thats not to say that there arent problems eating away at the system For a start the percapita cost of healthcare has been much higher in Germany than in Britain for years Most recent figures from  show the country spending  of its GDP on healthcare   above the OECD average As a whole the German system encourages overspending says Edzard Ernst Exeter Universitys Germanborn professor of complementary medicine Doctors who get charged per item are incentivised to oversubscribe and patients are incentivised to use the system more than in other countries There are also concerns about the longterm effects of the dual privatepublic system One of the problems is that it provides an incentive for the best doctors to move to urban areas where there are more high earners who can afford private sickness funds As a result rural regions struggle A public survey in  showed  of the population supports scrapping private health insurance altogether
