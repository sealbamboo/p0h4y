 When   so does their brain power new research suggests Being in a good mood appears to enhance decisionmaking skills and working memory among older adults according to the study published in the current issue of the journal   The study authors suggested that even something as simple as a small bag of candy can help older people perform better on socalled   There has been lots of research showing that younger adults are more creative and cognitively flexible when they are in a good mood But because of the mental declines that come with aging we werent sure that a good mood would be able to help older adults study coauthor Ellen Peters professor of psychology at Ohio State University said in a university news release So these results are good news she added There are ways for older adults to overcome some of the   In conducting the study the researchers divided  adults ranging in age from  to  years into two equal groups Those included in the first group were given a thank you note and two small bags of candy tied with a red ribbon to boost their mood when they arrived for the thinking skill tests Those in the other group did not receive either a thank you note or candy During the experiment the participants who received the candy used computers that had a skyblue background screen with smiling suns on it Meanwhile those who didnt receive the candy used computers with neutral round images but no smiling faces on the skyblue background The participants were given  in quarters and eight virtual decks of cards featuring a different pattern during the decisionmaking tasks Four of the decks were considered gain decks If participants chose a card from one of these decks  percent of the time they won a quarter and  percent of the time they didnt win or lose The remaining four decks were considered loss decks If someone chose a card from a loss deck they lost a quarter  percent of the time the study authors explained The participants could also accept or reject the top card of the deck that was offered to them Their goal was to win as much money as they could The participants were not told what the card values were Instead they had to learn through trial and error The researchers noted they were looking to see how quickly the participants would learn which decks won them money and which ones didnt The study revealed that the older adults whose spirits were lifted with a thank you note and candy performed much better at the decisionmaking test than the other participants We used an experiential task because real life is experiential Peters explained For example you meet a new person and she is like one of these decks of cards You dont know anything about her and you have to learn if she is someone you can trust What this study suggests is that people who are in a good mood are going to learn faster and make better decisions The participants also performed a memory test They listened as a group of random numbers and letters were read aloud to them and had to repeat the sequence back in numerical and alphabetical order For instance if they heard TA they would have to repeat back AT As the test progressed the participants were challenged even more with larger sequences they had to memorize Again the study showed that the participants who received the moodboosting gift achieved higher scores Working memory is important in decision making If youre working your way through different options how much you can remember of each option  and can therefore compare and contrast in your head  has a big impact on how well you can make a decision Peters pointed out Given the current concern about   our findings are important for showing how simple methods to improve mood can help improve cognitive functioning and decision performance in older adults just like they do in younger people The researchers noted that the participants speed of processing and vocabulary were not affected by a better mood And although the study found an association between improved mood and better thinking skills it did not prove a causeandeffect relationship
