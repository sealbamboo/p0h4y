A food poisoning bacterium may be implicated in MS say US researchers  Lab tests in mice by the team from Weill Cornell Medical College revealed a toxin made by a rare strain of Clostridium perfringens caused MSlike damage in the brain  And earlier work by the same team published in   identified the toxinproducing strain of C perfringens in a young woman with MS But experts urge caution saying more work is needed to explore the link Noone knows the exact cause of Multiple sclerosis MS but it is likely that a mixture of genetic and environmental factors play a role Its a neurological condition which affects around  people in the UK C perfringens found in soil and contaminated undercooked meat comes in different strains  Most cases of human infection occur as food poisoning  diarrhoea and stomach cramps that usually resolve within a day or so More rarely the bacterium can cause gas gangrene And a particular strain of C perfringens Type B which the Weill team says it identified in a human for the first time makes a toxin that can travel through blood to the brain  In their lab studies on rodents the researchers found that the toxin called epsilon crossed the bloodbrain barrier and killed myelinproducing cells  the typical damage seen in MS  Lead investigator Jennifer Linden said the findings are important because if it can be confirmed that epsilon toxin is a trigger of MS a vaccine or antibody against the toxin might be able to halt or prevent this debilitating disease  She presented the groups latest findings at a meeting of the    Dr Susan Kohlhaas Head of Biomedical Research at the MS Society said Discovering potential causes or triggers for MS could enable us to develop better treatments or even one day prevent the condition This is interesting research but the findings now need to be validated in larger studies to establish if this toxin really is a potential trigger for MS
