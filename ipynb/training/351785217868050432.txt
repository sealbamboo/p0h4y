I was lucky enough  I do see it that way  to be with my parents when each died My mother gave us more warning a couple of strokes a cancer diagnosis three months of hospice care a twoweek final vigil death in her own bed at age  My father was  but he was still so vital and healthy that his death from peritonitis and sepsis came as   From this vantage point it seems to me that losing your last parent is a different experience How could it not be Youve been orphaned The word loses that Dickensian aura of tragedy when you are decades into adulthood but it still influences your sense of self Todays longer lifespans means we have come to think it normal to remain someones child until we ourselves are elderly or close When we no longer are something profound shifts Regardless of the relationship theres something about the meaning of generations Barbara Moscowitz senior geriatric social worker at Massachusetts General Hospital said when I called to talk about adult orphans When theres no patriarch or matriarch youre the eldest generation In her practice and her support groups Ms Moscowitz sometimes sees former caregivers grow anxious about their own mortality once the people who seemed to stand between them and it are gone I havent noticed much of that in my own case but I have certainly been aware that with your surviving parent goes a significant chunk of your personal history No one else knew you from the moment of birth and anything from the name of the family spaniel to the identities of the people in that faded photo may be beyond retrieval In my case personal geography will probably fade too The small factory town in southern New Jersey where I grew up and the neighboring farms and communities are places I visited only as long as at least one parent lived there After my fathers grave marker is unveiled this winter following Jewish tradition Ill have scant reason to drive those  miles again What we miss  a nickname nobody else uses perhaps or an inside joke nobody else finds funny  depends on our pasts and our relationships My friend Ilzes parents emigrated from Europe and when her mother died this spring she realized I dont have anyone left to speak Latvian with We also may not know what to do with that impulse that led us to become caregivers After one parent dies we typically turn our attention to the other helping the survivor through the grief and the transition then at some point arranging the care he or she will need  To finally relinquish that role may come as a relief or feel like deep loss but either way it is a major change I have finally wrapped up most of the details of my fathers small estate so in a couple of months there will be nothing left that I can or should do for either parent It will be the first time in  to  years that that is true and   as my colleague Judith Graham wrote in March Let me acknowledge the vast disparities in our lives and our responsibilities Some adult children lost a parent at such a young age that they never became caregivers and some families have seen such anger and bitterness that relationships were severed long before death I miss my father but the grief that a California reader described to me sounds very different probably because her mother had lived with her for  years I feel no lifting of a burden only a huge void she said I wonder too if some sibling relationships falter when the second parent dies or if they get stronger Ms Moscowitz said that after her mother died five years ago I didnt know what my relationship with my brother would be or if it would be For as long as Id been an adult he and I had built our relationship around caregiving For years the first words of any phone call were Everythings OK Now Ms Moscowitz said We just say Hello  The variations are endless and I would like to hear what being an adult orphan has meant to you One sorrowful implication For those who have long struggled to try to forge better relationships with their parents being orphaned ends that possibility for good If they have not felt loved if the relationship has been difficult they may have held onto that wish even if its a fantasy Ms Moscowitz said Fantasies are very powerful She is no longer surprised when a person suffers tremendous grief after the death of a parent who treated him or her miserably The feeling of being truly bereft may not be only about what just happened she said It could be an expression of a lifetime of what one was waiting for and never had Fortunately my parents were both easygoing affectionate nonjudgmental people who always let my sister and me know that we were loved and approved of And they knew that we loved and honored them As I said we were lucky
