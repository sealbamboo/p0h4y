Checking into a hospital can boost your chances of infection Thats a disturbing paradox of modern medical care And it doesnt matter where in the world youre hospitalized From the finest to the most rudimentary medical facilities patients are vulnerable to new infections that have nothing to do with their original medical problem These are referred to as healthcareacquired infections healthcareassociated infections or hospitalacquired infections Many of them like pneumonia or methicillinresistant     can be deadly The World Health Organization   that each year hundreds of millions of patients around the world are affected by healthcareacquired infections In the United States the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the Health and Human Services Department   that   has a hospitalrelated infection In developing countries estimates run higher Hospital bed safety railings are a major source of these infections Thats what Constanza Correa  and her colleagues have found in their research in Santiago Chile Theyve taken on the problem by replacing them since  with railings made of copper an antimicrobial element Copper definitely wipes out microbes Bacteria yeasts and viruses are rapidly killed on metallic copper surfaces and the term contact killing has been coined for this process wrote the authors of an   on copper in  That knowledge has been around a very long time The journal article cites an Egyptian medical text written around  BC that cites the use of copper to sterilize chest wounds and drinking water Correas startup   has not yet assessed the railings impact in Chilean hospitals But a   of the effects of copperalloy surfaces in US hospitals intensive care units published last year in   showed promising results Their presence   from  percent in regular rooms to  percent in the copper rooms Correa spoke with Goats and Soda a few hours before   at a Latin America innovation conference earlier this month hosted by the InterAmerican Development Bank in Washington DC Healthcareacquired infections are a huge problem People come to the hospital with a sickness and they get another one in the hospital Then they have to stay longer and spend more money on treatment Sometimes it can cause death Eighty percent of these infections come from touching hospital surfaces In the hospital room the most contaminated surface is the bed rail Its the most manipulated by medical staff and patients Its in direct contact with the patient Thats the most critical surface in the room Our objective is to decrease the chance of infection due to surface contact So we replace current bed rails with copper bed rails It   viruses fungi and bacteria continuously In industrialized countries  percent of patients develop these infections and the number is three times more in developing countries These are infections like pneumonia and urinary tract infections In the United States the annual direct cost to treat these infections is  billion a year Plus the patient loses time at work And we dont consider what happens after a patient leaves the hospital They may get sick from these infections later too They are used at four hospitals in Chile in  beds We only change the rails not the whole bed We realized price is an issue so we focus on the most critical surface and we use a leasing model so it is easier for hospitals to take the decision Its not a big investment decision The cost is  to  per bed per month After  months they have paid for it There are a lot of options for how to incorporate copper Bed rails are only the first step You can have copper IV poles feeding tables night tables even mattress covers Yes there is a copper additive that can be combined with a polymer and its much better than the current covers It is all to create a healthier environment You can even use it for subway straps Yes my grandmother was hospitalized after a hip fracture She got an infection  she caught pneumonia We almost lost her We thought she was going to die and not because of the broken hip Yes fortunately But hospitals should be safer Copper kills everything Why wouldnt you use it It has so much sense for people
