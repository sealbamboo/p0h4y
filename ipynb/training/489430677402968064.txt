In the stirring World Cup final on Sunday between the national mens soccer teams from Germany and Argentina an American played a role on the field in Rio de Janeiro despite the United States  teams having been eliminated Sitting and occasionally pacing tensely along the German sideline was Mark Verstegen the teams trainer  Mr Verstegen the founder and president of EXOS a Phoenixbased company that trains professional and recreational athletes and corporate executives was appointed in  by Jurgen Klinsmann then the coach of the German team and now the United States coach   He was brought in to improve the players fitness agility nutrition and resilience At the time the Germans were at a low ebb by their high standards having not won a World Cup since  or a European championship since  Mr Verstegen said his appointment was met with widespread incredulity among German fans news media and even some players  They wondered what Americans could possibly teach the German squad he said  Then the Germans advanced to the semifinals of the  World Cup performing better than expected and on Sunday the team won this years edition defeating Argentina  in extra time  after having routed the host Brazilian squad  a few days earlier There arent many skeptics about Mr Verstegens training methods now  To learn more about how he trained the German team and how the rest of us might adapt some of their routines at home I spoke and emailed with Mr Verstegen in the days leading to and just after Germanys title victory His book Every Day is Game Day was published in January  What follows are excerpts from our conversations   What were the logistics of training the German team at the World Cup given that the team was traveling from city to city  We have a pretty amazing mobile training camp Its a  or square foot structure that we erect adjacent to the pitch It holds the latest cardiovascular machines weights fitness and recovery gear treatment tables and so on   What would a typical World Cup training session in that facility look like    It would depend on how close we were to the next game but wed often divide the structure into four stations a minicircuit with a different exercise at each station We might have the players do things like a   at one station and a miniband lateral walk at another Thats where you strap a band across the thighs or ankles and walk sideways We were ridiculed in  when we had players exercise that way But hip stability is essential for soccer performance and injury mitigation People dont laugh about it now   After a session in the facility then what   The team goes onto the field and does drills lots of drills working on agility and acceleration and building power We might have them do lateral and cross sprints drop squats running with the parachute or the Bullet belt a harness worn by the player and attached to a long rope held by a coach After that thered be technical and tactical work with the ball   How different are these sessions from the training that the German team did before you arrived  There was more emphasis then on the technical and tactical elements The physical training was very general with lots of long runs Now the players still spend lots of time working on technique and tactics but their physical training is more focused and individualized We constantly assess players movement patterns for instance watching as they perform every exercise Precision is very important If theyre slightly off in their movements on any particular day we correct things right away Its like running an antivirus program on a computer You want to get rid of the junk and keep the movements precise   Just how fit is the German team   I can give you precise numbers on that The German players covered  kilometers or about  miles on average as a team per game in the group phase Only the Americans ran more as a team In the quarterfinal round against France German players ran  kilometers or about  miles more as a team than did the French side That translates to about threequarters of a player more on the pitch  How can you tell how much players are running   All of the players wear monitors in their cleats that track their mileage movements where they are on the field when they stop and start and all sorts of additional data We track every players every heartbeat and keep and compare data from practice to practice and game to game We repeat certain drills and if someone is performing the same drill with a lower heart rate or faster speed we know hes improving If hes slower or his heart rate stays elevated we monitor him to make sure thats hes not becoming overly fatigued or ill then get him to push himself a bit more   Any suggestions on which aspects of the German teams training program those of us at home might usefully incorporate into our exercise routines even if we arent soccer players  The broad elements of the training program apply to anyone Concentrate on your mindset nutrition movement patterns and recovery On a practical level get plenty of sleep which is extremely important and often overlooked Kick the electronics out of the bedroom At the other end of the day when you first wake up do a few pushups or yoga poses anything that gets your body and mind primed for activity Youll be more receptive to activity throughout the day Then try to do whatever exercise you do a bit better every day You dont have to be doing split squats with kettle bells but do something that pushes you a bit The point is that the body and the brain respond positively to having demands put on them Thats really the key to fitness  Are you happy with the outcome of that last World Cup game  Utter elation We had put in  focused years of attention to details There are no givens in sports but once that whistle blew it was utter joy  To lessen the chance of injury and improve performance we all should ease into exercise with an orchestrated warmup Mr Verstegen said These eight exercises approximate a typical warmup for the German national soccer team so for many of us they might be a workout in itself at first he said But persevere and the moves will become easier he said and your subsequent workouts will be more productive These exercises require a foam roller and resistance band which are available at many gyms or can be purchased at sporting goods stores They are best performed in the order listed
