Theres growing concern in West Africa about the spread of the Ebola virus that has killed hundreds of people Health ministers have formed a regional response but fear and a lack of knowledge about Ebola threaten their efforts Liberian musicians are joining the campaign taking to song to educate people about the Ebola virus Their tune is called   and warns people to beware of close contact with those who fall ill The song warns Dont touch your friend Since   was first detected in Guinea in February the UNs World Health Organization has reported   there as well as neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia Almost  cases have been recorded to date Ebola is highly contagious through contact with bodily fluids like blood vomit or saliva And its generally fatal But there is a chance for survival if infected people can get medical attention West African government health officials have agreed to a coordinated strategy aware that a contagious disease will cross borders as people travel for commerce or work But their effort is hampered by fear and ignorance about the disease For example families sometimes hide relatives with Ebola rather than take them for treatment They fear the panic and ostracism that the disease may provoke from others nearby Thats why Liberias President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is warning her country that anyone caught hiding suspected Ebola patients will be prosecuted Here were talking about a deadly disease  a disease that can kill people And were obliged to also protect the lives of people Sirleaf said Theres a law that says they must do that And if they dont then there are penalties Sierra Leones president delivered a similar warning Ernest Bai Koroma had been criticized for failing to speak out publicly about the Ebola outbreak in his country He promised that more would be done to protect those trying to help curb the virus Medical workers in masks and protective suits often draw suspicion and fear from locals We are increasing police presence around health facilities to uphold the law and prevent incidents of violence against health workers and vandalization of health facilities Koroma said There have been several incidents of health centers and workers being attacked by the communities theyre trying to help The disease was virtually unknown in this region of the continent until recently and regional governments are trying to raise peoples awareness Weve asked them to stay away from taking people who are sick to prayer rooms to witch doctors in the bush to their own arrangements in homes said Liberias Sirleaf Her country is urging families to take the ill to health centers where they can be placed in quarantine and tested to see whether they have Ebola or something else Health workers are also trying to change local practices for burying the dead Families are no longer allowed to wash the bodies in traditional rituals Liberias deputy health minister Bernice Dahn recently attended a regional meeting in Ghana to seek a coordinated approach to these issues For the Liberian side there is a lot of denial Liberians do not believe the disease exists Culturally we are mobilizing our chiefs our committed leaders  and the people listen to their chiefs Dahn said If we can align their leaders to our health promotion activities they can help be our foot soldiers
