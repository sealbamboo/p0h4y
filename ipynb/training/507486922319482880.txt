Whats going on here I can only guess but heres what youre about to see In the video below the great musician Glenn Gould supreme interpreter of Bach is sitting at his living room piano on a low low chair his nose close to the keys Hes at his Canadian country house in his bathrobe Through the window you catch snatches of his back yard Its a windy day and hes got a coffee cup sitting on the piano top Hes working on a Bach partita not just playing it but singing along in his swinging baritone As he plays he gets so totally totally lost in the music that suddenly  from the top smack in the middle of a passage with no warning for no apparent reason his left hand flips up touches his head he stands up and walks in what looks like a trance to the window Theres an eerie silence Then in the quiet you hear the Bach leaking out of him Hes still playing it but in his head hes scatting the beats Then he turns wanders back sits down and his fingers pick up right where his voice left off but now with new energy like hes found a switch and switched it What just happened Im not sure But I think this is a rare vision of what its like to be so in your head you leave your body or at least the moving parts of your body totally behind There is a name for this from psychologist   but first just watch And dont miss the walktothewindow part  Glenn Gould was a complicated man He didnt like to practice instead hed prepare for concerts mentally running the piece over and over playing with imaginary fingers When he was a little baby it was said that instead of crying he would hum He had perfect pitch and could read music before he could read words So perhaps what you see in this video is just  for him  his way of playing He could switch seamlessly from fingering the piano to a purely virtual musicmaking he could move fluently from real to not Or maybe what we see him doing is something we all can do  but geniuses get there more often  reach a state of total absorption Gould in his living room for some reason reminds me of Michael Jordan playing basketball or Etta James singing the blues theres a concentration a zoning in thats so deep it feels special like a kind of ecstasy Athletes of course call this being in the zone Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi pronounced MEEhigh CHEECHsentmeehigh calls it the flow state When you are in it  neuroscientist   attention is focused on a limited perceptual field that receives your full concentration and complete investment Action and awareness merge You get so deeply into your head you lose track of everything except what youre doing There was a surgeon Csikszentmihalyi says who wasnt aware that the roof of his operating room had collapsed until he was done with the surgery In this state what you  becomes what you  Levitin writes We get wonderfully blissfully lost in an activity losing all track of time of ourselves our problems How one gets there  thats still a mystery Practice is important Tenacity matters Talent helps When you find your flow your brain changes Dopamine and noradrenaline kick in GABA neurons get suppressed sex hunger thirst matter less you are free to play more deeply with streamofconscious associations you are chemically released and can now roam far and wide Yes you have no idea where you are or how this is happening but  must be one of the most wonderful experiences ever When I watch Glenn Gould walking back to his piano carried there by an thcentury fugue I see a man transported a man not lost but found a man in a state of grace If there is a heaven Glenn Gould at that moment is very close  book
