Two Silicon Valley giants now offer women a gamechanging perk Apple and Facebook will pay for employees to freeze their eggs Facebook recently began covering egg freezing and Apple will start in January spokespeople for the companies told NBC News The firms appear to be the first major employers to offer this coverage for nonmedical reasons Having a highpowered career and children is still a very hard thing to do said Brigitte Adams an eggfreezing advocate and founder of the patient forum   By offering this benefit companies are investing in women she said and supporting them in carving out the lives they want When successful egg freezing allows women to put their fertility on ice so to speak until theyre ready to become parents But the procedure comes at a steep price Costs typically add up to at least  for every round plus  or more annually for storage With notoriously maledominated Silicon Valley firms competing to attract top female talent the coverage may give Apple and Facebook a leg up among the many women who devote key childbearing years to building careers Covering egg freezing can be viewed as a type of payback for womens commitment said Philip Chenette a   The companies offer eggfreezing coverage under slightly different terms Apple covers costs under its fertility benefit and Facebook under its surrogacy benefit both up to  Women at Facebook began taking advantage of the coverage this year While techniques and success rates are improving theres no guarantee the procedure will lead to a baby down the road The American Society for Reproductive Medicine doesnt keep comprehensive stats on babies born from frozen eggs  in fact the group cautions against relying on egg freezing to extend fertility  though experts say the earlier a woman freezes her eggs the greater her chances of success Doctors often recommend women freeze at least  eggs which can require two costly rounds But in the two years since the ASRM lifted the experimental label from egg freezing experts say theyve seen a surge in women seeking out the procedure Fertility doctors in New York and San Francisco report that eggfreezing cases have nearly doubled over the past year For many women taking the step to boost their chances of having kids in the future is worth the uncertainty A majority of patients who froze their eggs reported feeling empowered in a   published in the journal Fertility and Sterility Women who know they want kids someday can go on with their lives and know that theyve done everything that they can said Chenette Egg freezing has even been described as a key to leveling the playing field between men and women Without the crushing pressure of a ticking biological clock women have more freedom in making life choices say advocates A Bloomberg Businessweek magazine   earlier this year asked Will freezing your eggs free your career Not since the birth control pill has a medical technology had such potential to change family and career planning wrote author Emma Rosenblum News of the firms eggfreezing coverage comes in the midst of   as a Silicon Valley perks arms race Its only the latest in a generous list of family and wellnessoriented health benefits from Apple and Facebook whose COO of course is feminist change agent and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg Both companies offer benefits for fertility treatment and adoption Facebook famously gives new parents  in socalled baby cash to use however theyd like Silicon Valley firms are hardly alone in offering generous benefits to attract and keep talent but they appear to be leading the way with egg freezing Advocates say theyve heard murmurs of large law consulting and finance firms helping to cover the costs but no companies are broadcasting this support Its very forwardlooking said Eggsurances Adams Companies may be concerned about the public relations implications of the benefit  in the most cynical light eggfreezing coverage could be viewed as a ploy to entice women to sell their souls to their employer sacrificing childbearing years for the promise of promotion Would potential female associates welcome this option knowing that they can work hard early on and still reproduce if they so desire later on asked Glenn Cohen codirector of Harvard Law Schools PetrieFlom Center for Health Law Policy Biotechnology and Bioethics in a   Or would they take this as a signal that the firm thinks that working there as an associate and pregnancy are incompatible But the more likely explanation for lack of coverage is simply that egg freezing is still new and conversation around the procedure has only recently gone mainstream I think weve reached a tipping point said Adams When I used to say egg freezing people would stare at me with their mouths open Now Most people know someone whos done or considered it Many large companies adopt new benefits in response to employee demand  firms have recently started to offer benefits for transgender employees for example As womens awareness of egg freezing grows more employers may jump on the band wagon The attitude toward egg freezing is very different and more positive than just a few years ago said Christy Jones founder of   a company that offers and promotes egg freezing across the country Women are making the proactive decision to freeze their eggs at a younger age and the choice is more one of empowerment than this is my last chance  the first service to help women finance egg freezing has recently begun to capitalize on this shift by hosting   where experts educate guests Maybe you havent found Mr Right just yet or perhaps you would like more time to focus on your education or career the company website says Whatever the reasons freezing your eggs now will allow you to tackle conception later Women generally need about two weeks of flexibility for one cycle of egg freezing After about ten days of fertility drug injections patients undergo a relatively short outpatient procedure  and theyre back to work the next day said Lynn Westphal Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Stanford University Medical Center From there eggs are frozen and stored until a woman is ready to use them at which point shell begin the process of in vitro fertilization Once a woman freezes her eggs she may never return to use them fertility doctors report Some women get pregnant the oldfashioned way others make different life plans Westphal compares egg freezing to car insurance You hope you dont have to use what youve put away but if you find yourself in a situation where you need to youre glad to have the protection Will the perk pay off for companies The benefit will likely encourage women to stay with their employer longer cutting down on recruiting and hiring costs And practically speaking when women freeze their eggs early firms may save on pregnancy costs in the long run said Westphal A woman could avoid paying to use a donor egg down the road for example or undergoing more intensive fertility treatments when shes ready to have a baby But the emotional and cultural payoff may be more valuable said Jones Offering this benefit can help women be more productive human beings
