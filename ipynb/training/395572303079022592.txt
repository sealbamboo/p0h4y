Two accident and emergency AE units in London are to be downgraded Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced The units at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith will be replaced with hour urgent care centres Mr Hunt also said Ealing and Charing Cross hospitals would continue to have an AE service even if it is in a different shape or size Labour said this amounted to spin which masked their inevitable downgrading to urgent care centres Under the Shaping a Healthier Future programme four AE units were under threat In a statement in the Commons Mr Hunt accepted the findings of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel review The group recommended changes to the AE departments at Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals should take place as soon as practicable but said further work was required for Ealing and Charing Cross   Under the plans nine hospitals in northwest London will be redesigned so the most serious emergencies can be dealt with at AEs in Hillingdon Northwick Park West Middlesex Chelsea and Westminster or St Marys hospitals Mr Hunt said Improvements in emergency care alone should save around  lives per annum and the transformation in outofhospital care will save many more giving northwest London probably the best outofhospital care anywhere in the country He said he wanted to end the uncertainty around the future of Ealing and Charing Cross Mr Hunt said any changes as a result of the programme should be implemented by local commissioners following proper talks with the public Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the decision not to close the AE units represented a minor concession at a time of brutal surgery on west Londons NHS  He said the changes were primarily about saving money not saving lives  Addressing Mr Hunt in the Commons Mr Burnham said You talk of their AEs being of a different size and shape  Isnt that just spin for saying that these units will be downgraded and become urgent care centres Or are you giving them a permanent reprieve If you cant answer those questions directly Im afraid local people in those areas will take what you have said as just weasel words The health secretary said Labour should be shouting from the rooftops to support the proposals as they would mean more emergency doctors more critical care doctors and more psychiatric support and were supported by the medical directors of all nine trusts affected The Department of Health said the changes to AE at Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals would be made after the winter Under the plans m will be spent on both Ealing and Charing Cross hospitals which will have AE units open  hours a day These will have senior doctors and nurses and other emergency care professionals access to specialist consultant opinion social care and psychiatry a range of diagnostic services including pathology and radiology and the ability to admit people to hospital Mr Hunt said resources being taken out of some acute services would be used to give better and safer services  He said an example of changes having a positive impact was stroke services in northwest London which have been centralised in Charing Cross and Northwick Park resulting in stroke mortality rates in London halving  The Labour leader of Ealing Council Julian Bell said Weve been told the maternity unit has been closed  you cant have your baby at Ealing Hospital blue light ambulances cant come  that in my book is not an AE and its not a major hospital Its a sad day and Im very concerned for the residents of Ealing  The Liberal Democrat MP for Brent Central Sarah Teather said it would be vital for health managers to ensure Transport for London made sure the necessary new travel patterns could be accommodated Former shadow health minister Diane Abbott said it was important that ordinary people supported the plans Londoners are particularly cautious about these reconfigurations because of historic problems about access to GPs because of the many excluded communities for whom AE is their primary care and because the institutions are often major employers in their area she said Andy Slaughter Labour MP for Hammersmith and secretary of the Save Our Hospitals campaign said There will be no AE at Hammersmith Hospital in one of the most deprived areas of London and there are no promises to keep the beds and services at Charing Cross open  We will continue to fight these closures until we have a council and a government that will listen to local people and keep our excellent hospitals open On Monday the Court of Appeal   in southeast London During the summer a High Court judge ruled Mr Hunt acted outside his powers when he decided the emergency and maternity units should be cut back and the appeal court backed that decision
