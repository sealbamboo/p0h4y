Colin Hambrook is a poet and visual artist with mental health difficulties and ME He runs Disability Arts Online DAO a web portal for disabled artists which reviews and showcases their work  In Hambrooks latest autobiographical project Knitting Time he recalls being brought up by a Jehovahs Witness mother who was mentally ill She Hambrook and the other Jehovahs Witnesses they knew believed that the world was due to end in  This collection of illustrated poetry and the accompanying art exhibition explore the psychosis and grief he experienced as a result Knitting time is an allegory for psychosis What that does to you is bring you to a place where time is distended Brain functions like memory and cognition can get distorted and it becomes very difficult to believe whats going on in your head The idea of Knitting Time was to try and encapsulate that sense of bringing yourself back into reality  The story that unfolds through the poetry and artwork is that of my mother She was sectioned in the late s early s and knitting was one of the key activities that mental patients were given to keep their hands busy Once they had finished the knitting was ripped apart and the wool reused  My mothers psychosis got worse as time went on and knitting became a key part of her world She was knitting new universes places of safety we could go to when the world ended I was a very serious little boy and took the Jehovahs Witnesses seriously It was frightening to be brought up in this belief and to realise I had to do my best to be perfect so that Id be among the chosen ones when the end came  Everything went wrong quite a few years before  though When my mother was sectioned we were thrown out of the faith We were led to believe that only families who had a strong patriarch at their helm were eligible to be chosen but dad refused to have anything to do with the Jehovahs Witnesses So we felt we were damned anyway  By  I had largely come to realise that it was all rubbish All about money power and religious oppression But there was still a part of me that was keyed in to those beliefs  My feelings were mixed What had happened to my mother in the mental health system left me very depressed so a big part of me was looking forward to it all ending I didnt move forward easily I became very lost and pretty mentally ill and stayed in that state for most of my twenties  Theres part of me thats never quite come to terms with the fact that the world didnt end in   Knitting Times main theme is psychosis Whats your personal experience of this I dont think psychosis is necessarily a bad thing Its common for toddlers to have imaginary friends and night visions to see things that arent there  I had that facility to a greater degree than most I remember vividly seeing things at night time like a lion treading up the stairs or a man dressed in an archetypal burglar outfit swagbag on back  This capacity for hallucination has come and gone throughout my life A large part of me realised early on that it was my mind playing tricks  If I havent slept and my nervous system is distended it is likely that the psychotic episode will be unpleasant But if I can relax into it and find space to let it be then it can be interesting When I was nine or  an angel exuding white light stayed with me all night That was very beautiful Peoples prejudice around psychosis is down to a fear of those kinds of experiences because people dont understand it and people dont talk about it One of my main motivations for doing this project was to try and have a conversation about something people see as very dark and very difficult After my mum had electric shock therapy she temporarily lost all memory of her children It was like shed died the person we knew before never came back During my preteen and teenage years I went through a process of mourning A lot of my psychosis was in response to the grief I felt  I read a book by Joan Didion about the years following her husbands death when she went through a psychosis related to her grief It brought home to me my own experiences as a child The poetry I wrote for Knitting Time is a reflection on that part of my life and how like Joan I came through it with the help of family and friends
