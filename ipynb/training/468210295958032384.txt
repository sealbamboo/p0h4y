The food industry should be regulated like the tobacco industry as obesity poses a greater global health risk than cigarettes say international groups  Consumers International and the World Obesity Federation are calling for the adoption of more stringent rules  These could include pictures on food packaging of damage caused by obesity similar to those on cigarette packets   The Food and Drink Federation said the food industry was working to make healthy options for consumers  The two organisations  CI and WOF  said governments around the world should impose compulsory rules for the food and drink industry They said global deaths due to obesity and being overweight rose from  million in  to  million in  The new rules could include reducing the levels of salt saturated fat and sugar in food improving food served in hospitals and schools imposing stricter advertising controls and educating the public about healthy eating Artificial transfats should be removed from all food and drink products within five years said the recommendations  Advertising to children during television programmes such as the XFactor must be restricted said the organisations  Governments could review food prices introduce taxes change licensing controls and start new research to make this happen the report said Luke Upchurch at Consumers International said they were asking for the same level of global treaty as the tobacco industry faced He said stricter advertising controls could include pictures on food packaging of the damage obesity can cause similar to the images of smokingrelated disease on cigarette boxes  He said We want to avoid a situation like the s where the tobacco industry were saying there is nothing wrong with cigarettes they are good for our health and  or  years later millions have died If we dont take action now we are going to have the same intransigence and footdragging in the food industry He said the new rules would be at the highest level of global agreement meaning governments would be legally required to implement them instead of being able to opt out which he said was the situation at the moment Mr Upchurch said he was confident about Brazil and Norways support and that the UK government had really good ideas  Dr Ian Campbell clinician and founder of the UKs National Obesity Forum said This is very interesting and their recommendations are largely sensible and practical He said only when governments accepted their responsibilities and put consumers before producers will we see real change Dr Campbell added One significant difference between tobacco regulation and food regulation is that we need food to survive we dont need tobacco The inescapable fact is obesity is killing on a massive scale and only action from governments to tackle headon the fundamental causes of obesity will lead to any meaningful decreases Dr Tim Lobstein at the World Obesity Federation said If obesity was an infectious disease we would have seen billions of dollars being invested in bringing it under control  But because obesity is largely caused by the overconsumption of fatty and sugary foods we have seen policymakers unwilling to take on the corporate interests who promote these foods He said governments needed to take collective action  Terry Jones director of communications at the Food and Drink Federation said UK food and drink manufacturers were already supporting improvements to public health through many of the measures outlined in the recommendations He said The industrys participation in the UK governments public health responsibility deal sees manufacturers working in partnership with government health organisations NGOs and other stakeholders My Jones said it was acting to reduce salt saturated fat and calories in products provide clear nutritional labelling and to promote healthier diets and more physical activity
