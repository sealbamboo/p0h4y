Since her young son was diagnosed as autistic Sara Dunn has been attempting to help challenge the myths surrounding autism with a camera The photographer has been documenting her experiences with her son and other families affected by autism through photography Ms Dunn  from Chester stays with families for  hours to take images and wants to stage a public exhibition of her work Admiring Autism Some people have said to me they dont believe in autism my sons just a naughty child Ive been told autistic children dont know how to love They do she said Usually these children are having very complex sensory experiences and theyre in distress with some adults perceiving it as misbehaving Its pretty scary  Ms Dunn and her fianc have a twoyearold son called Frank After initially wondering if he was deaf a doctor then mentioned autism  We thought we would have a fight on our hands by all the horror stories you hear about diagnosis taking years but it was easy with Frank due to the severity of his needs she said By the time he was  months old he was diagnosed as autistic  The paediatrician told Ms Dunn it was the first time she had diagnosed a child under two with the condition  It was really hard Im quite optimistic about it now but at the time I kind of grieved  it was a fork in the road she explained Following the diagnosis she decided to start taking photos of Frank to help her cope I did it initially to remind myself that there are good days and there are small achievements Before I knew it I also wanted to photograph the bad days to show the professionals involved she said  Through the photography Ive realised the small triumphs that he has More regular eye contact more hugs starting to understand simple commands like bath or juice its a good reminder of how enjoyable these children are She added the images helped her manage Franks meltdowns and when he hits me After posting her images on social media other families around the UK started to get in touch to say they were also going through a similar experience She then decided to find out about other peoples ups and downs of autism by staying with other families  The staying part is important Im not prepared to come to their home take a picture and go because thats not representing what life is like for these people Ms Dunn said  The National Autistic Society said just over one in  of the population have autism but there is no register or exact count kept  It varies from mild to so severe a person may be almost unable to communicate and require roundtheclock care I met Ms Dunn as she stayed with the Callaghan family from Preston She had been sleeping on a camp bed in the hall downstairs and had just accompanied the family on a trip to the park  Lewis Callaghan four was diagnosed with autism when he was two He doesnt speak but uses the Picture Exchange Communication System  a set of cards containing images to help nonverbal people communicate  His mother Amanda  said We have had comments like he will grow out of it but its a lifelong condition Others think they shy away from social interaction with people but as you can see Lewis wants to interact with strangers I think its very misunderstood Its a very wide spectrum you could have one child who is so sensitive to noise that they have to wear ear defenders all the time or so sensitive to touch they cant wear normal clothes It can go from one extreme to another and everything in between Like Frank Lewis is a sensory seeker who explores the world around him by touching everything During the interview with his mum Lewis pulled the BBC tag cord I was wearing many times  More than  families from northwest England and further afield are now involved in the project  Looking back at Admiring Austism Ms Dunn said her images show a couple of things people may think autistic people dont do like kisses hugs and smiles She hopes her collection will go on display during National Autism Awareness Month next year and eventually wants to expand it to cover the lives of older children and adults with autism  The National Autistic Society has called it an inspirational project Ms Dunn said she had fears for the future but the photos were helping to create a small community to share her worries and experiences We should admire these children because they do achieve but we should also admire the parents and carers as they do go through many struggles but they get through it and carry on every single day she said
