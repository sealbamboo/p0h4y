Scientists from many areas of biology are flocking to a technique that allows them to work inside cells making changes in specific genes far faster  and for far less money  than ever before Its really powerful its a really exciting development says   of the University of Massachusetts Medical School He won the   in  for   that also lets scientists modify how genes work But Mello says this new genetic tool  known as CRISPR for    is more powerful because now you can essentially change a genome at will to almost anything you want The skys the limit Sure scientists previously have made enormous strides in their ability to do things with genes modifying them moving them from cell to cell even animal to animal But doing these things has been time consuming and expensive It looks like CRISPR will change all that Mello thinks medical applications for CRISPR are not far off Hes formed a company   to develop therapies for people with genetic blood diseases like   and   He says its been possible in theory to treat these diseases by removing a patients bone marrow repairing the damaged gene and then returning the repaired cells to the patient In practice Mello says succeeding with that approach has been nearly impossible But now the cost for that has come down to where its really feasible to tailor therapies using the patients own cells he says essentially correcting their genetic disease Though a lot of testing still needs to be done before doctors can say the CRISPR technique is safe and effective enough for use in treating patients even many scientists not directly involved in the research are enthusiastic about its possibilities CRISPR is one of those interesting inventions that comes not from scientists explicitly trying to cure a disease but from researchers trying to understand something fundamental about nature  research at the University of California Berkeley has focused on how bacteria fight the flu It turns out bacteria dont like getting flu any more than the rest of us do Doudna says the way bacteria fight off a flu virus gave her and her colleagues an idea Bacteria have special enzymes that can cut open the DNA of an invading virus and make a change in the DNA at the site of the cut  essentially killing the virus Doudna and other scientists figured out how this defense system works in bacteria that was interesting all by itself But then they realized that they could modify these enzymes   not just the DNA sequence of viruses that infect bacteria So this is now enabling researchers to introduce changes into the genetic code of cells and organisms at essentially any site she says Doudna realized from the start that she was on to something big I remember really feeling  the hairs on the back of my neck she recalls Because I thought wow if this could work in animal or plant cells this could be a very very useful and very powerful tool Honestly I didnt even realize at the time   powerful Like Craig Mello Doudna also foresees medical applications for CRISPR and she is a cofounder of a   that hopes to use the technology to develop new therapies
