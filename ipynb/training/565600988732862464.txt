For the first time in four years California is experiencing a statewide epidemic of pertussis or whooping cough with infants under the age of  months facing the greatest risk of hospitalization or death according to state health authorities We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated said Dr Ron Chapman director of the California Department of Public Health We also urge parents to vaccinate infants as soon as possible California counties have reported  cases of the disease this year including two infant deaths While that figure is less than the  cases reported in   the last epidemic year  health officials say this years caseload is on track to meet that level The summer months are usually the worst said Dr Gil Chavez an epidemiologist and deputy director at the department A disease is considered an epidemic if it exceeds anticipated levels it is not the same as declaring a public health emergency Chavez said On average state epidemiologists expect to see  to  cases of whooping cough each month In the last two weeks California counties reported more than  The earliest age an infant can be vaccinated is six weeks Because of this health officials say every pregnant woman should get a Tdap vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy as the mothers immunity will transfer to her baby  at least temporarily Unlike the measles vaccine pertussis vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity Its partially for this reason that whooping cough is cyclical It reaches epidemic levels every three to five years The disease is caused by the bacterium  which clings to the tiny hairs or cilia that line human air passages The hairs usually work to keep the passageways clean by sweeping them but   produces toxins that paralyze the hairs and inflame surrounding tissues As a result patients cant clear mucous from their lungs and their airways constrict This causes a whooping noise as they attempt to breathe after a coughing fit Symptoms can vary by age but children commonly suffer a cough and runny nose for one to two weeks then the cough becomes more severe Some infected infants may not suffer an apparent cough instead their face might appear to turn red or purple at times Our No  goal here is to try and prevent those cases of severe disease Chavez said
