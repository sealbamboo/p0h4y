For years Brandy McEllrath didnt think she was at much risk of developing   because no one on her mothers side of the family had ever been touched by the disease But last year during a visit with her new gynecologist the yearold mentioned that breast cancer has figured prominently in her fathers side of the family and both her aunt and grandmother had grappled with the disease At her doctors urging McEllrath went for a blood test that detects mutations of the BRCA and BRCA genes which put a woman at especially high risk for developing breast cancer McEllrath tested positive for mutations in both genes I was a little bit shocked because I was in denial it could happen to me I was swimming with the ideas and emotions of what I should do now In a split second my life completely changed says McEllrath who lives in Vancouver Wash and is the mother of two teenage girls But if it werent for the test I would have felt like a victim McEllrath who decided to have a   and is preparing to also have her ovaries removed as a result of the test findings is one example of a woman whose decisions were greatly impacted by having the BRCA test And a new study which was conducted by   a home genetics testing company reports patients are open to using the test to gauge their breast cancer risk and make crucial decisions about their health To learn more about the range of reactions patients have upon learning they are BRCApositive Uta Francke MD from the department of pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University in Palo Alto and her team interviewed subjects who had learned of their BRCA status through a home genetic test purchased through andMe They invited  people who had tested positive for the mutation and  who had tested negative to take a survey about their personal experience learning the results of the test Among the respondents  customers   men and  women  with the mutation as well as  without it agreed to participate in a phone interview Five women and two of the men had already known they were BRCApositive from prior tests and the andMe test confirmed those results Researchers who published their study in the debut issue of  an open access journal asked questions about family health history the participants emotional response upon learning the results perceived risk for developing cancer whether they shared the test results with family and friends if they consulted a doctor regarding the test results and if they had taken medical action such as having a mastectomy or seeking additional testing Among the group of BRCApositive subjects  women and  men said the test results were new information and caught them by surprise None of the subjects said they had an extremely negative reaction or felt especially anxious about the results while five women and six men reported their reaction was neutral The majority of the BRCApositive women sought medical advice and four of them opted for preventive surgery Five to  percent of breast cancers are believed to be hereditary Women with mutations in BRCA and BRCA are at higher risk  they are  to  percent more susceptible to developing breast cancer by the age of  than women who dont have the mutations whose risk is around  percent Women with the gene mutation also have a  to  percent chance of developing ovarian cancer according to the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation A woman who knows she is at risk for breast cancer can start annual screenings at an earlier age have MRIs in addition to   or opt to have a preventive mastectomy or   vastly reducing her risk for developing the disease The andMe home genetic test  available online for   can provide a person with information about  genetic health traits that include likely drug responses disease risk and carrier statuses says the company Once the kit arrives in the mail the individual sends back a saliva sample A few weeks later the customer can log onto andMes website for information such as their likelihood for developing Alzheimers disease asthma gallstones developmental dyslexia Canavan disease their reactions to drugs such as betablocker and metformin response to exercise and whether they have the BRCA and BRCA gene mutation Customers who purchase the test have the option to only look at certain results meaning they can opt out of seeing the BRCA test results if they so choose Prior studies on BRCA tests have only focused on hypothetical responses to positive results says Francke who began her research for the paper a year ago We were surprised there werent more negative responses she says adding that typically andMe conducts their studies by using customer data thats already available from selling the product This is the first study in which the company approached customers to conduct interviews No one said they were extremely upset or thought about ending their life says Francke However some of the subjects reported the test had prompted them to make life decisions such as arranging to have prophylactic surgery after having children So this was something worked into their planning their life says Francke She says she was most surprised by how the test results influenced other family members to be tested what she calls a cascade effect But Joanne Mortimer MD vice chair and professor of the Department of Medical Oncology  Therapeutics Research at City of Hope a cancer research hospital in Duarte Calif says this study doesnt offer the full picture of the emotional impact the BRCA test can have on patients Its important she says to assess the emotional impact of the   that must happen after the patient gets results when they are faced with making difficult choices such as whether to have elective surgery or simply to closely monitor their health  When you first get the information youre not sure what youre going to do with it Mortimer says Being upset with the test results is only a small part of what this test is about For McEllrath after counseling the choice was easy It turned out the test also saved her life her doctors detected cancer when she underwent an ultrasound prior to her mastectomy Both of McEllraths sisters have also since chosen to have elective mastectomies McEllrath says knowing the test is available has also empowered her two teenage daughters to get tested for the gene though neither of them have undergone it yet They both know they have this tool they can use she says
