With the fall season come littered leaves new television lineups and the sport that cant stop stirring up controversy football Rough tackles and concussions worry many parents And no wonder Research   by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons suggests that more than a third of college football players have had one concussion and  percent have had more than one Common strategies for trying to reduce the concussion risk have included specially cushioned   and safer practice   But Dartmouth College is trying something a little different this season  a robot Rolled out literally in partnership with DartmouthHitchcocks Center for Telehealth the robot called VGo looks like a foottall popsicle stick on wheels with a screen and camera up top It allows a brain specialist from miles away to help certified athletic trainers  if a player might have a concussion and what should happen next I would say an athletic trainer can probably manage  to  percent of the cases that he or she sees says   director of the Neurosport Research Lab at the University of Michigan But some difficult cases could benefit from having a quick consult with a concussion specialist like a neurologist or neuropsychologist he says For example a player who is coming in and out of consciousness or who seems to be having mental problems could benefit from a quick deeper evaluation says Broglio But not all high schools and colleges have certified athletic trainers on hand during every practice and scrimmage let alone a brain specialist Thats where remote help could come in handy the makers of VGo believe With VGo a school could have a virtual presence on the sidelines  essentially one doctor could be on the sidelines of a dozen games all at the same time says   director of the DartmouthHitchcocks center If VGo works for the Dartmouth football team Pletcher says it could potentially be used for other contact sports  hockey basketball or lacrosse for example  and by schools that dont have the budget to staff various games and practices with medical professionals Getting a medical problem diagnosed by someone whos not in the same room isnt new Kaiser Permanente one of the nations largest nonprofit health plans says that in   percent of the visits to primary care providers at Kaiser happened by email and  percent were over the phone However not all health professionals are sold on telemedicines effectiveness A    of  telemedicine studies found that  concluded it was effective  said it was promising but in need of more research and  said evidence is too limited to be definitive A video call by smartphone or electronic tablet would be cheaper and even more mobile than the robot some might argue But   a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona who has been involved with some preliminary testing of VGo on the football field says that unlike a phone the robot doesnt require an extra person to hold the camera up to the athlete And the robots movements are controlled remotely by the specialist who can pan and zoom as needed Whether Dartmouths robot works better than a smartphone for a concussion consultation is still an open question Vargas thinks the device also might eventually prove useful for remote monitoring of games or practices when athletic trainers cant be on hand But not everyone is convinced the device will ever be that sort of substitute There are a lot of things you cant deduce through a computer screen says the University of Michigans Broglio like watching a player on the sidelines or later in class for any change in personality which can also be a sign of concussion Its good Broglio says but its an adjunct at this point
