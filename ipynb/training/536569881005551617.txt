 As a GP I have many roles and like many colleagues I am also involved in commissioning including being medical director for the   programme and leading the development of a community education provider network CEPN I think I found my way into general practice because it provided me with the opportunity to treat people rather than diseases It also gave me the chance to develop skills in other areas like teaching management and commissioning which I find interesting and challenging The NHS and general practice are in my DNA so I want them both to survive and thrive but change is necessary to meet the needs of a changing and ageing population with greater expectations of the   There is also less money to fund modern and more expensive drugs and health technologies We must all respond to this evolving context and this in my view means very significant changes in the way we deliver healthcare including greater emphasis on prevention more care delivered outside hospital and centralising key specialisms where clinically appropriate I would also want to see more blurring of the boundaries between professional groups enabling greater provision of training and education in the community  the work I do is challenging but also very rewarding My proudest moments are when people thank me for what I have said or done to help them as a GP I am also proud to have contributed to the development and early thinking in south London about CEPNs as a new delivery model for training in the community which I believe will be transformational I have to admit too that I am proud to have been awarded an MBE this year in the Queens birthday honours for services to general practice  coping with rising demands on general practice but also with criticism and lack of understanding about the level of complexity and difficulty of the work that   in the community do  helping the public to realise that they are the custodians of the future of the NHS and must make sure the shrinking resource that we have is used wisely and sustainably in an age where demand is higher than ever before Supporting the NHS doesnt mean resisting any change it means making the right changes to improve the quality of care and outcomes  terrific energetic and committed to doing the best they can to make ends meet without compromising quality while ensuring that the next generation are in place willing and able to take over  when I finally retire I want to see the NHS thriving locally with goodquality care and people who can deliver it consistently to everyone everywhere and whenever it is needed take on too much and aim too high but there is a lot to do and so little time to get it right  focus on developing a sustainable model for transforming the workforce so much more care can be delivered in the community The traditional model of hospital care is changing and we need to respond This means enabling our workforce to be as capable of delivering care in a patients home as they are in a hospital changing the system is hard and often resisted by institutional loyalties and local politicians All too often the needs of our population are not being properly addressed by the way healthcare is currently organised and delivered  time there is never enough this is a tough question but I think the big thing I have learned is that if you really want to make change happen then you must play a long game take everybody with you and not care who takes the credit I have been in medicine too long to dwell on the future It doesnt exist The present is what we have and the trick is to make it count I guess the best thing is that no two days are ever the same I never run out of new challenges or new things to learn about It is always busy sometimes a bit chaotic but never predictable or dull I would have to say that the continual cycle of organisational change is exhausting and wastes so much energy and money reinventing the past Structural change is not the answer to improving outcomes for our patients but every new administration has to shuffle the deck It would be great if in future clinicians became more involved in these decisions Still being at it after all these years  Nothing I am out like a light before I hit the pillow
