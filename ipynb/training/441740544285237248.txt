In only the second documented case of its kind an infant born with the AIDS virus may have been cured of the infection thanks to an intensive drug treatment begun just hours after her birth The baby girl  now  months old  from Long Beach Calif is still on that regimen of antiretroviral drugs But researchers   at an AIDS meeting in Boston this week say advanced testing suggests that she is HIVnegative The California childs case comes three years after doctors   of her HIV infection shortly after she was born That child is now a healthy yearold who seems to be free of HIV doctors say despite having been off the AIDS drugs for almost two years now Researchers are eager to determine if the two remarkable cases are rare experiences or a broader sign of hope for the hundreds of HIVinfected babies born each day To find out clinical trials involving roughly  newborns will begin as early as this April or May says Dr   who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Fauci whose institute funded the research in both cases sat down on Thursday with NPRs Audie Cornish for    to talk about the two children and what their promising experience might mean for the future Heres an edited excerpt of their conversation In the usual situation when a baby is born to an infected mother you dont know at birth for sure if the baby is infected So what you do is you give the baby whats called a preventive type of drug regimen  lower dose and fewer drugs When you find out that the baby is ultimately infected you switch over to the full component of three drugs at the right dose to start treating them  The original Mississippi baby and the baby from California were treated within hours of birth as if they were infected So instead of giving them the prevention type of drug over a period of a few weeks they were immediately given the fullblown course of the treatment drugs The doctors would never have just  stopped drug treatment in the baby after several months The mother was lost to follow up and she apparently stopped giving the drug to the baby And then when the mother and child came back the physician noticed that the little girl had been several months off therapy and the virus did not rebound So a quirk  of the mothers decision or accident in not following up with the baby  has actually led to a situation that turned out to be beneficial To just  stop would not be ethical and thats the reason why were sponsoring a clinical trial that will begin sometime at the end of April or at the beginning of May where were taking a large number of babies  born of mothers who are infected women who have not received any antiHIV treatment during pregnancy at all and were going to be treating those babies literally within  hours of birth with the full component of the treatment regimen We will be assuming that they are infected even though they might not be And then well wait for a considerable period of time and very carefully in individual babies stop therapy to see if the virus rebounds In the United States its really not a big problem at all only because we have the prenatal and postnatal care for the mothers and almost all mothers who are infected will be started on antiretroviral drug therapy It will be extremely unlikely that the baby will be infected  not impossible but very very unlikely However the situation in the developing world is somewhat different There its not uncommon that a mother will come into a clinic in labor ready to deliver never having seen a health care provider and not being on antiviral therapy Those are the babies that are at the highest risk   Well its quite promising because if its the second one that we have documented now  and there probably will be others coming along  it really brings up a broader concept If you have the possibility of truly curing babies at the time of birth then the riskbenefit ratio of waiting until you document that theyre infected  that really changes the equation
