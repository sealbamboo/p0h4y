Who do these guys think they are the Dr Frankensteins of virology First two teams of virologists   more dangerous versions of the deadly HN flu Now they want to give the HN virus which has already sickened at least  people and killed  people in Asia a few new capabilities drug resistance faster transmission between people and the ability to sneak past the immune system Flu researchers Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands and Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of WisconsinMadison wrote up a whole list of risky experiments theyre starting with the new HN bird flu and then published their plans Wednesday in both   and   About  other scientists also signed the letters The proposed studies would essentially create a recipe for a superflu Some scientists worry that these strains could escape the lab and possibly kill millions  or get in the hands of the wrong people Fouchier concedes that some of the experiments are dangerous But he says the information gleaned from these superflus is critical for determining whether HN has the potential to trigger a pandemic like the Spanish flu in  or the   in  The   bird flu first appeared in China about six months ago The virus doesnt spread very easily between people and most people have probably caught it from live poultry But Fouchier and others are concerned that HN could evolve into a bigger problem We know that all pandemic viruses over the last century were transmitted via the airborne route Fouchier tells Shots The HN virus is not yet transmitted efficiently through the air But the question is can it gain the capacity and therefore pose a serious pandemic threat To figure that out Fouchier and Kawaoka are planning to genetically engineer HN and then see which changes in the viruss genes accelerate its spread between mammals By engineering these viruses we can stay ahead of the game Fouchier says By knowing which mutations might arise in nature we can be on the lookout for them Thats clearly of great relevance for public health Other flu researchers dont agree They think the risks posed by these labmade viruses outweigh their benefits Others question whether the proposed experiments have the proper oversight and argue that similar studies havent offered useful information for stopping flus The scientific justification presented for doing this work is very flimsy infectious disease specialist Adel A F Mahmoud of Princeton University     And the claims that it will lead to anything useful are lightweight Fouchier and Kawaoka   a storm of controversy in late  when they engineered versions of the HN that could spread through the coughs and sneezes of ferrets  the lab standins for people In nature HN doesnt pass easily between people But both Fouchier and Kawaoka figured out that just a few changes in the viruss genes could make HN more contagious  and a bigger threat Those findings prompted the Department of Health and Human Services to set up   for risky studies with HN It established a special review process for funding the work and outlined seven criteria that proposed experiments would have to meet HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Wednesday that the experiments proposed by Fouchier and Kawaoka will also undergo a similar review process before the researchers receive US funding Fouchier says that he has already started some of the HN studies with money from the European Union and the Dutch government
