s a society we continue to consider how technology can enhance quality of life productivity working conditions and the effectiveness of services  while also supporting peoples needs So join me for some future gazing to consider how   might transform health social care and social work Ever left a home visit or meeting and wished that a colleague could have been there to support you or to contribute to the situation With the   app this can become a reality This app allows other colleagues using Google Glass to Livestream into meetings home visits or conferences and take part in the discussion As colleagues Livestream into your discussion they add knowledge and expertise that enables you to offer faster better and more holistic service and care In a climate of austerity local authorities have embraced new ways of working to save costs This includes increasing hotdesking and use of agile and mobile working Although mobile working offers added flexibility it can also affect team dynamics and cohesion Livestream can help reconnect remote employees with each other to foster a sense of inclusivity Word Lens can be an enormous help in bridging language barriers The Glass camera can translate printed words and then overlays the translated text on top of the original text Such a tool can be used in partnership with a translator for practitioners working with people where English isnt their first language This bridging of the language divide can generate better understanding and empathy and a greater appreciation of peoples needs and preferences Google Glass can help when selecting services or providers It allows you to search a vast array of data and to compare different services before deciding which to purchase while the actual purchase can be made in a blink Literally the app allows you to purchase products and services with a blink Google Glass can also help people make more informed choices For example it can compare food labels with your nutritional requirements and dietary restrictions or allow you to track your diet offer health tips and recipes serve as a personal fitness tracker and offer exercise feedback It can also deliver medication information or health warnings give advice on personal safety and help people with visual auditory and physical disabilities Additionally Glass can guide you stepbystep through how to prepare a given recipe or remind you to turn off the gas when the food is cooked Hospitalisation or a new home should not mean losing touch with family Friends and relatives can Livestream to communicate with their loved ones and this can help the person adjust to their new surroundings while still feeling that they belong Families and carers could also receive selected updates about their loved ones activities and wellbeing By offering a visual of the patient combined with selected information from the patients record Google Glass can transform ehealth and einterventions  Doctors nurses social workers and   with appropriate consent can readily access and share medical and other relevant information and can remotely monitor the persons health and progress or offer einterventions and esupport The potential to monitor peoples wellbeing could help provide enhanced and more holistic care and services Just think about the possibilities for people experiencing Alzheimers dementia or other challenges Every new technology that affects the way we process information or do things bring new opportunities and ethical challenges and Google Glass is no exception There are already important questions about authenticity boundaries and privacy But the seamless integration of Glass into our lives can enhance services and could help to overcome some of the   in the social care sector
