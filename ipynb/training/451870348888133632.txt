Half of people with lung cancer die within six months of diagnosis says a report from Macmillan Cancer Support which looked at variations in cancer survival rates  While breast cancer and prostate cancer have a fiveyear survival rate of more than  lung cancers is around  Those who survive lung cancer for five years are then  times more likely to get another cancer Macmillan said improving early diagnosis was key In their report the cancer charity carried out an analysis of almost  cancer patients experiences of the NHS in England from  to  They looked in detail at what happened to people with one of four types of cancer  breast prostate lung or brain cancer  after they were diagnosed The research showed that one in five  women with breast cancer and one in four  men with prostate cancer survived for at least seven years after diagnosis in good health  But the picture was significantly worse for people with lung cancer or the most common form of brain cancer of whom less than  survived longterm and in good health The report suggests that one in five people with lung cancer die within one month of being diagnosed and  die within one year  Although survival rates for some cancers have soared over the past  years in England the report says other cancers are lagging behind and the figures make the case for improving cancer care across the UK more urgent In its report   Macmillan Cancer Support urges NHS leaders and GPs to plan cancer services better improve early diagnosis and provide the best treatment available regardless of age or location Ciaran Devane chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support said the findings revealed stark variations Cancer is not just one disease and therefore there is no onesizefitsall approach to treatment and aftercare  The NHS needs to get much better at using robust data to understand the complex needs of people with different cancers so that services can be planned accordingly Its no good papering over the cracks any longer we need a complete system overhaul  Dr Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said the report made an important call for improvements in early diagnosis  Late presentation and diagnosis is one of the main reasons lung cancer survival rates in this country lag so far behind rates in Europe and the US as well as rates for other cancers As such the reports revelation that over half of lung cancer patients die within just six months of diagnosis is sadly very telling Dr Woods said evidence suggested that public awareness campaigns were starting to increase early diagnosis rates But she added It is no coincidence that survival rates are so much greater for the likes of breast cancer given the amount of research funding allocated to such areas have long dwarfed the amount given to lung cancer  Lung cancer is by far the biggest cancer killer in this country its time we stopped treating it like the poor relation Most cases of lung cancer are related to smoking which is the biggest risk factor for the disease Although rates of lung cancer are decreasing in men they are rising in women because of the number of women who continued to smoke during the postwar period and into the s
