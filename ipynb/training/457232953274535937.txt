Originally Stone Phillips told me he intended to shoot a kind of home movie His parents after deliberating with their three children for a year were about to leave their independent living apartment in St Louis for a similar one in North Carolina near their daughters home She would supervise their care as their mothers dementia progressed I wanted to chronicle the move Mr Phillips  the former network news correspondent and anchor told me And I wanted to capture her before the dementia became too advanced So as Grace and Vic Phillips then  and  began saying their goodbyes to their many local friends and neighbors fellow church members even that nice lady at the bank their youngest child kept his camcorder rolling and asked lots of questions The elder Phillipses had lived in St Louis for decades Shed taught school hed been a chemical engineer at Monsanto Leaving would be wrenching If thats what you think is best Ill go with the program Grace Phillips says onscreen bravely trying to conceal confusion and anxiety beneath relentless sunniness Its going to be a whole new chapter At this point the handwriting had been on the wall for many months She was already experiencing memory loss Her husband who no longer drove would have had trouble taking care of her on his own Shed recently taken one of his blood pressure medications by mistake passed out and wound up at the hospital Their children lived in North Carolina Wisconsin and New York It was time Even as she reluctantly consented it was kind of heartbreaking Mr Phillips said It was difficult for them and for us an unsettling process  but one he knew that many families were experiencing The more the story unfolded it occurred to me it could be shared His family consented The resulting documentary Moving With Grace has been shown by  public television stations around the country since its debut on the St Louis affiliate almost a year ago WNET in New York will air it on Sunday April  at  pm KCTS in Seattle and KYVE in Yakima Wash will show it on May   Mothers Day  at  pm Distributed by American Public Television its likely to pop up on other stations in coming months Keep an eye out for it Moving With Grace is a frank and moving story that Mr Phillips hopes will stimulate discussions in other families His was fortunate that his parents agreed to relocate and could afford a continuing care retirement community But in many ways theirs is becoming a universal saga Since moving into their new complex in June  the couple has graduated from independent to assisted living Vic Phillips feeling isolated and depressed at first found assisted living friendlier Now  he works out daily in the gym and solves crossword puzzles online Grace Phillips  remains her cheery rosy amazing self her son said But she has declined since he shot the film When her son flies in from New York sometimes she recognizes him and sometimes she thinks Im a nice young man whos come to visit  Soon she will need to move into the memory care unit and the couple will be separated for the first time since they married in  At least their children think they will be only a few hallways apart Mr Phillips is glad they moved when they did And hes glad for personal reasons to have recorded his stillvibrant mother a couple of years ago Its a treasure for me seeing her be herself he said Hes a professional but you dont have to be to follow his lead Id encourage people Take out your phone do some interviews get some video he said Its precious to have
