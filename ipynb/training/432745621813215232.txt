In thebetterlatethannever department the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has revised its guidelines for effective treatment of the symptoms of   Published as a practice bulletin for doctors called   the new guidelines recognize that up to threefourths of women in the United States experience troublesome side effects when their bodies stop producing   as a result of natural or medically induced menopause The document addresses the most common distressing consequences hot flushes and vaginal atrophy Hot flushes can last for months or even decades but vaginal problems if untreated persist for the remainder of a womans life Hot flushes can cause drenching sometimes embarrassing sweating and seriously disrupt sleep night after night Vaginal atrophy and the loss of lubrication and elasticity can make sexual encounters painful depress libido and cause irritation and   during exercise You might think the standard treatment would be to administer the hormones that menopausal women are losing Indeed supplementation with estrogen was a common practice for decades and not just for curbing menopausal symptoms Estrogen was widely promoted as a way to protect womens health and to keep looking and feeling young well into old age But in  a large clinical trial called the Womens Health Initiative found that the most popular form of hormone replacement a pill that combined estrogen and synthetic   called Prempro increased a womans risk of heart disease   stroke and blood clots  The highly publicized results tainted hormone therapy with a broad brush Although the Womens Health Initiative was designed primarily to test the popular premise that hormone replacement after menopause protected womens hearts the unexpected findings prompted millions of middleaged and older women to stop using the hormones and kept many millions more from starting them Even though the vast majority of the  participants in the study were older women well past menopause the findings were widely interpreted to apply to all women going through menopause even younger women just approaching the end of their fertile years Somewhat frenetic experimentation ensued as physicians drug companies and women themselves searched for effective alternatives to hormone replacement Various nonhormonal remedies were promoted from soy foods and black cohosh to exercise and   Each had its advocates but all lacked rigorous scientific evidence for effectiveness Those promoting soybased foods and supplements for example cited the low reported rates of menopausal symptoms among Asian women whose diets are especially rich in soy which has estrogenic effects An authoritative review of placebocontrolled studies of plantbased estrogens however   One exception was genistein a substance in soy which the researchers said warranted further study The new bulletin prepared by Dr Clarisa R Gracia an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania examines the various claims and scores of studies It offers treatment recommendations based on the best available evidence for preserving the health and wellbeing of women experiencing menopausal symptoms In an interview Dr Gracia acknowledged that theres a strong placebo effect when women try one or another suggested remedy for menopausal distress She admitted that its all for the better if an innocuous placebo like a food or supplement brings relief to some women But most women do best when their physicians offer remedies that have been shown to be effective in welldesigned studies And as you might guess estrogen alone or in combination with a natural or synthetic progesterone progestin for women who still have a uterus is the most effective therapy for curbing hot flushes the report found Data do not support the use of progestinonly medications   or compounded bioidentical hormones the report also said Estrogen with or without progestin can be administered orally or through the skin with a patch gel or spray The transdermal route is considered safer When absorbed through the skin the hormones bypass the liver which would otherwise create substances that might raise the risk of heart attack or   The report emphasizes that treatment with hormones must be individualized and that doctors should prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest time needed to relieve hot flushes But because some women may need hormone therapy to control hot flushes even in their   years the guidelines recommend against routine discontinuation of systemic estrogen at age  Hormone replacement can be risky for some women especially those who have had breast cancer Alternatives that have   of   known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs like   and serotonin  reuptake inhibitors SNRIs like Pristiq Clonidine a   medication and gabapentin an anticonvulsant may also be helpful though neither is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for menopausal treatment The report found little or no data to support the use of herbal remedies   phytoestrogens like isoflavones soy and red clover or acupuncture to relieve hot flushes It did recommend common sense lifestyle solutions like dressing in layers lowering room temperatures consuming cool drinks and avoiding alcohol and caffeine For overweight and obese women weight loss can also help As with hot flushes vaginal symptoms respond best to estrogen therapy which can be administered through the mouth or skin or locally via a cream tablet or ring Even a lowdose vaginal tablet containing  micrograms of estradiol improves symptoms the report noted Lowdose vaginal treatments are administered daily for a week or two at first then once or twice a week indefinitely as maintenance therapy Because small amounts of estrogen used vaginally can enter general circulation women who have had hormonesensitive breast cancer are advised to try nonhormonal remedies first Many women experience relief of symptoms with lubricants and moisturizers prepared with water or silicone Lubricants applied just before intercourse can reduce friction and pain caused by dryness Moisturizers are used routinely to relieve dryness   irritation and pain and to improve elasticity Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved Osphena ospemifene to treat vaginal atrophy related to menopause The drug taken orally once a day is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has estrogenlike effects in the vagina But Osphena too can promote endometrial growth It is not recommended for women who have had breast cancer and it is not intended for longterm use
