Put a bunch of brand new hightech tennis rackets in front of a handful of pretty good middleaged  players  being Roger Federer and  being an untrained monkey and they wont care what kind of Nobel Prizewinning innovations went into building them But they will tell you what works Heres how they rated the hottest new tennis technology all about  retail on a cold winter night in suburbia under the lights  New racket with the fewest horizontal strings on the market  compared with the normal  or  causing the  vertical strings to snap back faster creating more spin and yielding greater control The design touted as the next big thing in rackets is claimed to deliver  more spin than a typical racket  Best for pure control Noticeably more spin than the other test rackets The ball goes where you aim it said one This is great for volleying and for doubles play where you need more accuracy than power said another Superb control at the net Weight About  ounces  A noticeable drop in power I couldnt hit the ball with enough drive and power said one Im getting more serves in but they arent going as deep or with as much speed So the balls are easier to return     This stiff torqueresistant frame is made of a graphiteandtungsten composite with a vibrationdampening treatment thats purportedly easy on your elbows and hands and aids control Its massive triangulartubed aeroshaped neck purportedly lets it swing through the air faster  The group ranked this one best overall its combo of stability and maneuverability made it the choice for singles doubles and strong hitters who wanted more control Testers called it the most powerful of the test rackets about equal to the Prince with the secondbest control next to the Wilson Good power without hurting your arm not a lot of vibration said one Great at the baseline and for serving It has a by string pattern and weighs about  ounces  None     Head uses hightech Graphene a single ultralight Nobelwinning layer of carbon atoms the company says is  times stronger than steel to lighten the shaft and bulk up the head and grip The result it says is more power and faster swing speed with less effort  A balanced allround racket with no flaws It has good accuracycontrol good power a solid feel and minimal vibration and shock Its almost as good allround as the Babolat said one I loved it serving It has an by string pattern and weighs about  ounces  None     Yearold graphite model with giant   and  inch holes in the frame rather than conventional pinhole grommets Prince claims the holes give the strings more response upon impact a bigger sweet spot and more power and control  The testers rated the Warrior a good allaround racket although it was no ones favorite One felt it had great raw power for baseline pounding and serving Another liked its spin and control Several liked the soft cushioned comfort and response In general it was thought to have a good balance of power and accuracy similar to the Head It has a by string pattern and weighs about  ounces  A bit of a muffled feel on finesse shots
