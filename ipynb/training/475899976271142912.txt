The performance of the Welsh NHS is never far from the headlines It takes up almost half the Welsh governments annual budget and those who manage and deliver the service are under scrutiny like never before  But how has the Welsh NHS evolved since the Welsh government took control of it in   The first decade of devolution was characterised by an unprecedented increase in health spending   but was all that money spent wisely Some argue the period of plenty was a missed opportunity to deal with some fundamental problems facing the NHS  And now at a time when health spending is being squeezed like never before are politicians and the NHS grasping the nettle in terms of its future  Throughout this week BBC Wales is looking at  years since devolution  throwing a spotlight on different aspects of it each day  BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke gives his assessment of the health system Money is certainly central to it In the first decade of devolution the cash flowed in A decision at Westminster to increase funding so that health spending came up to the European average meant the new Welsh government could also invest significant sums early on  In fact spending per head on health doubled in Wales in just a decade between  and  But since the financial crisis unprecedented growth has been replaced by an unprecedented squeeze  The Welsh government has cut the health budget since the last election meaning health boards have had to struggle to reduce their spending by hundreds of millions of pounds   the Welsh government did allocate some extra funding but theres little doubt belts will be extremely tight for many years to come More doctors and nurses were employed and salaries rose In fact the total number of NHS staff in Wales staff increased by a quarter during that period  But there are differing views as to whether or not all that money was spent wisely During the boom in    It was called Designed for Life It promised and delivered free prescriptions and an older peoples commissioner But some of the targets it set out for the health service on waiting times ambulance response times access to diagnostic tests still arent being met But Designed For Life also promised to redesign the whole of the Welsh NHS and to centralise some specialist care which it argued was spread too thinly and move other types of  care into communities It warned if change didnt happen families and communities would be failed A decade later and change has proved to be as slow as it has been controversial One theory is all the money early on allowed politicians to buy time to avoid grasping the nettle and making some tough decisions on reorganising the health service No such luxury exists today Certainly in health the Welsh Labour government did pursue some priorities that were different to the Labour government in Westminster  While in England there was a focus on patient choice and competition between health organisations the Welsh government set about dismantling the NHSs internal market mirroring decisions made in Scotland It culminated in the formation of seven large Welsh health boards in  which are responsible for pretty much all aspects of healthcare in their localities But according to some the jurys still out as to what extent the structure has delivered for patients Care standards in the Welsh NHS are under the spotlight like never before  after several concerns emerged about poor care David Cameron i  suggested the Welsh NHSs problems meant that Offas Dyke was becoming the dividing line between life and death  Welsh Labour hit back claiming the prime minister was seeking to divert attention from huge problems in England  Between now and the next general election were likely to see many more of these political rows Like the politicians the public also have mixed views   suggested that over  of the Welsh public are  satisfied by their experiences of GPs and hospitals Our BBC Wales poll suggests that less than a quarter believe the NHS has improved since devolution The Welsh NHS is not alone in facing a number of big challenges How to deal with more demand and greater numbers of elderly patients with complicated needs for example at a time when medicine is becoming increasingly specialised and expensive  But against the background of an unprecedented squeeze on its finances the Welsh health minister and others suggest the time might be right for a public debate about what we expect from the NHS to deliver in the st Century It depends who you ask Some argue the Welsh NHS is now is in a much stronger position than it was in  others claim the past  years is characterised by many missed opportunities But  a  came to the conclusion that there was no clear evidence that NHS Wales was lagging behind any other part of the UK In fact it demonstrated that NHS performance in the four countries on important measures of quality eg avoidable death rates   had remained broadly similar over two decades despite big policy differences postdevolution  Some are asking whether that means the NHS in reality is too big and complex for any politician to properly control Whats clear is with health accounting for almost half the Welsh Governments budget its stewardship of the NHS will continue to come under the spotlight  But like like elsewhere in the UK when it comes to running a health service in the face of ever increasing demand it seems there are few easy answers
