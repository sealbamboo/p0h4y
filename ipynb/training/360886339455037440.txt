Suffering from heart failure Eddie Malleis  had been at the University of Colorado hospital for  days All he wanted to do was go home But first Colleen McIlvennan a clinic nurse specialist in the hospitals advanced heart failure unit needed to review his discharge instructions Did Mr Malleis understand which new medications he was taking and why  Did he know which ones he should continue taking and which he should stop Sitting on the edge of his hospital bed silverhaired and lean Mr Malleis answered yes to all of the nurses questions But he hinted that he might not remember everything she was telling him When I go to the pharmacy theyll have all this written out on the bottles right Ms McIlvennan assured him that they would and handed him a fivepage summary of what he needed to know when he went home Included was information about a followup appointment scheduled within the week and a number for that physician Was this the number to call if he had any questions after leaving the hospital It wasnt clear there were several phone numbers on the sheets but none of them were highlighted Of all conditions that land people in hospitals heart failure is the one that most commonly causes older adults to bounce back within  days Its one of three conditions that Medicare is concentrating on as it pushes   with higherthanaverage readmissions rates  Hospitals like the University of Colorado have responded by studying why heart failure patients return to the hospital and what can be done to improve their transition back home Hundreds of medical centers are testing strategies that revolve around several themes   Turn this around and you have some idea of what older adults and their caregivers should expect on discharge from a hospital But many    And almost none have involved patients in planning how to prevent readmissions raising the risk that patients needs are not being addressed One initiative that has incorporated patient input is the Care Transitions Program used by  providers across the country and directed by Dr Eric Coleman head of the division of health care policy at the University of Colorado Denver  What weve learned from patients is that no one seems to be in charge of their care he said We dont ask patients or their families to articulate their goals We dont work from a single medication list We cant seem to coordinate our efforts And we dont see and overcome barriers to selfcare  like low literacy and impaired cognition How should seniors and caregivers respond When you leave the hospital you become by default your own care coordinator Dr Coleman said The more you can do to assert that role and tell health professionals what you really need the better To start insist that a family member or caregiver be at your side when hospital staff give you instructions about what to do when returning home Hospitals discharge patients at their convenience with a few exceptions Dr Coleman said Make it very clear you dont want this to happen Do not leave the hospital until you have answers to these questions Why was I in the hospital What was done to me  What needs to happen going forward What should I be doing to maintain a stable condition said Dr Christopher Manasseh a researcher at   or ReEngineered Discharge at Boston University Medical Center  Ideally conversations about how to deal with heart failure  watching your weight cutting back on salt getting exercise changing your diet following medication regimens  should begin early in a hospital stay and be reinforced daily Dr Manasseh said  If nurses are not giving you this kind of information tell them you want it Do not be shy about letting medical providers know about your life outside the hospital and your expectations for the future Do you live alone or with someone Were you functioning well or becoming impaired Do you have a way to get to medical appointments get up the stairs shop for groceries Do you think you might need some extra help The focus needs to change from the hospitals priorities to your priorities what you need to get back to the life you were living said Beth Ann Swan dean of the school of nursing at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia  When Dr Swans husband Eric was discharged from a rehabilitation hospital in  after a brain stem stroke she took home  pages of information about seven medications he had been prescribed a page report on five medical experts he needed to see post haste and five pages of instructions about home safety   There was just too much information to absorb Dr Swan wrote in   No one reviewed it with us to be sure we understood it all  or at least the key points Its unbelievable what were sending people home to do often without assessing their capacity or the resources they have available said Robyn Golden cofounder of the National Council on Care Coordination and director of health and aging at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago Ms Golden helped developed a program known as   which calls for social workers to coordinate post hospital discharge care for older adults and caregivers They link seniors as needed to community organizations that can provide various kinds of nonmedical assistance   Hospital staff may ask you to set up an appointment with your primary care doctor within a week or do this for you  Even if you dont understand why you need to see another doctor at this time  and many patients dont   make sure you go Dr Coleman said    Outside the hospital this doctor is responsible for monitoring you and dealing with medical problems that might arise Its frequently hard to get in to see medical specialists on a timely basis  If this happens to you ask your contact at the hospital or your primary care doctor to make a call on your behalf to try to help you get in sooner And dont forget to use this catchphrase suggested by Ms Golden  I hear theres a big concern about people coming back to the hospital unnecessarily  How can you help me make sure that doesnt happen
