Researchers are disappointed in the results of a longawaited study of the leading candidate vaccine against   one of humankinds most elusive scourges But pointing to more than a dozen other TB vaccines in the pipeline they say theyre not discouraged The results show that an experimental vaccine known as   didnt provide much protection for South African infants against either infection with TB or development of the disease Earlier smaller studies in adults and in animals raised the hope that the vaccine might work But the infants had immune responses to MVAA only a tenth as strong as adults did Clearly this is a disappointment says   of Oxford University who developed MVAA and led the South African trial Its not what we hoped for or expected But what we have learned from this trial will help us in the whole field There hasnt been a study of TB vaccine in infants for  years when a large trial affirmed the partial efficacy of what is still the only TB vaccine called  Every year more than  million babies around the world receive BCG a live but weakened version of a bovine TB germ that was developed  years ago But while BCG can prevent tuberculosis that has spread beyond the lungs it doesnt reliably protect against pulmonary TB the most severe form MVAA is designed to boost the effect of BCG All the infants in the South African study received BCG half of them got the experimental vaccine while the others got a placebo actually a skin test antigen or immune stimulator from a fungus called candida In combination with BCG the study vaccine did what it was supposed to in infants stimulate immune cells called CDs to produce immune responses specific to TB But the response was only modest and clearly not enough to protect the babies against either TB infection or disease Among the nearly  children in the study  percent got infected with TB over the month course of the trial  an indicator of how alarmingly common the disease is in South Africa About  in  people there die of TB and a growing number are getting   with   and even   drugs Thirtynine of the infants in the placebo group developed TB versus  who got the experimental vaccine That means MVAA was  percent effective in preventing TB But thats not statistically significant so we cant determine if that effect was real or not McShane told reporters Monday during a teleconference from London Despite the disappointment with the experimental vaccine in infants the findings are not a terminal prognosis for MVAA or for any of the other tuberculosis vaccines in development   and   write in an editorial that accompanies the findings in   Like the study authors Dye and Fine point out that there are a halfdozen other ways in which MVAA might still prove useful For instance judging from preliminary studies the vaccine might protect against TB infection or disease in adults Researchers would like to try MVAA alone as well in combination with BCG in larger studies with adults And they think its worth trying it in people infected with HIV because as a liveattenuated vaccine BCG isnt thought to be safe to use in people with HIVdamaged immune systems Meanwhile at least two other experimental TB vaccines are in advanced trials according to Dr   of   a nonprofit developer of TB vaccines that sponsors MVAA and about half the experimental vaccines in the pipeline The results will take a few years Evans says So its not around the corner but they are in the queue and moving forward Of the newly published results Evans says This trial leaves us optimistic not pessimistic Ten years ago many doubted such a trial could be completed  And McShane adds  years ago the technology didnt exist to develop and test novel vaccines aimed at stimulating the socalled cellular immune response which attacks and kills cells already infected with a bacterium or virus Classical vaccines stimulate the other arm of the immune system which makes antibodies TB hides inside cells which means its difficult for the immune system to get at McShane says Moreover like HIV it can persist in a latent form for a lifetime Its a very clever pathogen she says And as the new findings make very clear researchers are only in the very early stages of figuring out just what it will take to prevent TB infection or disease One detail in this study underscores what TB researchers are up against The authors note that the experimental vaccine may only be effective against severe forms of TB not the mild cases that develop in newly infected infants However it would take a prohibitively large study to test the efficacy of a vaccine in preventing severe TB the authors note
