OK the conventional wisdom about the   President Obama sent to Congress yesterday is thats irrelevant Its two months late after all and the   their own spending blueprints for fiscal  But heres why it matters when it comes to health First of all the Congressional budget process isnt exactly done The House and Senate still havent met to merge their differing proposals and they are very different into a consensus plan So the presidents formal input could still mean something at least in theory Second Congress hasnt yet begun its annual   where a little over a third of federal spending is determined So its not too late for the presidents wish list for spending for next year for agencies like the    billion up  million from fiscal     billion down about  million  and    billion up  million to mean something Finally late though it may be the budget gives the administration the chance to make a statement about its legislative priorities and possibly to lay a few bargaining chips on the table Here are a few from the health portions  to   This is a twofer according to CDC Director Tom Frieden Not only do early childhood education programs improve the health of young children but young people are the most pricesensitive to the cost of tobacco As a result he said at the departments budget news conference increasing the price of tobacco is the single most effective way to discourage kids from smoking and we estimated that this would result in at least  fewer kids smoking than would have smoked than if the tax does not go into effect  the budget calls for an increase of  million to help teachers and other adults detect potential symptoms of mental illness in young people as well as train  mental health professionals who will focus on the mental health needs of students and young adults At the same time said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius new investments are being proposed for the CDC to research gun violence to develop effective strategies to prevent future tragedies CDC technically   with relation to most gunrelated research although President Obama   earlier this year  Most of these are holdovers from   and from the deficit reduction plan submitted in the   In all it proposes about  billion in Medicare savings over the next decade Sebelius said While most of the savings would come from reducing payments to health care providers about  billion would come from increasing payments by beneficiaries New beneficiaries would be asked to pay higher   premiums and for the first time all beneficiaries would be asked to make copayments on home health services And the higher premiums now charged to higherincome beneficiaries for doctor and drug coverage would be expanded so that eventually a quarter of all beneficiaries would pay them The Administration stopped short of some rumored changes such as   But beneficiary groups still arent thrilled Instead of making harmful cuts to Medicare or shifting additional costs onto beneficiaries we need to look for savings throughout the health care system including Medicare said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond   The budget dropped most of the changes the administration had previously proposed that would have trimmed spending for Medicaid Thats an   that it intends to keep its promise to pay the lions share of a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act But it does propose one change that had some people scratching their heads It suggests delaying a planned reduction in the payments hospitals get to help pay for uninsured patients The original theory behind the cuts included in the Affordable Care Act was that because Medicaid would be expanded starting in  states would no longer require such large   payments to offset charity care since they would be providing less of it But now the Medicaid expansion is optional and some   about the worst of both worlds their state wont expand Medicaid and they will also lose their disproportionate share payments The delay however is less then meets the eye administration officials insist What this allows states to do is to complete their legislative decision making about whether to expand Medicaid or not Sebelius said before they run into what they see as a cut that they cant stop right now and cant do anything with until the legislators make a decision about Medicaid funding in the future
