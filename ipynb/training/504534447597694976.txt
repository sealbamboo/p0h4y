Some people dream of climbing Mount Everest or riding a bicycle across the country   has been to create the perfect toothbrush and now he thinks hes done it The saga of this brush tells a lot about the passion and persistence to take an idea and turn it into a product Shots first   to Davidson in  At the time Davidson thought his toothbrush would be ready for the market the following June That turned out to be wishful thinking The new target date is Nov  of this year and it looks like he will make it I visited Davidson and his partner in this adventure dentist Mike Smith earlier this year at the headquarters of their company   The headquarters is just an office in the dental practice they both work at in Pearland Texas Seated around a desk in that office the pair told me the story of the brush It begins in  Smith says the idea for the brush was Davidsons His story is he was in his garage one night Smith tells me Hes a very handy man me not so much But he likes to do the handy work so he has this clay model brings it in one day to the office and hes like What do you think of this And Im like What do I think of that  At this point Davidson interrupts Smith with a laugh You recognized a good thing when you saw it says Davidson So whats special about the brush Well to remove the bacteria that cause gum disease most dentists say you should hold the brush so the bristles are at a degree angle to the gum line Easy enough but most people dont Davidsons brush has an unusual handle that automatically puts the bristles at the correct angle It is really in my view the perfect toothbrush Not because I built it  because it makes sense says Davidson Coming up with the idea for the brush turned out to be the easy part As far as implementing it and making it usable neither one of us had any idea and especially when it came to actually fabricating one says Davidson We learned and we wasted so much money he adds with a rueful laugh The first design of the brush had a bladder mechanism inside that was supposed to squirt mouthwash into the gums as you brushed It took  months to design this brush but it was too complicated to manufacture That was  down the drain The next design had the same shape but no bladder and a different manufacturing design that uses whats called a core injection system That brush took two years to design But the core injection system turned out to be a bust Another  wasted And now were stuck and were scratching our heads and its like oh crap this is another redesign This is another two years says Davidson That was only when I was really Maybe it wont happen  Smith told him to just stay positive Well get through this its just going to take time They did get through it and designed a new model with a different manufacturing scheme They teamed up with a Chinese company that agreed to make the brush But after spending around  on airline tickets to China that business relationship soured and all they had to show for it was a lot of frequent flier miles Still no toothbrush Finally they linked up with a manufacturing facility in Vietnam that had Japanese owners Everything seemed to be going smoothly and the factory sent a prototype But there was a problem The handle on the prototype felt wrong It felt too big They tried it out on their colleagues in the dental practice and everyone especially women with smaller hands agreed the handle felt too big What we didnt know is that when they make any kind of piece of plastic for anything theyll make it upwards of  percent larger than it should be to account for the plastic contraction that occurs when hot plastic cools says Davidson Problem is the way their brush is designed it didnt shrink So the pound steel injection mold the manufacturer made is useless junk So then we spend the next four months arguing about whose fault it is says Davidson Once they got that straightened out another problem This one came completely out of the blue A geopolitical dispute between China and Vietnam nearly scuttled the brush Thousands of rioters trashed factories in Ho Chi Minh City where the brush was supposed to be manufactured Why the riots It turns out the Vietnamese were upset with Chinas decision to plant an oil rig off Vietnams coast so some people attacked Chineseowned businesses Davidson says their factory was spared because it was Japaneseowned not Chineseowned As I listened to this amazing story I began to wonder what kept them going All this just for a toothbrush Or maybe they were hoping to make gobs of money So I asked them What if some executive at Colgate hears this story and thinks We should buy these guys out before their brilliant toothbrush design makes a giant dent in our business Would they take the money Smith says no I mean weve taken it this far he says Were going to continue to take it all the way Its not about money adds Davidson Its about winning And its about beating these guys at their own game And showing we can do something better Clearly this is something Davidson feels passionate about Were not just trying to sell a cool toothbrush he says Ultimately we want people to realize the value of having a clean mouth because there are so many other systemic conditions that are related to gum disease And the thing about brushing is that if you do it right it feels a certain way It feels like a golf swing or a perfect tennis shot down the side  it feels a certain way And thats what this brush is designed to do Its designed to show you what good brushing feels like Thats the idea and it might be nice to have that feeling but at the moment hes got no proof that good feeling will result in less gum disease Davidson is confident that proof will come In the meantime theyre forging ahead After I spoke with Davidson in early June he flew off to Vietnam to oversee the first manufacturing run At the end of the first day of the run Davidson was able to take a box of newly manufactured brushes back to his hotel It was a heck of a feeling he says To go through all that and finally see the vision that we had right there in a completed form was a great thing There is of course that final hurdle whether anybody will pay  for a toothbrush
