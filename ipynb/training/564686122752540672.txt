More than a tenth of UK care workers are being paid less than the national minimum wage of  an hour a study suggests The Resolution Foundation think tank says its research indicates that about  people are losing out on an average of  each a year It said some firms wrongly did not pay staff when they travelled between clients on training or when on call Ministers said they were taking action against employers who broke the law The national minimum wage is paid to adults aged  and over and there are lower rates for younger workers and apprentices The   say working time includes travelling in connection with work and training or travelling to training during normal working hours The Resolution Foundation a notforprofit research organisation said the problem it had uncovered was primarily down to the failure of employers to pay staff at a level that adequately covers all of their working time  The care industry sector which employs about  million people in the UK has long been associated with low pay while funding cuts and an ageing population is creating an additional strain on wages it added The Resolution Foundation said the total amount that care staff were missing out on was estimated to be about m a year but it could be higher This is because the study did not take account of illegal deductions to pay which it said was the most common reason for noncompliance with the minimum wage regulations It is calling on national and local government as well as social care providers to address its concerns I have been a care worker for five months I can make up to  visits a day sometimes seeing the same client several times a day I am on a zerohours contract but generally get seven shifts a week from am to pm or pm to pm  I work  hours but only get paid for  hours I am only paid for the length of time I am with the client  I dont get travel time Mileage is covered at p per mile but not if there is more than an hour between appointments I dont understand this as its not like we cannot teleport ourselves to the next client I get paid between  and  an hour If I were paid for the average  hours I am out for I would earn  every four weeks instead I am earning   My friend and I worked out that we are basically earning about  an hour I enjoy my job and I like face time with my clients It is not just this company its all companies They dont have the funding to be able to pay us properly Anonymous  from Wakefield Laura Gardiner a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation said Diminishing public funding and ever tighter commissioning practices are placing great pressure on care providers but there is simply no excuse for breaking the law As well as helping to attract and retain staff and boosting the incomes of lowpaid workers better pay would ultimately lead to improvements in care quality TUC general secretary Frances OGrady said it was criminal that care workers were not being paid their full entitlement Our social care system is in crisis because of huge cuts to local authority budgets with many councils outsourcing services to the cheapest bidder she said Without extra funding the care sector will continue to be a haven for zerohours contracts and Victorianstyle employment practices Adult rate  and over   per hour  to yearolds   per hour  to yearolds   per hour Apprentice rate   per hour Colin Angel of the UK Homecare Association which represents providers said they operate in a market where purchasers largely local councils face unprecedented spending constraints HMRC have a responsibility to investigate and where appropriate take action against employers which do not pay the national minimum wage he said However we repeat our calls for commissioners to take the actual costs of care services into account when letting contracts to the independent and voluntary sector and for government to ensure independent oversight of the practices of social care commissioners A spokesman for the government said It is not only unacceptable to pay less than the minimum wage it is against the law We are taking action to make it easier to name shame and fine offenders as well as helping social care workers to recover the hundreds of thousands of pounds in pay owed to them  We are also looking at what more we can do to make sure social care workers are paid fairly in the first place
