Not all carbohydrates are bad for you Does the study distinguish between wholefood carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates You are certainly right that the source of carbohydrates is important Most researchers and health authorities agree that highly processed carbohydrates  sugar and white bread being the most obvious examples  have a very different effect on blood sugar cholesterol and weight gain than complex carbohydrates like fresh fruit beans plants brown rice and other unrefined carbohydrates  However the latest study took this into account People in the lowcarb group were told to eat plenty of vegetables and even fresh fruit They went to nutritional counseling sessions in which they learned to distinguish between complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates They were encouraged to always choose complex carbs So although they ate more fat and lowered their overall carbohydrate intake from about  percent of their daily calories to roughly a third the carbs they were consuming were typically coming from unrefined sources  Does the finding in favor of higherfat diets mean we should increase our consumption of meat and animal fats The lowcarb diet used in the study was not an allmeat diet The subjects in the lowcarb group went to nutrition counseling sessions in which they were taught the difference between saturated fats and unsaturated fats They were told to focus on eating foods that are mostly higher in unsaturated fat  like fish nuts avocado and olive and canola oils  but they were also allowed to eat some foods with more saturated fat like cheese meat and butter  A typical dinner for the lowcarb group would be some portion of vegetables and protein Keep in mind that the protein did not have to be meat Some people ate tofu for example This approach to eating can be followed by a vegetarian   Can you provide some examples of foods that contain trans fats saturated fat and other fats so I can figure out what Im supposed to eat Trans fats are typically found in highly processed and packaged foods like cookies potato chips pastries and some fried foods If you pick up a package of food in the grocery store and its list of ingredients contains the words partially hydrogenated then it contains trans fats which are heavily processed manufactured oils Saturated fats and unsaturated fats are found throughout nature And often they are found together in varying combinations in different foods Fish olive oil nuts avocado and plant sources of fat contain a lot of unsaturated fats polyunsaturated and monounsaturated Meat and dairy naturally contain some unsaturated fat but a higher proportion of saturated fat as well  There is widespread agreement among experts that trans fats increase the risk of heart disease so they are gradually being removed from the food supply  Health authorities have historically told Americans to limit their intake of dietary fat and in particular saturated fat But clinical studies have shown that the traditional lowfat lowcalorie diet does not reduce the rate of heart attacks and strokes in people at high risk A large study in The New England Journal of Medicine last year showed however that a diet higher in fat  especially unsaturated fat from olive oil and nuts  could lower heart attacks and strokes in people who had Type  diabetes or were overweight  One approach to eating that is widely recommended is the Mediterranean diet which contains plenty of fresh produce olive oil nuts beans and seafood It also includes moderate amounts of poultry eggs cheese and yogurt and some meat and sweets on occasion In recent years health authorities have pivoted away from their advice to limit all fat and instead encouraged people to focus on restricting saturated fat But recent studies have raised questions about whether saturated fat is truly as harmful as the federal dietary guidelines suggest Many experts say that refined carbohydrates like sugar play a more important role in obesity and cardiovascular disease 
 Perhaps I missed it but I havent seen how the latest study defines lowcarb eating Is it  grams a day  grams a day In this study people in the lowcarb group lowered their carbohydrate intake to  grams a day down from roughly  grams The low fat group meanwhile consumed  grams of carbs a day  Another way to think about lowcarb eating is to look at the percentage of your daily calories that come from carbs and fat Before the study eaters in both study groups had been consuming diets that consisted of  percent to  percent carbohydrates and  percent to  percent fats In the study the lowcarb group began eating a diet that averaged  percent carbs and  percent fat  By comparison the low fat group ate  percent carbs and less than  percent fat  Isnt the simple answer to eat less processed food junk food fast food candy sugar soda cookies and cakes eat more fruits and vegetables and exercise more I have interviewed a wide array of top researchers and nutrition experts over the years I think they all would agree with you What are the longterm implications for diets that include high levels of intake of animal proteins and saturated fats While this study doesnt address this others do and the outcome may not be that desirable Just to be clear this was not a  percent animal protein diet People on the lowcarb diet could eat pork red meat and tuna salad if they wanted or they could eat tofu soybeans avocados and vegetables The goal of the study was to see what happens when people lower their intake of mostly refined carbohydrates and increase their intake of mostly unsaturated fat  There has been some nascent research suggesting that certain compounds in foods like red meat and eggs may have a deleterious effect on gut flora But that research is very preliminary and the compounds being studied are not saturated fats I spoke with Dr Ronald M Krauss who studies atherosclerosis and was the chairman of the American Heart Associations dietary guidelines committee He said that the evidence against saturated fat is lacking Historically theres been so much focus on saturated fat that people like to think its the bad fat that its artery clogging and theres really no direct data to support that he said Dr Krauss added that this does not necessarily mean that everyone should eat red meat with abandon For instance some research has found an association between   So there may be reasons to lower or avoid red meat consumption Dr Krauss said but saturated fat does not appear to be one of them  Are any long term followup studies planned It would be interesting to see if the study subjects regain weight at a faster rate afterward  Yes The lead author of the study Dr Lydia A Bazzano of the Tulane University School of Public Health told me that she and her colleagues planned to further analyze their data They expect to publish followup studies Were investigating changes in appetite that might have occurred and some newer appetite hormones she said Were also looking at some biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function
