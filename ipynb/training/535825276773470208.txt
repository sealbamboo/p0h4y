Most people who drink to get drunk are not alcoholics suggesting that more can be done to help heavy drinkers cut back   The finding from a government survey of  adults counters the conventional wisdom that every fallingdown drunk must be addicted to alcohol Instead the results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that nine out of  people who drink too much are not addicts and can change their behavior with a little  or perhaps a lot of  prompting Many people tend to equate excessive drinking with alcohol dependence said Dr Robert Brewer who leads the alcohol program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention We need to think about other strategies to address these people who are drinking too much but who are not addicted to alcohol Excessive drinking is viewed as a major public health problem that results in  deaths a year from causes that include alcohol poisoning and liver disease to car accidents and other accidental deaths Excessive drinking is defined as drinking too much at one time or over the course of a week For men its having five or more drinks in one sitting or  drinks or more during a week For women its four drinks on one occasion or eight drinks over the course of a week Underage drinkers and women who drink any amount while pregnant also are defined as excessive drinkers Surprisingly about  percent of the population meets the definition for excessive drinking but  percent of them do not meet the definition of alcoholism Thats good news because it means excessive drinking may be an easier problem to solve than previously believed Studies show that simply raising the price of an alcoholic beverage by  percent reduces alcohol consumption by  percent suggesting that higher taxes on alcohol could make a significant dent in excessive drinking Zoning laws that reduce the number of establishments that serve alcohol in a given area can also curb excessive drinking Importantly a simple intervention by a physician talking to patients about their alcohol use has also been shown to help people make better choices and curb excessive alcohol consumption Ad campaigns like a  New York City initiative called Two drinks ago also may help In the New York campaign posters showed a welldressed woman slumped and drunk and a young businessman bleeding and bruised The posters read Two drinks ago you could still get yourself home and Two drinks ago you would have walked away The tagline was Stop drinking while youre still thinking  Dr Brewer noted that excessive drinking is still a challenging problem but it is not as difficult to address as alcohol addiction can be I dont want to minimize the fact that excessive drinking can be a difficult behavior to change even in those people who are not alcohol dependent said Dr Brewer So many of the cues people get about drinking behavior in our society are confusing People think drinking to get drunk is part of having a good time
