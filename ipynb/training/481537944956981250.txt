New technologies could help resolve some of the controversy around breastcancer screening  potentially improving the accuracy of scans that detect the cancer At the heart of confusion over   is the question of whether mammography could be doing more harm than good because of the many   that send women for biopsies of lesions that often turn out to be harmless But researchers now say a new screening method which employs D mammography resulted in  percent fewer callbacks for additional imaging while at the same time spotting more tiny aggressive and potentially fatal tumors according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association And in potentially better news for women other research published Tuesday suggests that doctors might one day be able to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions  and maybe even between aggressive and slowly developing growths  without the need for a biopsy That research was published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research The JAMA study scrutinized data from  medical centers that had switched to D imaging or tomosynthesis  are fairly ordinary Xrays Tomosynthesis is similar to a CT scan The researchers compared results from the years when the centers were using mammography alone to those from more recent years when doctors were using mammograms along with tomosynthesis Along with a  percent reduction in recall rates with tomosynthesis the researchers also found a  percent increase in the detection of potentially lethal cancers The D view also allows researchers to spot tiny lesions they might have missed otherwise  lesions like one tomosynthesis found in Edna Podell The yearold from Plano Texas went into her breast exam expecting to get a clean bill of health She felt good and hadnt felt anything was amiss on self exams But in her case a regular mammogram found a tiny spot that turned out to be an invasive cancer It was tiny tiny tiny Podell said So tiny that my surgeon as well as the radiation oncologist couldnt get over the fact that it had been caught They didnt want to panic me but they were very clear that it needed to be taken care of right away Because it was spotted so early Podells treatment consisted of removal and then a week of targeted radiation therapy Had it been bigger or had I waited even three months I probably would have ended up with traditional radiation that takes longer and comes with more sideeffects Podell said The reason for the improvements is in the ability to see the breast in millimeter slices said the studys lead author Dr Sarah Friedewald comedical director of the Caldwell Breast Center and section chief of breast imaging at the Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge Illinois It allows us to peel away the layers and see underlying lesions that might be obscured by other tissue You can think of regular mammography as showing a closed book With D you are able to page through the book one page at a time without other information superimposed Bright spots on a mammogram that look like potential tumors could turn out to be overlapping tissues or a blood vessel folding over on itself Friedewald said On D you can just see that its turned over on itself she said While D imaging can lower the rates of callbacks and detect more invasive cancers it does little to reduce the rate of biopsies But that may change if researchers manage to refine a technique based on combining multiple screening technologies that seems to be able to distinguish between cancerous and benign tumors The new imaging technique called multiparametric FDG PETMRI showed a  percent accuracy in distinguishing malignant breast tumors from benign ones according to a report published in Clinical Cancer Research The European researchers estimated that it could cut the biopsy rate by  percent By adding other types of imaging such as PET doctors can see tumors on the cellular level said Dr Katja Pinker lead author of the new study and an associate professor of radiology at the Medical University of Vienna Cancerous lesions tend to pack cells in more densely than benign growths Pinker explained They also tend to use up glucose more quickly PET scans spot this action while the MRI gets a more accurate picture of the structure than an xray can With normal imaging you just see structure Pinker said This goes beyond that to the functional level where you can see how much sugar the tumor is consuming and how fast its proliferating In a benign growth cells are more loosely grouped together In a fastgrowing tumor its like the subway at rush hour with people squeezed into each car Pinker suspects that the technique will also be able to distinguish between slow growing and aggressive tumors The new studies are a big leap ahead said Dr Margarita Zuley an associate professor of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh and medical director of breast imaging at the Magee Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center The significance of the tomosynthesis study is that it fundamentally changes the discussion about mammography Zuley said The controversy started roaring over the last two years But now the riskbenefit ratio has shifted I think this is a real gamechanger in the discussion The second study is highlighting an area that specialists are really really interested in for the future Zuley said Its not here yet But its a window into where were going with this
