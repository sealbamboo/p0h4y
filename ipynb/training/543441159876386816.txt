In  he started having unexplained pain It was so severe that nothing could touch his joints  Once the symptoms started they were pretty debilitating he remembers After a series of doctors visits and tests he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis  Doctors were able to find a medication that worked for him That was life changing  By  he felt so great that while watching his home NHL team the Atlanta Thrashers he made a decision The team was horrible that year and in watching them struggle motivated him   He would get back on the ice  One night it just flipped a switch and it just went I wanna go do this again he says The next day Ozubko says he unearthed his old goalie gear from the s He dusted it off and headed to the rink  He decided he wanted to be a goalie There was a learning curve though The modern techniques goalies used were different from when he was a kid He had to learn  He must have been a quick study because his style of playing caught the attention of some coaches along the way They invited him to play in an elite group of hockey players in the Atlanta area That led to an invitation to training camp for the minor league team called the Gwinnett Gladiators Ozubko made the cut and was tapped as the East coast hokey league teams backup goalie Quickly he was blocking shots from players half his age Hes always ready to step in whenever one of the teams goalies is injured or when the teams goalie would called up to the majors  Today hes retired from minor league play But he still feels good enough to play  He fills in on goalie when they need one for team practice He mentors many of his much younger teammates and works as a player liaison That time playing with the Gladiators has left its mark Ozubko remembers taking it all in as he dressed for his first professional game in November  It was a profound experience Ozubko says His mission now is to remind the young guys how lucky they are to have landed a coveted spot on a team When I first started doing this I was  and I never would have believed that I would have had an opportunity like this he says To him his ability to play even for a short amount of time it is a true gift
