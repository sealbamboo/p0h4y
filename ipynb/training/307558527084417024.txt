Robert Lustig wants to convince the world that sugar is making us very sick And lately hes turned to an unconventional field  econometrics  to do it Lustig rounded up statisticians and epidemiologists to look at the relationship between food and diabetes risk The   published this week in the journal  found that the more sugar on the market in  countries the higher the countrys diabetes rate Im not suggesting sugar is the only cause of diabetes   a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California San Franciso tells The Salt But in this analysis it was the only thing that predicted it And it was worldwide and over a decade The researchers found that for every additional  calories of sugar the amount thats in a ounce can of soda available per person per day the prevalence of diabetes in the population rose  percent They compared that against an additional  calories from any type of food which caused only a  percent increase in the populations diabetes rate over the past decade The findings controlled for obesity physical activity and a number of economic and social variables  columnist Mark Bittman  the new study the closest thing to causation and a smoking gun that we will see for the relationship between sugar and diabetes But not everyone agrees this paper is the smoking gun for sugar  an expert on diabetes epidemiology at Harvard tells The Salt that while the studys findings track with other research linking sugar intake to the diabetes epidemic Lustigs study by itself is weak evidence of a causal link Why Because he says epidemiologists dont consider ecological studies like this one which take a statistical snapshot as reliable as prospective cohort studies which follow a group of people over time Hu notes that he was also surprised to see that other foods did not predict diabetes risk nearly as strongly as sugar in Lustigs study I dont know why this happened because we know other foods are associated with diabetes risk  like highly refined grain products white rice bread and other starchy foods Those foods are not very different from sugar But maybe sugar is a better indicator of certain dietary habits of a population Lustig himself is the first one to admit that proving that any one thing causes a disease especially a chronic disease is tricky business And Lustigs coauthor Sanjay Basu   on an epidemiology blog this week that we cant prove causality through any amount of statistics But Lustig insists that nailing down sugars role in the rise of obesity and diabetes is useful because it will give people a starting point The point is if diabetes is caused by many things you can handle each one one at a time says Lustig Where to start then Well Lustig says we could start by regulating sugar better with stricter guidelines for sugar consumption and taxes on it Sounds like hell soon be pushing for legislation  especially since the doctor is pursuing a law degree Hes certainly no lightweight when it comes to getting out the message His YouTube   Sugar The Bitter Truth has attracted millions of viewers since it went viral in
