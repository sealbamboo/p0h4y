A major European study has shown that blood test screening for prostate cancer saves lives but doubts remain about whether the benefit is large enough to offset the harms caused by unnecessary biopsies and treatments that can render men incontinent and impotent The study   found that midlife screening with the prostatespecific antigen or PSA screening test lowers a mans risk of dying of the disease by  percent The relative benefit sounds sizable but it is not particularly meaningful to the average middleage man whose risk of dying of prostate cancer without screening is about  percent Based on the benefit shown in the study routine PSA testing would lower his lifetime cancer risk to about  percent Despite the fact that some men one out of every  men in the screening group  were helped by PSA testing in the European study the study authors say the finding does not support the use of widespread screening Instead cancer experts say the focus should be on screening men at high risk and working to identify nonaggressive cancers so men will not be unnecessarily treated for the disease We know we are finding a substantial number of cancers in the range of  to  percent that would never do any harm and would not lead to death said the studys lead author the urologist Dr Fritz H Schrder from Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands For every  cancers detected by PSA screening only one mans life would be saved  This overdiagnosis is unacceptable because it also leads to treatment Dr Schrder said Thats why there is consensus worldwide with very few exceptions that the time has not come to recommend populationbased screening The findings based on  years of data from a continuing randomized study of  European men are certain to create confusion about the relative benefits and risks of the PSA test which uses a blood sample to identify men at risk for prostate cancer The test often puts men on a path of repeated biopsies and testing and for some treatment of a cancer that would have never caused a problem if left alone In  the United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that healthy men should not be screened for prostate cancer a finding that drastically changed the standard of care for middleage American men who had grown accustomed to annual screenings The task force recommendation against PSA testing was based largely on  years of data from two major studies the United Statesbased Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian PLCO cancer screening trial of  men and earlier results from the current study the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Additional data collected from the European trial since then has shown a slightly larger benefit over time as a result of screening along with a still sizable risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment Its always been a complicated story said Dr Ian Thompsonthe  director of the cancer therapy and research center at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio who wrote an accompanying editorial to The Lancet study Dr Thompson said that better diagnostic techniques such as biopsies guided by magnetic resonance imaging tests along with personalized risk assessment and more informed decision making by men and their doctors were a better way to use the PSA test than to screen every man of a certain age  The majority of men who get PSA screening will not benefit from it Dr Thompson said If you do PSA testing in a more sophisticated contemporary way there may be the possibility of achieving the mortality reduction while reducing the morbidity impact Neither the American study nor the European study are viewed as the final word on PSA testing A flaw in the American study is that many men in the nonscreening group had already received a PSA test before the study began or later sought screening on their own thus blunting any potential benefit from showing up in the data analysis  The European study which recruited men from  to  in eight countries also has flaws One concern is that the increase in survival among men in the screening group may stem from differences in the quality of treatment compared with men in the control group In addition there are puzzling differences when comparing the results from individual countries For instance men in Sweden showed a benefit while men in Finland where the incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer is similar did not I think this additional followup doesnt change much said Dr Gerald L Andriole the lead author of the United Statesbased study and chief of urology at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis I think there is a benefit to PSA testing but unfortunately weve been overdoing it screening the wrong men overtreating way too many men and the benefit of screening is being outweighed by the side effects of overtreatment Doctors say that for men who are confused about whether to get a PSA test there is hope New MRI tests to guide targeted prostate biopsies may help find the most aggressive cancers that require treatment thus identifying men who do not need to be treated  The trick is to take the complex nature of the information and provide it to men Dr Thompson said A man who is fully informed may say I understand and decide against the test while another man who watched his father die of prostate cancer may want it
