A tour of the Ben  Jerrys factory in Waterbury Vt includes a stop at the Flavor Graveyard where ice cream combinations that didnt make the cut are put to rest under the shade of big trees One recently deceased flavor has yet to be memorialized there Coffee Heath Bar Crunch one of the companys bestsellers Ben  Jerrys CEO  says the company had to remove the key ingredient Heath bars made by Hershey and rework the flavor Its replacement is called Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch Some fans have blasted the company in online forums claiming it doesnt taste as good The reason for the change Hershey makes Heath bars with genetically engineered ingredients and Ben  Jerrys has made a pledge to remove all GMO ingredients from its ice cream The company has taken a vocal stand in recent years in support of states looking at legislation that would require manufacturers to disclose food that is made with genetic engineering And Vermont   that will require labeling starting in  Ben  Jerrys cofounder Jerry Greenfield recently launched a campaign to help fill the coffers of Vermonts crowdsourced defense fund set up to combat lawsuits over its labeling law The news that Ben  Jerrys is taking a stand on a controversial issue is no surprise its part of the companys calling card But some other mainstream companies are carefully  and much more quietly  calibrating their nonGMO strategies General Mills original plain Cheerios are now GMOfree but the only announcement was in a company   in January And you wont see any label on the box highlighting the change Grape Nuts another cereal aisle staple made by Post is also nonGMO And Target has about  of its own brand items certified GMOfree  runs the NonGMO Project which acts as an independent thirdparty verifier of GMOfree products including Targets She says her organization knows about a lot of exciting cool things that are happening that for whatever strategic reasons get kept pretty quiet The NonGMO Project has certified more than  products since it launched in  and Westgate says this is one of the fastest growing sectors of the natural food industry representing  billion in annual sales But just because theyre testing the water doesnt mean most mainstream companies are ready to start publicizing their changes  an agricultural economist at Kansas State University says big food producers are trying to gauge what direction consumers are headed in Ultimately he says these big companies arent just friends with Monsanto or something They want to make a profit and they want to be able to do whats going to make them money So theyd better have a product line in the works if consumer sentiment starts to shift more heavily toward GMOfree food But even as they create GMOfree products many of these corporations are fighting state initiatives that would require them to give consumers more information about their ingredients They often fight those battles through the powerful Grocery Manufacturers Association or GMA a trade group with hundreds of members It has just filed suit against Vermont over the states GMO labeling law Even Ben  Jerrys so vocal in its antiGMO stance has a conflict of sorts It may have eliminated GMOs but its still owned by Unilever which put a lot of money toward fighting labeling legislation in California and belongs to the GMA That might make things sticky for Ben  Jerrys CEO Solheim But he equivocates You know he shrugs in big companies a lot of things happen behind closed doors I think well leave that conversation behind closed doors But Solheim says a unique agreement between the ice cream maker and Unilever allows Ben  Jerrys to continue its social mission independent of its parents choices One reason these large companies might be quietly working to make GMOfree food now is because  More than  percent of all the soybeans and corn grown in the US are genetically engineered Most of those GMO crops go to producers of eggs milk and meat who feed their animals with them but GMO soy oil and cornstarch are used in a lot of food manufacturing too To ensure nonGMO ingredients the supply chain has to remain separate and pristine Crops need to be grown far enough away from genetically engineered seeds to prevent crosscontamination Harvesting equipment needs to be either used only for nonGMO crops or cleaned extensively before switching The same is true for processing and manufacturing facilities and transport receptacles like shipping containers Thats why Westgate says a natural foods brand like Kashi owned by Kelloggs is transitioning more slowly than many fans would like She points out that Kashi told consumers it would take a couple of years to switch over all of its ingredients Its a matter of changing contracts with growers finding farmland where nonGMOs can be grown successfully and reworking recipes so the flavors that customers have grown used to arent drastically changed like what has happened with Ben  Jerrys new toffee Right now nonGMO food fetches a premium Purdue University agricultural economist   says that premium is likely to come down if this part of the agricultural sector gains more traction and an efficiency of scale can kick in Ultimately the consumer is king And the question of whether or not consumers will want nonGMO products is still up in the air At the Ben  Jerrys factory in Vermont most tourists seem more interested in getting their free samples than hearing about the brands stand on genetic engineering Still manufacturers are clearly wondering what might happen if more states enact labeling laws and if consumer sentiment begins to shift So theyre hedging their bets fighting statebystate labeling initiatives but quietly introducing their own GMOfree products in the meantime
