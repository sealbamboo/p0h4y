Sixteen cases of a new flu around Shanghai have touched off a major effort to determine what kind of threat this new bug might be The victims range in age from  to  years old Six have died It is a tragedy for them and their families but is it a global crisis To understand why so few cases are generating so much concern the first thing to know is that no flu virus like this one  called HN  has ever been known to infect humans before That immediately grabs the attention of flu pros Since it doesnt affect people people havent developed immunity to it says Thomas Frieden director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A lack of immunity among humans is one key ingredient of a pandemic The other is a germs contagiousness Does it spread readily from one person to another Everything were seeing at this point suggests that is not happening Frieden said during a Friday afternoon teleconference with reporters Since the new flu emerged last weekend Chinese authorities have tracked down  close contacts of the  flu cases Theyre chasing at least  more Frieden notes that none of the close contacts have developed flu symptoms In influenza you would expect at least  to  percent of family members to develop illness he says So the fact that there are that many contacts and no illness has been identified is encouraging Actually his statement needs an asterisk Two adult sons of the first identified case an yearold retiree known as Li had severe respiratory illness and one died Both tested negative on tests for HN but thats not conclusive There are a number of reasons why a sample might falsely test negative Unfortunately the surviving son has reportedly refused a retest Chinese authorities are said to view the two sons as probable cases Conceivably other negative tests could be wrong too But the larger point is that epidemiologists really begin to worry when a virus begins to spark a chain of persontoperson transmissions So its reassuring that Chinese surveillance has so far discovered no spike of influenzalike illness in Shanghai hospitals and clinics or in the four surrounding provinces where HN cases have been recorded Still the public health community would be a lot more comfortable if it knew where this unique strain of flu is coming from and how its been getting into humans The most important thing is to try to understand how this virus gets around World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl tells Shots We need to know the behavior of this virus in order to know how to control it Research so far tells researchers this much Its a bird virus not a mlange of bird and pig viruses the way the pandemic HN flu virus of  was But this HN doesnt kill birds or even make them very sick So its hard to track through infected flocks The new HN has been evolving under the radar for quite some time picking up mutations that allow it to infect mammalian cells including ours Nancy Cox the CDCs top flu virologist says viruses obtained from the first Chinese cases are only  percent similar to previously known HN viruses That may sound pretty close but in the flu world it denotes a good deal of evolutionary change over time Moreover Cox tells Shots there are some molecular markers or genetic sequence changes  allowing the virus to bind to molecules on the surface of human respiratory cells  that would indicate these viruses might be able to infect humans more easily than for example the HN bird flu viruses Thats ominous The HN virus is among the deadliest flu viruses known although thankfully it has failed so far to acquire the ability to spread easily from human to human But Cox later emailed to say that the genetic markers she was referring to are not the only genetic features that determine transmission from human to human Those other features are less well understood she writes In the absence of persontoperson spread the best bet to explain the sudden widely scattered cases of HN in southeastern China is that people are catching it from poultry Frieden notes it has been found so far in pigeons a market item in China and chickens So the Chinese are beginning to destroy thousands of birds in an effort to stamp out the presumed source of infection Theyre also testing many other animal species in an attempt to find other vectors or at least potential genetic mixing vessels where a more dangerous HN might be incubating Meanwhile Cox says shes trying not to waste energy merely worrying about the problem All of our energy is going into being prepared for whatever might come she says The virus might become a public health threat Or it might fizzle out Either is possible at this point she says
