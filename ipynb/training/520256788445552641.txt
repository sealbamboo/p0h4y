Sara Ivanhoe has always been a bit ahead of her time The yearold yoga instructor has been practicing yoga since she was in high school At first she had no choice In the small Marin County town of Mill Valley where she grew up yoga was part of her schools curriculum Like a typical teenager she rebelled against most things that were associated with school but yoga was different More than  years and  million yogavideossold later Ivanhoe is still at it When she isnt teaching at YogaWorks in Santa Monica shes at Loyola Marymount University working toward a masters degree in yoga philosophy Here Ivanhoe shares some of her yoga wisdom Well I was distracted by makeup and boys  actually sometimes I still am And like anything else at school I thought yoga was a drag but I continued to practice because I had to Years later when life started to catch up with me as it does for many people postcollege I needed to find some peace and balance I realized that yoga had been with me all along First the bad I am very concerned about the trend of what I see as aggressive and acrobatic styles of yoga I see people who are new to yoga trying to do things with their bodies that they simply should not Some of them are dangerous Too many teachers are telling students to conquer their fears and to try things like handstands in the middle of a room without wall support For many people this is totally unreasonable The result is that people are falling hurting themselves spraining joints and causing injuries that will last a lifetime Not all fears should be conquered Some fears are intelligent and they keep us from harm Now the good I am so gratified by the popularization of yoga Even if people start the practice for purely physical purposes there is something about yoga that will sink in and lead to further study I have faith that underneath we all have the same intention to be loved and accepted for who we truly are I mostly practice in my living room I know thats not very glamorous but I find that I feel most comfortable to fail to be imperfect when I am alone Many people love practicing outside and while I am a huge fan of nature I find that often nature stimulates my senses and can cause my attention to waver If I had to choose a place outside of my home I would choose Bhakti Fest It is a yoga and kirtan festival out in Joshua Tree that is focused on the practice of Bhakti At Bhakti Fest I get the biggest high out of anywhere Ive ever been and there is no alcohol served Thats easy   breath Even people who dont do yoga naturally take deep breaths as a way to relax Studies have shown that a huge percentage of the perceived relaxation of smoking is that the smoker is taking deep breaths   comes from the Sanskrit root   which means victory It is a breath that makes you feel victorious Its not difficult to do Just close your mouth and breath both in and out through the nose creating a soft hollow sound This is the sound your body makes when it is sleeping so it already knows how to do it httpvimeocom Just a few moments of this breath even just doing three long smooth   breaths will make you feel better instantly and put a smile on your face Easy Erich Schiffmann Actually I think hes the best teacher in the world What makes Erich different from everyone else is the way he teaches not what he teaches What I mean by that is this that most teachers no matter their style of yoga no matter the subject of the class use a oneway directive method of teaching The teacher says and the student does Erichs way is to ask a question and then the students through investigation of their own learn what they dont already know Let me give an example Say you are in warrior  I might say something like Lift your chest Drop your shoulders Im telling you what to do and you are following me as best you can Erich would say something like Be aware of the pose and investigate What parts of the body can you relax without collapsing At this point the student tries to answer the question and in doing so heshe will relax different parts of the body Can the chest relax No the chest needs to stay lifted Can the legs relax No they need to stay active Can the shoulders relax Yes I dont need to waste tension there And so on Asking brings us into the present moment because we dont know the answer
