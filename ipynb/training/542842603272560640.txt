Two large studies of patients with serious brain injuries found that giving people the hormone progesterone soon after injury didn’t minimize the effects of brain trauma.. The results were from a study of 882 patients, called Protect III, headed by doctors at Emory University in Atlanta, and from another study of 1,195 patients, called Synapse, headed by doctors at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. Both reports were published in Wednesday’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
