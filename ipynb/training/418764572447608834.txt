WASHINGTONâ€”The Obama administration was given until Friday to respond to a Supreme Court order that temporarily halts enforcement of the federal health-care law's contraception requirements for religious-affiliated nonprofits.. The order was issued late Tuesday by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a case filed by nonprofit Roman Catholic homes for the aged. It brings the high court into another dispute involving the health law's requirement that employers include free contraception in health plans offered to employees.
