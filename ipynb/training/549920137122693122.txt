The searchanddestroy mission against the HIV virus just got much more complicated New research suggests that HIVs genetic program is far more abundant in certain dormant Tcells of infected patients and is potentially more capable of unleashing its deadly instructions than previously thought The reservoir of human immune cells hosting that code or provirus could be  times greater than previously thought according to the study published Thursday in the journal Cell And a bigger proportion of those proviruses appears to be fully functional awaiting the throw of a switch Its a little bit scary acknowledged microbiologist Janet D Siliciano of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine one of the lead authors of the paper Weve known about the latent reservoir for many years now What we didnt realize until this study is it might be larger than previously estimated The discovery by a team that also included the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard University and the medical schools of Yale and Louisiana State universities recalibrates the magnitude of the quest to conquer and not just control HIV Dr Warner C Greene an AIDS researcher and director of virology and immunology research at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco who was not involved in the study called the results a rather sobering new perspective for HIV cure research Multidrug therapies have been able to thwart the HIV virus in its quest to enter Tcells and patients following the regime can live a long time essentially virusfree There also have been promising advances including a Mississippi infant who recently was found to be after treatment with antiretroviral drugs For adults on the multidrug therapy however virus free has long been something of a misnomer Researchers have known that the virus genome manages to copy and insert itself into the genome of the host cells nucleus As long as these cells known as CD memory T Cells are inactive these viral genes remain transcriptionally silent or turned off In the short run that is good news for the human host But in the long run its a big bonus for the virus Its the perfect mechanism for virus persistence because it allows for the virus genetic information to persist unaffected by the host immune response and unaffected by the antiretroviral drugs Siliciano said The immune system doesnt see that cell and the drugs dont affect it because its not making virus Researchers had assumed that genetic silence was a sign of defect But the study revealed that about  of these provirus sequences were intact and could be used to synthesize the virus in the lab where it replicated just like the native stock That result essentially multiplies the target of researchers who have turned to a shock and kill strategy to eradicate the last vestiges of the virus The strategy is something like lighting a fire to kill a wildfire Activating the Tcells lights the match that kindles the fire of virus production But the antiretroviral drugs fight those flames keeping the virus from invading a new host The old host meanwhile essentially burns out Gone with it is the provirus genome The research team has been very successful in waking up the T cells but found that not all of them produced viruses Repeated attempts kicked more of the laggard genes into gear but the hitandmiss nature of the process baffled researchers Researchers still must figure out the fickle behavior of the proviruses and try to find ways to activate them without doing harm to patients for whom an overactive Tcell system can be deadly And they are faced with far more targets than expected I dont think its discouraging Saliciano said Our approach has always been to try to understand the latent reservoir Everything that were doing just gives us more information about the reservoir and about the mechanisms of latency I think the more we learn about what works and doesnt work helps us go forward
