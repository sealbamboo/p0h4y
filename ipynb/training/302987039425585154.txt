 Recreational use of the illegal drug known as ecstasy is associated with longterm changes in   a small new study reveals Based on research with women it appears that the socalled rave drug can induce a drop in serotonin levels that can last up to two years Serotonin the research team noted is critical to the regulation of mood appetite sleep learning and memory Weve always known that ecstasy produced transient effects but with the suggestion that there would be recovery over time explained study coauthor Dr Ronald Cowan an associate professor of psychiatry in the department of psychiatry with Vanderbilt University Medical Centers School of Medicine in Nashville Tenn But here we find that these effects may be sustained over time with no evidence of reversal he added Now this is an observational study so we cant do really any more than suggest causation Cowan noted But I would say that this is nevertheless the strongest evidence we have that there is chronic change in serotonin levels for those who use the drug Cowan and his colleagues report their findings in the Dec  online issue of the   The authors noted that nearly  million Americans aged  and older have reportedly used ecstasy at some point in their life As described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse ecstasy otherwise known by its chemical name MDMA is a psychoactive stimulant that is similar in structure to   and mescaline The drug increases serotonin levels in the brain and users feel a sense of euphoria and emotional warmth On the downside the institute notes that the drug prompts a potentially problematic increase in both heart rate and blood pressure and can lead to sleep disturbance and lingering feelings of confusion depression and anxiety On the other end of the spectrum some researchers have pointed to the therapeutic potential for the controlled clinical use of MDMA to help patients struggling with   PTSD andor dysfunctional social skills Cowans team focused on  women including  who were described as MDMA users The study was confined to women to avoid the complication of genderspecific serotonin level differences between men and women The average age of the women was  Cowan noted that those who were MDMA users had taken ecstasy for a period of between three to four years with the number of pills taken ranging from just five to roughly  overall At the start of the study all had abstained from ecstasy use for a minimum of  days with the average length of abstinence hovering at the twoyear mark The team used positron emission tomography PET scans to assess levels of serotonin receptors in the participants brains noting that receptor levels are known to go up as serotonin levels go down Those women who had a history of taking ecstasy had higher receptor levels than women who hadnt suggesting a drop in serotonin levels among MDMA users Whats more the team observed a dosedependent impact The more ecstasy a woman had taken in her lifetime the higher her receptor levels We dont actually know what the implications are acknowledged Cowan There is some evidence in prior research that a drop in serotonin leads to   depression anxiety and memory loss But in our work we didnt find evidence of mental health issues No increased anxiety impulsivity or depression And the IQs of the women who took the drug were identical with those who had never taken it he stated We also have no proof that a drop in serotonin levels would be forever Cowan noted Animal studies have indicated that there could be as much as a sevenyear duration in such dips But we dont know So this work raises serious concerns and questions but more research is needed Michael Mithoefer a clinical researcher in the field of MDMAassisted psychotherapy for PTSD stressed the importance of not jumping to conclusions You have to be careful with research like this Mithoefer cautioned There have been some other similar studies suggesting the possibility of some longterm changes with ecstasy use But the problem with retrospective studies based on selfreport is that there are other factors at play that might not be accounted for Did these people take other drugs at the same time Was it really MDMA that they took Exactly how much did they take What really was the dose taken That kind of thing can become very unclear when youre asking people to remember past behavior he explained Its also the case that in clinical research conducted with a few different doses of pure MDMA we have no found evidence of these kinds of problems noted Mithoefer I do however think its important that people not think that MDMA is without risk he added Especially with recreational use in an uncontrolled setting Whether that will lead to mental health issues or not is unclear But it is certainly something that bears further study
