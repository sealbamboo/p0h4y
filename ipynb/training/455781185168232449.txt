Somewhere between bliss and exhaustion Thats how the first few months of parenting often feel as sleepless nights blur into semicomatose days Most of us chalk up a babys nighttime crying to one simple fact Hes hungry But could that chubby bundle of joy have a devious plan Harvard Universitys   thinks so Last month the evolutionary biologist offered up a surprising hypothesis to help explain those  am feedings and crying jags The baby is delaying the conception of a sibling by keeping Mom exhausted and not ovulating Haig   in the current issue of the journal  Now the baby isnt consciously trying to halt Moms fertility Haig explains But if that happens it ups the likelihood that the babys genes will be passed along to the next generation In other words the drive to wake Mom or Dad up is an evolutionary one Babies that scream and suckle in the wee hours are more likely to survive and have children themselves Its clear that babies can get enough milk even if they sleep through the night Haig tells Shots The waking becomes a different issue  Im just suggesting that offspring have evolved to use waking up mothers and suckling more intensely to delay the birth of another sibling Sounds a bit crazy right But theres logic to the idea When times are tough  say during food shortages or when infectious diseases are common  babies and toddlers have a better chance of surviving when their parents wait a while before having another child Nursing a child especially at night seems to hinder many women from resuming ovulation soon after a pregnancy So if a baby can force Mom to feed him at night she may stay infertile longer And then the baby will have Mom and Dad all to himself And a better chance of survival Its probably not that simple though says anthropologist   of the University of Rhode Island Its an interesting perspective she says but its not the only one Haigs idea doesnt take into account all the benefits of nightly feedings Dunsworth says The baby gets not only nourishment but also love and warmth And the mom benefits as well There are so many good juices running through infant and mom she adds Its rewarding beyond the calories and hunger satiation for everyone involved  When you look at it from that perspective waking up to feed looks more like cooperation than conflict Plus notes Harvard evolutionary biologist   babies evolved to cry at night thousands and thousands of years ago when peoples sleeping habits werent like they are today Back then people werent working  to  in offices and trying to get eight hours of sleep Instead we were likely hunters and gatherers whose sleep schedules were flexible and likely fragmented The expectation that mothers and infants should have uninterrupted consolidated sleep is in many ways a historical artifact Hinde   in the same journal in a response to Haigs idea Like all evolutionary arguments the theory that babies are intentionally tiring out Mom is nearly impossible to test Haig admits We cant go back and study our huntergatherer ancestors But Haig hopes the idea might help relieve anxiety some parents feel when it comes to shaping the sleeping and nursing habits of their babies  including perhaps training babies to sleep through the night I want parents to know that children are quite robust and can handle a variety of environments Haig says One shouldnt be too anxious with minor variations in parental care
