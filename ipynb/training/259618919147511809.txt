As the caseload of fungal meningitis linked to a tainted steroid drug climbs experts are learning more about this humanmade epidemic The signs indicate that cases could still be emerging until Thanksgiving or beyond The   is  cases of meningitis and three patients with fungal joint infections spread across  states from New Hampshire to Texas and Idaho to Florida Twentyone people have died The illness is caused by a fungus called   a black mold that usually attacks plants Its so rare as a cause of human illness that nobody knows its incubation period So its hard to predict when the outbreak will be over even though presumably no patients received the contaminated steroid since the Massachusetts pharmacy that made it recalled three lots on Sept  The incubation period is something thats been a big question Dr   of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a Thursday evening session of the IDWeek meeting in San Diego The majority of cases have incubation periods around one to four weeks but weve clearly seen documented periods beyond that he said Chiller told Shots that none has been beyond two months so far Thats based on  cases for which the CDC has firm dates for steroid injection and symptom onset The incubation period is hard to calculate though because many patients had multiple injections of potentially contaminated   made by the  The   infections following steroid injections into ankles knees hips shoulders or elbows may take longer to develop than fungal meningitis Even more sobering the meningitis incubation period was as long as five months in an eerily similar outbreak of moldcontaminated methylprednisolone in North Carolina back in  Dr John Perfect of Duke University   in an article published online by the   on Thursday We learned or thought we learned several important lessons from the outbreak Perfect writes One of them is that mixing preservativefree steroid drugs such as the one involved in both outbreaks requires meticulous sterility to ensure lack of fungal contamination he says Anything less and fungi grow aggressively in a highly concentrated steroid solution But there are encouraging signs For both the  episode and the current one so far the attack rate is apparently low That is few of those injected with the contaminated steroid get sick  for unknown reasons Thats an inference from the fact that public health authorities estimate  people got the tainted injections since May  While no one can say how many people ultimately will get sick at least its not in the thousands so far Second the CDCs Chiller says more recent cases are less sick Early in the outbreak we saw more advanced disease he says Now as weve reached out to all these patients were identifying people early and symptoms are very mild CDC officials say that  percent of the  people thought to have received the contaminated steroid have been reached and advised to watch for signs of infection Infectious disease experts are warning that patients whove had injections of medicine from New England Compounding should get a spinal tap as soon as they develop even a mild headache If their spinal fluid shows an increased level of white blood cells indicating infection patients should be started on an antifungal drug called   right away a trio of infectious disease specialists say in   published online Friday by the  But they say nobody knows how long patients will need to be treated at least three months is necessary and maybe longer Thats tough because voriconazole interacts with a slew of other drugs that many of the predominantly older patients who got the steroid injections are taking It can also cause hallucinations in doses necessary to kill the fungus We want high levels but not so high where you have yearold patients hallucinating which is whats happening Chiller says Another new article in the     of the very first recognized case of fungal meningitis in this outbreak  a man in his s treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville It makes for grim reading Three weeks after he had a spinal injection of methylprednisolone made by the Massachusetts pharmacy he had worsening headaches and neck pain As doctors struggled to figure out what was wrong with him his meningitis symptoms worsened and he developed signs of stroke On the nd day of his second hospitalization his brain was so riddled with hemorrhages and dead tissue that there was no hope of recovery and his family decided to discontinue life support Oddly that man is the only case so far who was infected by a different fungus called   This week federal officials found multiple unused vials of the New England Compounding Centers methylpredisolone containing   but none so far with   Its just one of many mysteries that still surround this outbreak Meanwhile the owners of the Massachusetts pharmacy agreed Friday to a request by state officials to extend their shutdown of a sister company called   until investigators are satisfied that no tainted drugs were being produced at that plant
