A report that four young men who are paralyzed below the waist were able to move toes ankles or knees when their lower spine was electrically stimulated was hailed as a breakthrough But its hard not to be skeptical about anything labeled a medical breakthrough these days and thats especially true when it comes to spinal cord regeneration which has seen more than its share of hype For the quarter of a million people with spinal cord injuries dashed hopes can be devastating A treatment or cure for spinal cord injury remains elusive but the   by researchers at the University of Louisville appears to add important information Even a very weak signal from the brain can trigger movement To figure out what this means we talked it over with John Donoghue director of the Brown Institute for Brain Science and leader of the   project which in  made it possible for two people immobilized by strokes to   with their thoughts He wasnt involved in the Louisville research The conversation has been edited for length and clarity It isnt like there was no connection there it literally got severed and then you got something There has to be a connection to the brain The important thing I think is that its not magic Its sort of a hidden or masked connection This suggests that when they put in the electrical stimulation they revealed that theres a hidden connection thats hard to detect And if its there its really really weak Youre doing something that reveals that the pathway is there This is wonderful news I think But these people are not playing basketball or anything Is this functional movement Well in a sense but to me its pushing us in a direction to say that for people with damaged spinal cords theres a way to get a small input to have a meaningful effect In engineering there are command signals and control signals   at MIT has talked about this for years Bizzi said you dont have to have control signals coming down from the brain you just have to have command signals Spinal cord circuitry is remarkably complicated Its a machine that does a lot My favorite analogy that I teach medical students youre walking down the street and you stumble on a crack in the sidewalk You catch yourself before you fall Almost all of that action in your leg and foot is preprogrammed in the spinal cord Its a beautifully coordinated machine There are about a million fibers coming down from your brain Thats a lot What Bizzi and others are saying is maybe you dont need that many fibers Maybe a very weak command signal is enough to make something happen I think these guys have done that The electrical simulation used here is a very crude stimulation Heres the scenario Because of the injury theres a bunch of inhibitory neurons that are making it impossible for signals to get through You shut down the inhibitory neurons with the stimulation but theyre grossly shut down Now imagine you could shut them down in some coordinated pattern What if they could give you coordinated leg action And if you could get trunk and hip support then the person could stand up and take a step Thats going to be really hard   in Canada has been working on that for a long time So are   at the University of Washington   at Drexel and   in Switzerland Hes got locomoting rats Ive seen them Its pretty impressive Ive talked to a number of young people who have paraplegic lower spinal cord injury They lose bladder and bowel control and thats not just a question of dignity  it can be lifethreatening It turns out thats a really complicated problem  at the same time you want to squeeze one muscle and relax another one But if you do something simple like stimulate the nerve both muscles contract Thats not what you want to have happen Even if one might consider the Louisville research not gigantic progress this opens up a whole lot of thoughts of how we might go forward especially for disabled people
