At a party I recently attended a woman in her s proudly announced that her periodic facial treatments have made me look  years younger A man of similar vintage said he was considering facial tucks to raise his sagging jowls Some days it seems everyone I meet is afraid of getting old  or at least of looking as old as they are Occasionally I see women who have had so many face lifts that they can barely move their lips when they talk let alone smile Business is booming in the antiaging market Plastic surgeons who specialize in lifts tucks and fillers barely noticed the recent recession Cosmetics with antiaging properties fly off the shelf and new concoctions appear almost weekly I admit to supporting the multibilliondollar skin care industry with my long use of night creams as well as a slew of daytime facial and body lotions that purport to smooth out aging skin while protecting it with sunscreen I also color my hair which in its natural state is now about  percent gray But I draw the line at injectable fillers and muscle relaxants face lifts and tummy tucks Ill do everything I can to stay out of an operating room My antiaging measures if and when they are needed will be limited to   a   and glasses for driving I wear clothes that suit my personality and activities not necessarily my age Shorts and tank tops anchor my summer wardrobe And I wear colors near my face that are right for my skin tone avoiding those like yellow that are unflattering Still cosmetic fixes go only so far to counter the effects of time True youthfulness  or I should say appearing younger than your age  is much more than skindeep Research has shown that youthfulness must come from within In one study a team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland analyzed the facial photographs of  pairs of identical twins determining which sibling looked older and why Factors that contributed to looking older   the researchers reported Other studies have linked   to higher levels of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress which can accelerate aging The team also found that among those under age  a woman with a heavier body looked older than her leaner twin but in subjects older than  a higher body mass index was associated with a more youthful appearance Fat fills out wrinkles and makes the face  and presumably other parts of the body  look younger But theres a limit to its benefits obesity is associated with more rapid biological aging Another study published last year by researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston found a biological link between stress and accelerated aging Dr Olivia I Okereke and colleagues examined the chromosomes of  women aged  to  participating in the Nurses Health Study They    irrational fears of anything from social situations to spiders  had shorter telomeres on their chromosomes Telomeres are DNAprotein complexes on the ends of chromosomes that are considered biological markers of aging Shortened telomeres are thought to underlie many of the adverse health effects of aging and perhaps even to contribute to looking older than ones years A pilot   last month underscored the benefits of limiting stress Dr Dean Ornish and colleagues at the Preventive Medicine Research Institute and the University of California San Francisco tested the effects of lifestyle changes on the length of telomeres Ten men were asked to make changes that included adopting a wholefoods plantbased diet moderate exercise   techniques like yoga and meditation and seeking greater intimacy and social support After five years changes in the length of their telomeres were compared with those among  men who were not asked to make such changes In the men who made lifestyle changes telomere length increased by an average of  percent the more changes the men made the greater the increase in length But telomere length decreased in the control group by an average of  percent Still youthfulness is not just a question of biology People are perceived to be younger than their years if they smile and laugh a lot be proud of those laugh lines and are generally cheerful and upbeat the kind of people who smile at strangers and wish them a good day I occasionally pass an older couple who walk together three times a week With their dour expressions and grudging acknowledgment of my good morning I thought they were in their mids So one day I asked only to learn that she was  and he was  It also helps to pursue personal and professional activities you enjoy as you get older My role models include the actress Estelle Parsons who continues to perform on stage and can do yoga headstands at  and Dame Judi Dench  who stars in movies despite having to learn her lines orally because   has caused her vision to deteriorate My dear friend Margaret Shryer  starred in a short film about age discrimination and performed a onewoman show she wrote at a theater festival in Minneapolis this summer Another friend the awardwinning broadcaster Lucy Jarvis cane in hand at  still travels abroad to make television documentaries To my mind it is far better to act young than to look young Of course it helps to be physically fit Too often those who spend liberally to counter the superficial signs of age neglect their bodies below the neck and become physically old before their time Muscle tissue inevitably declines with age but much can be done to minimize and even reverse a loss of strength Try using free weights or resistance machines If these dont appeal lift cans of soup better for lifting than consuming and continue to do chores that require strength like digging in the garden or carrying groceries
