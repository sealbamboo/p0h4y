A New York City doctor just back from volunteering in Africa with Doctors Without Borders has tested positive for Ebola  a high price to pay for trying to help fight an epidemic   people and threatens to infect tens of thousands The doctor   of Columbia University correctly warned other experts before he was taken to Bellevue Hospital which has been gearing up to tackle Ebola cases New York Presbyterian HospitalColumbia Medical Center where he usually worked says he stayed away during the virus day incubation period He is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients first He has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas it said in a statement Thursday night Here are some reminders of why New York isnt in danger of an Ebola epidemic Think wet and warm The virus lives in vomit diarrhea blood and sweat Heat kills it it doesnt survive being dried out and it doesnt travel through the air It also doesnt appear to stick to surfaces much so unless Spencer threw up in a public place he would not have exposed the public to the virus Even if he did someone would have to touch it and then carry wet particles to their eyes nose or mouth to become infected No one has been documented to have spread the virus before showing symptoms such as a high fever vomiting and diarrhea The virus builds up in the body as patients get sicker In fact people in the early stages of Ebola infection often test negative for the virus because theres not very much in their blood While the virus is found in sweat and that might make people wary of public transport whats meant by that is that its found in the profuse sweat of very ill patients and unlikely to be in the normal perspiration of an otherwise asymptomatic person The people most at risk of Ebola are caregivers and health care workers who are physically touching Ebola patients at their sickest In  years of studying Ebola outbreaks no one has seen a mystery case People are infected by direct contact with others  not casual contact on buses trains or in the street Thomas Eric Duncan   in the United States didnt infect his girlfriend or other people who were in an apartment with him after he became ill   who had some sort of contact with him all have passed the day incubation period without disease He   who had been intensively caring for him when he was very ill Unlike measles or tuberculosis you cant just breathe in Ebola virus and get infected For one thing it doesnt float in the air like those germs do It must get into the eyes nose or mouth or get past the very strong barrier that is human skin carried by a needle or perhaps through a fresh cut Soap and water quickly removes Ebola virus and bleach or alcohol kills it quite effectively
