Two thirds of people support a ban on sugary drinks in all UK schools and academies suggests a poll carried out for the BBC  The Populus poll of  adults in Britain also found more than four out of  people would support a tax on sugary drinks   And  said warnings on packaging  similar to those on cigarettes  would encourage them to eat more healthily  Sugar industry representatives said demonising sugar was too simplistic The poll  which was carried out for    suggests a majority of people in the UK take a harder line on sugary foods and drinks in schools than government policy which bans the sale of fizzy drinks crisps and sweets in local authorityrun schools but leaves the decision of whether children can bring them into schools up to head teachers   These rules do not apply to academies and free schools which together make up more than half of state secondary schools   Some heads including that of   have opted for a complete ban on children bringing in sugary and caffeinebased energy drinks  But representatives from the sugar industry say it is being unfairly highlighted as the main cause of health problems in particular obesity   Dr Julian Cooper head of food science at AB Sugar told the BBC Its quite simplistic just to demonise one ingredient to the exclusion of all others We would say that were probably consuming too many calories and probably doing too little exercise and activity  There is probably an over consumption of all calories not sugar per se He added There are some products that potentially you can reduce sugar theres no doubt about it  So say for example a tomato sauce that you use for making pasta if you look at the total sugars in that product over  of the sugars come from the tomatoes  So yes you may have a potential to say lets take the  out  once you go below that figure youre starting to remove the tomatoes and personally I actually like tomatoes in my tomato sauce on my pasta Under government policy schools under local authority control can only supply drinks  and states that schools should remove drinks which have no nutritional value and can cause tooth decay and should encourage children to drink water or drinks such as milk and fruit or vegetable juices which provide important nutrients like calcium vitamin C and carotenoids These food standards do not apply to academies free schools or to private schools  although they will do from later on this year  But the Live poll suggests most adults support a tougher line wanting to see a total ban on such food in all schools  And three quarters supported fixed limits on the amount of sugar used in certain foods with  saying they wanted supermarkets to stop promotions on unhealthy food products  But Dr Alison Tedstone a nutritionist at Public Health England said more schools would soon come under the same guidelines  Actually academies from this year will have the same guidance around food as local authority run schools and so the majority of them are captured by this guidance  A spokesman for industry body the Food and Drink Federation said The food and drink industry is committed to supporting improvements in public health  Whether through labelling education reformulating old favourites or creating new healthier options food and drink manufacturers have invested in a wide range of measures to empower and enable consumers to make food choices appropriate to their lifestyle  Having eliminated artificial transfats and substantially reduced levels of saturated fat and salt in a wide range of products many manufacturers are now looking at how they can help consumers to reduce their calorie intake through a wide range of innovative approaches
