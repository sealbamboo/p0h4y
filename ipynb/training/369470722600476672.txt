We nurses all have stories  if were lucky its just one  about the time we failed a patient Its usually a problem of being too busy too many cases too many procedures to keep track of until one critical step just one slips through our frenetic fingers and someone gets hurt I saw it happen the first time while in nursing school A patient needed an escalating dose of pain medicine Her pain eased but her breathing slowed and her oxygen level dropped I told her nurse that the patient might need narcan a reversing agent for opioids Narcan The nurse didnt have time for that Caring for eight patients on a busy medicalsurgery floor meant that getting through the days tasks took up all her time Half an hour later though the patient needed an emergency team to revive her I held her hand while an anesthesiologist stuck a tube down her throat She ended up in intensive care It would be easy to blame the nurse How could she be too busy But she was a good nurse smart and committed She simply had too much to do too many acute needs to address And then one just one got out of control Bedside nurses are the hospitals front line but we cant do the firstalert part of our jobs if there arent enough of us on the floor More demands for paperwork along with increasing complexity of care means the amount of time any one nurse has for all her patients is diminishing And as hospitals face increasing financial pressure nurse staffing often takes a hit because nurses make up the biggest portion of any hospitals labor costs For patients though the moral calculus of the nursesformoney exchange doesnt add up Pioneering work done by   at the University of Pennsylvania in  showed that each extra patient a nurse had above an established nursepatient ratio made it  percent more likely that one of the patients would die She found that  people died a year because they were in hospitals with overworked nurses Research also shows that when floors are adequately staffed with bedside nurses the number of patients injured by falls declines Staff increases lead to decreases in hospitalacquired infections which kill  patients every year The importance of sufficient nurse staffing is becoming irrefutable so much so that the Registered Nurse SafeStaffing Act of  was recently introduced by Representatives Lois Capps a Democrat from California and a nurse and David Joyce a Republican from Ohio Among other things the act would require that hospitals include their nurse staffing levels on Medicares Hospital Compare Web site and post their staffing levels in a visible place in every hospital Concerns over money will determine whether this bill has even a chance at passing It is collecting cosponsors but similar legislation has never gotten very far because hospital administrators view such mandates as too costly Its hard to do a definitive costbenefit analysis of a variable as complicated as nurse staffing because health care accounting systems are often byzantine But data suggest that sufficient staffing can significantly reduce hospital costs Medicare penalizes hospitals for readmitting too many patients within  days of discharge and a full nursing staff is one way to reduce readmissions Having enough nurses increases patientsatisfaction scores which also helps maintain Medicare reimbursement levels Understaffing leads to burnout and nurses quitting their jobs both of which cost money in terms of absenteeism and training new staff Finally falls and infections have associated costs What this discussion of finances misses though is that having enough nurses is not just about dollars and cents Its about limiting the suffering of human beings When hospitals have insufficient nursing staffs patients who would have gotten better can get hurt or worse Several months ago I started a new job and a few weeks in I heard my name being called A patient getting a drug that can cause dangerous reactions was struggling to breathe I hurried to her room only to discover that I wasnt needed The other nurses from the floor were already there stopping the infusion checking the patients oxygen and drawing up the rescue medication The patient was rattled but there were enough nurses to respond and in the end she was completely fine Now picture the same events in a different hospital one that doesnt adequately staff and this time the patient is you As the drug drips in you feel a malaise You breathe deeply but cant quite get enough air Your thinking becomes confused your heart races Terrified you press the call light you yell for help but the too few nurses on the floor are spread thin and no one comes to help in time A routine infusion ends with a call to a rapidresponse team a stay in intensive care intubation ventilation death This kind of breakdown is not the nurses fault but the systems We are not an elastic resource We can be where we are needed but only if there are enough of us
