Thursdays million settlement between the National Football League and  retired NFL players underscores two key facts about traumatic brain injury that it is difficult to prove and measure  especially many years after the fact  and that its link to neurocognitive problems that appear years later remains an enigma A mediated agreement does not mean that the retired NFL players injuries were caused by football or even that they could have proven as much said former US District Judge Layn Phillips the courtappointed mediator who brokered the proposed settlement Nor Phillips added does it mean they could not prove it Whats clear is that proof either way will take years of further research  and litigation While evidence of a link between concussion and longterm cognitive and psychiatric consequences is mounting it may take many more studies to clarify the relationship And hard proof of causeandeffect may remain elusive Concussion is indisputably as much a consequence of football at the professional level as wrecked knees blownout shoulders and bad backs But even in the immediate wake of a ferocious blow to the head traumatic brain injury can be difficult to show unless there is evidence of bleeding in or swelling of the brain CT scans cant detect the brains massive metabolic disturbance in the wake of trauma Nor can they measure the shearing of fatcovered axons  the white matter that carries electrical impulses across the hemispheres of the brain and from region to region And yet research suggests both of those processes may be key to concussions most damaging cognitive consequences Nor is damage evident on a CT scan conclusive Even when such imaging does suggest brain injury many will not immediately suffer the headaches fatigue and loss of memory and concentration that signal the brain has been hurt Others who may have come up clean on a CT scan may complain of subtle symptoms for weeks or months after a blow to the head So the diagnosis of concussion can be hard to make even when a player is rushed from the field to a hospital  a rare response in a sport where players  have been urged to walk it off and get back in the game When depression dementia concentration difficulties and tremors appear years  decades even  after a player has retired their link to blows to the head sustained while playing professionally is extremely difficult to prove One problem is that research suggests a persons response to brain injury may be influenced by a host of factors  social genetic perhaps even nutritional  for which the National Football League is not responsible The US military for which brain trauma has become an urgent priority has sponsored many studies to identify the genes or life circumstances that might make a person more vulnerable to longterm effects of traumatic brain injury In the future that knowledge may help weed out military recruits or help steer NFL wannabes to noncontact sports instead But retired NFL players may be left with the hard fact that vulnerable or not they played Another problem is the plaintiffs lack of baseline measures of cognitive performance Those would allow a basis for comparison that might at least have correlated with a decline in cognitive health or psychiatric symptoms with blows to the head The settlement itself will set aside funds for baseline exams for all retired NFL players But those come long after the blows to the head have stopped They may provide early warning of  and treatment for  trouble ahead But theyll do little to establish a link between brain trauma sustained during play and later troubles Fortunately baseline cognitive testing has increasingly become the norm for players as young as grade school since it can help detect concussionrelated changes and guide a physicians decision to clear a concussed young player to return to play Over time researchers are certain to use that data to track players cognitive wellbeing as a function of playing time and blows to the head Finally theres the grim possibility that the small hits matter as much as the big ones  a hypothesis for which there is growing evidence When researchers at Purdue University wired the helmets of a high school football team in Lafayette Ind with accelerometers recently they found that some players with no sign of concussion  players who took many less forceful blows to the head during the season  began showing cognitive deficits as the fall wore on Whether those effects accumulate or the brain heals completely between seasons no one yet knows But it does suggest that professional football players who generally cut their teeth and rock their brains for years on high school and college gridirons may not have only the NFL to blame for their latelife problems On all these uncertainties research has begun to establish a link between traumatic brain injury and later cognitive and psychiatric problems At Boston Universitys Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy the autopsied brains of dozens of former athletes have shown clear evidence of degenerative disease not seen in healthy brains Epidemiological studies have found that dementia and depression are more frequently diagnosed in former elite athletes who played contact sports  than in people without such a history And at Columbia University and elsewhere researchers are increasingly using new imaging techniques including functional MRI that watches the brain at work to detect immediate and longerterm changes in the brains performance following blows to the head Those have already yielded evidence that in the year after a concussion scanned participants showed evidence of shrinkage in a region of the brain  the anterior cingulate gyrus  thats implicated in depression That may draw a clearer line between brain trauma and a greater propensity to mood disorders and suicide suggested by studies that have compared broad populations Were sort of at the beginning of learning about concussion and all of its longterm effects said NYU Langone Medical Center radiologist Dr Yvonne Lui who has conducted such research Right now theres a lot of data that shows that between groups there are differences between control populations and athletes in contact sports But what it means for any individual person is still questionable So how you use that information to say anything about the longterm risk of any individual athlete is hard to put your finger on and accurately predict at this point Meanwhile research gauging the effects of smaller or accumulated blows to the head has been recognized by the MacArthur Assn Kevin Guskiewicz who has conducted some of the strongest work linking concussion with later dementia and depression was long a thorn in the NFLs side But in  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asked Guskiewiz to chair the NFLs panel on safety equipment and playing rules and Guskiewicz said yes An earlier version of this online article incorrectly identified  Dr Yvonne Lui as a radiologist with Columbia University She is with NYU Langone Medical Center
