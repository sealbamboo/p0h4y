My patient Kevin developed a terrible rash By the time he showed up a few weeks into his new life as human scratching post he was red and flaky from scalp to ankles I asked a few basic questions and knew in less than  seconds exactly what to do for him Which was to get rid of him as quickly as possible As I explained to Kevin at some length I have the ability to address basic gardenvariety itches but he clearly needed more than I was ever likely to learn about skin disease what he needed was a dermatologist And so off he went with some adhoc creams and a dermatology referral in hand Two weeks later he was back He had missed the appointment and used up all the creams Doc youve got to do something he pleaded scratching his shoulder blade against the back of the chair Im dying here And so off he went with more educated pharmaceutical guesswork and another dermatology appointment And then incredibly he was back He had made it to the dermatologists crowded office found the wait intolerably long and left scratching to come back to me We looked at each other Why are you here I asked Because youre my doctor said he Check and mate Now what The calculus of primary care demands a certain amount of blind faith Not unlike various biblical concepts  the loaves the fishes the burning bush  it conflates finite and infinite arguing that an entity can be endlessly consumed yet remain whole That entity is of course the patient indivisible and organic and yet the sum of countless parts In Kevins case I had tried to do what primary caretakers do dozens of times a day pass a problematic fraction of him into more capable hands For him it was only the skin I disowned but other patients are carved like chickens heart lungs feet gut brain all heading out into different zones of expertise The theory holds that you can hack a patient to bits metaphorically speaking yet still provide care to a seamlessly reintegrated whole Some genius practitioners can actually do just that reassembling the parts so effortlessly that even their owner feels good Or maybe it is the patients who are the geniuses as they manage to forge yet another productive relationship with yet another expert of idiosyncratic temperament and demands The results can also be less than optimal Sometimes there are just too many parts in motion the harried doctor forgets about reassembling concentrates on juggling gets overwhelmed and drops everything Sometimes the problem is on the patients end Kevin I feel sure would never expect me to remove his appendix should the need arise But my refusal to extend myself to his rash clearly seemed peculiarly capricious  we usually got along so well  and so he was just giving me the opportunity to reconsider my role in his life and get it right He sat there and scratched I looked at him and mused on the hoary old question of what it actually means to be someones doctor when there is nothing constructive to be done for that persons ailing parts Back in the day when there was little constructive to be done period the Hippocratic mandate declare the past diagnose the present foretell the future summed up the mission of medical care Doctors didnt fix anybody they just provided the narrative Now the question arises most often when the patients parts are so irretrievably broken that all the experts sign off and ship the patient back to the primary caretaker COD The doctor then stops thinking about repair and concentrates on care and comfort reassurance and explanation But Kevins case fitted neither situation I couldnt provide the narrative of his illness because I had no idea what his illness was Truth be told I suspected his dog was involved but it was a weak theory at best I clearly couldnt provide comfort because my various attempts had all failed I could only glare at him  are mired in policy verbiage these days but most people know it when they see it The same goes for a related new concept known as the   which is simply the setting of stcentury primary care You can turn purple trying to define it but it is really only Robert Frosts place where when you have to go there they have to take you in And sometimes they have to usher you right back out again With the simple statement No more prescriptions from me Kevin was induced to return to the dermatologist Nobody there can articulate a good diagnosis either and Im afraid the dog is still under suspicion but a more sophisticated set of creams and ointments has helped
