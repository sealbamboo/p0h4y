Carlos Romeros apartment is marked with remnants from his former life a giant television from his days playing World of Warcraft and a pair of jeans the width of an easy chair Remnants of that time  when he weighed  pounds  mark his body too loose hanging skin and stretch marks I lift weights and work out and work hard but theres lasting damage says Romero Yet for all the troubles he had dating when he was obese  all those unanswered requests on dating websites  shedding weight left him uneasy about how much to reveal If you were to say to someone on the first date I lost  pounds youre indicating that you had a very serious issue at one point and that you may still have that issue he says So its not something I put on a dating profile because I dont want people to judge me for it The stigma of obesity is so strong that it can remain even after the weight is lost Holly Fee a sociologist at Bowling Green State University has conducted some of the only research on dating attitudes toward the formerly obese In  Fee published her   in the journal   She found that potential suitors said they would hesitate to form a romantic relationship with someone who used to be heavy The biggest fear Fee says is they believed these formerly obese individuals would regain their weight The prevailing belief is that people who have never been obese can control their weight and those whove been heavy have less willpower says   a psychology professor and the director of clinical services at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine Physicians and the general public tend to think that obesity is a moral failing and that they cant push away from the table  Sarwer says For men and women who have lost a significant amount of weight excess hanging skin can hold them back from dating and being intimate Health insurance almost never pays for costly plastic surgery to correct the problem which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing I think they can be particularly selfconscious about this issue and be worried about the first time the partner sees them undressed Sarwer says How are they going to respond Are they going to be grossed out It wasnt sex or romance that sparked the big change in Carlos Romero two years ago Thats when at age  he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy Romero knew if he didnt lose weight his condition could worsen quickly He stopped eating pizza and ramen noodles and drinking soda and began exercising Then a year ago after he had dropped a number of jeans sizes he tried Internet dating again Romero updated his old profiles and pictures and started sending out messages It was amazing at the time he says He got responses from girls he never thought he would hear back from I was like Holy crap This is so different It felt like a whole other world had opened up Now Romero spends many nights on dates with his new girlfriend Kate Rowe They met on OkCupidcom after he sent her a message He looked smoldering and broody in his profile picture Rowe says and I was like Why not  Their third date was on Romeros th  birthday and he decided to tell Rowe about his weight loss which he thought could be a potential dealbreaker I dont want to like this girl any more than I already do without having her know he remembers thinking I said I have to tell you this thing Please dont judge me  Romero knew the risk he was taking He thought What if she doesnt want to be anywhere near me Instead of being repulsed though Rowe says she was inspired by his hard work and commitment to good health If she had seen Romeros old profile back when he was bigger she probably would not have responded she says But now he is into rock climbing and being active and they have things in common For Carlos there are still physical and psychological hurdles to being in love Its difficult for him to be intimate He says shyly Shes seen everything And when he looks in the mirror he still sees a pound man His mind hasnt quite caught up to his body
