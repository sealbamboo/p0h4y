Heres a nonhypothetical question If an older person without much money could receive prescription drug insurance  ie Medicare Part D  at no cost why wouldnt he apply  Both Medicare and the Social Security Administration have tried to spread the word to tell lowincome seniors about a governmentsubsidized Part D program called Extra Help a benefit worth about  a year Most people who qualify automatically are signed up for Extra Help through their enrollment in Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income But among those who are eligible but must apply on their own  roughly  million older adults  only an estimated  percent to  percent receive it  as Jane Gross has pointed out But opting to take advantage of a free subsidy should in theory be a simpler decision Why arent people taking free drug insurance that anyone would benefit from said J Michael McWilliams a health policy researcher at Harvard Medical School Hes the senior author of a recent study that suggests an answer Some older people   Here is a clear choice Dr McWilliams said of Extra Help But it still requires awareness being able to fill out the application having a sense of what your income is a number of cognitive tasks Its easier than sifting through multiple plans to find the right one but its still a lot of work And it defeats more people at the lower end of the cognitive scale than at the upper end The study published in JAMA Internal Medicine used data gathered from  to  for the national Health and Retirement Study which includes information on respondents household income and incorporates a telephone version of a common cognitive test The researchers identified  Medicare beneficiaries whose low income and few assets would likely qualify them for a full Part D subsidy but who were not automatically receiving it those people were divided into four groups based on their cognitive scores The cognitive differences proved significant Those in the bottom quartile were less likely to be enrolled in Part D at all  percent than those in the top cognitive group  percent Only about a third of those with the lowest cognition were aware that a lowincome subsidy existed versus nearly  percent in the top group and they were half as likely to apply for it  percent versus  percent which is also a discouragingly low rate People who scored poorly on a short test of numeracy involving three simple math problems were also less likely to apply and enroll We found this pattern consistently Dr McWilliams said Its very telling So while the Social Security Administration mails out letters and creates public service announcements and while Medicare   a few years ago merely informing and reinforming people about the program may not solve this puzzle Even if applicants cognitive deficits dont reach the level of dementia they might not be able to read and process the materials Dr McWilliams pointed out They might misperceive their income and think they dont qualify when they do They might not be able to complete the application Or they forget about it Heres a situation in which family intervention could prove helpful  The   lays out eligibility requirements If your parent or older relative has income below  this year  for a married couple and less than   for a couple in other resources not including a house or car be sure theyve applied A broad swath of the elderly population meets these thresholds and could receive a partial or full Extra Help subsidy Family support that can help seniors navigate the system can be tremendously useful Dr McWilliams said But his study  and others that have found that people with cognitive deficits are less likely to buy Medigap insurance enroll in Part D or choose a Medicare Advantage plan with better benefits  points to a larger policy issue The market for Part D and other public insurance supposedly gets more efficient and benefits from healthy competition when consumers have sufficient information to make smart choices and drive prices down In this case though strategies that rely on just providing more information may not be effective Dr McWilliams said Maybe he and his colleagues suggest Extra Help enrollment should be the default with Medicare beneficiaries able to opt out instead of having to opt in Or perhaps Medicare could provide more guidance not just more data for those who find the process too daunting to contend with Though the doughnut hole is gradually closing Part D remains an imperfect program Still its supposed to be available to the elderly poor Prescription drugs arent a luxury
