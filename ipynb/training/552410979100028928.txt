Hospital AE units recorded their worst ever performance in the week before Christmas as   emergency care services struggled to deal with an unprecedented number of patients figures show Type  AEs emergency departments based at hospitals in England treated and either admitted or discharged just  of arrivals within the politically important fourhour target in the week ending Sunday  December The NHS also recorded its worst ever AE performance using the preferred measure of NHS England and the Department of Health this includes patients receiving urgent and emergency care in settings such as walkin and urgent care centres which are based at GP surgeries on high streets or at some hospitals In the week before Christmas just  of those arriving at all those places were dealt with within four hours though that rose to  the following week The  performance is the worst yet against the fourhour target and was a drop on the  seen a week before which was itself a record low The British Medical Association BMA which represents doctors said the NHS was struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door The NHS constitution states that  of all AE patients should be dealt with within four hours David Cameron and other ministers have regularly pledged to meet that and other key NHS targets but performances gradually worsened during  The  record is the lowest weekly performance against the target since AE records began in  It came in the week that a record number of people    attended AE Type  performance recovered slightly in the Christmas week reaching  in the week to  December partly because fewer patients attended   Before December the performance of hospitalbased AE units had only fallen below  once during  Statistics released by NHS England on Tuesday show that in the four weeks in December it dropped to  week ending  December   December then  and  in the last two full weeks of the year The new evidence of a growing crisis in AE comes as more hospitals are having to declare a major incident as they fail to cope with what doctors and managers have said are unprecedented numbers of patients   regularly have to increase their bed capacity by opening overflow or contingency wards where they can admit and treat extra patients and hiring extra staff to provide care there A yearonyear comparison of the last two weeks in December shows that the number of patients forced to wait more than four hours to be treated was almost treble what it was in the same fortnight in  Similarly the number who had to endure a trolley wait of between four and  hours before being admitted to a bed almost quadrupled While  patients had to wait more than four hours in the last three months of  many more did so in the final quarter of    Trolley waits rose across the most recent quarter from  in October to  in December This sharp rise prompted the NHS England medical director Prof Bruce Keogh to write to all hospitals before Christmas urging them to improve their performance and warning of the risks to patients left waiting for too long on trolleys Across the three months from October to December   of all types of AE patients were treated within four hours  the worst figure since the NHS began monitoring its performance against the standard Under the Labour government  of all types of patients had to be treated within four hours but the coalition relaxed that in  to the current  Speaking before the publication of the figures the health secretary Jeremy Hunt acknowledged the NHS was under immense pressure but insisted the fourhour target was being met in  of cases The cautiously upbeat remarks by Hunt who said that England had the best record for emergency treatment among countries which compile records contrasted with those of his Liberal Democrat ministerial colleague Norman Lamb who said the NHS was not meeting its targets Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said the government should take emergency steps to help the NHS cope These figures are extremely serious  and it shows that our National   Service today is under extreme pressure all round the country he said The secretary of state hasnt put plans in place to ensure the NHS can get safely through the winter He must urgently do so The BMA demanded urgent improvements to the overall system of NHS care to relieve the mounting pressure on hospitals such as improvements to the NHS  telephone advice service and better provision of social care services to help vulnerable patients stay well at home Patients should be treated on the basis of need rather than arbitrary targets but these figures show the NHS is under unprecedented levels of pressure Staff are working flat out but the system is struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door Growing pressure on services throughout the year means hospitals have no spare capacity to deal with the winter spike in demand So patients are enduring delays in their treatment and the NHS finds itself running just to stand still said Dr Mark Porter the BMAs leader Doctors must be able to treat the patient whos in front of them based on their individual needs which is why doctors dont agree with targets for targets sake Moving away from a system which prioritises targets above all else can help to improve the quality of care doctors are able to give patients by preventing rushed admissions or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment But this will only work in the best interests of patients if the NHS has the staff and resources it needs to meet rising patient demand he said The Royal College of Nursing said the AE figures were evidence that the overall health and social care system was in crisis and demanded proper funding to fix the growing problems These figures show what patients and staff already know  AE departments are constantly running at full capacity Patients and hardworking staff are being let down by a system which is in crisis said Dr Peter Carter the unions chief executive and general secretary Hospital trusts trying to recruit more staff have been hamstrung by the shortsighted cuts to nurse training places which means there simply arent enough nurses in the system This is made worse by chronic underresourcing of community services and social care which means more people end up in AE who could be better treated elsewhere The government needs to stop burying its head in the sand and accept that there is a crisis in AE which is getting worse Nothing short of a longterm strategy and a significant longterm investment in our health service will put an end to this crisis
