The taller a postmenopausal woman is the greater her risk for developing cancer according to a new large study of American women Similar results have been found in other Western populations including in the United Kingdom and Canada and in Asia  There had been several previous studies but there hadnt been much done in North America says Dr Thomas E Rohan chair and professor of epidemiology and population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx New York Hes the senior author of the paper published Thursday in   a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research We found that there was a strong significant association between height and cancer risk both for all cancers combined and for several specific cancer sites says Rohan Those specific cancer sites are colorectum colon rectum breast endometrium ovary kidney thyroid melanoma and multiple myeloma Each  centimeter  about  inch  increase in height is associated with a  percent increase in overall cancer risk according to his groups analysis of  women aged  to  participating in the Womens Health Initiative a major longterm research program established by the National Institutes of Health in  Rohan and his colleagues adjusted for other known risk factors such as body weight ethnicity smoking alcohol intake cancer screening and hormone therapy use In fact the study is one of the more detailed of its kind to confirm that being tall independently raises a persons chances of developing cancer  This study is in women our study was in women but when we looked at studies of men as well it is very similar says Dr Jane Green a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford England and the lead author of the largest study to date of the link between height and cancer  That link doesnt seem to depend on when the study was done or what the population was or what the height of the population was on average or the ethnicity of the population says Green It may suggest something interesting about how cancer develops in general Researchers say they dont know exactly why height is associated with cancer risk We speculate says Rohan        Being tall may raise a persons chances of developing cancer simply because taller people have more cells and cells can mutate as they divide which can lead to cancer say researchers But that explanation is not really of further scientific interest says Green because it doesnt give any insight into the actual process of how cancer develops Instead researchers focus on other possible factors such as genetics Eighty percent of the variation in height in Western populations is estimated to be determined by genetics according to todays study Those genes might have something to do with cancer development as well But adult height is also determined by environment An obvious candidate is nutrition in early life says Rohan There has been a secular trend in the last century or so of increasing adult height and that has been attributed to improvement in early childhood nutrition and to improvements in hygiene as well  Adult height is associated with drinking more milk for example which is associated with higher circulating levels of socalled insulinlike growth factor or IGFI IGFI helps children grow but studies have shown it is also associated with increased risk of certain cancers     Rohan would like to see future studies examine the genes associated with height to see if there is a cancer link In addition he says research studies that have recruited individuals at a young age may eventually help us to understand whether nutrition in early life is contributing to cancer risk In the meantime tall people should not worry about their cancer risk says Green The association of height with cancer risk is significant but modest she says and being tall actually carries a lower risk of some other diseases such as heart disease and stroke Youve got to look at the bigger picture says Green
