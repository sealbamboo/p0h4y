Go to the doctor with an aching elbow and the prescription may well be a cortisone shot Ah relief But that shortterm gain may make for longterm pain Theres mounting evidence that cortisone shots long the first response for the painful tendon problem known as tennis elbow increases the risk of continued problems or relapse one year out That may come as a surprise to those who have availed themselves of this seemingly miraculous quick fix The latest   published in   the J  found that  percent of people who got a cortisone shot for tennis elbow had recovered or improved one year later Sounds good right Well  percent who got placebo shots did just as well The study included  people in Brisbane Australia And about half of the people getting cortisone shots had symptoms return within a year compared to  percent who didnt get the treatment Those results are similar to   of tendon damage in elbows shoulders and Achilles tendons found steroids less helpful long term than taking a wait and see approach The researchers from the University of Queensland who did this study also wanted to see if physical therapy would counteract the lack of longterm improvement It didnt The recommendation from this study is not to combine physiotherapy and corticosteroid injections or to do corticosteriod injection   chair in sports physiotherapy and a coauthor of the study said in an email Vicenzino says that advice doesnt apply to acute tendon injuries like   in the knee Cortisone shots can help reduce the pain caused by those sorts of acute injuries though they are sometimes used to excess by athletes eager to get back on the field The pain of tennis elbow official name   seems to be caused by damage to the tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the elbow but not by inflammation Its becoming more common and can be caused by repetitive gripping of a computer mouse smartphone or other gizmo not just a tennis racket Its not clear why   a steroid would quickly relieve the pain from that sort of tendon damage It may be due to cortisones effect on chemicals produced by the damaged tendon  or by placebo effect Doctors have long recommended that patients have no more than three cortisone shots in a body part per year but theres no firm data on whether thats too much or not enough The harder you drill into the data the more it seems we may be better off doing nothing says   an upperextremity surgeon at the Illinois Bone and Joint Institute in Glenview Ill If you do nothing at all for this condition it will eventually go away But eventually can mean three years for tennis elbow So Benson says hell continue to recommend cortisone shots to his patients along with pain relievers like Advil and physical therapy The interest in treating this is for patients to have better quality of life sooner rather than later Thats a different point of view than that of   chief of physical therapy at Harvard University Health Systems If you can get through the short term without a shot you may be better off she told Shots The   study found that physical therapy helped improve symptoms four weeks out but showed no more benefits than placebo a year after treatment But the therapy participants took half as much pain medication and didnt have the problems with recurrence seen with cortisone shots Its disheartening to see a lack of positive physical therapy results Wilmarth says But there were actually better results with PT than with corticosteroids
