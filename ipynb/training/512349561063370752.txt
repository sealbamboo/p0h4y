For those who eagerly trace their genetic lineage or subscribe online to find their earliest ancestors theres a new group to consider adding to the furthest reaches of your list A previously unrecognized population of ancient north Eurasians may be a major third braid in the genetic twist that gave rise to most modern Europeans and their kin Scientists have known from previous work that more than  years ago a population of darkhaired lighteyed huntergatherers from Western Europe and a group of darkhaired browneyed farmers from the Near East got together and had kids But new data suggest a third group from north Eurasia may have swaggered into the ancient party many years later  after agriculture was introduced  contrary to previous thought These traveling Eurasians are evidence that people were moving into Europe later than expected scientists now say after the continent was already densely settled The evidence from a team led by geneticist   at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and   at the University of Tbingen in Germany was   Wednesday in   The scientists analyzed DNA from nine ancient skeletons and from  modernday people from across the globe In particular you might thank the remains of a yearold farmer from Germany and eight yearold huntergatherers from Luxembourg and Sweden DNA from their bones or teeth was harvested for science We were using the whole   Reich tells Shots which means they compared the DNA libraries of each individual looking for areas in the genome that are variable among different populations In the end their statistical analysis found that a computer model incorporating these three very different populations of ancestors seemed to best explain the genetic patterns seen among most Europeans today Prior to the study the third lineage was considered a ghost population  thought to exist based on genetic patterns seen in the genomes of modern Europeans but without any ancient DNA evidence to confirm that Interestingly though Reichs team solved the mystery of one ghost population theyve created another Their genetic data indicates that theres likely at least one more group whose physical remains havent yet turned up Its a population that split off from all other Eurasian populations before they separated into the three Reich says I think the most exciting aspect of this work is that it is a powerful demonstration of how ancient DNA analyses can provide insights into human history that would be difficult or impossible to make from genetic data of contemporary individuals alone says   a geneticist at the University of Washington School of Medicine I suspect this study and several others recently published are a harbinger of things to come
