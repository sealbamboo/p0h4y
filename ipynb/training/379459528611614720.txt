Then things indeed went south The worse they looked the more I kept going to the fridge recalled Mr Richichi a cohost of a   on KDKAFM in Pittsburgh First a couple of Hot Pockets By the second quarter I threw in a box of White Castle hamburgers As the game progressed I just went through the refrigerator the more fear the more emotion Im chomping down But Im not going near the salad or the yogurt If it doesnt have  calories Im going right past it The aftereffect of the Steelers ignominious defeat by a score of  clung to Mr Richichi on Monday when he rejected his regular breakfast of yogurt and strawberries in favor of a bagel sandwich with sausage eggs cheese peppers and hot sauce Then his mood hardly improved after spending four hours on the air railing and commiserating with Steelers fans he had pizza for lunch My weight goes up and down with my teams  said Mr Richichi My team does well Im   pounds lighter  Mr Richichis eating habits joined at the waistline with the NFL were reflected in a recent study that investigated whether a football teams outcome had an effect on what fans ate the day after a game Although the study did not look at weight fluctuations researchers found that football fans saturatedfat consumption increased by as much as  percent following defeats and decreased by  percent following victories The association was particularly pronounced in the eight cities regarded as having the most devoted fans with Pittsburgh often ranked No  Narrower nailbiting defeats led to greater consumption of calorie and fatsaturated foods than lopsided ones If youre a fan you say We lost I lost said Pierre Chandon a coauthor of the study and a   a Parisbased business school When people feel their identity is threatened they compensate by eating indulgent food Its more difficult to resist temptation No one ate broccoli after a defeat Using the National Eating Trends database from the NPD Group a market research firm researchers extracted day food diaries kept during two regular NFL seasons in  and  zeroing in on Sundays Mondays and Tuesdays Altogether they looked at  individuals over  consumption days including fans from cities whose teams won and lost Those whose team didnt play those Sundays or who were from a city without a team served as controls The researchers found that the greatest divide in calorie and total fat consumption between winners and losers was on Mondays By Tuesday the fans eating habits paralleled the control groups Moving past the letdown theyre getting pumped up for the next weeks game Previous studies have linked sports defeats to   domestic   and   but this was the first to analyze the effects on fatty food consumption The findings were    While losing a game appears to trigger emotional eating a team victory may have the opposite effect Dr Chandon said because Your ego is boosted you have higher selfesteem and its easier to feel strong and good about yourself Its easier to delay gratification or resist temptation That seemed to be the case for Jessie PadillaBryson an academic writing assistant in Burlington Wash who settled in to watch the Seattle Seahawks opener last Sunday against the Carolina Panthers reinforced with chips dips and pizza  The  victory tasted so good The morning after Ms PadillaBryson said she was in a better mood and I texted my friends and husband all day long about the game At lunch she skipped her usual chicken strips and fries and instead ate a turkey sandwich Dr Chandon said the phenomenon is not distinctly American In one of the experiments that was part of the study he and Yann Cornil a graduate student randomly assigned  French adults to write about a victory or a defeat by their favorite team or athlete Then participants were given a word puzzle and told they could nibble from bowls of potato chips chocolates grapes and cherry tomatoes While everyone ate roughly the same quantity of food their choices differed those who were asked to write about defeats tended toward the fatsaturated foods while the others made more healthful choices The French are very snooty about their food said Dr Chandon Theyre more mindful eaters than Americans but when it comes to sports they had the same response to defeat I think thats reassuring In a followup experiment designed to test whether negative eating patterns could be changed the researchers gathered  French adults to watch highlight videos from one of three soccer games a French victory against Italy the defeat of France by Italy and a match between two Belgian teams After they watched the game highlights half the participants were asked to rank a list of values  family religion the arts  and write about their top priority This technique called selfaffirmation is meant to focus individuals on whats truly most important to them bolstering a sense of self that can withstand a perceived insult or indignity Then researchers showed them pictures of the four snacks asking which they preferred  Those who had watched a defeat and were asked to rank their values thereby affirming their stronger sense of self tended to choose the healthful foods Those who watched defeats but didnt list their values preferred the unhealthy foods David Sherman a social and health psychologist and associate professor at the University of California Santa Barbara who was not involved in the study said that the results made sense People want to see themselves as good and competent he said  and when events challenge that view  say a loss by the sports team you identify with people feel their identity has been threatened Theyre thinking The Giants blew it he said The goal is to remind people of these other resources that regardless of how your team did youre still a good capable person  But in the real world The one in which the morning after the Green Bay Packers suffered a bitter loss to the San Francisco ers Paramveer Singh a passionate Packers fan who lives near Milwaukee and typically starts his university workday with a breakfast of fruit salad instead grabbed a chocolate milk and a Hershey bar How do you stage a selfaffirmation intervention with a fan in mourning Dr Chandons suggestion Perhaps you could prompt your spouse I know youre a fan but is this all you care about  He paused to reconsider Oops Perhaps that could make it worse
