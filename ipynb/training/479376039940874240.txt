We   when we hear the claims that its possible to get rid of the gunk that accumulates in our cells by doing a cleanse with clean foods But what if some foods actually do help detox the body The results of a recent clinical trial suggest that compounds in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale prod cells to get rid of certain air pollutants The intriguing randomized control trial of about  Chinese adults found that consuming a beverage made with broccoli sprouts every day for three months led to high rates of excretion in urine of two harmful chemicals benzene and acrolein Now benzene and acrolein are pretty common If youre pumping gas at a gas station youll breathe in a little benzene and if youre smoking or around smokers youll take in acrolein and some benzene too If you live in a place with heavy pollution you may get a big enough dose of benzene to make you sick  though that   Lately scientists have been zeroing in on a compound called glucoraphanin that seems to have a protective effect against these and other toxins Animal model studies have shown that when vegetables containing glucoraphanin are chewed or swallowed another compound called sulforaphane appears on the scene and kicks enzymes into action to take up pollutants and clear them from the body in urine In other words sulforaphane seems to act like fuel for the bodys own trash collection and disposal services  published online in early June in the journal   set out to figure out whether drinking a halfcup of a beverage containing broccoli sprouts would increase the rate of excretion of benzene and acrolein The researchers say they chose these chemicals because they were among the most stable molecules among pollutants to track About half of the  Chinese adults in a rural farming community in Jiangsu province  a community with very high levels of air pollution  who participated in the study were given the broccoli sprout drink every day for  weeks while the other half got pineapple and lime juice The researchers who hail from Johns Hopkins University and several other institutions in the US and China found that among the people consuming the broccoli sprout beverage the rate of excretion of benzene increased  percent throughout the week period As for the acrolein the excretion rate went up  percent during the trial We thought the pathway might respond initially and then the compounds would wear out their welcome and the body would tune out   a researcher at both Johns Hopkins and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and an author of the study tells The Salt But the effect was just as vigorous at the beginning as at the end which suggests that over ones lifetime you could enhance this preventative activity in the body with food While the researchers say they have no idea whether superfoods like broccoli can actually prevent cancer or other diseases this new study lays some important groundwork that will make it easier to answer that question The assumption is that if theres less carcinogen in the body theres less risk he says But at some point we need to do a definitive trial to find out if you take this approach for months or years whether rates of disease are dampened Kensler admits the study is quirky But hes optimistic that the benefits of consuming broccoli and its cousins may extend way beyond detoxicating the body of benzene and acrolein Almost for certain we think that other toxins will be influenced in similar ways he says But heres a caveat The sulforaphane is most likely to work on chemicals youve just been exposed to  not those that stick around in the body The researchers dont know whether the compound has any effect on the chemicals stored in fat cells  things like pesticides DDT or dioxin But Kensler says hes excited about what the findings could mean for combating the health effects of air pollution The next step will be to figure out how little of a food like broccoli sprout you would need to eat and how often youd need to eat it to get the protection Theyll also have to figure out what to do about the fact that not everybody loves broccoli Still we think these foods provide awesome opportunities particularly because theyre relatively inexpensive and culturally appropriate for most people he says
