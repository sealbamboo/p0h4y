For nearly a year disease detectives around the world have been trying to track down the source of a mysterious new virus in the Middle East that has infected  people and killed  since September Now it looks like theyve pinpointed at least one place where the virus is hiding out Scientists at Columbia University have detected the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus or MERS in a bat near the home of a man who died from the disease The team found a small fragment of the viruss genes in the animal that matches perfectly with those seen in the patient Its the first time the virus  or a piece of it  has been found in an animal And the discovery offers strong evidence that the flying mammals carry   which causes severe pneumonialike symptoms similar to SARS Although MERS can sometimes spread between people in most instances the source of the virus has been unknown So health workers havent been able to stop the virus from cropping up sporadically around the Middle East Several signs had pointed to bats as a likely carrier MERS is most   to a bat virus And the nocturnal animals are known to harbor an array of coronaviruses So right after MERS emerged on the Arabian Peninsula last September virushunting master   and his team at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health in New York hopped on a plane and started looking for the pathogen in Saudi Arabian bats They interviewed the family of man infected with the virus in   Saudi Arabia and collected samples from bats close to his home including those at an abandoned date palm orchard and a garden near his work The team also trapped bats in two other cities in Saudi Arabia and headed back to the US with more than  samples When they tested the samples back in the lab the MERS virus showed up in just one a fecal pellet from an Egyptian tomb bat caught near the patients home The team  its findings in the journal   On the surface this means the bat was infected with MERS says virologist   of the University of Maryland School of Medicine who wasnt involved in the study Thats legitimate And  percent of the time thats the case But he tells Shots its probably too soon to say for sure that the Egyptian tomb bat is the animal reservoir or source for MERS First off the virus was found in the bat guano or excrement So theres a chance the virus was just passing through the bat You dont know whether the bat has eaten an insect that is infected with MERS or if the bat itself is positive for the virus Frieman says Second the frozen bat samples collected by Lipkin and his team werent in pristine shape when they arrived at the lab The shipment was inadvertently opened at customs  and sat at room temperature for  hours before transfer to Columbia University Lipkin and his team write in the study Such rough treatment could have degraded the samples and made it tough for the team to dig out viral genes Thats probably why the team found only a tiny portion of the viruss genome Frieman says Its actually kind of amazing that they got this little piece of the virus out at all Its clearly a preliminary study he says But everybodys been waiting on this data We all knew that Lipkin was working on the problem but no one knew what the data said Its nice to finally have it
