In Colorado more people die   than car crashes And that has a profound effect on the people on the front lines who treat gunshot victims Chris Colwell is an emergency room doctor in Denver and says he sees gun violence victims on a weekly basis When those cases are fatal they are hard for him to forget Theyll come in and theyll look at me and theyll talk to me and then theyll die says Colwell who has been at Denver Health the citys biggest public hospital for  years Colwell also treated casualties from two of the deadliest mass shootings in American history He responded to the scene during the  massacre at Columbine High School where  died He also treated victims of last Julys movie theater shooting in Aurora where a dozen were killed and  were wounded But he doesnt just treat the victims  often hell also treat the shooter after he or she has been caught by police Colwell describes a case from a few months ago where he treated a woman  who later died  and her husband the shooter They had had a fight He had caught her in what he felt was cheating and he had lost his temper he says He went and grabbed the pistol that he had for home defense at his bedside and he made a snap decision and he realized his life will never be the same and hers was gone He says its remarkable how often people who pull the trigger are surprised at the consequences of their actions And hes deeply disturbed by how easy it is to get guns I see patients every day that are right on the edge of being unstable and are out there in the environment and they describe problems with access to medications problems with access to psychiatric care or substance abuse care problems with access to homes or to shelter says Colwell But they dont describe problems with access to guns  has worked with Colwell in the emergency department for  years She says she cant shake the gunshot victims either A few weeks ago she came to work and learned that an ambulance was rushing in with a yearold whod been shot in the head The mother   each of her three children and then committed suicide Our patient was the only one who was a survivor Bakes says Bakes is unequivocal in her opposition to guns Bakes and Colwell say gun injuries seem much more deliberate than any other kind of trauma they see Its so senseless Bakes says You know its not an accident Somebody intentionally pulled the trigger for whatever reason Dr Jack Cletcher is a retired orthopedic surgeon and avid hunter in Longmont Colo Hes treated his share of gunshot victims too Decades ago he took care of wounded soldiers just off the plane from Vietnam He can sympathize with Bakes and Colwell but he doesnt see guns as the root of the problem This is the kind of emotional reaction that occurs with these horrible catastrophes that happen Cletcher says The gun is only the instrument Its not something that happens because the gun does it There has to be somebody holding the gun to do it Cletcher is opposed to most of the new gun restrictions lawmakers are talking about in   and   I dont think we need new laws we just need to make the ones we have work better says Cletcher He would rather see lawmakers focus on better treatment for the mentally ill and keeping guns out of their hands he says Recently leaders of the   of the American Medical Association went to Washington to   for measures to help prevent gun violence Strengthening mental health care was on their agenda and they support President Obamas executive action for increased research into gun violence  presidentelect of the chapter showed Rep Ed Perlmutter DColo the results of a recent survey of Colorado AMA members showing about twothirds of their membership want to see gun regulations strengthened and about a third dont There are   around the country who dont either But a majority of AMA delegates at the national level have   tighter restrictions on guns And many professional groups have too including the   the   and the
