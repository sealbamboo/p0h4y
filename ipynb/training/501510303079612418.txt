Scientists have taken the first steps to developing a vaccine for chikungunya  an emerging mosquitoborne virus that has infected more than a half million people in the Western Hemisphere this year About  Americans have brought the virus to  states The study was small Only  people were given the experimental vaccine But the findings are promising They demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and that it triggers a strong response from the immune system scientists   Friday in the   journal Until last year   was found only in parts of Africa and Asia Then in December the virus started circulating on the island of St Martin in the Caribbean From there chikungunya spread like wildfire It hopped from island to island in the Caribbean and spilled over into Central America and parts of South America By July chikungunya had found its way to Florida At least four people have caught the virus in Florida And the state has recorded  imported cases New York state has the second largest number of imported cases  Chikungunya usually isnt fatal But it causes a high fever headache nausea and extreme joint pain  which can linger for months And theres no cure or vaccine To start filling in that second gap a team of researchers at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda designed a vaccine using   a new technology Synthetic particles carry proteins found on the viruss outside shell The particles dont contain any of chikungunyas genes so theyre not infectious But the immune system doesnt realize that When   and her colleagues injected the viruslike particles into the muscles of volunteers their immune systems created antibodies that can stop the virus from infecting cells After three injections the participants had chikungunya antibodies in their blood at concentrations similar to those found in people who had fought off the viral infection And these antibodies stuck around in the volunteers blood for at least six months Those findings suggest that the vaccine could give longterm protection But Ledgerwood and her team wont know if thats true until they test the vaccine in more people and see how effective it is at stopping an infection Overall the experimental vaccine was well tolerated by the volunteers Nine out of the  developed tenderness where the shot was given and  volunteers reported tiredness nausea or headaches after the vaccine But in general the shot was safe This experimental vaccine isnt the first for chikungunya Back in the s a team at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases created a vaccine with a live weakened version of the virus That vaccine completed a   But scientists halted its development because there wasnt enough funding
