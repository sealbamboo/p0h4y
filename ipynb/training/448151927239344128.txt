Leave it to the   to uncover the hidden treasures of the Internet Recently they were gabbing about Googles nutrition comparison tool which was quietly   at the end of  and escaped us here at The Salt Using this clever little tool is as simple as searching for two types of food preceded by the word compare The word vs between the two foods also seems to work for some comparisons but not every single one So for example say you want to compare the calories sugar content and nutrients of mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes Just type in   and boom you get photos and an elegant chart revealing that sweet potatoes have  grams of sugar per  grams compared with  grams in mashed potatoes Scroll down and youll see that sweet potatoes kill mashed potatoes in vitamin A potassium and calcium content As you contrast ingredients perhaps out of sheer curiosity perhaps to design a meal plan youll learn a lot by playing around with the preparation and cooking method of the food Tweak the mashed potatoes to potato mashed with milk and butter and unsurprisingly the fat content jumps up You can even compare apples and oranges apples are slightly sweeter and have slightly more calories in case you were wondering Or analyze foods from totally different food groups  for instance what do grapes and bacon have in common Google says its getting most of its data from the US Department of Agricultures   so you can compare pretty much anything in it According to Google spokeswoman Krisztina RadosavljevicSzilagyi the company created the comparison tool after the success of its original nutrition search tool   in May  We noticed that people were doing a lot of food and nutrition searches  multistep searches on one food and another food RadosavljevicSzilagyi tells The Salt These things are often compared to one another so we thought why dont we make it easy The data arent perfect  as we discovered when we dug deep into bacon Depending on the preparation you choose the number of protein grams fluctuates pretty dramatically dropping all the way to  grams for cooked bacon Some   that cooked bacon in this case means bacon grease but its not clear Still you may still learn some surprising facts For instance when it comes to bacon vs ham bacon comes out way fattier than almost all cuts of ham Of course when we typed in bacon vs kale for fun we also got a slew of temptinglooking recipes RadosavljevicSzilagyi reminded us thats because Googles algorithm is always calculating what might be useful to you when you ask a question Thanks Google Yes I   like to make   The company   yet another food search tool at the end of February This one helps you access restaurant menus faster  so you dont have to mess with all those Flash presentations and slideshows that can make it frustrating to scan a Thai menu for your favorite duck curry on your smartphone Google says it has access to the menus of  percent of restaurants in the US And the food tools wont stop there RadosavljevicSzilagyi says There are plenty more complicated food recipe and nutrition questions to help people answer We want to give as many answers to as many complicated questions as possible
