 Changes in blood vessels in the eye might be an   researchers reported In a large prospective study retinal arteriolar narrowing at baseline was associated with an increased risk of openangle glaucoma after  years according to Paul Mitchell MD PhD of Australias University of Sydney and colleagues But reporting online in   Mitchell and colleagues cautioned that  because glaucoma takes so long to develop  it remains unclear if the changes are part of the cause of the disease or part of its normal progression But either way Mitchel said in a statement picking up vascular changes in the eye might allow clinicians to intervene earlier Our results suggest that a computerbased imaging tool designed to detect narrowing of the retinal artery caliber or diameter could effectively identify those who are most at risk for openangle glaucoma Mitchell said Early detection would allow ophthalmologists to treat patients before optic nerve damage occurs and would give us the best chance of protecting their vision he added The findings come from the prospective observational Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study which for this analysis tracked  people for a decade Over the year study period  people developed openangle glaucoma in  eyes In a multivariable analysis adjusted for such things as age sex family history of glaucoma smoking diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol narrower CRAE at baseline was associated with higher risk of incident glaucoma The association remained significant after adjustment for intraocular pressure or ocular perfusion pressure It also remained significant when the analysis was restricted to eyes thought to be at lower risk of the disease  those with a baseline intraocular pressure of less than  mm of mercury and a cuptodisc ratio of less than  Compared with eyes in the highest quartile of arteriolar caliber those in the lowest quartile had about a fold increase in the risk of glaucoma after adjustment for all the risk factors including intraocular pressure the investigators found On the other hand Mitchell and colleagues found there were no independent associations between CRVE and the risk of glaucoma They cautioned that they measured systemic and ocular risk factors only at the baseline of the study If baseline characteristics changed over time sequential measurements they noted might have provided more precise associations They also cautioned that unmeasured factors might have confounded the analysis Nonetheless they concluded the data support the concept that early vascular changes are involved in the pathogenesis of openangle glaucoma Source
