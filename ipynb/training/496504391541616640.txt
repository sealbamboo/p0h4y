A special plane transporting the second American infected with Ebola has left Liberia's capital en route to Atlanta.. An Associated Press reporter saw the four-vehicle convoy that arrived at Monrovia's airport early Tuesday. The chartered plane took off at 1:12 a.m. local time.. Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, will be treated at the same Atlanta hospital where an American doctor with Ebola already has been taken.. Writebol's son, Jeremy, said his mother "is still struggling" but that "there seems to be improvement.". The two Americans infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans. Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries.
