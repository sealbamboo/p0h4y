That was the day I had a conversation with a Boston bombing victim who after three surgeries ran her first marathon a few weeks ago  Before that I worried about Mile  which is when many runners quit In most marathon training programs you dont run farther than  miles before race day It seems natural to a WoodyAllen brain that Mile  should induce panic How are you supposed to get energy for those extra  miles which will take me at least an hour to run All of those complaints and fears seemed so childish after I emailed with Lee Ann Yanni a yearold who was standing near the finish line in Boston in April when the bombs went off Chips of wood and shrapnel the size of a halfdollar lodged themselves in her leg Her fibula broke through the skin Her eardrum popped The doctors thought she was crazy she said when she told them she was   Before the bombing she signed up for the race in honor of her dad who died of cancer in October  Injuries werent about to change her mind Im not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me    Three months after the bombing Yanni walked without crutches In September she ran for the first time since the surgeries which removed the shrapnel repaired the bone and grafted skin across the bottom part of her leg pulling the flesh from her thigh Yanni is a physical therapist in Boston so she knew what she was up against I know I wasnt ready to run and I said many times that this was the dumbest idea I had ever had she wrote to me but no one argued with me Guess they were smart A friend suggested she walk most of the marathon but Yanni insisted she would run it within the   hour limit I said NO Thats not even an option Its not an option not to FINISH My dad fought his cancer for six weeks she added and I could suck it up and do whatever it took for  or   hours of pain He was a fighter and I knew that it was in me in some form The world of running was new to me when I began this process This spring two miles stole my breath I had to do   to be able to   the marathon training program For all their quirks  the   the   the    runners all seem to harness a sense of determination you dont find in daytoday cubicle life It cant be a question of whether or not youll finish You will finish  To believe otherwise is to fail in a sense  I believe that now but only because Ive heard so many stories like Yannis Earlier this year I   the marathon she started in Boston but was cut less than a mile short by the bombing Once I hit the point where I stopped in Boston I was like No more walking Im running this she told me This race this is for Boston Im finishing  There I also met Gary Woodbridge whose wife Ronota NewberryWoodbridge was killed in the  Oklahoma City bombing He ran his first marathon in her honor She always wanted to run a marathon and I finally lost enough weight where I thought I could try he told me He struggled but he finished He had to  When Im running the marathon next week in North Carolina Im sure there will be points when Ill want to give up  but I wont Ill have too many stories with me  Ill think of how Yannis husband washed her damaged leg while she held a towel over her face and cried unable to walk and not wanting to look at the limb About how she only had run about   miles in her premarathon training She hit the wall so to speak at Mile  of her race It was like a wall or a curtain came down she said Everything got hazy She doesnt remember seeing mile markers  or   My legs started to cramp but I didnt want to stop and stretch because I was scared I wouldnt be able to get going again She did keep going of course  My advice would be just take it one step at a time she wrote We are only a select group of people that make that journey and take the time to achieve such an insane goal  Take each mile and savor it I am glad that I can inspire people she added but I just feel like a normal person who loves running and who is wicked stubborn  I was gonna cross that finish line one way or another After hearing Yannis story Im sure I will too Id also encourage you to consider signing up for a race  of any length  as part of   Hundreds already have pledged to do so  The goal is to show support for the truly brave people such as Yanni and others who are taking steps each day toward recovering from the Boston tragedy  Were running for them
