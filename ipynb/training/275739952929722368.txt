An ancient circumcision ritual is at the center of a presentday legal battle in New York     The New York City Department of Health wants to require parental consent for a controversial circumcision practice which it says can spread the herpes virus But several Jewish organizations are suing to block the new rule which they say violates their freedom of religion     Jewish law requires that all baby boys be circumcised on the eighth day of life Orthodox Jews sometimes follow with a ritual known as   Immediately after the boy is circumcised the man who performs the ritual  known as a mohel  takes a mouthful of wine Then he places his mouth around the base of the boys penis and uses suction to clean the wound  is supposed to prevent infection And when its done correctly proponents say thats exactly what it does    I did I think over  circumcisions says A Romi Cohn a mohel from the Borough Park section of Brooklyn Never had one incident where a baby got an infection Never never never Cohn is also the chairman of the American Board of Ritual Circumcision He says mohels who are properly trained and certified are not a threat to the health of the baby Our regulation is very strict about protecting human lives says Cohn If theres any slight possibility  Im not saying  percent even  percent  that that baby gonna get hurt we not allowed to perform that circumcision Most circumcisions in New York probably do not involve   Still the citys Health Department says it has linked the practice to nearly a dozen recent cases of the herpes virus in young boys Of the  cases that we have absolutely confirmed to be herpes infection that was transmitted in this way we know that two babies have died says Jay Varma the deputy commissioner for disease control Those are deaths we would have liked to have avoided    So the department is taking steps to reduce what it sees as a risky behavior We are not banning the procedure says Varma Were not regulating circumcisions Were merely mandating that people who undergo a procedure that is risky be aware of those risks before it occurs     Earlier this year the department passed a law requiring mohels to get parental consent before performing   and give parents literature that explains the citys concerns But that regulation goes too far for a group of rabbis and religious organizations who sued to block the law The plaintiffs declined to comment for this story But lawyer Avi Schick  who is not part of the case  wrote about his objections in an editorial in the   Government shouldnt be telling religious officials the message to deliver Schick says If the city has safety concerns the way to address them is not by drafting religious figures and making them their foot soldiers in its war against this practice To most observers and even to many Jews the practice may seem like an obsolete ritual thats not worth defending But the lawsuit doesnt surprise Samuel Heilman a professor of sociology at the City University of New York who studies Orthodox Jewish communities Whenever it seems that the modern world is inserting itself into matters of ritual Heilman says there are certain elements in the Jewish world that say No We will stand guard over what is genuinely appropriate in ritual and not the modern world  And those elements seem unlikely to bend to the will of City Hall Mohel Cohn may speak for many Orthodox Jews who say they will not obey the new regulation The mayor is the mayor of the city of New York says Cohn But we have a mayor hes the mayor of the universe We gonna follow his instructions For now the city law is on hold until a lower court judge can hear arguments about it next week
