For the past nine months Princeton University in New Jersey has been trying to halt an outbreak of bacterial meningitis in its students without success So its going to   students a vaccine thats not yet approved for broader use in the US Since bacterial meningitis is a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord that can cause brain damage and death having it on campus is no small matter The situation in Princeton where six students and a visiting student have fallen ill got us thinking  why do meningitis outbreaks seem to happen most often on college campuses We asked   a meningitis expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to tell us why that happens Heres the conversation edited for length and clarity Well we know that adolescents and young adults are at higher risk for meningococcal disease overall But   occurs in all age groups and it occurs in all states in the US So every day theres a case or two Most cases are sporadic they just happen individually and thats it In fact  percent of cases are sporadic But outbreaks do occur And it really has to do with sustained patterns for social interactions among college students Really close contact living in dorms are especially known to put kids at risk Its transmitted either by close contact or facetoface prolonged contact Its carried through large respiratory droplets or oral secretions So really its not casually transmitted It requires pretty close fairly intimate contact Well maybe French kissing But thats not the only way its transmitted If you live in close quarters the roommate is at very high risk to get infected We give preventative antibiotics to people who are around an infected patient But it really requires direct contact with people Youll find a little bit of information out there in some experimental studies that if you put the bacteria on surfaces a fraction of them will survive for a few hours but we dont think thats an efficient way for transmission It often ends up being an institution So a college campus elementary schools and high schools prisons Outbreaks are more likely to occur in places with lots of people in close contact When you hear about   really what youre talking about is a type of bacteria called  or meningococcus  theyre the same thing But we divide those bacteria into strains or serogroups The vaccines we recommend routinely cover four serogroups  A C W and Y Traditionally outbreaks are seogroup C  and cases tend to occur in a short period of time very quickly and closely backtoback The outbreak in Princeton involves serogroup B which isnt covered by the vaccine approved for use in the United States With the B strain there can be weeks or even months between cases So in this situation it means you have more time to mobilize and vaccinate the population But it also means its harder to know when the outbreak stops
