Finlay Ritchie was just seven weeks old when brain surgery was first mentioned to his parents Kali and Martin We felt completely numb going home on the train afterwards Kali says But Finlay had no future at that point  and neither did we On a bad day their baby boy was having around  seizures a day which were characterised by shivering and whimpering followed by shaking jerking and crying The doctors said they wanted to sever the connections between the hemispheres of his brain and shut down the left side They told us he would probably be paralysed down his righthand side  It was frightening but doing nothing was not an option because medicine alone wouldnt ever be able to control it The day after Finlay was born at Eastbourne District General doctors realised he was fitting constantly and they immediately started investigating the cause with a barrage of tests and scans Just four days later they were told he had pachygyria  a thickening of the folds in the brain which had caused the left side of his brain to develop abnormally Last Christmas just three weeks after Finlays birth at Eastbourne he was in and out of hospital If his parents couldnt sedate him at home with medication while checking his heart rate and breathing then they had no option but to call an ambulance It was a horrible frightening and emotional time for two bewildered firsttime parents But they pay tribute to the doctors and nurses who held their hands through the trauma of those early weeks and months It was when they met neurologists at the Evelina Childrens Hospital in London to discuss his case that surgery was first discussed Epilepsy surgery is no longer seen as a last resort particularly in small babies thanks to growing expertise and improving technology which means that brain surgery can cure seizures in up to  of cases If the cause of seizures can be found then neurologists now prefer to do something about it rather than leaving it Great Ormond Street Hospital in London is one of four specialist centres carrying out this type of surgery in the UK Around  procedures were performed there last year Surgeons at GOSH performed a hemispherotomy on Finlay when he was  weeks old which disconnected one half of his brain from the other half so that the seizures could not spread With the left side of the brain controlling the right side of the body the risk of paralysis on his right side was high But Sophia Varadkar consultant paediatric neurologist and clinical lead for childrens epilepsy surgery at GOSH says it was the best way of giving Finlays brain the chance to develop Small childrens brains are very clever they can adjust Probably before birth the good side of his brain had taken over so control of the right side of his body had already been taken over by right side of his brain Instead of paralysis Finlay was able to kick both legs after the operation He had lost vision on the right side of both eyes but that was all His parents are thrilled by the transformation in him which they could see clearly just days after the operation Most importantly he hasnt had a single seizure since surgery says Kali talking eight months on Hes now talking hes very chatty and curious hes holding things and trying to turn over Finlay is about six months behind developmentally because of all the seizures he had in his early life but he has regular physio and checkups to keep him on track Now aged one Finlays doctors say there is no reason why he cant learn to walk and talk and lead a very normal life Family life is returning to normal Kali has gone back to work and for the first time their son does have a future
