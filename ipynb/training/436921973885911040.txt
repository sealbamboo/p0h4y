A Pakistani exchange student in a coma since a November car accident faces possible deportation next week as his visa expires and the Minnesota hospital caring for him seeks to send him home amid mounting unpaid medical bills claims the mans family The immigration status of Shahzaib Bajwa  has gained the US State Departments attention while near his bed at Essentia HealthSt Marys Medical Center in Duluth his family wages a strained battle with the hospital to keep Bajwa at that facility off an airplane and in the United States He was in a onesemester program at the University of WisconsinSuperior before a car in which he was a passenger struck a deer They asked us to sign a consent form to take him back to Pakistan in this condition We just want whats best for my brother to stay here to be treated in the United States said the students brother Shahraiz Bajwa There is one doctor at this hospital who has put a lot of effort in sending my brother back and he must be very heartbroken that we are still here He is doing it because my brother is costing them money Bajwa said In his condition it would be a big risk It would be  hours to get there And they do not have the same medicines in Pakistan The young mans family is in the US on visitors visas His travel insurance plan was capped at  for emergency medical care Hospital spokeswoman Maureen Talarico said patientprivacy laws prevent her from addressing the familys claims and allow her to report only that Shahzaib Bajwa is in fair condition We are working collaboratively with Mr Bajwas family and caregivers along with the US and Pakistani governments to reach the best possible outcome for the patient and for his family Talarico said His family is watching both the calendar and the clock Bajwa has slowly regained the ability to open his eyes wiggle his toes and squeeze his mothers hand  although inconsistently and he remains unable to speak his brother said adding We dont know whats going on in his mind Based on a   Bajwa may be emerging from his coma While the ensuing months of bedside vigil may be many the family sees the hours dwindling before his student visa expires Feb  When we asked the hospital to convert his student visa into a medical visa first they said they would help us Then they took that offer from the table Shahraiz Bajwa said His brothers medical expenses he confirmed exceed  adding the family  visiting from Pakistan  does not have the money or medical insurance to cover to those bills Now federal agencies are examining the issue During a Feb  briefing State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was asked if the agency had decided not to extend Bajwas student visa while he remains in a coma No thats not true Harf said  The State Department is continuing to work with the hospital with the student program sponsors He is in the United States on a State Departmentsponsored J student exchange program   Its not accurate to say that the State Department isnt extending the visa Thats just not how the process works right So were working with his family as they decide on treatment options and well help them maintain flexibility in terms of his status Harf said Minneapolisbased immigration attorney Saiko McIvor working on behalf of the Bajwa family said the State Department seems not to favor extending Bajwas student visa Shes in talks with the local branch of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services  part of the US Department of Homeland Security We are working to get things resolved so that he would stay in legal status in the United States beyond Feb  But trying to get a J extended may be very difficult because that would require US State Departments cooperation and I dont think they might be willing to do that McIvor said The case has cast a fresh light on medical repatriations According to   released by two advocacy groups some US hospitals unlawfully discharge ill immigrants  most of them undocumented some comatose and many deported without State Department knowledge The researchers said they tracked more than  cases spanning the previous six years in which immigrant patients who could not pay their hospital bills were returned often without consent to their nations of origin The defacto deportations included one patient spirited through a hospitals garbagedisposal doors and another flown to a foreign airport and abandoned on the tarmac said the report which urged Congressional hearings US hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care to patients regardless of immigration status but this obligation terminates once the patient is stabilized researchers wrote And stabilized is a term of art  they can still be in critical condition But at that point they dont have to continue to treat them said Lori A Nessel director of the Center for Social Justice at Seton Hall University School of Law a study coauthor No government agency provides oversight Nessel said Its an unregulated black hole People are being forced to go back to their native countries where theyre not going to get the kind of care they need  which could deprive them of their life
