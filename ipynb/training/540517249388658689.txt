Public restrooms arent any dirtier than the rest of our environment researchers report To reach this conclusion scientists first decontaminated two mens and two womens restrooms then let people come and go They tracked the accumulation of bacteria and viruses on toilet seats floors and soap dispensers checking periodically to determine which germs were present and in what quantities  They then closed the restrooms to see what happened Over time they   fecal species did not flourish in the dry aerobic environment of a public restroom After the rooms were closed for a few hours fecal species represented at most  percent of the germs suggesting they die relatively quickly Most of the microbes they found were either skinassociated including Staphylococcus aureus a common cause of skin infections or microbes associated with soil and plants probably tracked in There were no differences by sex except that vaginal organisms were found on womens toilet seats  Whatever is on the surface of public restrooms comes from humans said the lead author Sean M Gibbons a graduate student at the University of Chicago Most of the things on us and in us are not only benign but necessary for our health So these surfaces are occupied predominantly by our friends
