In an effort to combat stigma that has arisen around a treatment that prevents HIV a San Francisco elected official announced publicly Wednesday that he is taking the medicine City Supervisor Scott Wiener said he is taking Truvada a drug that dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection He appears to be the first public official to make such an announcement Wiener wrote about his experience for The Huffington Post In an interview at Wieners office in San Franciscos City Hall he said My hope is that by disclosing my PrEP use publicly that I can help move the conversation forward and get more people thinking about PrEP as a possibility and encouraging people to consult with their medical provider Truvada combines two different drugs into a single pill that when taken daily can reduce the risk of HIV infection by more than  percent It was approved by the FDA in  Both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend its use by   Still it is the subject of debate especially within the gay community Wiener  was first elected to the Board of Supervisors in  He says he started coming out as a gay man in  at what he called the height of the AIDS epidemic Coming out in that environment was challenging and stressful he said Immediately associating sex with illness and death was very stressful and many many people I think had that same experience He spoke of friends who recently started taking the pill to prevent infection and who told him that their general anxiety level around intimacy has gone down significantly Wiener said only a few people knew that he was taking Truvada James Loduca vice president of philanthropy for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation called Wieners disclosure incredibly courageous We need more people like Supervisor Wiener Loduca said In my own personal network many of my HIVnegative gay male friends are on PrEP None of them talk about it publicly and that is a reflection of the enormous stigma and shame that we still have around sex around a desire to have intimacy  Its an important watershed moment for our community that someone so visible steps forward and says PrEP is helping me  Wiener spoke openly of people availing themselves of all options to prevent acquiring the virus including the use of condoms and being tested regularly If someone becomes infected with HIV identifying the infection sooner yields more immediate treatment which has positive longterm health outcomes Wieners announcement comes on the eve of a rally to be held Thursday coordinated by San Francisco Supervisor David Campos Campos is calling for the city to make PrEP available to San Franciscans regardless of income New York Gov Andrew Cuomo has made a   for his state Nationally there have been  new HIV infections every year for the past  years PrEP is the first new tool in our fight to protect ourselves from HIV since the epidemic began Campos said in a release Wiener backs the effort In order for PrEP to be successful we have to do three things he said We need to raise awareness about it make sure people know about it  We need to secondly remove the stigma around it so people are able to talk about it are able to consider it and finally we need to expand access But that kind of communitywide campaign is exactly the wrong idea some advocates say To deploy PrEP as a communitywide preventive is a public health disaster in the making said Ged Kenslea spokesman for AIDS Healthcare Foundation a global advocacy group He stressed that the organization is not opposed to the use of PrEP on a casebycase basis The crucial problem is adherence to the medication he said He also pointed out that condoms are effective at protecting against not only HIV infection but also other sexually transmitted diseases for which PrEP does nothing Kenslea said hes worried that people seem to be throwing condoms out the window Dr Robert Grant with the UCSF Gladstone Institute   that ultimately showed Truvadas effectiveness as a preventive agent against HIV and has followed it since He said theres   between PrEP and increasing highrisk sexual behavior He also supports efforts to make PrEP available more widely and compared having a variety of tools to fight HIV with having a variety of methods of birth control available Just like contraception he said were happy to have people using different methods  same way with HIV We have to have lots of different methods for people to use so people can find one thats attractive to them Grant said that in his research we have not seen anyone become infected who has taken PrEP daily or nearly daily When taken to prevent HIV infection Truvada  that include headache abdominal pain and weight loss Potentially serious side effects include kidney problems liver damage and a buildup of lactic acid in the blood
