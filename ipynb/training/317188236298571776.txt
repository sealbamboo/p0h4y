Last year a new drug called Zaltrap was approved as a kind of lastchance therapy for patients with colorectal cancer Studies suggested Zaltrap worked almost exactly as well as an existing drug called Avastin In fact the main difference between the two drugs seemed to be the price I was rather stunned Dr Leonard Saltz who specializes in colorectal cancer told me Zaltrap costs about  per month  about twice as much as Avastin Saltz said Saltz and his colleagues at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York made what seemed like a very reasonable decision The hospital would not stock the more expensive drug But taking cost into account for a new cancer drug was a very unusual decision for the hospital There was a lot of angst over it simply because it had never been done before at SloanKettering Saltz says It was such a big deal that he and a few of his colleagues decided to write an oped about their decision in the   The oped ran under the headline   Peter Bach one of the doctors who coauthored the oped braced for the reaction I admit to clutching my chair as it went up he says But you know the response was really uniformly positive After the oped ran Sanofi the company that comarkets the drug started offering hospitals a discount of  percent on Zaltrap The company wouldnt comment for this story Bach has taken speaking fees from the company that makes Avastin Saltz has been paid consulting fees from both drug companies So why doesnt this sort of thing happen more often Why is a highprofile hospital choosing not to buy an expensive new drug so rare that it merits an oped in the   Its partly because we dont know how a lot of drugs compare to other drugs The headtohead studies just havent been done That is starting to change though as federal funding for comparative studies increases More headtohead studies will raise a new question What do you do with comparative information when you have it The Zaltrap case was a bit of a fluke Two drugs seemed to worked equally well Both extended life by  months But what if Zaltrap had worked slightly better than Avastin What if it had extended life by say an extra week Would SloanKettering have stocked the drug then in spite of the price Absolutely Bach says We are a premier cancer center in the country  maybe the world  and drugs that provide additional benefit are ones we want to understand and want to be able to use
