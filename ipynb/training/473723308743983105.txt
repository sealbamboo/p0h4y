Small shops and grocers near Scottish schools are to be encouraged to offer healthier food choices for children It forms part of a new initiative aims to get children to eat more healthily in school across Scotland Research suggests more than half of secondary pupils buy lunch outside school at least once a week  Schools will also be given advice on how to encourage children to stay on site as part of the Beyond the School Gates scheme  Shops and convenience stores will be given tips on increasing the sales of nonjunk food  Councils will even be told how to use licensing and planning rules to encourage healthier options near schools  The Beyond The School Gate initiative has the backing of the local authority organisation Cosla and the Scottish Grocers Federation Public Health Minister Michael Matheson will officially launch the scheme in Glasgow He said We have made excellent progress in improving the standard and nutrition of school meals in Scotland  However the evidence shows that many children are simply not staying to eat these meals We are fighting a battle against obesity in Scotland and we know that if children eat unhealthily in their teenage years its a habit that can be hard to break This initiative looks at how we can encourage children to choose healthier options both inside and outside school He added This government has already made a major commitment to childrens diets by extending free school meals to primary  to  children from January  and launched new guidance on school food earlier this year Through Beyond the School Gates we aim to enable children to continue that healthy eating into their teenage years
