There has been a sharp rise in the number of people having CT scans in the UK according to experts assessing the risks of radiation on health The number of scans on children  who are most at risk   doubled over the past decade to  a year in  Concerns centre around evidence radiation can increase the chance of developing cancer But the governmentappointed Comare group said the benefits of scans usually outweigh the harms During a CT computerised tomography scan an Xray tube rotates around the patients body to produce detailed images of internal organs and other parts of the body  The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment Comare estimated that the number of scans carried out each year reached a record of five million in   Figures were based on data gathered from a third of UK hospitals  but experts warned without more information they could not accurately assess how many cases of cancer this radiation may be linked to  They urged the government to make it mandatory for hospitals to report the number of scans and the doses of radiation they use  Prof Alex Elliott who led the committee said At the moment these surveys happen almost on an adhoc basis and that means we dont have decent data on which to carry out the epidemiological studies We need to know what the dose to the people was otherwise we cant work out what the risk might be Though the group felt the majority of CTs were justified they warned clinicians need to be aware of certain groups who are more susceptible to the harms of radiation  Children are at more risk as they have a longer lifespan during which they can accumulate more exposure to radiation  A    suggested multiple CT scans over  in childhood could triple the risks of developing brain cancer or leukaemia  And women who carry the BRAC and BRAC gene mutations are also more sensitive to radiation according to the report The team emphasised doctors need to minimise risks by ensuring they use scans that answer clinical questions  not necessarily ones producing the most detailed images  They estimate  of the radiation people are exposed to in the UK comes from nonnatural sources And some  of this comes from medical interventions  They said the UK holds one of the best records in the world  The Royal College of Radiologists said Radiologists are more aware than most of the remarkable growth in the use of CT over the past decade  This has undoubtedly brought benefit to patients but carries attendant risks from the radiation dose involved  Clinical radiologists have always accepted their responsibilities in the area of radiation safety
