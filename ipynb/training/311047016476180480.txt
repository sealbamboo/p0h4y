Ever since she was a small child Samantha Grimaldo has had to carry her voice with her Grimaldo was born with a rare disorder Perisylvian syndrome which means that though shes physically capable in many ways shes never been able to speak Instead shes used a device to speak She types in what she wants to say and the device says those words out loud Her mother Ruane Grimaldo says that when Samantha was very young the voice she used came in a heavy gray box She used to have to carry this device around that was at least  or  pounds Ruane says and she was only like  pounds herself The poor thing had to carry this back and forth to school every day on the bus It was miserable having to lug her voice around that way  a clunky box sitting on the seat next to her Today fortunately Samanthas voice takes up much less space She types into a special program on an iPhone or iPad and a synthesized voice in the program says the words aloud The voice one of several types on the market is called Heather Thats a nice enough name  easygoing and accessible  but Grimaldo doesnt like to use the voice if she can help it Her mother has noticed that when the family goes out to restaurants Samantha prefers to write out her menu choices Apparently as she explains to her mother this is because Samantha has some reservations about the voice itself  the cold metal sound of it Because its weird Samantha says of the mechanical voice  speaking in the voice itself Its not just that the voice is artificial and disjointed It sounds Samantha says older Samantha is only  and the sound of the voice  deep methodical mature  doesnt exactly align with her sense of herself Like any teenager she feels selfconscious about it I dont want people to hear she says If you dont have a voice who speaks for you Today there are more than  different options for people who need to use synthetic voices to communicate but for the majority of people who use them there is a single answer to that question Perfect Paul  a speech scientist at Northeastern University estimates that between  and  percent of the people who use synthetic voices use the same one  the Perfect Paul voice If you have ever heard Stephen Hawking speak or listened to the weather radio you have heard the voice of Perfect Paul Perfect Paul is used so widely because some studies have shown that his voice is easiest to understand in a variety of situations including classrooms and public outdoor spaces Still some in the community of people who rely on synthetic voices have found the Perfect Paul version frustrating  not because its a bad voice but because its limiting In fact it was through confronting the clear limits of Perfect Paul that speech scientist Patel came to the conclusion that people like Samantha Grimaldo needed new options It happened around  years ago when Patel was at a conference for the makers and users of synthetic voices I was watching a demonstration of a new technology and someone came up and said something in their synthesized voice and then someone else came up Patel says Both spoke in the same voice  Perfect Pauls Then a third person arrived and another It was the same voice saying different things says Patel And sometimes they were saying the same phrase but off by a few seconds  so it felt like it was this echo going on It was just a strange thing Standing there in the middle of all these radically different people with the exact same voice Patel had an idea Isnt there something we can do to make these voices more individuated So around seven years ago Patel started working to change synthetic voices When a person speaks two things are happening First the source of speech comes from the voice box which vibrates to produce sound Then the mouth shapes those sounds into speech In many people who have speech disorders its mainly the second part of the system that doesnt work In people with speech disorders the source is pretty preserved Patel says I thought Thats where the melody is  thats where someones identity is in terms of their vocal identity  So Patel decided to capture the melody of a voice She primarily works with kids and so she asked kids with speech disorders who can still make some sounds to come into her lab and do something really simple We just need them to say a sustained sound like   she says Patel can take that sound run it through a computer and find out all kinds of things about how that person would sound if that person could speak words We can determine their pitch the loudness the breathiness of their voice the changes in clarity she says She then takes a recording of the voice of what she calls a healthy donor  for example the voice of a child who is roughly the same age as the child shes trying to help  and gets them to say a large number of words So she ends up with samples of the sounds they produce when they talk She then combines that voice with the pitch breathiness and other characteristics of the child with the voice disorder Patel played me examples of two different voices shes created If you listen you can clearly hear different pitch and clarity in the different voices These voices Patel can make are unique for each individual Which brings us back to Samantha Grimaldo When Patel was getting started Samantha was one of the first kids with a voice disorder who came to her lab to give a voice sample At the time Patel wasnt at the stage where she was actually constructing voices But shes since figured it out and recently she created a new voice using Samanthas   sample Last week she gave the personalized voice to Ruane and Samantha so they could hear it The voice was constructed from a sample taken when Samantha was much younger For a current version of Samanthas voice youd need to take a new sample Still it was the first time that Samantha and her mother had heard anything close to Samanthas voice Ruane had listened earlier in the day when Samantha was still at school and was clearly deeply moved by the experience It made her realize in a fresh way she says how difficult it had been for her to never hear her daughters voice When I heard it I thought Yeah This could be it  Ruane says through tears To her ear the voice had a sweetly familiar quality My son  my son Nicholas  I could hear some of his voice in it she says And so when Samantha got home from school that afternoon they sat down together to listen Samanthas young voice it turns out is clear and light Ruane told me that when Samantha heard the voice her eyes lit up and a smile broke out on her face Both thought that the voice sounded happy Personalized voices like these arent yet available to everyone Patel has figured out how to do it but not how to make it work on all of the different electronic devices that people use to play a synthetic voice But Ruane Grimaldo hopes that voices like these will be available one day very soon You need a voice she says You need a voice
