 A leading obgyn group is recommending that   with three or more fetuses be counseled by their doctors and told about the option of reducing the number of fetuses they are carrying Known as multifetal pregnancies these are typically the result of fertility treatments and are associated with a much higher risk of complications as well as premature delivery and developmental issues for the children according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG The issue first gained notoriety in  when Nadya Suleman dubbed the Octomom by the press gave birth to octuplets after her fertility doctor implanted  embryos into her uterus The American Society for Reproductive Medicine generally recommends implanting no more than two embryos in women under  Suleman was  Sulemans fertility doctor lost his medical license in  for this and other cases of negligent medical treatment In its new guidelines the ACOG also pointed out the potential social and economic hardships of having multiples along with increased parenting   lower quality of life depression and possible child abuse the group noted Health care costs for twins and triplets are four and  times higher than for single births respectively The recommendations also emphasize the importance of preventing multifetal pregnancies Prevention of multifetal pregnancy is preferred said Dr Monique Spillman chairwoman of the ACOGs ethics committee which wrote the new recommendations Fertility treatments are usually the reason for multifetal pregnancies although women with multiple fetuses should receive information on pregnancy reduction whether they got pregnant through natural conception or with fertility treatments Spillman said Treatments that increase womens chances of getting pregnant with multiples include in vitro fertilization IVF in which fertilized eggs are placed into a womans uterus and use of a medication called clomiphene brand names Clomid and Serophene that stimulates the ovaries to release eggs I think many   are quite good at discussing risks with women said Dr Lori Day a maternalfetal medicine specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved in writing the new recommendations I dont know if women hear as much about risk with pill medications Among the pregnancies resulting from IVF in   percent were twins The rate of triplets and higher multiples from IVF has dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  thanks to advances that help clinicians select viable embryos more precisely and thus reduce the number of implanted embryos according to the ACOG report In cases where women are already pregnant with triplets or higher multiples we are obligated to give the woman as much information as she needs or wants and it is her decision whether she reduces or carries the pregnancy Spillman said Multifetal pregnancy reduction is a type of selective abortion in the first trimester or early second trimester to reduce the number of fetuses in most cases to two Reduction is distinct from abortions that are done to end a pregnancy altogether and in some cases can improve the likelihood that the other fetuses will survive Day noted The new recommendations which were published in the February issue of the journal   echo the ACOGs  recommendations but they include more data on the risks of multifetal pregnancy Still the decision to carry through with a multifetal pregnancy is ultimately up to the mother the experts said These recommendations make it more clear that the womans autonomy is what guides the decision process Spillman noted Multifetal pregnancies put women at higher risk of complications during pregnancy such as diabetes and preeclampsia a condition that involves high blood pressure and can be deadly The rates of   and preeclampsia go from  percent and  percent of singlefetus pregnancies respectively to  percent and between  percent and  percent of triplet pregnancies Women with multifetal pregnancies have that much more change in their physiology and that puts them at significantly higher risk Day explained Babies from multifetal pregnancies also face many health risks primarily being born premature and the complications related to prematurity including learning disabilities behavioral problems and cerebral palsy Babies that are born premature at  or  weeks in gestation have about a  percent chance of having a major cognitive or motor impairment said Dr Marilee Allen a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore When we counsel women on multifetal pregnancy reduction we talk about reduction in the likelihood of risk to the babies and risks to themselves and the likelihood that all of the fetuses would even make it to an age in the pregnancy when they could survive outside the mom Day said Although the ACOG does not give specific advice about what doctors should tell women about multifetal pregnancy concerns and the option of pregnancy reduction it does recommend that women talk with a team including social workers obstetricians and neonatologists who specialize in newborn medicine to get a wellrounded view of their pregnancy My heart goes out to the families facing the question of reduction Allen said Looking at it from before the pregnancy takes place is really the time to be having those conversations with families because then its not really so much an ethical consideration as it is a more practical decision If a woman decides to reduce her pregnancy she may also face limited resources and have to travel to an area where she may feel less comfortable and learn whether her insurance company will cover the procedure Day added
