Most American Jews are Ashkenazi meaning their families originated in Eastern and Central Europe and they may be wondering if they should seek genetic testing  Here are answers to some questions about genetic testing for the three common harmful mutations in the BRCA and BRCA genes Im an Ashkenazi Jewish woman Should I be tested for the mutations in the BRCA and BRCA genes If you have been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer or have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer you may want to be tested for one of the mutations in the BRCA and BRCA genes that are common among Ashkenazi Jews Knowing your carrier status may help you evaluate your future risk and can be useful information for other family members If you have cancer the information can help shape treatment and alert you to other risks such as a heightened risk for ovarian cancer if you have breast cancer While some Israeli doctors want to expand testing and make it routine general practice in the United States has not encouraged genetic testing for individuals who are cancerfree and dont have a family history But for Ashkenazi Jews the bar for genetic testing is not as high as for the general population said   executive director of the Basser Research Center for BRCA at the University of Pennsylvanias Abramson Cancer Center If youre Jewish we have a low threshold for testing Dr Domchek said If you have an aunt who had breast cancer at  and you want testing thats OK  Keep in mind that the odds of testing positive are fairly low  only one in  Ashkenazi Jews or  percent carry the mutation That is higher than the rate in the general population in which fewer than  percent carry these mutations but it means you have a  percent chance of testing negative  Remember that a family history includes relatives on both sides of the family including your fathers side People ignore the fathers side of the family and they shouldnt said Dr Domchek Women will come to us and say theres no family history but actually the dad was Ashkenazi Jewish and the dads mother had breast cancer at   thats a significant family history What if I dont know much about my family history Many Ashkenazi Jews have limited information about their family because they lost relatives in the Holocaust Others come from small families that dont provide a lot of clues and families everywhere become estranged and keep secrets One reason Israeli doctors want to do broadbased screening of Ashkenazi Jewish women is so that individuals are not dependent on family members for information Nevertheless Dr Domchek emphasized that there is still some uncertainty about what it means if a woman tests positive for a mutation and no one in her family has had cancer Research is trying to resolve questions about what the risk is in these cases Its a challenge to give an individualized risk assessment she said If you are concerned because you have limited information about your family genetic counseling may help clarify whether you should pursue testing What does the test consist of How much does it cost Will insurance cover it The genetic test is a blood test often accompanied by genetic counseling Testing for the three specific BRCA and BRCA mutations common among Ashkenazi Jews generally costs between  and  for all three Insurance coverage varies and may be more likely to pick up the cost if the individual has a clear family history of breast or ovarian cancer Genetic testing of men who do not have cancer is generally not covered Dr Domchek said What does a positive result mean A woman who tests positive for a mutation will be given a range of risk for developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer during her lifetime that takes her family history into account but assessing individual risk is a challenge Dr Domchek said If the only history is a mother who developed breast cancer at  and the mother has four sisters and no one else has cancer of any sort then the womans risk will be deemed lower than if several of her aunts have cancer she explained While about  percent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives  percent to  percent of women with a harmful BRCA mutation and around  percent of those with a harmful BRCA mutation will develop breast cancer by age    While about  percent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer some  percent of carriers of a harmful BRCA mutation and  percent to  percent of carriers of a harmful BRCA mutation will develop ovarian cancer by age  What factors should I weigh when considering prophylactic surgery Choosing prophylactic surgery is a difficult and highly personal decision Many doctors emphasize the importance of removing the ovaries because the mutations increase the risk of ovarian cancer which is harder than breast cancer to detect at an early stage Israeli physicians urge women to undergo ovary removal as soon as they have had their children preferably by the age of  Removing the ovaries also reduces the risk of breast cancer considerably The choice of whether to have a prophylactic double mastectomy is complex Close monitoring and surveillance of the breasts with frequent magnetic resonance imaging scans and clinical breast exams is another option doctors say Over time however doctors say many women tire of the constant checkups especially if they are called back for frequent biopsies and some eventually opt for mastectomies as a result Both oophorectomy and mastectomy are difficult operations that have serious side effects Breast reconstruction often leads to infections and other complications and many women are disappointed by the look and feel of their new breasts Removing the ovaries robs women of important hormones and plunges them into menopause overnight leading to hot flashes reduced sex drive and heightened risks of heart disease and bone loss Hormone replacement treatment or other medication is often required In  my sister and I of Ashkenazi descent were tested for the BRCA and  mutations and told we didnt have them My mother aunt cousin all had breast cancer In  I had breast cancer and a lumpectomy Was the genetic testing the same then as now Should we be retested You and your sister were probably only tested for the three mutations common among Ashkenazi Jews also called founder mutations There are other mutations in these genes and you may want to discuss with your physician the option of more extensive  and more expensive  genetic testing More testing may not yield much additional information however since less is known about many of the other mutations and you are probably already being closely monitored because you have a history of breast cancer Your sister should also be closely monitored because of your history Do you have additional questions about breast cancer Submit your question to
