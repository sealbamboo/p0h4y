The Obama administration said there will be no further extensions of the federal health-insurance program for people with pre-existing health conditions, and it will close Wednesday, April 30.. Officials had previously extended the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan several times amid concerns that thousands of people had not found new coverage. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that less than 5,000 people are still enrolled in the plan, and many of them are believed to have obtained new coverage that will take effect May 1.
