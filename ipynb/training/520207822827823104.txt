Id like to review some data with you my patient said to me as I sat down catercorner from him at the small desk in the exam room  He was a professor of statistics who had recently retired from a local university and had been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome a few weeks ago As this cancer affects the bone marrow blood counts are frequently low and can worsen with chemotherapy which we had started a month earlier He opened a green Pendaflex folder to take out some papers and shoved them over to me The first graph shows my platelet counts over the past six weeks The next graphs in yellow red and blue show my platelets before during and after treatment  I looked down at the scatter plots of lab values and the regression line drawn through the dots each one representing his platelet level on a particular date He had done the same with his hemoglobin total white blood cell counts and neutrophils Im not seeing a clear pattern he continued so Id like you to interpret these  Wow this is a lot of work I joked You must be good at your job He smiled just a bit acknowledging my attempt at levity but wanted to keep the conversation serious Tell me what were you trying to learn from your analyses I asked  He shifted in his chair and leaned back as he thought this over Bone marrow cancers lend themselves to a religion of numbers And if thats the case I suppose I am a sort of shaman who tries to interpret the holy text of lab reports People are first diagnosed with these cancers because we tell them their blood tests show levels that are too low or too high We administer medicines that make those values even more abnormal promising that good will come from such suffering  Is it any wonder our patients can become as obsessed with numbers as we do This was not the first professor of statistics I have had as a patient either The other professor was hospitalized with leukemia and awaited the improvement of his neutrophils which would allow us to safely discharge him I advised him to dream of neutrophils to accelerate their recovery  half jokingly and half to encourage guided imagery as Ill take any help I can for my patients to heal  I came up with a better plan he told me one morning For every mile I walk in the hallways here I will recover  neutrophils  I laughed though wasnt completely sure he was joking so asked how he would calculate that he had walked a mile He looked up at the hospitals drop ceiling Each one of those ceiling tile panels is two feet long I counted off  of them as I made my laps I stared at him incredulous By the time he left the hospital he had walked  miles We cling to numbers because theres so little we really can control in cancer For those of us who make our living working with numbers there is also a comfort in their reliability their solidity and maybe a hope that if we can understand them even if just a little we can influence the diseases outcome I wanted to see if the regression lines are indicating at least a statistical trend towards a recovery of my counts my professor patient said to me leaning forward now and crinkling his forehead in frustration But the numbers just dont support it I reassured him that it was still too early to expect a response to the chemotherapy and that we might not see one for months I also promised that I would let him know when I saw the first sign of improvement
