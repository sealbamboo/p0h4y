We may think of ourselves as just human but were really a mass of microorganisms housed in a human shell Every person alive is   They outnumber human cells  to one and account for  percent of the unique genes in the body Katrina Ray a senior editor of Nature Reviews recently suggested that the vast number of microbes in the gut could be considered a human microbial organ and asked   Our collection of microbiota known as the microbiome is the human equivalent of an environmental ecosystem Although the bacteria together weigh a mere three pounds their composition determines much about how the body functions and alas sometimes malfunctions Like ecosystems the world over the human microbiome is losing its diversity to the potential detriment of the health of those it inhabits Dr Martin J Blaser a specialist in infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the   has studied the role of bacteria in disease for more than three decades His research extends well beyond infectious diseases to  autoimmune conditions and other ailments that have been increasing sharply worldwide In his new book   Dr Blaser links the declining variety within the microbiome to our increased susceptibility to serious often chronic conditions  from allergies and celiac disease to Type  diabetes and obesity He and others primarily blame antibiotics for the connection The damaging effect of antibiotics on microbial diversity starts early Dr Blaser said The average American child is given nearly three courses of antibiotics in the first two years of life and eight more  during the next eight years Even a short course of antibiotics like the widely prescribed  Zpack azithromycin taken for five days can result in longterm shifts in the bodys microbial environment But antibiotics are not the only way the balance within us can be disrupted Cesarean deliveries which  have soared  in recent decades encourage the growth of microbes from the mothers skin instead of from the birth canal in the babys gut Dr Blaser said in an interview This change in microbiota can reshape an infants metabolism and immune system A recent review of  studies involving  births found that compared with  babies delivered vaginally those born by cesarean section   and  percent more likely to be obese as adults The placenta   researchers have discovered which may also contribute to the infants gut health and help mitigate the microbial losses caused by cesarean sections Other studies have found major differences in the microorganisms living in the guts of normalweight and obese individuals Although such studies cannot tell which came first  the weight problem or the changed microbiota  studies indicate obese mice have gut bacteria that are better able   Further evidence of a link to obesity comes from farm animals   sold in the United States are used  in  livestock These  antibiotics change the animals microbiota hastening their growth When mice are given the same  antibiotics used on livestock the metabolism of their liver changes stimulating an increase in body fat Dr Blaser said Even more serious is  the increasing number of serious disorders now linked to a distortion in the microbial balance in the human gut They include   gastrointestinal ailments like Crohns disease ulcerative colitis and celiac disease cardiovascular disease nonalcoholic fatty liver disease digestive disorders like chronic reflux autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis and asthma and allergies Some researchers have even speculated that    play a role in celiac disease and the resulting explosion in demand for glutenfree foods even among people without this disease In a mouse model of Type  diabetes treating the animals with antibiotics accelerates the development of the disease Dr Blaser said He and other researchers including a team from Switzerland and Germany have also linked  the serious rise in asthma rates to the rapid disappearance of Helicobacter pylori a bacterial pathogen that persistently colonizes the human stomach from Western societies Once virtually everyone harbored this microbe which European researchers have shown  H pylori colonization in early life encourages  production of regulatory Tcells in the blood which Dr Blaser said are needed to tamp down allergic responses Although certain strains of H pylori are linked to the development of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer other strains are protective his studies indicate Research by Dr Blaser and his colleagues further suggests that H pylori in the stomach     and esophageal cancer Still it is not always possible for researchers to tell whether disruptions in gut microbiota occur before or after people become ill However studies in laboratory animals often suggest the bacterial disturbances come first Dr Blaser among many others cautions against the overuse of antibiotics especially the broadspectrum drugs now commonly prescribed He emphasized in particular the importance of using fewer antibiotics in  children In Sweden antibiotic use is  percent of ours at any age with no increase in disease he said We need to educate physicians and parents that antibiotics have costs We need improved diagnostics Is the infection caused by a virus or bacteria and if bacteria which one Then we need narrowspectrum antibiotics designed to knock out the pathogenic bacteria without disrupting the healthpromoting ones Dr Blaser added This will make it possible to treat serious infections with less collateral effect
