A   published online recently in the journal   documented slightly elevated levels of arsenic in samples of chicken purchased at grocery stores in  cities in the US So how did trace amounts of this toxin end up in supermarket poultry Well arsenicbased drugs are approved for use in chicken and turkey production At the time of the grocerystore testing back in late  and early  a drug called Roxarsone was still being used in chicken feed to stave off infections with parasites The drug was voluntarily   in June  by its manufacturer We did the study to learn whether using arsenicbased drugs leads to increases in the toxic form of arsenic in meat explains researcher   of Johns Hopkins And it turns out it does A little The researchers documented  ppb  thats parts per billion  of inorganic arsenic the more toxic type of arsenic in the meat of chicken that had measurable levels of Roxarsone By comparison the meat from chicken that had no detectable levels of Roxarsone had  ppb of inorganic arsenic Thats three times less But its important to point out that these low levels are far below the  ppb  set by the FDA The researchers found no measurable trace of the arsenicbased drug in the  organic samples they tested Roxarsone is not allow in organic chicken By comparison  of the  samples of meat from chickens raised conventionally did contain the drug The National Chicken Council released a   calling the studys conclusions misleading Broiler chicken producers the council says are no longer using any arsenicbased drugs In lieu of Roxarsone which had been used to prevent intestinal parasites chicken producers have switched to drugs known as ionophores Today folks chicken producers are just doing the best they can without Roxarsone says Tom Super of the National Chicken Council He says the ionophores are not as effective against the parasites The FDA in   says another arsenicbased drug known as Nitarsone is still being marketed Its approved for use in chickens and turkeys Though the FDA does not disclose animal drug sales data the drug is used to prevent outbreaks of   an infection caused by parasites in turkeys The National Turkey Federation says Nitarsone is used primarily in the turkeys first few weeks of life and used more heavily during the summer months when blackhead is more likely to occur The industry depends on the drug as a preventive since theres no effective treatment once an outbreak occurs The authors of the new study say they hope the FDA considers their conclusions in making decisions about the approvals for these drugs Roxarsone still continues to be sold by drug company Zoetis in Latin America and is still approved for use here Johns Hopkins Nachman says despite the fact that it was voluntarily pulled from the market in  The FDA says it continues to investigate all uses of arsenicbased drugs in foodproducing animals and agency spokesperson Jalil Isa says the agency will take the appropriate action to protect public health
