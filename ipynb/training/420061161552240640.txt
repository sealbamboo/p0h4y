Karin Satrom a yearold Brooklynite had been feeling fine through  weeks of   when one night she said she became very very dizzy as if I were drunk Her husband suggested that she lie down but even with her eyes closed the room continued to spin Still extremely dizzy and seeing double in the morning Ms Satrom called her doctor who sent her directly to New York Methodist Hospital No pregnancyrelated reason for her symptoms was found but a neurologist suspected a tear in an artery in her neck that supplies blood to the back of the brain An   confirmed the diagnosis   and showed that the   or mini  she had experienced as a result had left no lasting brain damage Ms Satrom was immediately given an injection of Lovenox an anticoagulant that she must continue to inject twice a day until the baby is born sometime in March Then a second scan will be done to see if the artery has healed Now six weeks later Ms Satrom has religiously followed her doctors orders to do nothing that involves turning my head  no swimming no driving and has remained symptomfree  a neurosurgeon at CedarsSinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and an expert on vertebral artery dissection said Ms Satrom was lucky to have seen astute physicians who zeroed in on the cause of her distress before it resulted in a fullblown stroke Not everyone is as fortunate A dissection is not a hole in an artery which would cause extensive bleeding Rather a tear occurs in one of the inner layers of the vessel which results in a pooling of blood in the wall that partly or completely closes the flow of blood to the brain Rarely a dissection can result in a bulge  an    on the outer wall of the vessel that may or may not be painful Although vertebral artery dissection is one of the most common causes of stroke in young adults it may produce no noticeable symptoms at first And when they do occur they are often nonspecific like   or   Symptoms may be ignored until it is too late or   Ms Satroms   in a review of  studies involving  patients by Dr Rebecca F Gottesman a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and coauthors   afflicted  percent of those in the studies headache usually in the back of the head  percent and neck pain  percent But nearly onequarter of patients had no head or neck pain at the time of diagnosis  headache and neck pain are extremely common and most often not related to a vertebral artery dissection But when such a symptom occurs suddenly and seems out of the ordinary emergency medical attention should be sought without delay Dr Gottesman said in an interview A prompt diagnosis is vital she and her coauthors wrote because the greatest risk of a stroke occurs in the first few weeks after an artery tears Some tears  the percentage is unknown  never cause symptoms however and heal on their own without treatment Dr Gottesman said A vertebral artery dissection can result from a sports injury or a car accident Minor traumas including a forceful cough or sneeze   extreme extension of the neck as might happen in a beauty parlor when painting a ceiling or practicing yoga or during chiropractic manipulation have been reported to cause dissections The role of chiropractic manipulation is disputed because people may seek chiropractic treatment for neck pain that is unknowingly the symptom of an existing dissection not its cause If a neck pain comes on suddenly for no good reason or seems in any way unusual people should think twice before going to a chiropractor Dr Gottesman said Fewer than half the patients in Dr Gottesmans study reported a recognizable trauma that could have caused the tear and less than  percent had a connective tissue disease like   or   syndrome that increases the risk of a dissection Other risk factors include   fibromuscular disease causing abnormal cell growth in artery walls   pregnancy which loosens connective tissue throughout the body and a recent respiratory tract infection The severity depends on whether the dissection occurs before or after the affected artery enters the skull The latter causes a hemorrhage between the brain and skull in more than half of cases and has a much poorer prognosis An MRI usually done using a contrast agent that highlights the arterial structures is now the gold standard for diagnosing a vertebral artery dissection The main risk of a dissection is the formation of a clot or series of clots that can travel to the brain and cause a stroke A   is a warning sign of a possible stroke and should always be taken seriously Treatment with an anticoagulant most often   also known by the brand name Coumadin for several months or longer is needed to head off formation of a braindamaging clot There has been no controlled clinical trial to justify this approach but experts attest to its logic Ms Satrom was given Lovenox because it is much safer than warfarin during pregnancy Although most dissections heal on their own further intervention is occasionally needed as when strokerelated symptoms persist after six months of anticoagulation The damaged artery may then be treated by inserting a   or coil If a dissected artery becomes completely blocked and continues to cause symptoms despite effective anticoagulation Dr Schievink said a surgical bypass can be done to replace the damaged part of the artery
