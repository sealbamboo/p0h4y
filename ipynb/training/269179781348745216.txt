Tens of millions of Americans cant follow the   for healthful eating because they cant afford or access enough fresh fruits and vegetables Sometimes its because they live in whats known as a   places devoid of markets with a good variety of quality fresh foods Increasingly researchers want to understand just how the food environment  where people buy food what food is available food prices and how food is marketed to the consumer  has become the problem And even as cities from Philadelphia to   to Detroit mobilize to hydrate the food deserts its becoming clear that even if you make fresh produce affordable people may not buy it In the   of   a publication of the Agricultural  Applied Economics Association agricultural economists tackle among other things what drives consumer preferences for fruits and vegetables in food deserts They found that consumers are indeed sensitive to price and more likely to buy fruit when the price drops An effective program would have to heavily subsidize the price to attain a large increase in the consumption of fruit but may not be effective with vegetables researchers at Michigan State University write But they note many other factors prevent people in food deserts from buying fruits and vegetables The researchers wanted to find out what happens when competitively priced fresh fruits and vegetables are introduced into a food desert community So they looked at Piety Hill of Detroit where most residents are elderly and lowincome They chose Piety Hill because of the arrival in  of   a mobile produce truck that delivers fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the community the company also operates a brickandmortar store In  and  Peaches  Greens became the only retailer in Piety Hill to participate in the   which provides coupons worth up to  that can be redeemed only for fresh fruits and vegetables The researchers found that people in the DoubleUp Bucks program increased their fruit purchases by  percent yearoveryear their vegetable purchases by  percent and combined purchases by  percent On the surface that sounds successful But its not the whole story Turns out that despite the availability of the coupons most members of the community never even made it to Peaches  Greens  in part because they did not know it was there And even if they had known other obstacles remained Fewer than  percent of those who responded to the community survey had access to a vehicle cooking facilities safe food storage or utilities All of which help explain why prepackaged foods may seem like an easier option to people in food deserts The problem isnt limited to Detroit According to USDA around  million Americans live in areas designated as food deserts  mostly urban areas
