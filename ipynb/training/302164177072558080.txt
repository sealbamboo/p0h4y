  Theres truth in the adage the medium is the message According to new research out of the Harvard School of Public Health and the public health foundation Legacy graphic warning labels on cigarette packages appear to be more effective at getting smokers of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to think about kicking the habit When they looked at the reactions of  smokers to warning labels on cigarette cartons researchers found that smokers responded more positively to aggressive visual antismoking warnings than textonly lists of smoking dangers Overall the smokers found the graphics more impactful credible and effective The study to be published in PLOS ONE also found that the more powerful impact of the graphics held true across groups based on race ethnicity   and education The implementation of graphic warning labels appears to be one of the few tobacco control policies that have the potential to reduce communication inequalities across groups said Jennifer Cantrell DrPH MPA assistant director for research and evaluation at Legacy in a press release Since  as part of the implementation of the  Family Smoking and Prevention Tobacco Control Act tobacco companies are required to use images depicting the negative   on packaging labels and in ads Some tobacco companies have challenged the constitutionality of the mandate and questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the labeling Studies like this one provide support for the idea that visual warnings do work and may be more effective among culturally and socioeconomically diverse audiences There is a nagging question whether benefits from social policies accrue equally across ethnic and racial minority and social class groups The evidence from this paper shows that this new policy of mandated Graphic Health Warnings would benefit all groups said Vish Viswanath senior author and associate professor of society human development and health at Harvard School of Public Health in the release Given the disproportionate burden of tobaccorelated disease faced by the poor and minorities mandating strong pictorial warnings is an effective and efficient way to communicate the risk of tobacco use Its also a question of health literacy Disadvantaged demographic groups often dont have access to health information or help interpreting it and things like cigarette warning labels go unnoticed when they appear only in text according to researchers Interventions that have a positive impact on   among the general population have often proven ineffective in reaching disadvantaged groups worsening tobaccorelated health disparities added Dr Cantrell Its critical to examine the impact of tobacco policies such as warning labels across demographic groups According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more thanÂ   Smoking increases the risk for heart disease stroke COPD and many cancers among other conditions Tobacco use is a social justice issue said Donna Vallone PhD senior vice president for research and evaluation at Legacy in the release Given that low income and minority communities have higher smoking rates and suffer disproportionately from tobaccos health consequences studies like this show us that graphic warning labels can help us reach these subgroups in a more effective way ultimately saving more lives
