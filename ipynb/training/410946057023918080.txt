Genetic influence explains almost  of the variation in GCSE exam results twin studies suggest Scientists studied academic performance in more than  identical and nonidentical yearold twins in the UK The team from Kings College London found that on average genes explained  of differences between GCSE scores in core subjects such as maths  Differences in grades due to environment such as schools and families accounted for about  The remaining differences in GCSE scores in maths English and science are explained by environmental factors unique to each person say the researchers  Study leader Nicholas Shakeshaft from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings said Our research shows that differences in students educational achievement owe more to nature than nurture  Since we are studying whole populations this does not mean that genetics explains  of an individuals performance but rather that genetics explains  of the differences between individuals in the population as it exists at the moment This means that heritability is not fixed  if environmental influences change then the influence of genetics on educational achievement may change too The researchers studied two sets of twins  identical and nonidentical  to help distinguish between the effects of nature and nurture at the age of  If identical twins scores at GCSE are more alike than those of nonidentical twins it can be assumed that genetics plays a bigger role than the shared environment  attending the same school and family influences Professor Robert Plomin director of the Twin Early Development Study also from the Institute of Psychiatry said it was important to recognise the major role that genetics plays in childrens educational achievement It means that educational systems which are sensitive to childrens individual abilities and needs which are derived in part from their genetic predispositions might improve educational achievement he said Previous research has shown large numbers of genes may be involved in academic ability many of which have not been identified Prof Michael ODonovan from the Medical Research Council which funded the research said Further research is needed to assess the implications of the findings for educational strategies Dr Simon Underdown principal lecturer in biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University said the results must be treated with caution  While the genetic influence is slightly more than  that still leaves a massive role for environmental factors  What this research does is show that complex traits like intelligence are not the product of one or two simple genes Rather it is managed by an intricate process that relies on genetic factors and environmental influences The naturenurture debate is not over yet The findings are published in the journal
