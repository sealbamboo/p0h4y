Amid ongoing reports of animal illnesses and deaths tied to pet jerky treats the nations leading veterinary association says it wont warn owners not to feed the popular chicken duck and sweet potato products to their dogs  The American Veterinary Medical Association or AVMA rejected a resolution this month that would have discouraged use of the jerky products until further evidence about safety is available  The resolution as presented is basically dead said David Kirkpatrick an AVMA spokesman We dont have the scientific proof to say Dont do it Instead the AVMAs house of delegates recommended that the group tell its  members to report jerkyrelated pet problems to the federal Food and Drug Administration and to work with the FDA to safeguard animals through quality control of pet food and treats That comes as a blow to some AVMA veterinarians and scientists who already have been warning owners to avoid the jerky treats linked to   and some  illnesses since  Most of the concern has been centered on pet treats made in China  Do I think animals are getting sick because theyre eating jerky treats Yes said Kendal Harr a Seattle vet and a clinical pathologist who helped push a petition for the resolution at the AVMAs house of delegates meeting Jan  And it adds to confusion for pet owners trying to decide whether to feed their animals the strips nuggets and other treats that many pets love but that have been linked to gastrointestinal illnesses kidney failure and a dangerous disease called Fanconi syndrome  The FDA has cautioned pet owners for years about a potential association between the treats and the illnesses but the agency has stopped short of a warning to avoid them  The AVMA like the FDA says that while its clear animals whove eaten treats have become ill or died theres no conclusive proof of the cause The FDA has been testing jerky products for more than five years to no avail  The AVMA resolution came just weeks before two of the nations top pet jerky treat makers  starting next month Nestle Purina Pet Care plans to introduce new versions of its Waggin Train products in February while Del Monte Foods Corp said it would offer new versions of its Milos Kitchen treats in March  The companies issued nationwide recalls last year after New York state agriculture officials detected trace levels of unapproved antibiotics in jerky treat samples The FDA and company officials said that the antibiotics werent tied to the ongoing reports of illnesses Jerky makers have consistently said there is no proven link between their products and pet illnesses Nestle Purina officials said they have made significant enhancements to the Waggin Train production process including limiting meat sourcing to single suppliers and requiring that each batch of treats be tested for a range of contaminants The treats are part of the  billion US pet food industry including  million in sales last year for Waggin Train and nearly  million for Milos Kitchen treats according to data compiled by Packaged Facts a market research group  Nestle Purina is a minor AVMA donor federal tax records show contributing  of the groups  million budget in   Veterinarians like Harr say that its likely that tests dont exist to identify the toxin behind the animal illnesses It took years for instance for scientists to recognize that grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure in dogs and that Easter lilies can cause the problem in cats  The search for the problem is like a needle in a haystack of potential compounds and its moving too slowly she added I dont think theres progress personally In the meantime the AVMA and the FDA both remind owners that jerky treats are not a necessary part of a pets diet and to seek medical care at the first sign of gastric distress or kidney trouble
