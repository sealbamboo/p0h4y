The plague is making headlines again A teenage girl in Oregon reportedly came down with bubonic plague while on a hunting trip The culprit as always is a flea which can spread the infectious bacterial disease from squirrels and other rodents This isnt the first time the disease that terrorized the medieval era has made a modern appearance In the summer of  five cases were reported four in Colorado and one in China The Colorado residents   after coming into contact with an infected dog According to Chinese officials   in northern China were quarantined for nine days and  people were put under close observation after a man died of the disease last Wednesday He was reportedly   handling a dead Himalayan marmot a chubby rodent with   of carrying the bacterium that causes the plague Whats remarkable is that the disease has remained essentially the same over all those years and in all those places Anthropologists   the strain of bacteria in medieval skeletons from Europe is almost identical to the one circulating today Once known as the Black Death for the dark patches caused by bleeding under the skin the plague swept Europe  years ago killing a third of the population  an estimated  million It wiped out millions in China and Hong Kong in the late s before people put two and two together and started targeting rat populations Centuries later the plague periodically pops up in countries   The painful infection is caused by     that dwells in fleas The bacteria will hook onto the lining of the fleas gut and stomach and grow into a film that   the insects digestive passage The next time the flea goes for a blood meal it pukes into whatever animal it feeds on usually a rodent spreading the bacteria Once the rodent is infected the bacterium can then spread to the wild carnivores that eat it or to pets and people that come in contact with it The plague can persist in rodent populations especially wild ones for   without affecting humans But it can reemerge Ken Gage who studies vectorborne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says temperature and humidity can change   regulate how comfortable the bacteria are inside their hosts and allow rodent populations to mushroom The rodent densities have to get above a certain level he says and when that happens the likelihood of a rapid plague spread among the rodents goes up pretty dramatically As their rodent hosts die off the fleas seek new hosts  typically the next animal to peer down the burrow hole What we see in the West here is the fleas will crawl up to the entrance of the burrow and wait for a host to come by Gage explains If they get on another rodent that they can live on then theyve been successful But they can also jump on humans or on dogs or coyotes or cats which arent the right hosts but unfortunately those animals can be bitten by the fleas and get plague Sometimes that new host can transport the fleas a few miles away and spread them to other animals In the US which sees   human cases a year the plague tends to surface in rural areas often near plagueperfect settings semiarid forests and grasslands populated by everything from squirrels and rats to voles and rabbits Cases can occur when people or their pets get within fleajump range There are three forms of the plague The first bubonic happens when the bacterium infects the skin where a person has been bitten causing a swollen lymph node or bubo the hallmark bumps in medieval images of the disease If the bacterium enters the bloodstream thats septicemic plague And if the infection gets into the lungs at which point its called pneumonic plague it can spread from person to person in the droplets of a cough The World Health Organization   pneumonic plague to be among the deadliest infectious diseases Here in the US what we would do is identify the person try to figure out where theyve been who theyve had contact with in the last few days he says That includes anyone who got within  feet of the patient  close enough to get coughed on As with most bacterial infections   But medics have to catch the symptoms early on In the US infections tend to happen in the West fanning out from San Francisco where the disease may have made its   on American soil around  One thing you have in the Western US is a good variety of rodent species that are susceptible to plague and they have fleas that can transmit the disease says Gage Thats the key element But hes not too worried about the disease I dont think well see another pandemic Gage says because we know the organism and we know how to treat it We know how to do some flea control We can break the cycle at least as far as involvement with humans Indeed   in Libya in  the Democratic Republic of the Congo in  and Algeria in  were contained The bacteria may still be hosthopping around the globe but modern medicine has prevented the plague from getting anywhere near the disastrous levels it reached in the Middle Ages   one Scottish account from the th century So great a plague has never been heard of from the beginning of the world to the present day  At Gods command moreover the damage was done by an extraordinary and novel form of death  This sickness befell people everywhere but especially the middling and lower classes rarely the great It generated such horror that children did not dare to visit their dying parents nor parents their children but fled for fear of contagion as if from leprosy or a serpent Thats a plague scenario youll likely see only in history books
