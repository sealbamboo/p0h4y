Many Americans say their jobs are stressful  we complain of too much to do in too little time demanding bosses or difficult colleagues But researcher Sarah Damaske wanted to know objectively is being at work any harder than being at home So Damaske a professor of labor and employment at Pennsylvania State University had  people swab their saliva six times a day for three days to test cortisol levels a biological marker of stress And   The most relaxing part of most peoples day is when they are on the job This is across gender across education level across occupation level Damaske says So a pretty strong finding In addition to testing saliva samples researchers also asked participants how they felt throughout the study Men reported no big changes across the day but Damaske says women were significantly more likely to say they were happier at work Part of this might be women are leaving work and then cooking dinner and doing the dishes Damaske says Even though men are doing more than they did  years ago its still not an even distribution During a recent school dropoff in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington DC there was no gender divide when NPR asked people  unscientifically  what stressed them out most during their day Getting the kids up getting them dressed packing their lunches said Tonija Navas who works at an international nonprofit while her two kids are in school I am at ease  and then I have to pick them up she said laughing It starts all over again For Jason Hamacher a massage therapist a stressor is feeding the kids breakfast It drives me insane he said I have to distract my yearold with a toy maybe some kind of video which I hate doing but its the only thing that works Now  surprise  its not just parents who feel more stressed at home The study finds that work is even more of a haven for people without kids like Leigh Hartless Standing in line at a food truck she says that she feels stressed just thinking about everything she has to do once she gets home from work If your job is that stressful you can quit Hartless says But your personal life You cant quit your personal life These sentiments dont surprise Arlie Russell Hochschild a sociologist with the University of California Berkeley She made waves in the late s when her book   asserted that for some people home life had become so stressful that work was a refuge Hochschild remembers asking Where do you feel really good at what you do Relaxed Appreciated People would say Well gosh Actually if Im doing the right thing at work chances are my supervisors clapping me on the back  Hochschild says  But if Im doing the right thing at home with my teenager who wants the car and is mad at me Im doing the right thing but Im not appreciated  Of course not all stress is equal Hochschild says You still love your fussy baby Penn States Damaske sees a positive element in these findings that work lowers ones biological stress levels This is good news she says Work is actually good for you
