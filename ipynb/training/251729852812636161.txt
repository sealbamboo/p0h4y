We at Shots dont shy away from talking about poop as Michaeleen Doucleff demonstrated last month with her   on the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundations investment in fake feces Poop talk may strike some as juvenile but many people in the world   a safe way to do their business And by age  about half of American adults have experienced hemorrhoid symptoms   the Mayo Clinic Which brings us to a discussion thats been simmering since at least the s Is the modern toilet at least partly to blame for problems like hemorrhoids and constipation Some architects and doctors have posited that squatting may be the more natural position for us to do our business Thats spawned a sort of squatting counterculture and a budding industry to go with it As neuroscientist Daniel Lametti   in Slate in  squatting allows the er anorectal angle to straighten so that less effort is required for evacuation And today there are lots of squatting evangelists on the Internet who marshal scientific evidence limited as it may be and ample cultural evidence of the practice enduring in many parts of the world to make their case that squatting is superior But not everyone who might want to experiment with squatting can actually squat safely or comfortably especially elderly folks with bowel movement issues Enter   a product launched by Robert Edwards a yearold contractor and designer in St George Utah The story really starts with his mother who was suffering hemorrhoids and constipation and had resorted to raising her feet with a step stool while on the john for some relief The bulky step stool took up too much space so Edwards offered to make her one that would fit snugly around the base of the toilet when not in use The family experimented with different prototypes and soon realized there was a market for such a product In the last year Edwards says without any advertising he has sold  Squatty Pottys they start at   a testament to the revival of squatting in the US And he says he has become more convinced that the modern toilet is the cause of many peoples bowel issues The modern toilet has been sold to us as civilized but the straining that sitting causes is not healthy Edwards tells Shots Squatting on the other hand or getting closer to squatting with the help of the Squatty Potty can end hemorrhoids prevent colon disease improve pelvic floor issues and offer numerous other benefits he asserts We wondered what doctors had to say about all this so we called up   a colorectal surgeon at the Center for Pelvic Floor Disorders at Virginia Hospital Center Kim sees a lot of older women like Roberts mother whove developed conditions that make defecation difficult Kim says one of the first things she tells patients who struggle on the john is get a stack of telephone books or a stool to rest their feet on  an option not unlike the Squatty Potty But she says many of the claims Squatty Potty makes havent been well tested Squatting on a stool can reduce the amount of straining on the toilet which may mean less hemorrhoids but there are no clinical studies proving that she says So does this mean everyone should consider abandoning the more comfortable position of sitting for the potentially preventative position of squatting No says Kim For most people the modern toilet doesnt cause any problems she says But if youre to believe Slates Lametti squatting on top of the toilet could be a timesaver  he   his minute routine down to a minute
