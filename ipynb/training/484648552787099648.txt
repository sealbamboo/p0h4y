I was halfway through my ride on a recent crisp and sunny Sunday morning gaining speed as the road on which I was traveling  descended precipitously  miles per hour     I eased on the brakes but my bike abruptly lost its traction and as if pushed by God wiped out  In the movies this all happens in slow motion often with classical music playing in the background We see our protagonists face wideeyed in alarm as he falls gracefully and then grimacing as he braces for contact with the road  In reality the event occurs all of a sudden and violently  Wham Followed by intense pain in my side and the disembodied sound of my own guttural breathing as I skidded to a stop Did this really just happen was all I could manage to think and then the conclusion Yes but Im alive The only thing I had been able to do to prepare for impact was to put on my bike helmet before starting on my trip making my crash a teachable moment for my kids for days afterward A man driving in the opposite direction saw the accident stopped his car and jumped out to halt traffic so I wouldnt get run over He came over to me Are you OK he asked Can you get up I nodded but as I stood I cried out as one broken rib after another scraped against its separated brother and for the first time realized that I no longer fit together  He helped me to the roadside brought over my bike and stood by while I called my wife In giving her the basic details of what happened and my location I had to take breaths in between short sentences Xrays later confirmed that I also had a  
As I waited for my wife to take me to the emergency room I tried to organize the story I would tell the hospital personnel I promised myself that under no circumstances would it start with the words I am a doctor I didnt want the VIP treatment I had seen it so many times before  Often it was given to a prominent doctor on the hospitals staff One of my first patients as an intern was a wellknown infectious disease specialist who had developed a foot infection after stepping on glass Under the watchful glare of the many department chairmen who visited him in his room I promptly wrote an order for him to receive the wrong dose of penicillin I was mortified and when I acknowledged my mistake to him he graciously laughed and said he just assumed I had read a new journal article supporting the higher dose Another time after I had become an attending a famous doctor developed leukemia and his wellintentioned friends promptly admitted him to the general medicine VIP floor of the hospital which resembled a fancy hotel but with wider doors I navely marched into his room and urged him to move to a much smaller room on the lesswellappointed leukemia floor where he would be looked after by nurses doctors and pharmacists who specialized in his disease He acquiesced much to the surprise of my senior colleagues who couldnt believe how brazen I had been I just wanted him to get the most appropriate care Then there are the celebrities the sports stars the politicians whose hospital admissions typically lead to a lot of tests ordered by a lot of consultants all done with the best of intentions  But I worry that overtesting leads to overdiagnosis of conditions or findings that dont need to be treated And I didnt want to fall into that category My wife dropped me off at the emergency room while she parked the car The triage nurse  immediately redirected me to the trauma rooms As the trauma team was called she offered to help me undress so they wouldnt have to cut off my clothes Thats when she noticed the electronic pebble clipped to my shoe  the activity monitor that employees at my hospital are required to wear to qualify for health insurance discounts She was wearing one too Where do you work she asked I told her I worked at the main hospital And what do you do she pressed further I mumbled my response barely getting out the words doctor and oncologist This information was passed on quickly and before I knew it I was getting the VIP treatment I was given a private room sent for a lot of tests strapped to a cardiac monitor overnight and visited by several consultants I also got a visit from the hospital president  All of which I have to admit I appreciated And while I could have refused many of these interventions I recognized how awkward it would be to reject my colleagues advice or worse still to be thought of as a difficult patient I also realized how hard it was to distinguish normal from supernormal care  I did fine and was discharged the following day If I underwent more tests than someone without a medical degree I did not suffer from them and understood they were ordered with my wellbeing at heart I still had to wonder though Could I have done just as well with less
