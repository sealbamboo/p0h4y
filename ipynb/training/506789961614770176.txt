Hello, everyone, and nice to see you again. Although the calendar says otherwise, it certainly feels as if summer has come and gone, especially now that the long and restful holiday weekend on this side of the pond is over. And watching the shortest of short people clamor aboard the school bus this morning was another sure sign. Perhaps you can relate. If nothing else, that familiar routine of meetings and deadlines has returned with a vengeance, has it not? To cope, yes, we are quaffing a cup or three of stimulation. Do feel free to join us. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Hope you survive the day and stay in touchâ€¦. Novo Nordisk is pulling out of inflammatory disorder R&D to increase its diabetes and obesity efforts, following the failure of an investigational rheumatoid arthritis drug; GlaxoSmithKline faces a shareholder revolt over plans to shake up its board, with leading investors calling for the speedy departure of chairman Chris Gent; and an Exelixis cancer drug failed to prolong survival in men with advanced prostate cancer in a Phase III study and, as a result, 70% of its workforce, or 160 employees, are being let go.
