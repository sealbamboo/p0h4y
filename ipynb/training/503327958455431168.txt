Venezuela used to be a world leader in managing malaria but is now the only country in Latin America where incidence of the disease is increasing Around  people were infected last year and according to government figures  of cases were in Sifontes a tiny region of the country where gold mining  where workers drill for gold in mosquitofriendly standing water  is booming and healthcare is scarce Jesus Caas can barely speak when I ask him about the symptoms of malaria  he shivers babbles and closes his eyes  The light is one of the things that I cant stand says Caas  whos been mining for more than two decades in Bolivar a tropical state in south east Venezuela  Jesus is no stranger to the disease He has been infected with malaria  times he says His wife has had it  times and even his grandchildren have had it a couple of times Jesus believes it is worth risking his health for the financial rewards that gold mining brings Here you can earn more money than elsewhere with just one pan of gold you catch in a day what you will earn with the monthly minimum wage From the s to late s malaria was almost eradicated in the country But because its tropical conditions Venezuela has always had several pockets where the disease remained These areas stayed under control until recently Last year the country registered the highest number of cases of malaria in the last  years with  out of every  people infected  Throughout the previous decades the average was  cases in every  And according to the Ministry of Health it seems that  is going to be just as bad as  Both the government and critics agree that the cause of the surge is in part due to to the boom of illegal gold mining in the region  Mining was introduced to the area decades ago But in the past  years thousands of miners have come from all over the continent generating an environmental impact that helps the mosquitoes breed  Most dont have permits to work  or even remain  in the country causing overpopulation in a remote region where access to healthcare was already scarce It is the surge of malaria cases in Bolivar that puts the whole country at risk says Jose Felix Oletta a former Health Minister who is now director of Red Defendamos la Epidemiologia Protect Epidemiology Network Because of it says Oletta there are other endemic regions where the mosquito can thrive again The Venezuelan government says around  people die a year from malaria but Olettas organisation counted  deaths last year  So far this year this country of m people has registered more than  cases of malaria according to government statistics  In the wild state of Bolivar the municipality of Sifontes is ground zero of the malaria surge The environmental impact of mining has as locals put it made mosquitoes angry The boom of illegal mines means more people eroding the rainforest cutting trees and creating pools of stagnant water to extract gold The mining conditions poor infrastructure and everswelling numbers of people for mosquitoes to feast on have created perfect conditions for malaria to spread Residents work either as miners or as service providers to those who risk their lives at the mines  There are shops around every corner where miners sell their gold as well as pool bars and motels  There is also a brand new government hospital where every morning hundreds of illlooking people queue to get tested for malaria Those who test positive receive a sevenday treatment paid for by the government which includes rehydration drinks to combat vomiting and diarrhoea and pills that target the specific malaria parasite theyve been infected with  vivax or falpicarum Around  of the cases in Sifontes are vivax and the rest are falciparum says Jorge Moreno an entomologist who coordinates malaria research for the Bolivars Health Ministry  Vivax is not fatal but has the strongest symptoms whereas falciparum goes unnoticed but can suddenly kill you  Proper treatment is essential for controlling malaria but Ralph Brown one of the hospitals six doctors says this doesnt always happen The problem is that only two days after feeling okay patients abandon the treatment he says Then they start drinking partying they dont eat well they have sex he says Many of the patients in Sifontes however complain of shortages of medicine  one of the effects of Venezuelas current economic crisis Visiting the mine where Jesus works its easy to see how mosquitoes thrive in the humidity and mud  The miners often sleep right next to the mine in sheds made of black plastic bags with zinc sheeting for roofs Theres garbage and stagnant black waters surrounding just outside every tent When the motors from the mine are off you can hear the mosquitoes buzz in your ear I have a mosquito net says Jesus as he shows me the hammock where he sleeps But that doesnt really avoid the bite as you can get it any time Doctors say the best way to protect yourself from malaria is to use repellent cover up and stay inside at dawn and dusk  advice Jesus and his fellow miners largely ignore The government says its doing what it can to control malaria Dr Armando Ortega director of environmental health at the Institute of Public Health in Bolivar is responsible for controlling malaria in the state Environmental conditions like rainfall humidity and hydrostatic pressure make the mosquito well adapted to the region But human intervention has played a major role in the surge of malaria here he adds This is one of the biggest gold reserves in the world which means that many people have migrated here from many parts of Latin America to become richer We try to control the mosquitoes with fumigation we give out insecticidetreated mosquito nets and we have quick diagnosis and treatment programs But we also think the solution is structural  there must be a national programme to regulate mining Critics say the government has allowed illegal mining to grow in the last  years Jose Felix Oletta was Health Minister in the s with the government party Copei which is today part of the opposition He is one of the main critics of the malaria surge in Venezuela  Were going backwards and malaria threatens to spread to regions where the disease had been eradicated Perhaps unsurprisingly he lays the blame firmly at the governments door Theyve been in power for the last  years have stopped spending in health and permitted illegality all over the country and at every level   Nonetheless both critics and government agree that its the hunt for gold that causes malaria  A miner here can easily earn as much in a week as a professional in the capital Caracas earns in a month As Dr Ortega puts it as the gold price goes up so does malaria
