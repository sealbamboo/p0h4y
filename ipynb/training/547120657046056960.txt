Compared with other primates and our early human ancestors we modern humans have skeletons that are relatively lightweight  and scientists say that basically may be because we got lazy Biological anthropologist   and her colleagues at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History were studying the bones of different primates including humans When they looked at the ends of bones near the joints where the inside of the bone looks almost like a sponge they were struck by how much less dense this spongy bone was in humans compared with chimpanzees or orangutans So the next step was what about the fossil record When did this feature evolve Chirchir wondered Their guess was that the less dense bones showed up a couple of million years ago about when   a kind of protohuman left Africa Having lighter bones would have made it a lot easier to travel long distances Chirchir speculated But after examining a bunch of early human fossils she realized their guess was wrong This was absolutely surprising to us she says The change is occurring much later in our history The lightweight bones dont appear until about  years ago Thats right when humans were becoming less physically active because they were leaving their nomadic huntergatherer life behind and settling down to pursue agriculture A report on the work appeared Monday in the   along with a study from a different research group that came to much the same conclusion Those researchers looked at the bones of people in more recent history who lived in farming villages nearly  years ago and compared them with the bones of people who had lived nearby earlier as foragers The bones of people from the farming communities were less strong and less dense than those of the foragers whose measured bone strength was comparable to similarsize nonhuman primates We see a similar shift and we attribute it to lack of mobility and more sedentary populations says   an associate professor of anthropology at Penn State University Definitely physical activity and mobility is a critical component in building strong bones
