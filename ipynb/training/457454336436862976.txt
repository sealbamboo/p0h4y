A Vietnam veteran swoops his hand through a row of baby vegetables caressing the peppers on down to the kale The plants are aligned in tidy military order atop his backyard fence He could spend hours describing his first garden But he cannot utter a word He cant even eat his eventual harvest So Bob Hoaglan  simply stands and grins at the spouts behind his Oxnard Calif home Then he grabs his primary communication tool an LCD tablet scribbling a stylus across the screen He displays his words with a silent chuckle I dont have a green thumb With a button click he erases that sentence before composing another His daily aim is to throw his body and brain into new pursuits The crops  fresh life for a man facing mortality  help shove his disease to the back of his mind He admits though he cant keep it there I try he writes Sometimes it creeps up on me As he shows that message the smile vanishes Hoaglan was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS also known as Lou Gehrigs disease nearly a year ago Inside a malady that offers no cure or explanation he embodies two intriguing clues that a top researcher says may whisper answers Hoaglan served in the military and he is a nice man US veterans carry a nearly  percent greater risk of contracting ALS than civilians according to a white paper published in  by the ALS Association citing Harvard University research that tracked exservice members back to  That alarming disparity has prompted the Pentagon to devote  million annually to hunt for ALS causes and treatments The investment includes a  million grant made April  to the CedarsSinai Regenerative Medicine Institute in Los Angeles to test a promising therapy in lab animals and perhaps later in humans with the disease When you think about the military you have intense training and we all wonder Is it something to do with extreme exercise and a genetic vulnerability says Clive Svendsen head of the Cedars institute Hes been working for a decade to crack the ALS enigma His theory For veterans born with a rare genetic flaw that predisposes them to ALS the militarys harsh physical demands perhaps trigger the disease to erupt years later The latest DOD grant will allow Svendsens team to inject a special protein called GDNF into the leg and diaphragm muscles of rodents bred to carry a form of the illness GDNF promotes the survival of neurons  nerve cells through which the brain tells selected muscles to fire ALS damages neurons paralyzing muscles as it spreads becoming lethal in two to five years as breathing becomes compromised The mind remains untouched Roughly  Americans live with ALS and more than  new cases are diagnosed annually experts say Svendsens team will use a benign virus to deliver GDNF to targeted cells Recent research by one of Svendsens colleagues found that stem cells  engineered to produce GDNF  boosted motor function and lifespan when transplanted into the muscles of rats with ALS If we can slow down the disease that would be huge Svendsen says Even if I can tell my patient You can keep a finger going they can still communicate Right now theres nothing This is one of the best bets we have With the rosetinted glasses it is a piece of a potential cure If the protein injections work in animals the LA researchers can ask the federal government to approve clinical trials for human patients all part of a threeyear project The answer is in stem cell therapy Hoaglan writes on his LCD board The Army drafted him but he later enlisted in the Navy Reserves He served as a heavy equipment mechanic in Vietnam from  to  His base twice took mortar fire He scrawls more words with urgency in his eyes I want to get involved in a stem cell study Hoaglan began feeling an odd lump in his throat in  His words became slurred Now his throat muscles are paralyzed preventing him from speaking or swallowing He can still taste though writing that the hardest thing is smelling real food and I cant eat A gastrostomy tube coils beneath his shirt connecting to his stomach Each day he uses a syringe to push seven cans of calorically rich liquid into that tube He writes that hes having pulmonary problems Hes lost  pounds and tires easily He has the use of his hands arms and legs  and his warm charm His handshake is firm His smile is steady The other thing with this disease Ive found is the people who get ALS are just the nicest people Svendsen said Ive met so many become their friends Unfortunately theyre not around very long As a scientist Svendsen doesnt offer that observation as a simple kindness While possessing only anecdotal observations he believes that shared trait of a gentle nature has meaning Its possible he said that theres a genetic correlation that makes you vulnerable to ALS and that same mix of genes makes you a nice person Leaders of the ALS Association have heard such hunches They arent yet sold The ideas are currently unsubstantiated and mere speculation however interesting said Lucie Bruijn chief scientist for the Washington DCbased advocacy group At his ranchstyle home about a mile from the Pacific Ocean Hoaglan tends his sundrenched garden but knows where hell be after dark at his computer scouring the Internet for news of clinical trials Hell be searching for answers But he has one fundamental question He clutches his LCD board and jots two words Why me
