Spending on health care has of course been rising in the US for decades Health care now accounts for  cents of every dollar Americans spend up from  cents in  But where exactly is all that money going And for that matter where is the money coming from to pay for all that health care We found answers to both of these questions in   First heres where the money is going Despite huge changes in medicine and medical technology the share of health dollars that flows to each major category has changed little in the past  years In other words spending on each category  drugs hospitals doctors etc  has increased at about the same rate What has changed dramatically is where the money comes from In  by far the biggest share of health care spending was what people spent out of their own pockets Today insurance private plans along with Medicare and Medicaid which are governmentrun covers almost everything We emailed Uwe Reinhardt the Princeton health economist to ask about this shift Insurance coverage has become much more comprehensive he said For example in  people typically had to pay for drugs out of their own pockets By  it had become routine for private insurance to cover drugs Medicare drug coverage began in  Whats more he said in many cases employees gave up some freedom of choice in health care in exchange for less out of pocket spending But that trend is reversing itself he said Now we are going the other way with higher deductibles and coinsurance for employerbased plans he said A   conducted in the s and s is relevant here Researchers randomly assigned people to receive different types of insurance  some had full coverage while others had to pay for a big chunk of the care they received People had to pay more for care tended to get less care And people who were poor and who had to pay more for care fared worse on some key health measures The underlying question here is one of the oldest and most contentious in health economics What costs should health insurance cover and what costs should be left to individual patients
