Two years ago a   found that having Medicaid health insurance makes a positive difference in peoples lives Backers of the program have   time and again in their push to encourage states to expand the program as part of the federal health law Now the researchers have dug a little deeper into their data and the   published in the latest   are not quite as uniformly positive We dont see any improvements in this window in hypertension high cholesterol or diabetes said   a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the lead researchers on the project The window Baicker is talking about is the period between  and  when researchers got to perform a rarely available public policy experiment They compared a large group of similarly situated people with Medicaid in Oregon to a likesize group of people with no health insurance It happened because the state of Oregon found itself with just enough money to expand coverage to about  adults from a waiting list of  As a result Baicker said the state drew names from that waiting list by lottery which provides randomization The treatment group was selected in the lottery and the control group didnt get that opportunity Overall the researchers ended up studying about  people half of whom got Medicaid coverage and half of whom didnt For the first part of the study researchers looked at things like how much health care people used how much money they spent out of pocket and whether they thought Medicaid improved their health Overall the findings were uniformly positive People with insurance used more care spent less money We found big improvements in selfreported health Baicker said We asked people how they felt how their health interfered with their normal daily activities And they reported substantial gains when they got Medicaid coverage relative to the randomly assigned control group that didnt have Medicaid coverage For this current study however the researchers wanted to go a little deeper Rather than just asking people if they felt better they wanted to see if they actually   healthier after getting Medicaid coverage So they did personal visits that included medical tests like blood pressure and cholesterol screening But the results there werent so positive There was no statistically significant difference between the Medicaid group and the control group in those measures The study did find however increases in the diagnosis and treatment of those common ailments in the Medicaid group And there was a significant decrease among the Medicaid population in the likelihood of being diagnosed with depression It was about a  percent decline in the probability of screening positive for depression among those who had Medicaid than among those who didnt she said Baicker said there was also a clear financial benefit for those who gained coverage Theyre protected from catastrophic financial expenditures she said Medicaid coverage virtually eliminates having medical costs that are more than  percent of your income But she says the study also shows that Medicaid coverage comes at a cost to society  and to taxpayers People on Medicaid consume a lot more resources and that means they spend more money she says And is the additional money worth it I think were not paying attention to a lot of the problems with Medicaid even as we try to expand it said Scott Gottlieb a physician and resident fellow at the conservative   And people seem to want to ignore the many flaws with the program Gottlieb says Medicaid can be fine for people who need only fairly routine care or care in a hospital But in general the program has been spread too thin over too many people And for people who really need to access a lot of specialty services  particularly outpatient specialty services  in many states in many cases you just cant get access to it in a timely fashion he said Gottlieb is one of many who worry about the Affordable Care Acts call to dramatically expand a program they see as   Merely expanding the program isnt resolving the challenges and merely providing a little bit more money as the president did for primary care benefits under the program isnt going to resolve the serious challenges he said One obvious way to resolve some of the lingering questions would be to look at what happens to those Oregon Medicaid recipients in the future That however wont be possible Oregon found some extra money in  said Baicker and ended up giving people in the control group Medicaid coverage too Good for them but not so good for the research But Baicker says the researchers still have a lot of data they havent analyzed yet So this particular debate over Medicaids impact isnt quite over
