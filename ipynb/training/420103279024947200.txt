Fruits vegetables and wholegrains might be an unlikely treatment for asthma according to animal studies  Tests on mice   showed that a highfibre diet could reduce inflammation in the lungs The extra fibre changed the nutrients being absorbed from the gut which in turn altered the immune system The researchers argue the shift to processed foods may explain why more people are developing asthma The airways are more sensitive to irritation and more likely to become inflamed in people with asthma  It leads to a narrowing of the airways that make it harder to breathe However a possible solution may lie in another organ the gut and the bacteria which live there The cells of the human body are vastly outnumbered by the trillions of microbes that live in and on it  There is growing evidence that these bacteria have a significant impact on health A team at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland showed that the high and low fibre diets altered the types of bacteria living in the guts of the mice  Bacteria which can munch on soluble fibre the type found in fruit and vegetables flourished on the highfibre diet and they in turn produced more shortchain fatty acids  a type of fat which is absorbed into the blood The scientists said these fatty acids acted as signals to the immune system and resulted in the lungs being more resistant to irritation The opposite happened in lowfibre diets and the mice became more vulnerable to asthma  Their report argued that a dietary shift away from fibre in favour of processed foods may be involved in rising levels of asthma It said In recent decades there has been a welldocumented increase in the incidence of allergic asthma in developed countries and coincident with this increase have been changes in diet including reduced consumption of fibre One of the researchers Dr Benjamin Marsland said some of the differences caused by highfibre diets have already been observed in people by comparing diets in Europe and Burkina Faso He told the BBC Theres a very high probability it works in humans the basic principle of fibre being converted to shortchain fatty acids is known But we dont know what amount of fibre would be needed and the concentrations of shortchain fatty acids required might be different It is early days but the implications could be far reaching  The team in Lausanne are also investigating the role of diet in longterm lung inflammation such as COPD which is set to become the worlds third biggest killer An alternative to tweaking diets is giving the purified fatty acids themselves as a dietary supplement  This worked in mice but Dr Marsland warns there certainly needs to be more work before this is suggested in people
