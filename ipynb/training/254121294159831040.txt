Can there be too much lifesaving peanut butter In Haiti two different humanitarian groups have built new factories to make this product which is used to treat   and maybe someday   The problem is Haiti doesnt appear to need two of them Each factory all by itself could satisfy Haitis current demand This tale of two factories is also the story of two organizations with the same mission Its also about the strange economy of philanthropy with its mixture of altruism and selfpromotion The first organization is   or MFK Pat Wolff a pediatrician from St Louis set it up almost a decade ago specifically to make that special peanutbased treatment for malnutrition in Haiti She started small in a rented house in CapHaitien grinding peanuts and mixing them with sugar dried milk oil and lots of minerals and vitamins We started doing this in  Wolff recalls And in  PIH contacted us PIH     is much bigger than MFK and its worldfamous for its work fighting AIDS in some of the worlds poorest countries Its founder Paul Farmer is one of the most charismatic figures in the whole field of global public health They said Oh what a great idea tell us more about that  Wolff says And we were totally transparent to them Wolff and her colleagues shared their recipes their technologies and PIH soon set up its own kitchenscale production of enriched peanut butter which it calls Nourimanba PIH uses it to treat patients at its own clinics in central and western Haiti Then Meds and Food for Kids decided to do this on a much bigger scale It raised  million about  of which is a loan and it built a factory It just got up and running a few months ago It has white clean rooms and expensive machinery made of stainless steel that spits out little foilwrapped packages of enriched peanut butter UNICEF buys the product and distributes it to hospitals and clinics all over Haiti According to Wolff this factory can make everything thats needed for the whole country of Haiti But now Partners in Health is building its own factory That factory is just as big if not bigger Its funded by a  million grant from Abbot Laboratories If all goes according to plan it will be up and running by the end of the year Jonathan Lascher whos managing this project for PIH insists that his organization is not competing with MFK Partners in Health he says will not sell its product to UNICEF or the World Food Program It will pass out this treatment for free to people who need it in the regions of Haiti where PIH is active I certainly think there are ample opportunities for MFKs operations to scale up to meet most of the demand across the country he says and there will be opportunities for PIH to do other things For instance there will be so much excess capacity at PIHs new factory that the organization is considering using it to make commercial peanut butter too PIH could sell that product to help cover the factorys costs In any case Lascher says PIH decided to go ahead with its own factory in order to provide opportunities for peanut farmers in PIHs home area in Haitis central plateau When that center opens farmers around that area are going to know that this center is a beacon of economic opportunity They can bring their peanuts and well purchase them Lascher and his colleagues at Partners in Health dont seem threatened by MFKs factory it doesnt affect their plans much Meds and Food for Kids on the other hand is much smaller and financially more fragile It does appear threatened Theres not enough local peanuts and not enough need for this product in Haiti to have two factories that hope to be sustainable into the future says Wolff Its not just that a second factory could cut into MFKs sales Wolffs colleagues say PIHs project also has sucked away funders and consultants who were donating their technical expertise Of course the important question is probably not whether a second factory is good for MFK but whether its good for the people of Haiti We called up someone who knows both organizations Mark Manary a professor of pediatrics at Washington University in St Louis Hes a pioneer in this field Years ago in Africa he first showed Wolff how to make this peanutbased treatment for malnutrition When PIH was thinking about building its new factory people from that organization asked Manary for advice Manary doesnt really take sides But he says looking at the situation from the outside it does seem like a waste of money It seems like having two factories isnt appropriate for Haiti This kind of thing happens he says because nongovernmental organizations end up behaving like all other organizations They compete they try to attract recognition and funding and to promote their own brand Unfortunately branding is a powerful force among many NGOs he says And it is basically true I think that once an organization exists it tries to survive But that can prevent it from cooperating with other organizations or stepping aside to let another organization thrive Manary says he understands that impulse because he has tried to build an organization too But it can distract an organization from the people its really trying to help
