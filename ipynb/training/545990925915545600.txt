Do casting directors insist on remarkable cheekbones when theyre lining up actors to play characters with dementia Think about it Julie Christie in Away From Her    in Still Mine   as Margaret Thatcher  And heres one more Julianne Moore in Still Alice which had brief runs in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for Academy Award nominations and will open nationwide in January   Dementia seems irresistible to dramatists with its herebutnothere characters and bewildered families already grieving for people who havent died  Yet these stories remain hard to sell to audiences along with aging narratives in general  So I suppose we cant blame producers and directors for populating their films with actors who are first beautiful and second younger than their characters People in movies tend to be more beautiful than ordinary folks period At least   who deserved an Oscar for the unflinching Amour  and has the requisite cheekbones  was   Still Alice backs away even further from the usual characterizations though by giving its lovely protagonist a fairly rare form of dementia earlyonset Alzheimers disease which afflicts those younger than    Prof Alice Howland seen running effortlessly through Riverside Park is just  and enjoying an impressive academic career at Columbia when she starts forgetting words and getting lost in familiar places  Lisa Genova the neuroscientist and author of the novel Still Alice has explained her reasons for featuring a younger victim Alzheimers may not be immediately recognized in yearolds she has pointed out especially since we expect older people to have memory lapses A younger intellectual Ms Genova said would notice cognitive lapses at once and be alarmed Its a more dramatic scenario perhaps than a plot featuring the elderly it also allows filmmakers to cast much younger stars Fair enough I suppose Its bad form to carp because filmmakers make the movie they want to not the one youd prefer  But no more than  percent of people with Alzheimers have the earlyonset variety and even fewer have the familial form that descends upon Alice Howland So as sensitive as Still Alice is with a wonderful a performance at its core it still feels like were afraid to see what dementia most often looks like who typically gets it and what families really go through In movies moreover nobody seems worried about the enormous costs of caring for patients   The dementiarelated movies I found better written more honest and more moving  Iris starring Judi Dench an exception to the cheekbones rule Away From Her and Amour  were made in Britain Canada and France perhaps not coincidentally  Given our common wish that dementia looked prettier than it generally does we should applaud the filmmakers who   for tackling Still Alice at all   I do applaud them Award nominations Golden Globe Screen Actors Guild are already piling up for Ms Moore I hope she gets that Oscar nomination the way Dame Judi and Ms Christie did in their turns as Alzheimers sufferers the way Bruce Dern did for    Maybe Ms Moore will even win But I also found myself looking at the screen and thinking This is not the way it is
