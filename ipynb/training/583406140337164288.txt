A free app to improve childrens sleep has been launched by doctors at the Evelina Childrens Hospital in London They think it will help the two million parents in the UK who express concern about their childs sleep and ease pressure on the NHS Kids Sleep Doctor gives parents tailored advice such as dealing with night terrors or upallnight teens based on their sleeping patterns Experts said good sleep was vital for a childs development and behaviour Paul Gringras a professor of childrens sleep medicine at the hospital said massive waiting lists mean doctors could see only the tip of the iceberg So the hospital developed an app that gives personalised advice to parents of  yearolds to tackle the different sleeping problems that crop up at different ages  Initial advice starts after entering details about bedtimes where the child falls asleep how much screen time they have and caffeinated drinks consumption After five days of recording a childs sleep habits such as nightwaking and bedtimes the full personalised service kicks in Hopefully they are sleeping in the normal range but if theyre outside that then it advises parents Prof Gringras told the BBC News website Take a fiveyearold who suddenly is waking up every night screaming doesnt recognise parents and pushes them away The app would say it is like a night terror and will happen in  of children in this age range and they will grow out of it but they can also try a technique called scheduled waking half an hour after they have gone to bed In another scenario it would advise parents of teenagers unable to sleep until really late at night and are then too tired for school that exercise in the afternoon is as powerful as any drug for promoting sleep These are not annoying daily tips its tailored advice he added The app has been designed to reduce pressures on the health service rather than make money It is currently available free on iOS Android and Windows versions will follow I think theres a lot of people it could prevent needing to see a GP Parents can do a brilliant job added Prof Gringras However the roughly  children with serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnoea would see need to see a doctor  The advice does not apply during the first three months The app has also been designed in a dark and orange palette to minimise the amount of blue light emitted  which is the wavelength of light that most disrupts sleep Psychologist and child therapist Professor Tanya Byron commented Many children are affected by sleep problems which can have a major effect on the whole family  Getting a good nights sleep is so important for a childs physical and mental development behaviour and concentration  to name but a few We know parents know their children better than anyone and Im confident that the Kids Sleep Dr app will help parents to understand and better manage their childs sleep problems
