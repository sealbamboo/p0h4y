More than  million children get free or reduced priced meals during the school year But in the summer that number drops to only three million The big question is what happens to all the other children Do they get enough and the right food to eat This summer government agencies and   are making a massive push to get millions of meals to kids who might otherwise go hungry as part of the nationwide   And theyre doing some creative things to reach them Take rural Hopkins County in western Kentucky Its mostly farms and coal fields and gently rolling hills So when schools out the children are widely dispersed and often isolated That makes it a challenge for the local YMCA Its feeding about  children a day this summer mostly at central sites like camps and parks But increasingly its using mobile units to get food to some of the hardertoreach areas in the county One of the units is a red pickup truck with two Y employees in front and several coolers of food in the back One of its first stops of the day is a Baptist church in the small town of Earlington Church volunteer Don Egbert is waiting inside for the lunch delivery  about  pork barbeque sandwiches carrots strawberries and milk No sooner is the food set out on a long table at the church when two little girls rush in Kiarra and Ciara Crook ages  and  live right around the corner Egbert says they come to the church for lunch every day like clockwork Well we dont have any food at home  explains Ciara adding that her mother works but only gets paid once a month Deanna Brewster arrives next driving a blue pickup truck with three neighborhood kids in back Another two are up front Brewster says these children automatically get fed when schools in session But during the summer she says its difficult for some kids to get even one good meal a day If they werent getting these free meals says Brewster the kids she brought would probably be eating a pack of noodles for lunch Thats the truth about it she says Its hard these days   executive director of the Hopkins County Family YMCA has a map on his wall where hes circled in black marker what he calls pockets of poverty  areas where kids not only lack money but often transportation to get to other sites or grocery stores Some also lack parental supervision There are children who their parents are not home he says I know some of the housing sites over the years where the parents have kind of locked them out and then theyre just on their own And who knows what theyre eating if theyre eating at all he says In the summer nutrition program  which is funded by the US Department of Agriculture  any child who shows up gets a free lunch No questions asked The kids just have to live in an area where more than half the children qualify for freeor reduced price meals at school Thats most of Hopkins County Wallace is now using four mobile routes to target some of the hardest to reach areas in the county We stop feed them make sure theyre eating and then we move on to the next site he says The fourth mobile stop of the day is a subsidized apartment complex in Dawson Springs a town about a half hour from the YMCA About a halfdozen children are waiting in line for the red truck Most of them are holding white plastic grocery bags Even though the children are supposed to eat outside at a picnic table where the food is delivered many take some of it home for siblings and maybe a parent Carrie Kovach watches as her children ages   and  unwrap their barbeque sandwiches She says she and her husband both work but they still struggle to pay all their bills so the lunches help Cause food costs a lot nowadays And feeding three kids Yeah she sighs There are similar efforts across the country this summer Libraries are sending lunches out on bookmobiles Food banks are delivering meals directly to the homes of needy children who cant get to another site Cities are serving lunch at public housing projects where parents are afraid to let their kids out alone Educators say when school reopens they can tell which children ate well over the summer and which did not Those who didnt are less focused less ready to learn Imagine if childrens hospitals said Were not going to be open in the summer If the fire department said Were not going to be open in the summer time  says   head of Share Our Strength a national food advocacy group It makes no sense I mean this is a critical service Kids need it Its got to be provided all year round The problem is right now the governments summer nutrition program is hit or miss It relies on a loose network of agencies and volunteers still trying to figure out the best way to reach needy kids when theyre not in school
