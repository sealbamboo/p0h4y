nyone who has followed it since it began two years ago will have noticed that   pledges are becoming the new years resolutions of healthcare lofty vague and unlikely to happen Lets go back to the beginning NHS Change Day is a response to the computer says no elements of   culture Its less about red tape  changing regulation is thoroughly out of scope  and more about giving excellent staff the permission to trust their professional judgment and get on with sensible obvious stuff they cant believe no ones already fixed Working in an NHS organisation of thousands and a collective health service of  million there can be a neverending chain of people to involve in decisionmaking and signoff Change Day says trust your instincts and if youre a manager trust your staff The best pledges some of them   are the practical ones Take the   of   to help clinicians spot sepsis early Or the   campaign to take   to reduce avoidable pressure sores in hospital beds These are real practical things that actual people are promising to start doing very soon if they havent started already Its vital that Change Day doesnt become yet another policy wonk wishlist Search the   hashtag on Twitter and youll find the wonks out in full force Crap pledges are easy to recognise because they go along the lines of something something better care Here are some real examples Good pledges follow the lead of the NHS Change Day organisers As  elsewhere last years  pledges demonstrated a groundswell of support for distributed leadership or in human speak trusting brilliant NHS staff to do what they do best But in  the organisers were calling on those in the NHS not to make a pledge but to record and share their actions  the stuff they were actually doing That message didnt quite seem to get through this year but enormous kudos are due to people like   whove turned   into   So Im proposing that for next years Change Day we all adopt one of two pledges or actions if were being picky Option one is that we change the name to NHS STFU and JFDI Day and Im not talking about involving the Southern Tenant Farmers Union Option two is lets all agree what makes a good pledge  staff and teams giving themselves permission to make commonsense humansized changes  and leave the wonk talk in the conference centre
