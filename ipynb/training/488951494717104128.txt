In the land that came up with the phrase Thank God its Friday and a restaurant chain to capitalize on the sense of relief many feel as the work week ends researchers made an unusual finding in  Moms who worked full time reported significantly better physical and mental health than moms who worked part time research involving more than  mothers found And mothers who worked part time reported better health than moms who didnt work at all Working and juggling family responsibilities can be stressful But can work despite its demands be less stressful than the alternative Mothers who worked longer hours had more juggling to do They had more demands on their time and more stress How could they possibly be in better physical and mental health One answer of course is selfselection Mothers who were in better health to begin with may have chosen to work regularly Researchers   and   who conducted the  study also found that moms who worked steadily had other advantages They were more likely to have grown up with two married parents more likely to have completed high school and more likely to be in a stable relationship before the birth of their first child But in new research Damaske argues that another factor might have been at play Its a factor that sociologists such as   and psychiatrists such as Sigmund Freud have examined in the past Hochschild for one found that many people find work to be less stressful than their home lives Work was in fact a haven Freud once said work and love were two wellsprings of emotional satisfaction in life In a   of  working men and women Damaske had volunteers collect samples of saliva throughout the day The samples were later tested to measure the levels of cortisol a stress hormone Cortisol levels didnt spike when the volunteers were at work They soared when the volunteers were home When we looked at the difference between home and work in terms of their cortisol levels  that biological marker of stress  we found that peoples cortisol levels were significantly lower at work than they were at home Damaske said The results suggested to us that people  at least biologically speaking  had lower levels of stress  at work she said Lowincome people and those without children were especially likely to report lower levels of the stress hormone when they were at work The idea that work might be less stressful than home life for many people is mirrored in   conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health Health problems the death of loved ones and juggling busy family schedules often scored among the top sources of stress in peoples lives Damaske said there was an important difference between the kind of stress people experience at home and the kind of stress they experience in the workplace No matter how urgent something is at work you are not as attached to that urgency as you would be to say a health scare or the death of a loved one because we are emotionally entangled at home in a way that we arent at work she said in an interview Besides she added most workers have a trump card to play at work which they may not feel they have in their personal lives You still know that you can quit you can look for something else that you can leave  leave your boss and your bad day behind Damaske said Those arent exactly strategies that you have for home right Most of us arent going to up and leave our families because theyre stressful although most peoples families are stressful from time to time Damaske said the study offered a different window into why women who work steady jobs might experience better physical and mental health than those who work part time or not at all It is still possible that women who are healthier to begin with are more likely to hold steady jobs but Damaske said it might also be the case that work had positive effects on womens health So why do we hear so much about stressful jobs bad bosses and difficult demands at work One reason could be that people might find it easier to talk about problems at work than to talk about problems and challenges in their personal lives Social norms Damaske said make it acceptable to complain in public about our work lives but make it difficult to talk publicly about health problems and other stressors in our personal lives All this points to one thing There is pentup demand in the United States for a new restaurant named TGIM  Thank God its Monday
