Newer football helmets could cut concussion risk in half a new study suggests Researchers found a  percent difference in concussion risk between two different helmets made by the same company in a large study that included data from  college football players  The players in the study wore one of two helmet models made by the Riddell company the older VSR and the newer Revolution All the helmets had been equipped with sensors that recorded forces or accelerations experienced by the players heads each time there was a hit  No helmet can completely prevent concussions said study coauthor Stefan Duma a professor and head of biomedical engineering at Virginia TechWake Forest University Theres always a risk All we are saying is that by effectively adding more padding it reduces the accelerations and that reduces concussions Duma and his colleagues scrutinized concussion and accelerometer data collected from  to  from eight college football teams All the players wore either the Riddell VSR or the Riddell Revolution  During the years of the study there were a total of  head impacts in players wearing the VSR helmets and  concussions which amounted to  concussions per  jolts to the head Among those wearing the Revolution there were  head impacts and  concussions which amounted to  concussions per  head impacts Concussion experts called the study an important first step but one that needed to be duplicated since there is another recently published helmet study that found no difference in concussion protection between older and newer versions  The newer helmets are about  percent thicker so its not a surprise that they would reduce the linear impacts you would record said Dr Robert Cantu a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the Boston University School of Medicine and codirector of the Center for the Study of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Cantu also serves on the board of trustees as vice president of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment  What is surprising is the degree to which they appear to have found concussion to be reduced he added  Cantu said he was concerned about the small number of concussions that were reported Numbers were also an issue for David Hovda a professor of neurosurgery and director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center  There was far less data from the VSR wearing players Hovda pointed out And if there had been more data the difference between the two helmets might not have been as sharp Further Hovda said you have to take into account the fact that many many players werent  and still arent  reporting concussions Ultimately there will just need to be more studies on the topic said Dr Douglas Smith a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center I would say this is an important study because it instructs us on how to sharpen our focus for future ones Smith saidÂ
