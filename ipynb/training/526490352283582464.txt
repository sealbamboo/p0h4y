
 Are you among the half of Americans who say they check the nutrition labels on packaged foods when shopping If you can read the information without a magnifying glass do you understand what the many numbers mean to your health Do you look only at calories or do you also check the amounts of sugar sodium protein or dietary fiber in a serving And does the serving size listed represent how much you might actually consume at a sitting The Nutrition Facts label mandated by Congress on processed food packages since  was designed to help Americans consume a more nutritious diet If manufacturers had to reveal the nutrients and calories in foods the reasoning went they might be encouraged to add more nourishing ingredients and to eliminate or reduce those that are detrimental to health This strategy worked well for reducing arterydamaging trans fats now all but gone from processed foods but not nearly so well for ridding products of salt and sugar And manufacturers added things like vitamins minerals and fiber to make products appear healthier than they really are Although the numbers can look good the product may not be real food and have no nutritional value said Dr David Kessler who as the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration championed the development of the current label The epidemics of obesity and Type  diabetes show that the goal of a healthier population has yet to be realized One obstacle is that those most likely to read food labels are healthconscious people who least need to do so But another problem is the label itself which can border on meaningless for many consumers especially those who cannot relate grams of a nutrient or percentages of the Daily Value to the amount of food that goes in their mouths So prompted by the Institute of Medicine the FDA is planning a revision It will be a while in coming Thousands of public comments must be reviewed then final rules issued and the food industry given time to implement them Some of the proposed changes should be helpful For example instead of listing sugar as a single entry the new label would separately list added sugars to distinguish those naturally present and not Also the proposed label will highlight the number of calories in the amounts of food most people consume at a sitting Though an official serving of a soft drink might be eight ounces for example people may habitually consume the entire ounce can or ounce bottle if so the calories in that amount would be featured on the label Likewise a serving of chips may be  chips But if people typically eat a whole bag of say  chips that calorie count would be most prominent Labels on ice cream too now list onehalf cup as a serving That would increase to one cup on the new label bringing a serving of HaagenDazs Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream for example to a whopping  calories With that amount prominently displayed on the carton a shopper might instead choose Edys Slow Churned Double Fudge Brownie Ice Cream  just  calories a cup Official serving sizes are supposed to reflect what people actually eat but they are based on what Americans typically consumed in the s More recent national nutrition surveys show that the average person eats considerably more of many foods hence the uptick in serving sizes Given the high cost of changing hundreds of thousands of food labels I and many health professionals believe the revisions though positive over all do not go nearly far enough For one thing they fail to give harried shoppers a fast and easy way to distinguish among similar products perhaps by using frontofpackage traffic light signals to highlight the good bad or neutral health value of a food Ecuador is already doing this because theyre so worried about obesity Marion Nestle a professor of nutrition food studies and public health at New York University said in an interview In Great Britain it was shown that when people saw red dots on a package they didnt buy it That is why the American food industry has fought hard against such indications of a foods healthfulness The label would also be more meaningful if it used common kitchen measurements like teaspoons of sugar in a serving rather than grams Dr Nestle said Fewer people might down a ounce cola if they knew it contained  teaspoons of sugar The proposed revision also fails to address the often daunting ingredients list which currently enables manufacturers to disguise the total contribution of undesirable nutrients by listing each one separately A consumer cannot tell that added sugar is the main ingredient if sugar honey highfructose corn syrup agave and grape juice concentrate are listed individually The Center for Science in the Public Interest has proposed that ingredients like sugars and fats be grouped together and that the label distinguish major ingredients from minor ones making up  percent or less of a product Even healthconscious shoppers like me can be fooled by current labels I recently purchased Doles Orange Peach Mango juice described on the carton in large type as  juice Technically correct But a closer look at the label later revealed filtered water as the main ingredient followed by apple juice concentrate orange juice concentrate clarified pineapple juice concentrate grape juice concentrate and mango pure concentrate Not what I thought I was buying tasty though it was Without orange peach and mango juice as the main ingredients  and with  grams of sugar six and a half teaspoons in an ounce serving  I will not be buying it again Also absent in the proposed revision is information that would actively encourage consumers to purchase real foods rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains Dr Kessler said The answer to obesity if there is one is eating real food and moving away from foods laden with fats sugars and salt Highly processed food goes down in a whoosh but real food slows down eating Instead the new label like the current one would focus on specific nutrients and give food companies an incentive to fortify their products so they can make claims such as added fiber or to produce sugarladen foods that can be labeled low fatÂ    in
