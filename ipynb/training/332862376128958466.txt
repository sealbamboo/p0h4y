Even if I hadnt known the hospital inspectors were coming I would have figured it out quickly enough from my email The admonitions were flying Its boilerplate stuff that doctors like me should do all the time but often overlook Now we were about to be graded Hospitals that the quality inspectors deem deficient can lose their accreditation and be barred from Medicare reimbursement A nonprofit called the   though not on the tip of patients tongues is the outfit were accustomed to seeing every three years for these quality checkups So I was surprised to learn that the surveyors as they like to be called were coming instead from a Norwegian company called   thats short for  or in English The Norwegian Truth The company has been approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to certify hospitals since  Suffice it to say that most doctors like me have never heard of them My first thought was What Theres an alternative Id always believed that the Joint Commission had a monopoly in the hospital accreditation and certification business At the very least it always seemed to be some sort of quasigovernmental organization As it turns out that isnt true Welcome upstarts With little competition until now the Joint Commission has tended to be viewed adversarially by hospital insiders My second thought was how could an Oslo company that started out assessing the risks of oceangoing vessels in  know anything about accrediting US hospitals Interestingly though rooted in Norway DNV has had various risk management businesses in the US since  And   CEO of DNV Healthcare is a persistent man He spent   working to obtain CMS approval to become a hospital accreditorcontinuing even after he was rejected the first time It was like climbing Mount Everest   Horine told Shots The new kid does things differently Horine who started out as a consultant helping hospitals prepare for traditional audits figured there had to be a better way As soon as surveyors left the building and hit the parking lot it was always back to business as usual he said There was nothing to sustain quality improvements after surveys So DNV surveys its client hospitals annually rather than every three years which has been the Joint Commissions norm But the Joint Commisions   says it now offers annual visits on a voluntary basis  with about  percent of hospitals opting for that approach DNV brings a new standard for hospitals   accreditation ISO  is an internationally recognized quality system in manufacturing and service industries Before DNV applied it to the field ISO  had never before been used in US hospitals Now the Joint Commission is testing its own ISO  accreditation program at four sites across the US according to Blouin DNV has a long way to go Right now it accredits about  US hospitals compared with nearly  by the Joint Commission But DNV has doubled its list of customers in just two years putting the Goliath of accreditation on notice
