If you follow the news on nasty contagious norovirus you might assume that the place youre most likely to get it is on a cruise ship For one there was that outbreak earlier this year when a group of passengers   with severe vomiting and diarrhea on a Royal Caribbean boat Or recall the   of  in which more than  passengers and crew members fell ill with the bug But a   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds you are far more likely to catch the bug in a restaurant or cafeteria than on a cruise ship Cruise ships account for only  percent of reported norovirus cases while the other  percent of the  million annual infections are happening all around us all the time often in sporadic oneoff cases or in small clusters Foodborne transmission accounted for  outbreaks or about  percent of those reported between  to  the CDC says The other main way of transmitting the virus is by direct persontoperson contact which accounts for about  percent of outbreaks But as far as foodborne pathogens go norovirus is king accounting for about half of all outbreaks reported to the CDC between  and  Heres a   of sicknesses from other pathogens Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks and illnesses in the US the CDCs  tells The Salt So how is this happening Through infected food workers  from cooks and handlers to servers and waiters Theyre responsible for about  percent of reported norovirus outbreaks from contaminated food The typical scenario  involves an infected food worker who is preparing foods particularly handling them after theyve been cooked says Hall And then the food is served to a customer who goes on to get sick Also the virus stays on countertops spoons and other kitchen surfaces for up to two weeks And hand sanitizers wont necessarily kill it As consumers were   that the best strategy to prevent foodborne illness from bacteria such as salmonella is to cook our food well This kills off the pathogens that can harm us But this strategy doesnt seem to be very effective in preventing norovirus transmission in the restaurant setting Its not that heat doesnt kill the virus It does  above  degrees Fahrenheit But unfortunately in  percent of reported norovirus cases in which a particular food was pegged as the culprit the food was contaminated by infected food workers during the final preparation step after the food was cooked perhaps assembling a sandwich or a salad Hall says Hall says the food service industry could improve prevention efforts by enforcing handwashing But he also points to the need for sick leave for infected food workers We really want to call upon the food service industry to work with public health to help foster an environment where food workers can stay home when theyre sick Hall says Of the  million people who get sick from norovirus each year the CDC estimates somewhere between  and  are hospitalized
