As the glutenfree diet has become something of a trend and a marketing angle over the last decade glutenfree varieties of packaged foods have hit grocerystore shelves and even chain restaurants now offer options that dont contain gluten For people with   a genetically based autoimmune disorder this has been good news as the only treatment for celiac disease is a medically prescribed diet free of    the protein found in wheat rye and barley Wider availability of glutenfree foods is also helpful for people with nonceliac gluten sensitivity who also want to follow a glutenfree diet in order to avoid gastrointestinal distress But as gluten awareness has increased so has the idea that going glutenfree even for people who can tolerate gluten is healthier There are plenty of anecdotal accounts from people who havent been tested for gluten sensitivity who claim to feel better and more energetic once they go glutenfree or even just reduce their gluten intake A glutenfree diet may result in some initial weight loss depending on the rest of your diet and in general closer attention to what you eat will likely lead to smarter more informed food choices But current evidence tells us that going glutenfree when you dont   to isnt necessarily better for you A   looked at the risk for heart disease and metabolic syndrome among people without celiac disease who followed a glutenfree diet Researchers found that while there was an association between those on the diet and lower   there was no significant difference in risk for heart disease and metabolic syndrome And according to   longterm consumption of gluten was not associated with a risk for cardiovascular disease the studys authors also noted that glutenfree diets should not be recommended for heart disease prevention in people without celiac disease A glutenfree food is any food that does not contain any element of wheat barley or rye These grains which are basic ingredients in most breads and pastas are obvious sources of gluten But gluten may also be hiding in sauces or soups if one of those grains is used as a thickening agent If youre serious about following a glutenfree diet you will also have to cut out soy sauce and malt products such as beer Keep in mind that even health supplements may contain nonobvious gluten products Despite what you may have heard going glutenfree doesnt simply mean cutting out wheatbased pastas and breads And its not the same thing as a lowcarb diet says   a dietitian based in Manchester Massachusetts who specializes in celiac disease and the glutenfree diet Such diets can include several forms of nonwheat carbohydrates including ricebased products cornbased products and naturally glutenfree grains such as teff amaranth millet and quinoa A truly glutenfree diet requires vigilance and is not easy to maintain but its a must for people with celiac disease which is diagnosed with blood tests followed by an intestinal biopsy Approximately  percent of Americans have celiac disease but most people who have celiac disease have not been diagnosed according to   Some people who feel better on a glutenfree diet may actually feel better because they have celiac disease notes Thompson People who have this disease really want to be diagnosed because they want to have the help they need to make sure the diet is being followed the way it should be followed Nonceliac gluten sensitivity is more difficult to diagnose It remains what we call a diagnosis of exclusion says Thompson If an individual doesnt have celiac disease and they dont have an allergy to wheat or barley but theres still a suspicion that they have some type of negative response to gluten or wheat then they can be trialed on a glutenfree diet to see whether their symptoms resolve If they resolve on the diet then it may be the case that the individual is glutensensitive If you suspect you have gluten sensitivity its extremely important to get tested  going on a glutenfree diet If you do have celiac disease you want to know If you have celiac disease your diet needs to be a strict one says Thompson And diagnostic tests may not be accurate once a glutenfree diet is already being followed you must be tested while you are still eating a nonrestricted diet If youre simply curious about following a glutenfree diet  and dont need to be on a strict one for medical reasons  its worth considering what you can and cant expect to gain from it If youre thinking of including glutenfree foods in your or your   you may not realize exactly how much care you must take to prevent crosscontamination even while cooking   Crosscontamination can happen in a variety of places in your home says Thompson Its important she notes to store glutenfree food separately if not in a designated cupboard then at least on a shelf above wheatbased products Crumbs can fall and its far better for the glutenfree crumbs to fall on the glutencontaining products rather than vice versa Always wash your utensils thoroughly and use separate utensils when preparing food For example if you are making glutenfree foods like pasta for yourself and regular pasta for the rest of your family dont strain them using the same strainer or serve them using the same pasta tongs Have a dedicated toaster if possible and remember to clean your microwave But cross contact is an issue long before food even comes into your home Crosscontamination of grains can occur in the field during harvest and during transport This is why we tell people with celiac disease that whenever possible they need to choose naturally glutenfree grain that is actually labeled glutenfree says Thompson There are plenty of simpletoprepare meals that can be delicious and glutenfree such as a meat combined with a grain quinoa or rice and cooked or fresh vegetables If youre interested in trying glutenfree foods avoid processed snacks and highcalorie restaurant meals and instead experiment with some of these
