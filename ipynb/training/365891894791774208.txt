So it seems Lucy and Ricky Ricardo mightve been on to something Nearly  of you responded yesterday   asking whether you sleep better with your partner or alone  and  percent of you admitted in the safe anonymity of an online vote that you actually sleep better solo Science and history are on your side too Sleep experts say that we tend to associate snoozing in a separate bed  or a separate room  from your significant other with relationship problems but thats not always the case Because some couples might work completely opposite schedules and others might be dealing with health issues like sleep apnea requiring a terribly noisy CPAP to run all night But even one persons mundane problem like snoring can keep the other up all night TODAYcom reader Nikki Garcia Lopez said on  that she and her husband of  years have slept in separate rooms for  of those years He snores loud and moves too much keeping me up all night And despite their bedtime separation Garcia Lopez says We are very happy  More couples might start sleeping separately as they get older Dr Neil Stanley a UK sleep specialist said in an email When you are young or in the first flush of a relationship I dont think sleeping separately is very common but when you get to middle age you are perhaps more pragmatic Some couples might also have more space since their children have grown up and left home He thinks the  percent figure sounds about right for that age group Poor sleep has been linked with higher rates of depression obesity diabetes heart disease and hypertension to name just a few of the lasting consequences of too little sleep Stanley says He adds that research has shown that up to  percent of your nightly sleep disturbances are caused by the person you share a bed with   you say  Its a very nice thought but thats probably about all it is One sleep study had couples sleep separately one night and together another night while measuring each persons brain waves to assess sleep quality Interestingly couples said they slept better when they were sharing a bed with their partner says David K Randall who recently published a book all about slumber called   He says that although couples  they slept better together their brain waves told a different story showing sleep disturbances and wakefulness throughout the night When sleeping separately they were able to fall asleep faster and sleep better all night long It feels good to sleep next to somebody but if youre just looking at sleep itself youre generally going to sleep better when you sleep in a bed by yourself Randall says Especially he adds if youre sleeping next to someone like him who kicks and snores in his sleep Thats not necessarily fun to sleep next to he says For his book Randall looked into the history of sleeping literally sleeping together How long has it been considered the norm in our culture to share a bed If you look at the history of beds its actually really weird how its changed Randall says If you look  years ago  everybody slept in separate beds He explains that in the Victorian era especially sharing a bed with your partner was considered unsanitary even dangerous There was this idea that if you were sleeping next to somebody they could be stealing your life forces It was never really defined but basically  our vitality happiness and all these other things he says Randall estimates that it was some time in the s s or even s that it became the norm for American married couples to share a bed  sometime around the era that Freuds theories really took over he says Its just kind of one of those things where now seems like its normal in our culture Randall says But thats just whats popular now New York City psychiatrist Dr Gail Saltz says if youre not going to be sleeping together in the literal sense youll need to make it a point to continue sleeping together in the Biblical sense since sleeping separately takes away some of that spontaneity But if it works for you you dont need to worry that sleeping in separate beds means your relationship is on the rocks   The advice to sleep separately is not for everyone Stanley says If you are happy with your sleeping arrangements then do not change however if you are being repeatedly disturbed from your sleep by your bed partner and this is affecting the way you feel during the day then you may want to consider changing to separate beds or bedrooms
