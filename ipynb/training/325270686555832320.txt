Alarmed by a nation that increasingly equates fresh with healthy the frozen food industry has a message for you What we call fresh in the supermarket is really better termed raw says Kristin Reimers a registered dietitian and manager of nutrition for   A lot of times those vegetables have been transported for days and then sit It could be a matter of weeks between when theyre picked and consumed Frozen vegetables she says are probably more nutrientrich than many of the raw vegetables in the produce section We called Reimers after seeing that the frozen food industry just hired two big ad agencies for a  million campaign to convince us that frozen food is good ConAgra is one member of the new Frozen Food Roundtable along with General Mills Heinz Kellogg and other big manufacturers They have ordered up a campaign designed to change the way consumers think and feel about frozen food by promoting positive messaging regarding the benefits and attributes of frozen food  to   Were going to do this in a way that hasnt been done before says Corey Henry vice president of communications at the American Frozen Food Institute which hosts the Roundtable He told The Salt Youve had various voices weighing in here and there on the value of frozen Here frozen food manufacturers are united to weigh in in a comprehensive fashion The campaign should launch later this year Henry says We at The Salt have plenty of frozen vegetables in our home freezers Brussels sprouts and kale and lima beans to name just a few And the Science Desk freezer is full of singleserve meals that people have stashed for lunch on deadline So we figure this is not an industry on the ropes Indeed frozen vegetables remain popular racking up  billion in sales last year up about  percent Frozen fruit sales totaled  million up  percent according to AFFI And frozen breakfast items have been posting robust sales But in an era when even Wendys is advertising always fresh never frozen producers worry that longevity and convenience are no longer selling points particularly among  to yearolds One industry survey found that people are more positive about frozen vegetables than they are about frozen entrees with significant concerns with the nutritional value and a general feeling that frozen foods are not as good as fresh according to   Newer technologies like steaming and special baking trays have made frozen foods taste fresher and reduced problems from inconsistent heating in microwaves Reimers says  comparing the nutrient content of frozen vegetables with fresh find that frozen ones are almost as good But there are plenty of variables including how long fresh vegetables have been stored since picking how long their frozen counterparts have been interred in the home freezer and how both types are cooked In a   that ConAgra posted on YouTube last month two women text each other as each heads off to the farmers market to buy fresh veggies Oh my gosh I almost forgot about this work party tonight Jen texts from amid the broccoli I know I was just about to grab fresh vegetables to go with dinner tonight but running short of time now Shana texts back Shana abandons the farmers market heads to the store and buys   What the ad doesnt note is that the meal has  calories  grams of fat and  milligrams of sodium   percent of the daily recommended maximum Jen abandons the farmers market heads to the store and buys   FYI It gets  of its  calories from fat and has  milligrams of sodium   percent of the daily maximum Then she tops that off with   with  calories and a whopping  grams of fat Maybe ConAgra needs fictional shoppers who make healthier choices Or maybe the frozen food industry really needs that  million image makeover
