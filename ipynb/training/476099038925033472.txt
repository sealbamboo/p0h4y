Heres a bit of reassuring news  children who must get multiple Xrays and CT scans because of heart disease dont have much of a higher risk of cancer later in life from the radiation a new study shows But a few kids who had the most imaging had significantly higher risks  especially girls the team at Duke University Medical Center found In general we found that most of our patients are not getting exposed to really high doses of radiation so their lifetime risk is not that great said Dr Kevin Hill a cardiologist at Duke who led the study There was a subgroup of very complicated patients who did have a higher risk Hills team studied  children under the age of  who had surgery for heart disease at Duke between  and  They gauged their radiation dose to calculate and project their lifetime cancer risk Its an issue because children are three to four times more likely to develop cancer from exposure to ionizing radiation like that given in an Xray or computed tomography CT scan Radiation exposure in childhood is of particular concern because children have immature developing organ and tissue structures Hills team wrote in their report published in the journal Circulation These kids got an awful lot of imaging   Xrays CT scans and other procedures before during and after surgery The Xrays didnt deliver much radiation at all Hills team found The big culprits are   and CT scans They can deliver up to  times more radiation than a standard Xray Children who got many of these complicated and timeconsuming scans did get enough radiation to triple their risk of cancer Hill found On average children dont have a high risk of cancer though so even doubling or tripling that very low risk still doesnt make them very likely to develop cancer Even though their risk is threefold greater it is not necessarily a high risk Hill said I think it is important for parents to understand that there is a small amount of risk Doctors can and should do their best to minimize radiation exposure Hill said New technology can help with this as can techniques that make it necessary to use the shortest possible burst of radiation
