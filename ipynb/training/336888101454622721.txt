 We do not yet have the ability to wave a wand over you and take out breast tissue and put in an implant  were not at Star Trek medicine said   a breast surgeon in Burbank Calif who is on the board of the  Ms Jolie said that she completed her reconstructive surgeries in nine weeks but for many patients the process takes closer to nine months Three months is probably a little unusual said Dr Gregory R D Evans in Orange Calif president of the   I usually tell my patients it will take about a year And it is major surgery Even with the best plastic surgeon breast reconstruction carries the risks of infection bleeding anesthesia complications scarring and persistent pain in the back and shoulder Implants can rupture or leak and may need to be replaced If tissue is transplanted to the breast from other parts of the body there will be additional incisions that need to heal If muscle is removed longterm weakness may result A syndrome called upper quarter dysfunction  its symptoms include pain restricted immobility and impaired sensation and strength  has been reported in over half of breast cancer survivors and may be   according to a  study in the journal Cancer People have to understand its not a breeze said Geri Barish president of   and a threetime survivor of breast cancer I dont want people to think this is the cureall that this is it hurry up run out and get the test and have your ovaries and breasts removed 
 An array of new techniques each with its own risks and potential benefits makes for bewildering options for women The first choice in breast reconstruction is whether to have implants or to make the new breast from muscle or fat and skin taken from elsewhere in the body often from the abdomen  socalled autologous tissue transfer More plastic surgeons are familiar with implants and the procedure is less expensive than tissue transfer Of the  women who had reconstruction last year in the United States a vast majority opted for implants with  choosing silicone and  choosing saline according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Just over  women chose autologous tissue transfer Many surgeons believe silicone implants confer a more natural look than saline despite a longrunning controversy over their safety The Food and Drug Administration allowed silicone implants back on the market in  after studies showed they did not increase the risk of immune disease A new type is filled with a thick gel that may pose less risk of leakage Whether they are silicone or saline however implants do not last a lifetime As many as half need to be replaced or removed within  years according to the American Cancer Society The implants can rupture cause infections and lead to pain Scar tissue often forms around the implants making the breast hardened or misshapen Last year alone there were  procedures done to remove breast implants Reconstruction may be started at the same time as the mastectomy or later Usually the first step is to place a socalled tissue expander under the chest muscle which normally presses against the ribs The surgeon injects saline into the balloonlike pouch at regular intervals several weeks apart to create space for the implant Eventually the expander is removed and replaced with the implant Unlike breast tissue which sits on top of the chest muscle the implant is situated under the muscle which holds it in place The process can take several months longer if problems develop or the patient needs other treatment like radiation which tends to damage the surrounding skin and make it less hospitable to an implant In autologous tissue transfers muscle skin or fat from another part of the patients body substitutes for an implant Some surgeons believe this creates a more naturalfeeling and naturallooking breast There are several options The   uses tissue and muscle from the lower abdomen to shape a breast mound But the surgery weakens the abdominal area and at Johns Hopkins Breast Center the procedure has been abandoned because of the risk of hernias and abdominal bulges and limitations on lifting after surgery Instead some surgeons now perform the   which uses only abdominal skin and tissue not muscle to create the breast Both the TRAM and DIEP surgeries are lengthy procedures that can last  hours and can lead to a complication of necrosis or tissue death if there isnt adequate blood supply Dr Attai said A third type of flap procedure relies on back muscle that is moved under the skin to the front of the chest but this can weaken the back shoulder or arm In yet another procedure the gluteal free flap tissue and muscle from the buttocks are used to create a breast mound Reconstruction of the nipple has long been a challenge Surgeons have used incision scar tissue or tissue taken from the groin or between the buttocks to craft nipples Tattoos are also used to darken the areola with D tattoos that create the impression of a nipple With a nipple and skinsparing mastectomy the surgeon removes all of the glandular breast tissue while preserving the skin areola and nipple much as one might scoop all the fleshy fruit out of an orange and leave the skin intact This is the procedure Ms Jolie had Yet even when it is successful the nipples usually lose sensation and are numb and cannot play the same role in sexual arousal as before surgery Residual breast cells may be left behind and there is a concern that these may become cancerous The American Society of Breast Surgeons has established a nipplesparing mastectomy registry to track patient outcomes A potential complication of nipplesparing surgery is necrosis of the nipple and areola One recent study found that onefourth of patients developed partial necrosis in the areola and nearby skin and   The choices to be made in breast construction or whether to have it at all are highly individual Some patients just dont want more than one incision and want to avoid autologous tissue for that reason Dr Attai said Other patients want to avoid having a foreign body inside them and therefore opt against implants Many women say plastic surgeons push them to choose larger implants Some women worry that function can be sacrificed for form in the reconstruction process leading to restricted mobility and pain that limits everyday tasks like driving and sitting at a computer as well as more vigorous activities like biking or skiing While women should know about the options all the options may not be good for you as an individual Dr Attai said It is wise to get several opinions she added because surgeons have their own preferred techniques and biases Whatever procedure is chosen infections are a common complication requiring aggressive treatment with antibiotics and often surgery to remove implants One  study estimated infections occur in   Though rare it is possible for cancer to occur or recur in a reconstructed breast because some breast tissue remains Recurrence happens in  percent to  percent of patients according to Dr Attai as it does for women who have mastectomy without reconstruction Recurring cancers can be somewhat easier to detect in breasts reconstructed with implants than with tissue transfer she noted Though there has been concern that the nipplesparing procedure might lead to more frequent recurrence of cancer a recent review found that just  Cost is an important consideration A federal law passed in  required insurance plans and health maintenance organizations that pay for mastectomy to also cover the cost of reconstructive surgery But the availability of plastic surgeons varies by region and many do not accept insurance reimbursement Women may also face deductible payments as high as  with some plans and those on Medicaid may face long waits because of a shortage of plastic surgeons who do breast reconstruction and accept this insurance While many women without cancer may now seek genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA  and BRCA  genes they must meet certain criteria to be reimbursed by insurance doctors say The criteria vary by insurer   for instance covers testing if there is a known mutation in a family member or a first or seconddegree relative has developed breast or ovarian cancer The test is expensive about  and a negative test result for known genetic mutations does not necessarily mean a womans overall breast cancer risk is negligible experts say A lot of people with a strong family history of breast cancer discover they have no genetic mutation at least not one we know about said Dr Marisa Weiss an oncologist and founder of   While they may be relieved they dont have BRCA  or  obviously something is going on if a family is significantly affected 
 
The test results can be ambiguous finding what is called a variance of uncertain significance or changes in the genetic code that are not well understood said   director of the   at the University of Pennsylvania Minority patients have a higher rate of such results she said The finding usually results in more frequent monitoring for cancer For all women other options for reducing breast cancer risk include breastfeeding and avoiding both oral contraceptives and hormone therapy Dr Weiss said Treatment with tamoxifen also appears to reduce the risk for BRCA mutation carriers None of these steps however will reduce the risk as significantly as prophylactic mastectomy and surgery to remove the ovaries Dr Weiss said Ms Jolie has said indicated that she may undergo surgery to remove her ovaries Ovarian cancer is so hard to detect that it often is found only at an advanced stage But removal of the ovaries leads to immediate menopause and may adversely affect quality of life in drastic ways The multiplicity of treatment options and the persistent uncertainties about which is appropriate to an individual patient mean that decisions about preventive mastectomy have not grown easier only harder Many physicians are concerned that women especially those traumatized by loss of a family member to cancer may make hasty choices We have had a rush of phone calls coming in with this idea Should I be getting my mastectomy  Dr Domchek said But every surgical procedure comes with potential complications and we need to attempt to balance the risk and benefit
