UK drugs firm AstraZeneca has rejected the new takeover offer from Pfizer The US company had earlier   it was offering for AstraZeneca to the equivalent of  a share valuing the firm at bn  the new terms offered were inadequate substantially undervalue AstraZeneca and are not a basis on which to engage with Pfizer If the deal were to go through it would be the biggest takeover of a UK company by a foreign firm AstraZeneca employs more than  staff worldwide with  in the UK Pfizer  whose drugs include Viagra  has a global workforce of more than  with  in the UK Announcing Pfizers new offer Pfizer chairman and chief executive Ian Read said the firm believed that there is a highly compelling strategic business and financial rationale for combining our businesses with significant benefits for shareholders and stakeholders of both companies We believe our proposal is responsive to the views of AstraZeneca shareholders and provides a sound basis upon which to arrive at recommendable terms for the combination of our two companies Pfizer also   to try to address concerns over the bid On Wednesday   about possible UK lab closures following a Pfizer deal and a committee of MPs is considering an inquiry into the issue Pfizer told Mr Cameron it would go ahead with Astras planned research and development RD base in Cambridge and retain its Macclesfield manufacturing facilities Pfizer also pledged that if the deal went ahead  of the combined companys RD workforce would be based in the UK The US firm said its commitments would be valid for five years unless circumstances changed significantly Business Secretary Vince Cable told the BBC Weve now received some assurances from the company that they will strengthen the British science base they will protect British manufacturing We need to look at that in detail we need to look at the small print we need to establish that it is binding but as far as it goes on the basis of what weve seen so far it is welcome and encouraging On Friday Conservative peer Lord Heseltine   to intervene in foreign takeovers if crucial UK interests were at risk On Monday it emerged that Pfizer had originally made a takeover approach for AstraZeneca in January worth  a share which was rejected The latest offer from Pfizer is a mixture of cash and shares equivalent to  per AstraZeneca share If the deal goes through Pfizer also wants to establish its corporate and tax residence in the UK as well as its European headquarters AstraZenecas board said the offer was too low and that it believed a major driver for Pfizers takeover was the move to establish a tax residence in the UK by changing its company structure The large proportion of the consideration payable in Pfizer shares and the taxdriven inversion structure remain unchanged Accordingly the board has rejected the proposal AstraZeneca said Leif Johansson chairman of AstraZeneca added that the companys product pipeline of new drugs was rapidly progressing Pfizers proposal would dramatically dilute AstraZeneca shareholders exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its delivery Mr Johansson said Heather Self a tax expert at Pinsent Masons told the BBC Pfizer wants to put a UK company on top of the whole group which is taking the whole company outside the US tax system US federal corporation tax is  while the UKs rate is  and is due to be cut to  in  But Ms Self added that a significant tax gain for the UK would be unlikely All it will mean is moving a few senior people here and having a few board meetings here It doesnt mean anything for the UK tax industry she said Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna expressed concerns over job security for AstraZeneca staff Pfizer has a very poor record on previous acquisitions Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry our second biggest pharmaceutical firm to basically be seen as an instrument of tax planning he said The GMB union which represents workers at AstraZenecas Macclesfield plant called for the proposed deal to be investigated on competition grounds and queried Pfizers promises over UK jobs Pfizer are said to have given undertakings to the UK Government as they increase the money they are offering the AstraZeneca shareholders said Allan Black GMB national officer for the chemicals industry Similar undertakings were given by US multinationals before which have proved to be worthless The GMB also questioned how committed Pfizer was to manufacturing and RD in the UK In  Pfizer laid off  staff from its research facility at Sandwich in Kent Pfizer walked away from a purpose built manufacturing plant in an economic bleak spot in Kent with the loss of many jobs Mr Black said The Institute of Directors IoD said that the government should not be involved as the matter is for  directors and shareholders to decide The IoD does not support any extension of any national interest test for takeovers said IoD director of corporate governance Roger Barker Takeovers are primarily a matter for boards and shareholders to determine not government
