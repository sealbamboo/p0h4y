 Shortages of key   are posing a real hazard to patients throughout the United States a new report finds The shortages are making it even more difficult to treat whats known as multidrugresistant forms of the infectious respiratory illness the researchers said These patients often require socalled secondline drugs when the medication of choice fails For example the new report cites the  case of a father and his infant child who had each contracted TB Despite intensive efforts by public health personnel to obtain the two drugs needed the initiation of treatment was delayed by eight days for both patients prolonging the fathers infectious period and thereby increasing the risk for transmission to the community wrote a team led by Dr Barbara Seaworth of the University of Texas Health Science Center Matters were even worse for the   and was placed in a particularly dangerous situation the researchers noted TB meningitis in young children is a medical emergency and delays in treatment lead to worse outcomes such as severe mental impairment   and death according to the report published in the Jan  issue of the   a journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In this case both the father and baby did recover fully but not every case involving drug shortages may turn out so well the experts said In the new study the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association surveyed TB programs across the United States and found that  percent of those that reported having patients with multidrugresistant TB also said they had problems obtaining the medicines needed to treat these patients All of the programs that reported difficulties in obtaining drugs to   listed nationwide shortages of the drugs as one of the reasons for the difficulties according to the report In an accompanying editorial experts noted that since September  the   has been precarious Kanamycin is no longer produced in the United States streptomycin has been intermittently unavailable because of increased international demand and capreomycin and amikacin have been available on an intermittent basis in only small amounts because of manufacturing problems and lack of raw materials according to the editorial Other causes included shipping delays noted in  percent of cases lack of resources  percent and the complicated process of obtaining certain drugs  percent As a result of difficulties obtaining drugs to treat multidrugresistant TB  percent of the TB programs reported delays in treating patients  percent said there were lapses or interruptions in patient treatment and  percent said they were forced to use an inadequate  and potentially less effective  treatment regimen Shortages disrupt the flow of care as well the editorial pointed out leading to rationing increased drug costs and inefficient use of staff time They also increase the risk for medication errors because regimens must be adjusted leading to confusion over drug administration schedules adverse reactions side effects and drugtodrug interactions the experts wrote Some efforts are underway to help ease the situation In March of  the Federal Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis created a working group to address ongoing drug shortages and in October  a presidential order directed the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Justice to fight drug shortages occurring across the health care spectrum Reliable consistent access to secondline drugs will require the collaboration of CDC FDA state and local health departments national health professional societies and the pharmaceutical industry the study authors concluded
