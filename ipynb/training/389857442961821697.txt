Our new patient was  always a problematic age  old to some young to others He had turned yellow a few weeks before The first thing he did was go to the health food store for liver restoratives When they did nothing he went to his doctors office The doctor wasnt in on Thursdays but the office nurse took one look at the intense lemonyellow of our patients eyes and walked him straight to the emergency room There he had a busy evening in and out of the CT scanner The liver team stopped by He didnt get to his bed on our medical ward upstairsuntil dawn Eighteen hours before he had been riding a crowded subway in from Brooklyn Now he was by far our sickest patient A mass in his pancreas presumably a   was blocking his bile ducts His liver was failing and it was taking the rest of him along with it The next step was to unblock the bile flow and   the mass but that could not be done until his kidneys were functioning his electrolytes were balanced and his blood was induced to clot again The liver doctors scheduled him for Monday giving us the weekend to make all that happen Understandably the patient was a little dazed when we met Friday morning presumably from the combination of a sleepless night bad news and the toxins leaking from his liver Lets do this Monday thing got to know whats going on he mumbled Then he went back to sleep By late Friday afternoon it was clear that we were losing ground Nothing on a general medical ward moved quickly enough to outrace the livers collapse We called the intensive care unit to take him in Two young intensivists came up to evaluate him for transfer both cheerful somethings who looked as if they were still in grade school It took them five minutes to go through the brief chart a minute to chat with our groggy patient another minute to call their supervisor two minutes to write their note and then they were gone Our patient needed comfort care not intensive care they wrote His illness was clearly terminal Had we notified the   service Issued his do not resuscitate orders Located his next of kin We should continue our management on the ward they concluded They would keep an eye on him But they knew as well as we did that nobody with that kind of multiple organ failure makes it through a weekend on an ordinary ward Our patient died Saturday morning after a brief unenthusiastic flurry of resuscitative efforts final diagnosis still unclear In the years since this unsettling  hours of hospital time unfolded Ive revisited it repeatedly trying to sort out what went wrong It seems clear to me that something did go wrong even though all the catchwords of modern care were piously invoked Our patient was never uncomfortable he had no pain at all in fact He was spared the long pointless agony of intensive care for untreatable malignant illness He certainly did not burden the system with unnecessary expense But surely in the huge ocean of medical expense in which we all drown every day he had a few more health care dollars coming to him Those studying how best to deploy the tools of intensive care for people with terminal disease are still   There are the terminal conditions some experts prefer to call lethal ones that will kill the patient no matter what care is provided  fulminant liver failure among them There are the gentlest terminal diseases among them of course life itself Then there are the midrange illnesses intensive care helps for some while for others it just catapults the patient into even worse trouble Our patient almost certainly had a terminal even lethal disease But was he a terminal patient Thats really the question He was far from comprehending his situation let alone making his peace with it A   takes less than an hour to issue a fatal diagnosis but the mind scrambles far behind And what are health care dollars really but bitcoins to feed times meter till mind brain and body are all in the same place If our patient had been  years old we would all have struggled mightily to buy him some time If he had been  we would have been relieved at his merciful end Perhaps what bothers me most is less the fate of our patient than the memory of those two doctors both so young efficiently dispatching a complicated decision in a matter of minutes then dancing off without looking back They knew a lot about the costeffective deployment of intensive care It would have been good to see them spend a little time struggling with the limitations of their analysis
