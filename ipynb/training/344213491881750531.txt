Sometimes it doesnt take a major diet overhaul to get significant health benefits Small changes can be helpful too This seems to be the takehome message from a new study in   linking olive oil and nuts to improved survival from prostate cancer Researchers studied the fat intake of more than  men who had been diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer this is cancer thats still confined to the prostate gland and has not spread to another place in the body It turns out that men who replaced  percent of their total daily calories from carbohydrates such as rice bread and sweets with vegetable fats such as olive oil and canola after their cancer diagnosis had a  percent lower risk of developing lethal prostate cancer and a  percent reduced risk of death during a median of eight years of followup In addition adding a daily ounce of nuts to their diets was linked to an  percent lower risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer So whats at play in the body I think it could be several things study author   of the University of California San Francisco told me by phone Consumption of oils and nuts increases plasma antioxidants and reduces circulating insulin  and inflammatory markers she explains And this could be significant since high levels of insulin cell damage and inflammation can all play a role in the progression of cancer Richman says she wasnt necessarily surprised by the results though the finding that vegetable fat was beneficial was new and worthy of followup studies This was an observational study so its tough to suss out whether its the high intake of vegetable fat   a lower intake of carbs that is responsible for the effect observed As the researchers point out there are lots of men who could potentially benefit from dietary changes The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about    of prostate cancer diagnosed this year And about  million men currently have the disease The findings fit with a larger body of evidence pointing toward multiple health benefits of reducing consumption of refined carbohydrates and replacing foods high in saturated fats with plantbased sources of fat including oils nuts and avocados We asked outside experts who were not involved in the study to comment on the findings These data in cancer patients specifically men with prostate cancer echo what we have seen in healthy individuals wrote  of Johns Hopkins University in an email Vegetable fat mostly oils appear to be beneficial And this year weve seen some of the most convincing   that following a Mediterranean diet rich in fish vegetables beans and fruits  as well as olive oil and nuts  can significantly cut the risk of cardiovascular events such as strokes among atrisk individuals
