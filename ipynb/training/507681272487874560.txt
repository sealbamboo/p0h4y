 One in five child deaths in England could be prevented according to reports in The Lancet Around  die each year with  to yearolds having the highest proportion of preventable deaths from suicide accidents abuse and neglect The University of Warwick researchers said more could be done to cut future deaths by tackling child poverty and spotting serious illnesses sooner Overall child mortality in highincome countries has fallen to very low rates In   looking at child deaths in highincome countries researchers used previously published figures to compare death rates They also looked in detail at patterns of child mortality in England and Wales and sometimes for the UK In the past one hundred years the number of child deaths in England and Wales has fallen in all age groups the report says Infant deaths  before the age of one  which have always shown the highest mortality rates decreased from  per  live births in  to  in  In other age groups deaths have fallen by nearly  since  Deaths of children diagnosed with chronic lifelimiting diseases make up at least half of all child mortality in England and Wales However the report said compared with many other European countries child mortality in the UK remained high because of the income gap between rich and poor The reports found that child mortality rates tended to be higher in the Midlands and north of England and lower in the south and east appearing to affect poorer families disproportionately At all ages death rates were higher in boys than girls  Dr Peter Sidebotham series lead author and associate professor of child health at the University of Warwick said more could be done to prevent child deaths across all age groups It needs to be recognised that many child deaths could be prevented through a combination of changes in longterm political commitment welfare services to tackle child poverty and healthcare services  Politicians should recognise that child survival is as much linked to socioeconomic policies that reduce inequality as it is to a countrys overall gross domestic product and systems of healthcare delivery Focusing on three key areas where child mortality rates could be improved the researchers said strategies to promote a healthy nosmoking lifestyle to women during pregnancy would help to reduce stillbirth and perinatal deaths up to seven days after birth To prevent child deaths due to natural causes they recommended enhanced and extended training of family doctors and improved communication with parents and families when it came to spotting signs of illness or failing health They also said there was a strong economic and ethical argument to target prevention strategies at the most vulnerable to reduce deaths due to injuries and suicides in older children The authors concluded that all countries should explore the different factors that contribute to every child death They said this knowledge could be used to help prevent more deaths Dr Sidebotham said Child death review processes that are being developed in many highincome countries provide important details of the circumstances surrounding a death and can add to a greater understanding of how and why children die  To be effective child death reviews need to conducted by multidisciplinary teams that share information about the circumstances of child deaths with the goal of preventing future deaths and improving child health and welfare  Dr Hilary Cass president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the figures were a serious wakeup call for both healthcare professionals and policymakers She said the high levels of deaths caused by accidents suicides and abuse in yearolds was worrying and action was needed It means equipping all professionals with the knowledge and skills to identify mental health difficulties early better access to mental health support for children and young people and making sure that Ofsteds inspection framework for early years settings schools and colleges includes consideration of the extent to which these settings promote children and young peoples social and emotional wellbeing   She added We also want to see some practical measures such as the reduction of the national speed limit in builtup areas to mph and the introduction of Graduated Licensing Schemes for novice drivers to reduce road deaths
