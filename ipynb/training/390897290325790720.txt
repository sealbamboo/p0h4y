Dengue fever is in Houston And it turns out the mosquitoborne illness isnt exactly a stranger there Dengue has been roaming around the city since  according to a study published Wednesday There was   circulating and we had no idea that it was here because we just werent looking says the studys lead author   of the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Childrens Hospital Like some other warm parts of the US Texas experienced several dengue epidemics in the early s But intensive mosquito control helped curb the illness   along the border with Mexico The latest study shows dengue hasnt been pushed completely to the sidelines About  percent of people infected with dengue dont show any symptoms The other  percent can experience high fever severe headaches rashes and vomiting And in really bad cases a variation called   can make a persons capillaries leaky and bleed The   was published Wednesday in the journal   The fever   in the Florida Keys and moved further   earlier this year But the type of fever in Florida is different from the type found in Houston and that poses another problem If a person experiences one type and then suffers from another the chances of having the hemorrhagic variety is much more likely says   dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine If you recover from one type of dengue and then you have antibodies to the virus having antibodies to one strain and then being infected with a second strain seems to work in synergy against you he tells Shots In the current study Murray and her colleagues looked at samples of blood serum and spinal fluid collected between  to  from people with serious illnesses most likely brought on by infections Among  samples the researchers found  that were positive for dengue fever While that may not sound like very many the samples came from the sickest people which could mean there was an undercount of the fuller disease picture It was pretty clear we had an outbreak that occurred in  that would be classic as far as what we would think of as dengue transmission and then we saw sustained transmission in  and  Murray tells Shots At first researchers thought dengue came back because travelers were carrying it from Central America where the illness is entrenched But some samples positive for dengue came from people who never left the city So it became clear those cases hadnt been imported Theres no treatment or vaccine currently for dengue fever So for now Murray says the goal is to mitigate the spread of the fever as much as possible and to have doctors on board to check for the fever when dengue season comes back around next summer
