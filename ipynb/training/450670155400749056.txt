Despite several wellpublicized accidents like the   just  the popularity of extreme sports has soared in recent years Participants in the X Games and other sporting events regularly perform heartstopping tricks on skis and snowboards skateboards and mountain bikes all of them endlessly replayed on YouTube and television for a growing audience of thrillseekers Unfortunately many young people eager for an adrenaline rush are trying to copy their extreme sports idols putting themselves at terrible risk Filled with overconfidence many participants lack the skills and training for these stunts And often they fail to use safety equipment that could reduce the risk of serious injury Amateurs without referees coaches or medical personnel around can end up with broken bones crushed skulls severe   ruptured blood vessels or lifelong disability  if they survive More than four million injuries attributed to extreme sports occurred from  through  according to data collected by the   In the firstever study of the nature of these injuries   an orthopedic surgeon at Western Michigan University School of Medicine and her colleagues examined the incidence of head and neck injuries the most serious hazards short of death At the recent annual meeting of the   Dr Sabesan reported that more than   including skateboarding snowboarding mountain biking and motocross Her analysis showed that  percent were head injuries and  percent neck injuries with  percent described as severe resulting in potential lifelong disability or death The level of competition and injuries were seeing keep rising Dr Sabesan said in an interview Many do recover but not necessarily without longterm consequences Dr Sabesan noted that head and neck injuries were of particular concern because of the increased awareness of their short and longterm consequences concussions fractures and traumatic brain injuries which can result in outcomes such as   headaches   and death Skateboarding caused the most head and neck injuries more than  reported during the studys  years Snowboarding produced more than  such injuries while skiers experienced more than  and motocross participants more than  Dr Sabesan said that not only were more people engaged in extreme sports each year but also that the participants were younger With very young kids tearing down ski slopes at  miles an hour the risk of suffering a lifechanging injury is all too real she said Young people often lack judgment she added They see snowboarder Shaun White take the sport to a whole new level and some kids try to emulate his tricks In effect the culture says its OK to try this According to Dr Sabesan skateboarding is particularly hazardous because helmets now routine for skiers are not required Yet she said when you land on your head on concrete or asphalt its not as forgiving as snow The study found the risk of suffering a   while skateboarding was  times that of doing so while snowboarding Her first recommendation to reduce the risk of serious injury is to use proper safety equipment A simple thing like wearing a helmet can go a long way toward preventing a lifelong disability she said Her own experience underscores this advice While training for a triathlon she flipped over the handlebars of her bike and landed on her head A helmet protected her brain My yearold nephew Sam was spared permanent disability by the protective garments he wore during a terrifying fall while biking on a mountain trail two summers ago Coming very fast downhill into a blind turn he said he was able to hop over two logs across the trail but his front wheel caught the third log and he was catapulted over the handlebars He landed on his head hard enough to split his helmet He was knocked unconscious and badly banged up but no bones were broken and his brain recovered fully I was wearing a fullmask helmet and a full upperbody suit of armor called a pressure suit as well as knee and shin guards he said The suit and guards protected a shoulder and knee that also landed hard he said but if I hadnt been wearing that helmet I probably wouldnt be here Even after sustaining serious injuries extreme sports participants often come back for more Dr Sabesan said she recently treated a yearold woman for a broken arm and two fractured femurs suffered while she attempted a jump at an allterrainvehicle racetrack in Michigan The woman who works as a bank manager had previously suffered a broken neck and ribs in a similar accident The occurrence of serious injuries is definitely increasing as participation rates in extreme sports go up Dr Sabesan said Yet she added adequate studies of the associated risks have not been done We have no baseline she said No one is monitoring injuries that occur during the X Games Theres minimal literature on hip and knee dislocations broken bones or the longterm effects of head and other injuries Dr Sabesan said her findings pointed to the need for trained supervision and medical assistance at extreme sports events as well as proper training of participants and mandated safety equipment Her message to parents Require children who skateboard to wear a helmet and elbow and wrist guards Snowboarders whose feet are strapped to the board should wear wrist guards to protect them if they fall on outstretched hands And of course everyone on a bike skis or a board should wear a helmet designed for the activity
