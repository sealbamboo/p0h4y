Two things we love about the Saucony Breeze Vest ($75; . ): The extra length in back helps keep your derriére discreet, and the bold hue stands out in low-lit areas.. Pair the Puma Mesh Cover Up ($50; . ) with a neon .  and you'll be serving up serious '80s style. Bonus: It's nice and airy, so you won't overheat when you sweat.. Featherlight yet unbelievably strong, the windproof New Balance Ultra Jacket ($125; . ) protects you from sudden gusts. Also handy: There's a chest pocket.
