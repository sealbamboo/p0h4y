When her first child Lane was born two years ago Texas optometrist Erin Taylor was back in the office giving eye exams within a week When her second son Rhett arrived in February the Amarillo mother says she treated herself to a longer maternity leave  days  People thought I was absolutely crazy said Taylor  who is selfemployed with three staffers to support But I was like you tell me Whos gonna pay the bills Across America growing numbers of new mothers  from professionals like Taylor to those in lowerpaid service and retail jobs  say theyre feeling financial and personal pressure to get back to work very quickly often within days or scant weeks after giving birth I originally planned to take six weeks off but I came back in three said Lauren Anderson  a hairstylist at the upscale Square Colour Salon and Spa in Las Vegas Nev  She was worried about the money sure  Anderson pays  a week rent for her salon chair and doesnt earn when she cant work  but she also was concerned about abandoning her established clients for too long even when she directed them to competent replacements  Just being the controlling person that I am I was wondering is this person going to do it the same said the mother of monthold McKenna What am I going to have to fix About twothirds of US women are employed during pregnancy and about  percent of them report taking some time off according to most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics The average maternity leave in the US is about  weeks but about half of new moms took at least five weeks with about a quarter taking nine weeks or more figures showed  But a closer look shows that  percent of new moms took only one to four weeks away from work after the birth of a child  and  percent took no formal time off at all returning to job duty almost immediately  That means more women are coping with pregnancyweary bodies the demands of a newborn and the demands of a boss  all before the Welcome Baby flowers have wilted on the bedside table Research has shown that shorter leaves can interfere with recommended breastfeeding duration and may contribute to higher rates of depression among new moms  And the women themselves say they were swamped trying to juggle so many roles at once  It was trying to wear all hats  being a doctor and caring for my patients being an employer and all the decisions and responsibilities of running a business and caring for a newborn trying to figure the mommy thing out and getting to know your baby Taylor recalled Still its a trend that appears to be accelerating said Rosemary Haefner the vice president of CareerBuildercom a job board site that conducts annual surveys of workplace metrics  In  the companys snapshot poll of about  working parents found that one in  women took two weeks or less of maternity leave This years results place that number at one in eight  Its small but its going up Were seeing some shifts said Haefner There are some very tough decisions being made by families about how much they can afford while out on maternity leave Part of the change is simply because womens income has become more important More than twothirds of mothers overall are in the labor force and a record  percent of households with kids under  have moms who are the sole or primary source of income  of US Census data showed The contributions that women make to household incomes are no longer the icing on the cake theyre half the cake said Ken Matos senior director of employment research and practice at the Families and Work Institute  Sarah Strydom  of Topeka Kansas said she was her familys chief breadwinner when her only child Ruan was born four years ago  I worked from home the minute I got back said Strydom who is an executive in her familyrun printing business Our website went live the same day my son was born and I was checking email on my Blackberry from my maternity bed Although shes part of the clan Strydom said she feels as much pressure  or more  than nonrelated employees  And part of the trend may be because America continues to lag so far beyond the worlds developed nations in its policies for parental leave The US is one of only eight countries  out of   that does not offer paid leave according to a recent analysis by Jody Heymann dean of the school of public health at the University of California Los Angeles and author of the new book Childrens Chances How Countries Can Move from Surviving to Thriving In the US the yearold Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees that larger employers and public agencies offer  weeks of unpaid leave plus health benefits for the birth or adoption of a child and other family care responsibilities  But about  percent of workers are left out because the law only applies to companies with  or more employees and it requires that workers have been at the firm a year and have worked  hours in the past  months Plus its unpaid and many workers simply cant afford the time off  When they can afford it competitive work environments and professional demands may cause women to cut short their leave  even when their companies allow it Thats true in fastpaced pressured jobs like law media and technology where workers are expected to be accessible at all times said Matos  In those cases some women might feel that taking six months off is going to be a significant bump in their future progression he said In places where even a slight disruption of the forward momentum puts you behind anyone else any time away is a threat to your ability to stay away Because theres no federal policy supporting parental leave most US families simply cobble together their own solutions In the case of Taylor the optometrist she brought both babies to work for the first six months relying on willing staffers to take care of them when she was with patients  Anderson the stylist left her baby daughter with her grandmother when she went back to work early And Strydom the printing firm executive said that staying on the job immediately after childbirth has given her greater flexibility later on Because I didnt take time off when my son was born I dont have any qualms at all about taking the time now she said I choose to work from home if I need to be with him and because Ive shown that I can take on so much my company has allowed me the latitude of creating a really flexible work scheduled to accommodate my family
