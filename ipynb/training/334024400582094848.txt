I now know why I gained more than  pounds in my early s I was lonely I had left my beloved alma mater upstate for graduate school and a job in the Upper Midwest I knew no one and felt like a fish out of water I filled my lonely nights and days with  you guessed it  food Anything I could get my hands on especially candy cookies and ice cream Food filled the hole in my soul at least temporarily No matter how hard I tried I could not rein in my outofcontrol eating until I returned to New York and my family and began dating my future husband Loneliness says   an awardwinning psychologist at the University of Chicago undermines peoples ability to selfregulate In one experiment he cites participants made to feel socially disconnected ate many more cookies than those made to feel socially accepted In a reallife study of middleaged and older adults in the Chicago area Dr Cacioppo and colleagues found that those who scored high on the UCLA Loneliness Scale a widely used psychological assessment ate substantially more fatty foods than those who scored low Is it any wonder that we turn to ice cream or other fatty foods when were sitting at home feeling all alone in the world Dr Cacioppo said in his welldocumented book Loneliness written with William Patrick We want to soothe the pain we feel by mainlining sugar and fat content to the pleasure centers of the brain and absent of selfcontrol we go right at it He explained that lonely individuals tend to do whatever they can to make themselves feel better if only for the moment They may overeat drink too much smoke speed or engage in indiscriminate sex A   found that social isolation is on a par with     lack of exercise or smoking as a risk factor for illness and early death Dr Cacioppo wrote Even without indulging in unwholesome behaviors Dr Cacioppo and others have shown that loneliness can impair health by raising levels of stress hormones and increasing inflammation The damage can be widespread affecting every bodily system and brain function Lisa Jaremka a postdoctoral fellow at Ohio State University reported in January at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology that   indicating more activated viruses in their systems In another study she found higher levels of inflammationinducing substances in the blood of lonely people Chronic inflammation has been linked to heart disease     and even   Dr Jaremka noted People who are lonely also react more strongly to negative events and perceive daily life as being more stressful which can depress the immune system Loneliness can even influence how genes are expressed Dr Cacioppo has found Loneliness predicted changes in DNA transcription that in turn dampened the bodys ability to shut off the   he reported A study by   and colleagues at the University of California San Francisco   and followed them for six years Those who were lonely were more likely to develop difficulties performing activities of daily living like bathing and dressing using their arms and shoulders climbing stairs and walking Loneliness was also associated with an increased risk of death during the study period Its not surprising that loneliness has also been linked to cognitive decline A Dutch study published last year in The Journal of Neurology    Psychiatry found that participants who reported feeling lonely  regardless of how many friends and family surrounded them  were more likely to develop   than those who lived on their own but were not lonely The nearly  participants ages  to  were followed for three years and had shown no signs of dementia at the studys start About half lived alone and  percent reported feeling lonely After adjusting for other factors that are linked to cognitive decline like age   according to Tjalling Jan Holwerda of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam This is not proof that loneliness causes dementia the reverse could be true People whose cognitive abilities begin declining may withdraw from others the authors suggested On the other hand loneliness may result in a lack of sensory and cognitive stimulation which in turn reduces levels of nerve growth factors in the brain and may contribute to dementia The Dutch study among others suggests that how people perceive their situation may have a stronger impact on health than whether they live alone and lack social connections Divorced people have reported feeling lonelier in a bad marriage than they do being single And people who live alone may still have a large network of friends and family that helps to keep loneliness at bay But according to Dr Cacioppo having many friends and family members around does not guarantee immunity from loneliness if the relationships are missing a strong emotional connection The quality of these relationships  how meaningful they are to the individual  counts more than numbers in predicting loneliness his studies and others have shown People are fundamentally social beings who require meaningful connections with others to maximize health and wellbeing Dr Cacioppo suggests reaching out to others with random acts of kindness doing something that helps them physically or emotionally maybe something as simple as complimenting a strangers outfit leaving behind the change in a coffee machine or helping an old person carry groceries or cross the street Next try seeking out social activities that help others while fostering social contacts like volunteering in a soup kitchen reading to the blind or assisting in a classroom Such actions can result in what Dr Cacioppo calls the helpers high establish new friendships and counter a feeling of aloneness Whats required he wrote is to step outside the pain of our own situation long enough to feed others Real change begins with doing You wont know whether what you do will result in a genuine connection to another person unless you try While I have always been outgoing since my husbands death Ive tried even harder to connect with people in ways that make us all feel good For example on learning that an acquaintance at the Y needed pants from a store I was going to pass I offered to get them for her an exchange that enriched us both
