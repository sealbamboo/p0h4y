The program that brings them together called Meet and Move began just a few weeks ago but Ive already noticed a significant boost in my spirits said Ms Mariner  Four years ago she moved in with her ailing mother now  and in need of a great deal of help I was getting tired mentally and physically she said Besides walking with other caregivers twice a week Ms Mariner religiously monitors the pedometer that the program provided often she adds a minute amble after work or parks her car at the far end of the supermarket lot aiming to record  steps a day She has come to recognize she said that I have to take better care of myself in order to take care of Mom Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation wanted to help family caregivers take a break get some exercise and connect with others By focusing on caregivers we could improve the health and wellbeing of seniors and at the same time deal with the tremendous caregiver burden and burnout we see in our daily practices said Dr Sangeeta Kopardekar chairwoman of geriatrics and palliative care at El Camino Loneliness and social isolation are big issues for caregivers she added As caregivers walk and talk on Saturday mornings or Thursday afternoons or turn out for a salsa dance class Wednesday nights though conversation might prove more difficult there she hopes that they will eventually form informal support networks Traditional support groups serve that purpose too and have been shown to reduce caregiver stress and depression But not everyone wants to sit in a circle of chairs and share Some might find exercise also a potent way to relieve stress and improve health more palatable We are learning more about caregiver burden and its potentially pernicious effects Caregiver stress increases the likelihood of depression other mental health symptoms and illness said Steven Zarit a Penn State geriatric psychologist who has led research on the topic for years Predictable breaks from caregiving he and his team have shown are very important emotionally but also at a physiological level A study by Mr Zarit and his colleagues recently published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry is among the first to demonstrate that a helpful intervention   The researchers asked  caregivers who lived with relatives who had received a diagnosis of dementia  one of the higheststress situations  to collect their saliva five times a day for eight days Later analysis showed that caregivers levels of DHEAS a hormone that protects against the harmful effects of other stress hormones were significantly higher on days after their relatives attended an   In nightly phone interviews the caregivers also scored higher on scales measuring positive mood on those days reporting greater cheerfulness calm and closeness to others Might other kinds of interventions  like regularly walking with other caregivers  have similar physiological effects Its hard to say and the Meet and Move program isnt designed to find out But early participants   have enrolled to date most women most caring for a spouse or parent  seem enthusiastic Sometimes you just need to talk about it said Margaret Hsieh  who shares the care of a demanding yearold mother It was a godsend to get to know other people in a similar situation And it gets us out To help keep participants active and connected Meet and Move provided water bottles and pedometers to those who signed up and asked them to log their physical activity and social interactions A facilitator stays in touch by email sometimes forwarding articles of interest Every four weeks those who send in their logs receive a  Visa or MasterCard gift card In parts of the country with lessenviable weather of course people starting such efforts would have to do some of their walking in malls or other climatecontrolled places with less sunshine and fewer hummingbirds I could also envision a more targeted reward for participating an hour of home care Meet and Move or similar programs could negotiate volume discounts with agencies then provide caregivers with that rare thing an hour off the clock Though Ms Mariner I should add sounded quite pleased about her gift card She works nearly full time in addition to taking care of her mother and she knew just how she planned to use it Im going to get a massage she said
