More young women than ever are donating their eggs to help other people become parents according to a new report in the Journal of the American Medical Association From  to  the number of donor eggs used for in vitro fertilization or IVF increased about  percent from  to  The increase in egg donation is more likely due to advances in assisted reproductive technology and more acceptance of the idea culturally Dr Jennifer Kawwass of Emory University who led the study I think that there are more yearolds who are more comfortable with the concept I think that the concept of donor eggs is becoming more acceptable Kawwass says The report includes some great news for women who want to be moms but have had trouble getting pregnant using their own eggs Donor eggs reduced some of the complications often found in pregnancy as women get older For example the numbers show a low risk for premature birth and a higher rate of single births vs multiple births when using a donor egg  But some doctors and advocates worry that too little is known about the longterm health and psychological impacts on the egg donors themselves  young women usually between the ages of  and  Its true that using donor eggs reduces the risk to babies and mothers of having pregnancy complications and if were able to avoid the risk of multiple gestations that might be an argument to use donor eggs more frequently says Dr Evan Myers a professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University who wrote an editorial accompanying the report But if thats going to happen then we really need to be able to give the donors better information about how to make the decision The findings were based on data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from  clinics  thats  percent of all fertility centers in the US Researchers found that the number of women donating eggs has increased and so has the number of women using those eggs intending to become mothers  The easy explanation behind the increase would be that more young women are donating eggs because of the challenging economy And anecdotally fertility center workers do say they see more interest from potential egg donors in tough economic times  Especially in times of recession we get way way way more calls from donors Its definitely monetarybased says Robin von Halle president of Alternative Reproductive Resources in Chicago But most people do have altruistic reasons that motivate them because its not a quick buck Just for the money its kind of a lot to go through Kawwass doubts this She notes the rate of compensation stayed the same throughout that decade and there wasnt any spike in donors in  or the years that followed I honestly think its more that theres a higher demand than that theres a higher supply says Kawwass Undergoing the hormone treatments and the surgical treatments required to donate the eggs does carry some risks both physically and psychologically and some doctors argue these risks are not well understood Theres certainly information available about motivation for egg donors and different psychological aspects but nowhere near as robust as for the women who are using those eggs says Dr William Schlaff professor and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia  And Myers says while its wonderful that this new report suggests that pregnancies that result from egg donations go well we dont know much about what happens to the egg donors themselves What we dont know is are there longterm impacts of undergoing this for somebodys future fertility Particularly if theres someone whos an egg donor in her s and herself waits until her s to try to get pregnant Myers says I think this whole area its also one of the areas in medicine where its as close to a free market as possible Its a wide open area and there really isnt much research That might be at least in part because the idea of paying someone in exchange for their biologic property makes many people really really uncomfortable The American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that payments to donors higher than  require justification and that anything above  is inappropriate When Raquel Cool donated her eggs in  she was  and its true she was initially attracted by the money   But she also loved the idea of helping a family have a child and she was also fascinated by the technology  After her eggs were harvested however she developed a moderate case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or OHSS which occurs when hormones overstimulate the ovaries causing them to become very swollen  sometimes softballsized Myers says Fluid leaks out of the ovaries and into the belly and chest In severe cases the young woman will need to be hospitalized in order to drain the excess fluids in mild cases the symptoms go away with rest But we dont have great details on how common it is Myers says It was uncomfortable but Cool recovered at home and shes healthy now Throughout the entire egg donation process though she says she mostly just felt really alone It was a difficult ordeal both physically and emotionally  and although she believed in what she was doing there was no one to talk to about what she was going through   I think I really underestimated the extent to which being a donor would have a lasting impact on my identity she says So earlier this year Cool began   from other women about their egg donation experiences So far she and her colleagues have spoken to  women Every experience is unique I think in the  years that donor eggs have been used that very few questions have been asked toward us donors about how we feel about the experience says Cool who is now  and lives in Santa Cruz Calif Its sort of dizzying and it can be very very isolating
