An advisory from the Food and Drug Administration that strongly cautioned doctors against performing a common surgical procedure on women is upending the landscape of gynecological care across the U.S.. The FDA surprised gynecologists last month when it issued an advisory against using a device called a laparoscopic power morcellator, saying it can spread a dangerous hidden cancer. The bladed tool is used in minimally invasive surgeries to slice up and remove uterine growths called fibroids, sometimes as part of a hysterectomy.
