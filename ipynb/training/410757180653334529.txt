Within a week after surgery Cox no longer had to take insulin for her type  diabetes In a month she was off her blood pressure medication Over the next several years Cox lost half her body weight eventually settling at a comfortable  pounds  Bariatric surgery carries risk just like any surgical procedure Cox says But I decided for me the risk of staying at  pounds was also very high  Once feared by patients and denounced by primary care physicians bariatric surgery has become more accepted as research shows its not only helping people lose weight but also   and   Severely obese adults who undergo gastric bypass lose on average  pounds in the three years after surgery  or  of their initial weight according to a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association Those who have the adjustable gastric band or LAPBAND procedure lose about  pounds   suggests some of these patients will gain back a portion of the weight over time but the overall health benefits of bariatric surgery are appealing to many struggling with excess weight  People lose sight of the fact that the patients arent just obese but theyre sick bariatric surgeon Dr Alan Wittgrove says Its not as easy as just losing weight  Twenty years ago Wittgrove performed the first laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure It was  and up until that point bariatric surgery had been done through a large incision in the patients abdomen Doctors had to cut through a thick wall of fat Wittgrove says creating an unstable wound that often led to infections hernias and sometimes death  It was big surgery on big patients says Dr Jaime Ponce president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery It really put on a stigma at that time  Wittgroves groundbreaking operation changed all that More than  of bariatric procedures are now minimally invasive and inhospital mortality rates have dropped to  according to a   published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons Ponce says laparoscopic bariatric surgery is now as safe as or safer than gallbladder removal one of the most routine surgical procedures in America  Fewer risks means less fear for obese patients Ponce says In the early s approximately   were undergoing bariatric surgery By  that number had jumped to  cases per year according to the   Since then surgeons have seen a steady number of patients Ponce says although early numbers for  suggest another uptick Physicians are also jumping on board as they see that bariatric surgery is about more than weight loss Wittgrove says  Were seeing more primary care doctors that truly understand the power of these operations he says I think society in general understands that this is the best treatment for    Bariatric surgery works in two ways by limiting the amount of food patients can consume andor by preventing patients digestive systems from absorbing some nutrients The procedures also affect the bodys metabolic hormones such as ghrelin which stimulate appetite  Most people have heard of the RouxenY gastric bypass procedure which was developed in the s With gastric bypass doctors create a smaller stomach pouch that can hold only an ounce of food and connect it to a new section of the small intestine bypassing part of that digestive organ  Also popular is the adjustable gastric banding procedure more commonly referred to as the LAPBAND Doctors place the LAPBAND around a portion of the patients stomach to create a smaller pouch similar to the gastric bypass procedure This band can then be tightened or loosened via a port below the skin of the patients abdomen Unlike the gastric bypass procedure the LAPBAND is reversible  Two other bariatric procedures are also performed in the United States During a sleeve gastrectomy procedure doctors remove  of the patients stomach creating a slim tube or sleeve that foods travels through With a biliopancreatic diversion a portion of the stomach is removed and the remaining tissue is connected to the lower portion of the small intestine  Doctors have discovered that gastric bypass procedures have a nearly immediate effect on patients with type  diabetes The bypass reroutes the intestine Ponce explains allowing food to hit a portion of the bowel that stimulates the pancreas which then produces more insulin  Sometimes patients walk out of the hospital without medications he says There is also data showing the sleeve diversion and band can improve or put diabetes into remission with varying degrees of success Earlier this year the American Medical Association   Many saw the AMAs decision as a step toward getting health insurance companies to accept bariatric surgery as a viable treatment for metabolic disorders like diabetes Although stigma around bariatric surgery has been reduced it still exists Cox says  Theres still that feeling that its drastic that its dangerous she says Some people call it the easy way out And theres nothing easy about having your insides rerouted  Wittgrove wonders if wed have such a negative view of bariatric surgery if obesity wasnt viewed as a lazy persons disease We would never judge someone going into surgery to have cancer removed he says so why do we judge those trying to reverse their diabetes or heart disease  The reality is the year survival rate for some individuals with metabolic disease is less than if they have some cancers he says I dont think bariatric surgery is a radical treatment I think its shown to be the best treatment  If anything shows how perception is changing Ponce says its the name of his professional organization In  the American Society for Bariatric Surgery became the   acknowledging the impact bariatric surgery can have on metabolic disorders Researchers around the globe are following bariatric patients to see if the effects of surgery stick Scientists in Sweden have collected data on  patients for more than a decade Nearly  of their bariatric patients were in remission for type  diabetes two years after surgery compared to just  of nonsurgical weight loss patients  But  years later only  of the surgical patients were still in remission While the researchers noted that this was still higher than the remission rate for those who hadnt had surgery their results illustrate an important point  Bariatric surgery is not a one size fits all approach to weight loss says Dr Anita Courcoulas lead author of the new JAMA study  Courcoulas and her colleagues found their results varied widely between patients More than  needed additional bariatric surgery after their first procedure three died in the month following a gastric bypass More research is needed to determine which patients will be the most likely to benefit from bariatric surgery the scientists say  Its not as predictable as wed like it to be Wittgrove says It works well in some patients doesnt in others We dont really know whos going to be a successful candidate  All Cox knows is that she made the right choice for her Shes been able to keep the weight off successfully for  years  I was looking at a very shortened lifespan she says I have no doubt that Im going to live   years longer because Ive undergone this procedure
