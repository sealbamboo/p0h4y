Over the past few decades changes in the treatment of   amount to a revolution in patient care And its not over yet There was a time when the standard approach was a radical   which involved removal of not just the breast but all the lymph nodes in the armpit and underlying muscles in the chest wall This approach has been replaced by less extensive surgery that through decades of clinical trials has proved to be equally effective at treating patients as well as safer and less disfiguring Even simple mastectomies in which most nodes and the muscles were left intact have become far less common Dr J Dirk Iglehart director of the Susan F Smith Center for Womens Cancers at DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston estimated that he now performs a tenth of the number of mastectomies than when he entered the field in the s Currently most women with earlystage breast cancer have a   only the tumor and a small margin of surrounding normal tissue are removed along with a few lymph nodes Patients then receive localized radiation therapy and often drug therapy to head off a recurrence Even though this approach is less aggressive breast cancer death rates have dropped steadily since  a combined result of earlier diagnosis and medical therapies developed largely through a major national investment in   research according to Dr Clifford A Hudis chief of breast cancer medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York Treatment today is getting much more individualized Dr Hudis said Depending on the molecular nature of a womans tumor postoperative hormonal or other drug treatments are routinely prescribed to prevent or delay a recurrence of disease Still with nearly  breast cancer deaths annually in this country more needs to be done Instead of waiting for cancer to recur in certain highrisk patients scientists are now developing techniques to outsmart the cancer cells aggressive tactics by prompting the patients immune system to launch a continuous attack that keeps the disease at bay indefinitely Even lumpectomy could eventually become a thing of the past if these techniques achieve their early promise Another nonsurgical approach under study involves destroying the tumor by freezing it with an ice probe but leaving it in place so that the immune system can be trained to attack it Dr Hudis said The patient then would be given an immune stimulant to help overcome the molecular obstacles that had kept the immune system from recognizing the cancer as foreign tissue When tumors are more advanced at diagnosis it is already sometimes possible to minimize the extent of surgery without compromising a womans chances of diseasefree survival Fran Saunders  is one of the estimated  American women who will this year learn they have invasive breast cancer The tumor which she noticed herself after skipping   for a few years is confined to the breast region but too large for a lumpectomy So Ms Saunders an administrative assistant from Brooklyn is now undergoing  weeks of   at New York University Langone Medical Center to shrink her tumor after which surgical options will be discussed with her doctor The size of the tumor and presence of positive nodes may not matter as much as we thought said Dr Deborah M Axelrod a surgeon who directs breast cancer programs at the center Its not even true that if the cancer is metastatic its curtains Tests are being developed to help doctors predict an individual patients response to various therapies Dr Axelrod said Patients are encouraged to become wellinformed about their disease and possible therapies and to participate in treatment decisions What a woman chooses may depend on such factors as her age values personal circumstances professional concerns and risk tolerance Theres no right or wrong decision as long as patients are wellinformed and choose what is best for them said Dr Jennifer K Litton a surgical oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston The old days of paternalistic medicine are gone Also gone is the simplistic notion that cancer is a disease of abnormal cell division said Dr Larry Norton deputy physicianinchief for breast cancer programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Its a disease of abnormal relationships between the cancer cell and other cells in its environment This new perspective is leading to changes in treatment he said For example current surgery for breast cancer involves removing only a few lymph nodes for testing which avoids complications like a chronically swollen arm We know that in many cases were leaving behind nodes that contain cancer cells but it doesnt hurt the patient to leave them there Dr Norton said Cancer cells require other cells in their vicinity to help them grow he added Understanding how the cells communicate is opening new opportunities to keep cancer cells from forming a tumor Its not true that if theres one cancer cell left it will definitely grow and cause trouble Knowing that the effectiveness of treatment is reduced once cancer has metastasized  that is spread to other regions of the body  researchers are now testing creative ways to prevent such recurrences One a specially designed vaccine called NeuVax is in the final stage of multinational clinical tests under the direction of Dr Elizabeth A Mittendorf a surgical oncologist at MD Anderson The vaccine is made from a peptide a small piece of a cancer protein that is combined with an immune stimulant Early results suggest that the vaccine can reduce the risk of recurrence by  percent among breast cancer patients whose tumors produce low levels of the protein HER a marker for more aggressive breast cancer Without the vaccine such patients have a  percent chance of a recurrence Dr Mittendorf said Rather than waiting to see if a patients cancer comes back the vaccine is given at the time of initial treatment when few if any cancer cells are present she explained Changes have already taken place in postoperative radiation for breast cancer that reduce side effects and minimize potential longterm damage to organs under the breast After surgery to remove the tumor the breast may be only partly irradiated Radiation can be focused on the cancerous area using a more intense but shorter course of treatment Dr Axelrod said And while chemotherapy is anything but pleasant measures ranging from antinausea medication to massage are now commonly used to minimize patient discomfort
