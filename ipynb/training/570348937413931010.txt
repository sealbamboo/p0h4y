According to the researchers the percentage of lung cancer patients who smoked at least  packyears declined over the study period while the proportion of cancer patients who had quit for more than  years rose  As smokers quit earlier and stay off cigarettes longer fewer are eligible for CT screening which has been proven effective in saving lives said epidemiologist Dr Ping Yang in a statement released by the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Patients who do eventually develop lung cancer are diagnosed at a later stage when treatment can no longer result in a cure Over the study period the percentage of lung cancer patients who would have been eligible for CT screening under current guidelines fell dramatically from  in  to  in  The proportion of men who would have been eligible decreased from  to  while the percentage of women dropped from  to   Researchers worry about the trend We dont want to disincentive patients to stop smoking Midthun told CNN in a phone interview When I told one of my patients about the study his first question was If I stop smoking will I have to stop screening We want people to stop smoking and we dont want them to lie or continue smoking just so they can be screened added Midthun We need better tools to make risk calculations for those who should be screened The Mayo study did not take into account other risk factors for lung cancer such as personal and family history for lung cancer or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD because they are not in the current guidelines for reimbursement   For example COPD raises a persons risk for lung cancer by four to six times said Midthun yet  only age and pack year history are in the guidelines Theres nothing magical in year pack history added Midthun He told CNN that age is an equally important factor For example if a person stops smoking at age  his risk of lung cancer at age  is higher than it was at age  when he quit The study was published in the February   issue of JAMA the journal of the American Medical Association It was funded by the Mayo Clinic and grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging
