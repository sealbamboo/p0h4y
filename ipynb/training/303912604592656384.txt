 The new   as easily as the common cold according to a new study But in the event of a largescale outbreak researchers in Switzerland found the virus  known as HCoVEMC  may be treatable with components of the immune system known as interferons This immunotherapy has shown promise in the treatment of the respiratory disease SARS and   the study authors said Surprisingly this   said study coauthor Volker Thiel of the Institute of Immunobiology at Kantonal Hospital in St Gallen in a news release from the American Society for Microbiology Epithelial cells line hollow organs and glands The other thing we found is that the viruses HCoVEMC SARS and the common cold virus are all similar in terms of host responses they dont provoke a huge innate immune response he said The study was published online Feb  in   HCoVEMC which may have jumped from animal to human very recently was first isolated in June after a man in Saudi Arabia died from a severe respiratory infection and kidney failure Following his death health officials identified  more people infected with the virus the latest in Great Britain So far six of the  people with known infections have died Nearly all patients have lived or traveled in the Middle East Concerns have been raised that the new strain could trigger a pandemic similar to the SARS outbreak of  which infected more than  people and killed  We dont know whether the cases we observed are the tip of the iceberg or whether many more people are infected without showing severe symptoms noted Thiel The World Health Organization on Saturday said that doctors should test patients for the new coronavirus if they have unexplained pneumonia or unexplained complicated respiratory illness not responding to treatment So far no cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the United States according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention To test the new virus the researchers used cultured bronchial cells to mimic the lining of the human airway Although this lining is a key barrier against respiratory viruses the study revealed these cells didnt mount a big defense against HCoVEMC Instead they found human lungs are highly susceptible to the virus which can multiply at a faster initial rate than SARS The study authors noted however that pretreating the airway with proteins that play a critical role in immune response to infections  known as lambdatype interferons  significantly reduced the number of infected cells Although their findings suggest there is promise for an effective treatment against HCoVEMC the researchers added ongoing cooperation between scientists and health agencies around the world is needed to prevent outbreaks of this virus and other diseases
