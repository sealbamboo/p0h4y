A renewed call for an inquiry into Welsh hospitals with the highest death rates has been made by the Welsh Conservatives The party claims four of the six health boards in Wales which have a major hospital have higher than average mortality rates Health Minister Mark Drakeford said changes would be made to the way mortality rates were measured in Wales But he rejected the idea of an inquiry into the matter It comes after it emerged the medical director of the English NHS suggested persistently high death rates in Welsh hospitals should be investigated Sir Bruce Keogh said data on rates in six Welsh hospitals was worrying but not adequate to form a view He called for an inquiry in an email sent in November released under the Freedom of Information Act The Welsh Conservative Party has frequently called for an investigation similar to one conducted by Sir Bruce in England in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal inquiry Neglect and abuse at Stafford Hospital was said to have contributed to hundreds of unnecessary deaths between  and  Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar told an assembly debate on Wednesday that he believed there was an urgent need to look at mortality rates in Welsh hospitals He said public confidence in the NHS had taken a big knock What is there to hide he asked AMs Surely an independent review would be helpful to put things right this has the whiff of a coverup he added Health Minister Mark Drakeford said an inquiry was unnecessary arguing the Welsh NHS had adequate systems in place to respond if things went wrong But he confirmed the Welsh government would overhaul its mortality rate indicator  Four new measures will be published at the end of March which aim to give the public greater clarity about how Welsh hospitals are performing  The calls for an inquiry echo those made by the UK governments Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who called for a proper independent examination of mortality rates in Wales during a Westminster debate He said failings in the Welsh NHS had led to an increase in pressure on the NHS in England Although health is a devolved issue unfortunately failures in care in Wales are now having a direct impact on NHS services in England with a  rise since  in the number of Welsh patients using English AE departments leading to very real additional pressure on border town hospitals said Mr Hunt And what is causing that pressure Dr Dai Samuel of the Welsh BMA describes standards of care in Wales as follows he says its pretty horrific the level of care being given to patients is compromised substandard  we are seeing a miniature Mid Staffs every day Both NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh and president of the Royal College of Surgeons Professor Norman Williams have written to the Welsh authorities calling for action only to be completely ignored In response a spokesman for Mr Drakeford said Jeremy Hunt was today responding to a debate following an unprecedented scandal that occurred in the English NHS  The fact that he wants to drag the Welsh NHS into that debate is shameful  Both debates come as a Welsh government taskforce led by Wales deputy chief medical officer Dr Chris Jones recommended a change in the way death rates were measured in the Welsh NHS  Dr Jones said the aim would be to develop measures which would make it easier to compare hospital performance in specific areas such as in stroke or cardiac care He said current mortality indicators which give a single score to an entire hospital were not a helpful measure of the quality of a complex hospital Currently Wales uses a mortality indicator known as RAMI  which gives each hospital a score  It aims to show whether that hospital has a higher or lower death rate than that which would normally be expected in a hospital of a similar size and type A score of  is considered normal but officials say higher numbers could indicate cause for concern  what has been described as a fire alarm In recent years there has been an improvement in RAMI scores across Wales  but there continues to be big differences between certain hospitals The English NHS uses a different indicator making it almost impossible to accurately compare death rates between the two countries
