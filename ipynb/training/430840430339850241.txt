If youre looking for a silver lining in the coldfest that has been Winter  look no further than your waistline Shivering may be as good as exercise to help you drop a few pounds a new study finds  is linked to a hormone produced by the bodys muscles according to research from the National Institutes of Health published Tuesday in the journal Cell Metabolism When a body trembles from the cold it releases irisin also known as the exercise hormone which stimulates fat tissue to produce heat so the body can maintain its core temperature Irisin was first discovered two years ago and is a kind of messenger hormone relaying beneficial information to body tissues Increases in irisin turns the bodys white fat into the more metabolically active brown fat which helps the body burn more calories It also may make the body more sensitive to glucose The researchers wanted to find out if shivering could produce the same effects on irisin as exercise explains lead author Dr Francesco S Celi chair of the division of endocrinology and metabolism at Virginia Commonwealth University who has been studying adaptive thermogenesis basically how our bodies react to temperature changes From an evolutionary perspective shivering is the last resort to maintain core temperature  Ten healthy volunteers of normal weight and good health participated in three different experiments designed to measure irisin levels First participants exercised at maximal aerobic capacity on a stationary bike Researchers then measured their energy expenditures Blood samples were also taken To induce shivering participants were put under cooling blankets set to slightly more than  degrees Fahrenheit The researchers found that irisin levels produced through exercise were comparable to shivering  To help confirm their results the researchers tested the effects of irisin on cultures of adipose or fat tissue cultures They found that irisin did help stimulate production of specific proteins linked to brown fat essentially making the white fat cultures more similar to that of the more metabolically active brown fat  Although the researchers are not saying we should dump our parkas for tshirts when its  degrees outside they do think there is something to be said for finding ways to burn more energy The general equation is weight gain is a sustained imbalance between energy intake and expenditure and we live in an environment that is completely artificial a perennial spring says Celi who was with the NIH when the research was performed Thats all designed to decrease the amount of energy we need to expend and that can lead to health problems particularly diabetes and other metabolic issues such as lipid profiles The hope is that these findings and others will eventually lead to some type of pharmacologic intervention to promote irisin production and perhaps stem the tide of obesity  Exercise is important but so is weight loss and people often overestimate how much exercise they are doing and wind up eating more says Celi There are not many people who can lose weight just through exercise but if we could find a way to increase brown tissue fat we could help very many people get healthy In the interim we could stand outside for a few seconds or do what a scientist does While Celi doesnt copy one of his colleagues who    only cold showers now he says I did lower the thermostat a bit at home
