LA County Hospital sees some of the worst possible medical cases Patients suffering from gunshots car wrecks and other severe injuries frequently pass through the doors of the Level I trauma center At the same time since its a public hospital LA County ER doctors also often see patients who dont have lifethreatening emergencies but who otherwise lack access to health care The new documentary   goes behind the scenes at the hospital depicting the intense efforts of doctors and nurses as they try to resuscitate patients on the brink of death and cope with the massive volume of people in need The films director Ryan McGarry is a physician specializing in emergency medicine He trained at the hospital which is officially called the Los Angeles CountyUSC Medical Center The film goes beyond the medical drama to show the burdens paperwork can put on the doctorpatient relationship McGarry tells NPRs Arun Rath that   is both a testament to the people who work at the hospital and a critical look at the US medical system  I couldnt believe the volume and the amount of perceived chaos And yet underneath that chaos was a very wellfunctioning machine of resuscitation both for critical illness as well as trauma And I thought My gosh I dont think Americans would believe that this is happening here in a major US city  this type of volume this type of need And its seemingly working out LA County Hospital is one of the first places that emergency medicine was formed as a specialty And its important to recognize that emergency medicine  as is   are actually fairly young I mean these are s s developments in this country When you look at all the specialties of medicine emergency medicine is one of the youngest And so this is where its thought the specialty was born CBooth  its been lost to history but we think that means either Critical Booth or Cardiac Booth  is kind of where the sickest patients would come And as a training physician its where you would oversee up to six or seven or even more of these critically ill patients Even postObamacare were seeing throughout the country emergency room visits go up and that might be counterintuitive But what were finding is that yes more people have access more people are getting insurance cards but those cards arent always premium And were already in a system where a lot of specialists wont take a subpremium insurance card because youre not seen as profitable enough So many people end up coming to public hospital emergency departments just to see an orthopedist or an endocrinologist or someone who wont take their probably decent insurance but its not good enough They moved from an effectively historic landmark building to whats probably one of the most impressive technologyladen medical facilities in the country It was a  billion structure and its packed with absolutely incredible features But what was lost along the way is not so much a reflection of the LA Countys decision to move from one building to another but really a perfect encapsulation of what modern healthcare has become Its sort of become depersonalized as a result of a lot of wellintentioned features whether that be safety regulations or privacy regulations or even a lot of technology I mean think about it The last time you went to the physician or even a nurse practitioners office a computer and a screen and a lot of charting was probably the mainstay of that experience That didnt happen at the old place because it was just so open and intimate I think the major responsibility here is actually on the physicians I think that we have to speak up And probably most doctors have lost control over this  You know oftentimes were the most invested in the patient care Im  in debt I lost every weekend of my s to becoming a physician And yet Im the last one who decides what that patientdoctor experience is going to be like Thats now decided by everyone from politicians to insurance companies to people who got their MBAs online or something Ive invested so much into this idea of the patientdoctor experience and yet Im the last one to really get to say how that experience is going to go So really I think the answer is Docs need to speak up And I think partly thats what   was for me personally  a chance to say OK this is the state of affairs And I dont that we feel like its acceptable
