The use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs significantly reduces the risk for cancer but no one has been able to explain why Now researchers have found that these drugs slow the accumulation of a type of DNA change called somatic genome abnormalities or SGAs that lead to uncontrolled cell growth The scientists studied  people with Barretts esophagus a condition in which cells in the esophagus become damaged usually by acid reflux Sometimes the cells become precancerous and rarely the problem leads to esophageal cancer The researchers tracked SGAs with periodic biopsies over an average of almost  years Over all the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was associated with a  percent reduction in the rate of mutations  We used techniques used to measure mutation rate in viruses like HIV to measure it in humans said the senior author Carlo C Maley director of the Center for Evolution and Cancer at the University of California San Francisco We measured whole pieces of chromosomes that are getting deleted or copied Apparently aspirin slows that rate of mutation The study   is very small Dr Maley said and has yet to be reproduced in a larger population But since most cancers take decades to develop he added if you could just slow it down you could slow it enough to have people die of something else
