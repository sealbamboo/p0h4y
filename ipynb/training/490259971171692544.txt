Psychotherapists have plumbed all sorts of relationships in their quest to understand and improve human communication so perhaps it was only a matter of time before they studied horse sense Herd behavior changing habits building trust  it seems that people have a lot to learn from  Psychotherapist Tara BennettGoleman long ago joined the ranks of those who appreciate the equine perspective She makes a strong case for what horses can inspire us to do as opposed to what we can train them to do in her latest book Mind Whispering A New Map to Freedom From SelfDefeating Emotional Habits which just came out in paperback After the publication of her first book Emotional Alchemy How the Mind Can Heal the Heart BennettGoleman and her horse a yearold mare began studying with renowned horse whisperer RJ Sadowski who trains horses with what he calls horsemindship As she learned how to connect with horses BennettGoleman came to see so many metaphors for human communication that she eventually attained a sort of equine equivalent to a Zen aha moment The way we humans act and think of ourselves as separate and in control of things must appear strange to a horse even predatorlike she writes But horses seem to accommodate our foolish ways accept us anyway and even find creative ways to remind us that were really part of the herd In Mind Whispering BennettGoleman synthesizes mindfulness meditation cognitive therapy a touch of neuroscience and Indian classical dance  and her longstanding love of horses Failing a common verbal language you speak to a horse with body language and we in turn begin to understand them through their movements There are she believes crucial takeaways for      For a human to gain the trust of a horse and eventually acceptance as the dominant herd leader he or she needs to understand the language of a horse This isnt done by force but by the horse developing trust that the human will be a benevolent leader Though being one of the herd has a pejorative implication the lessons from horse whispering suggest that if a person wants to be a good leader in his or her group identifying and empathizing with the groups needs are essential   Horses will sense if youre off balance or unstable when you mount them If they sense youre too insecure to lead them it will make for a bumpy ride so its advisable to take a few minutes to make sure your weight  and your attention  is centered your stirrups are in place and that you are ready for action The same holds true in human endeavors says BennettGoleman People who arrive at work and take some time to settle in at their desk and take a mindful pause before they check incoming emails who look over a report before a meeting and who take a few breaths to review their intentions before the day kicks in will more likely be ready for whatever they undertake    Humans can be either while horses are prey animals that protect one another in a herd If we are predatory we might get what we want but it can harm the connection BennettGoleman says Herd dynamics can be a model for humans With herd animals the relationships are based on trust respect cooperation and connection We can be more aware of our predatorlike habits  like a controlling forceful stance  and adjust to a more empathic way of communicating that considers how the other person may be seeing the situation Then we can work together in a spirit of collaboration and cooperation    Horses are habitual introduce a pattern with which they can become familiar and they keep repeating that pattern good or bad Their bad habits can be changed to good and those good habits can be reinforced through patient retraining This very much dovetails with new neuroscience research called neuroplasticity which suggests that humans can literally change their brains BennettGoleman says We can create new maps of the mind to repattern selfdefeating habits Our work she writes in Mind Whispering is to learn and keep repeating modes that lead to equanimity wisdom and compassion Just as you can lead a horse to water and let it be free to make its own choice she adds in a gentle way we can lead the mind to a more positive way of thinking communicating and acting  and make it part of our nature    September  Omega Institute Rhinebeck NY   September  Harvard Coaching Conference Boston MA   November  Garrison Institute Garrison NY For full schedule and information see
