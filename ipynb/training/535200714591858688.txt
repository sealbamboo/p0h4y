Breaking up fights and chasing and arresting suspects may be the deadliest parts of police duty not only because of the obvious risks of violence but because they may trigger heart attacks An indepth study of what kills cops shows that sudden stress can set off heart attacks The risk of sudden heart death is as much as  times higher when police are struggling to restrain people or fighting a team reports in the journal  We found that stressful and physically demanding law enforcement activities were associated with large increases in the risk of sudden cardiac death compared with routinenonemergency policing activities the team led by Stefanos Kales of the Harvard School of Public Health wrote Law enforcement is already a dangerous occupation In  the fatality rate among patrol officers in the United States was  per  fulltime workers about three to five times the national average for private sector employees the researchers wrote Most are caused by trauma such as shooting or accidents And police already have a high risk of heart disease the No  killer of Americans Kales found in an earlier study for example that threequarters of police officers firefighters and other firstresponders have high blood pressure They looked at two databases covering the deaths of more than  US police officers between  and  from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the Officer Down Memorial Page During that time  police officers had suffered sudden cardiac death About a quarter died while restraining or fighting someone  percent died during physical training  percent died while chasing a suspect  percent died during some sort of rescue operation  percent died while performing routine duties such as desk work or writing parking tickets and the rest were classified as other The risk of dying suddenly was  to  times higher during restraints or altercations and  to  times higher during pursuits Kales and colleagues found For example if police officers spend  percent of their time on routinenonemergency duties we would expect  percent of sudden cardiac deaths to be associated with such duties they wrote But in fact  percent of deaths occurred during nonroutine duties Physical restraints and altercations comprised about  percent of a police officers annual professional time but accounted for  percent of onduty sudden cardiac deaths the team wrote
