By the World Health Organizations official tally the flu pandemic of  killed  people around the world Those are deaths of people who had laboratoryconfirmed cases of the socalled swine flu But a fresh   says the real toll was  times higher  up to  deaths And maybe it was twice that if you count people who died of things like heart attacks precipitated by the flu Lets take the conservative figure of  Thats about the same as a normal flu season So the figure confirms the popular impression that the   pandemic of  was a paper tiger as these things go Or as one NPR listener   back in early  the headline might be Despite PuffedUp Fears Swine Flu Was A Complete And Total Bust Thats an odd complaint of course  as though it would have been better if the  pandemic had been more like the   which killed an estimated  million people around the world But the current study commissioned by the WHO helps explain why the agency struggled so much to calibrate its response to that pandemic and find the right tone for its public messaging WHO leaders were first   for taking too long to declare a pandemic when spread of the disease clearly met its definition Then critics charged the agency with hyping the situation under pressure from vaccine makers who wanted to recoup their investment The low number of laboratoryconfirmed deaths  just   added to the confusion a team of global health researchers write Tuesday in the journal   This modest number has caused many to wonder what all the excitement was about and some to question whether the pandemic response was excessive There were all kinds of conspiracy theories in Europe says the studys lead author   of George Washington University But I cant see how they could have responded in any other way The most important insight from the analysis Simonsen says is that the HN swine flu was hugely variable in how it affected different parts of the world The takehome message is that you can have such heterogeneity in a pandemic she tells Shots It was really truly twentyfold worse in some countries than in others In particular the Americas were much harder hit than Europe or Australia and New Zealand That posed a political dilemma for theWHO a creature of its  member nations  as it tried to organize a coherent global response But even in the same region there were inexplicable variations in severity In Argentina it was very severe and right next door Chile was affected far less says Simonsen Why did the flu have such differential impact Thats the milliondollar question she says Her favorite hypothesis is one that seems surprising in light of traditional thinking about how peoples immune systems react to the virus The usual notion is that people who have previously been infected with flu viruses are at least partially protected when a new but similar strain comes along Its almost as though the earlier infection acts like a vaccine Thats almost certainly true and probably explains why people over age  were strikingly underrepresented among the deaths from the  HN strain Older people were exposed to the descendants of the fearsome  virus which were closely related But scientists are beginning to think that something like the opposite can also occur That is when a population has been exposed to an HN seasonal strain thats   related to a new pandemic virus their previous exposure can set the stage for a more severe reaction Recent animal experiments support this idea In fact the HN strain circulating in the season before the recent pandemic was such a distant cousin Under this hypothesis younger people  who didnt have the benefit of residual protection from the more closely related  virus circulating in the early decades of the last century  may have been primed for a more severe response to the pandemic HN strain by their exposure to the more distantly related seasonal HN virus But Europeans were also exposed to the distantly related HN and they didnt suffer as many flu deaths in  So thats not an entirely satisfactory explanation We still dont understand these global variations  why Americans were hit harder than Europeans says Dr   an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota It couldnt be that one region had better care Misunderstandings about regional differences in flu severity help explain why many people underestimated the recent pandemics real impact Osterholm says I think some people rushed to judgment in  he tells Shots They looked at countries with less impact and said Aha this is whats happening  Another message that comes through clearly in the current study is the unusual burden that fell on previously healthy children teenagers and young adults especially pregnant women The thing that sets this pandemic apart is not the absolute number of deaths but the fact that those deaths occurred in a much younger group of people than one normally sees during a typical flu season Dr   of the WHOs Global Influenza Program writes in an email to Shots Therefore if one thinks in terms of yearsoflifelost the  pandemic had a much greater impact than a typical influenza season
