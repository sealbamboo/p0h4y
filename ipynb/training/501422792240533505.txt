In the   Nicole Carroll is grimacing tears welling in her eyes Shes in the final set of a workout  three rounds of  squats seven muscleups pullups on two overhead gymnastic rings and  lifts of a pound weight from hip to shoulder level This isnt just any workout its a timed CrossFit workout of the day and the two women Ms Carroll began with have left her in the dust She has only two reps to go but as she clenches her teeth and throws the weight bar with her chiseled arms she buckles into a deep squat and loses control The bar slides to the ground Undeterred she gets up and tries again On the final rep her right knee collapses but she keeps pushing muscling the bar to her shoulders She finishes the workout dead last yet her grit and determination have made her its star CrossFit combines weight lifting sprinting and gymnastics into ritualized routines that are posted each day at CrossFitcom and on whiteboards at thousands of CrossFit affiliates Most WODs as the workouts of the day are called last less than  minutes but their intensity and lack of rest can acquaint even the ultrafit with CrossFits unofficial mascot Pukey the Clown Each new workout comes with a video demonstration the  one featuring Ms Carroll became known as Nasty Girls and turned her into a hero Count J C Herz among her admirers A former New York Times technology columnist and the author of Joystick Nation and Surfing on the Internet Ms Herz took up CrossFit after her husband a devotee adopted the first rule of CrossFit  always talked about CrossFit Soon she too was extolling its virtues Her narrative introduces an array of characters including CrossFits founder Greg Glassman who created the enterprise in Santa Cruz Calif in the s Capt Brian Chontosh a Marine who discovered that CrossFit made ideal training for combat and women like Ms Carroll who find selfempowerment at the CrossFit gym or box where women are celebrated for their strength and encouraged to compete with men What makes CrossFit appealing to members and confusing to outsiders is that its more than a workout  its a cultural identity CrossFit doesnt just transform bodies it changes the way people think of themselves Workouts are scaled according to ability and effort counts as much as results Everyone fights to finish Ms Herz writes Everyone belongs Small class sizes promote a sense of community that is missing at globogyms the CrossFit epithet for chain fitness centers packed with cardio machines and individual headsets The tribal nature of CrossFit and the paleo diet that many members adopt have led to cult comparisons Maybe it is a cult Mr Glassman allows  one where people get really fit and support each other The book is loaded with tales of lives transformed by CrossFit but after a while all bornagain stories sound alike Multiple chapters on CrossFit competitions quickly become tedious with their overwrought prose and forced drama Readers looking for an impartial examination of CrossFit will be disappointed to find that the workouts theoretical basis and scientificsounding claims are annotated almost entirely by articles from the companys own publication CrossFit Journal Still the book is sure to become the Gideon Bible of the CrossFit movement  one that firebreathers as CrossFit devotees often call themselves give to coworkers friends and spouses in their efforts to convert them But some words of caution are in order The weight lifts used in CrossFit can intimidate and they require practice and good technique Torquing your back on a dead lift hurts Ms Herz acknowledges but it also teaches that improper barbell technique is a bad thing to avoid in the future You learn not to do it again she added Debates about CrossFits safety have raged online since reports came out of participants developing rhabdomyolysis a potentially lifethreatening condition that occurs when brokendown muscle tissue floods the bloodstream It can kill you Mr Glassman told The Times in  Ive always been completely honest about that Theres a hint of bravado in the warning  try it if you dare but be forewarned This workout is so potent you could die Even Uncle Rhabdo a cartoon character CrossFit created to spread the word about the condition seems to convey a hint of swagger Ms Herz argues that rhabdomyolysis isnt caused by CrossFit but by ego The athlete spoiling for rhabdo is a guy who used to run triathlons and therefore considers himself a badass under the spare tire who comes back from an extended break and matches the intensity of threedayson onedayoff CrossFit veterans The safety debate boils down to how you think about risk  is it something to avoid or something to manage If your goal is to avoid it find a globogym CrossFit is for risktakers Most of its boxes offer beginner courses to teach skills and judgment but they wont shackle you with training wheels or unnecessary safety equipment Its your responsibility to stop before you are hurt the author implies but the culture documented here glorifies those who struggle beyond pain The guy who was wise enough to quit yesterdays WOD before rhabdomyolysis set in never warrants a mention Ms Carrolls struggle in the Nasty Girls video makes it easy to understand why The same shattered technique and disregard for fatigue that raises safety concerns for some is precisely what makes CrossFit and its heroes so inspiring The line between breakthrough effort and injury or overtraining can be seen only after it has been crossed The pursuit of that boundary holds the allure of selfdiscovery  CrossFits ultimate appeal  Read  from the book
