Pregnant women may be at a much higher risk of car crashes than those without babies on board especially during the second trimester according to a surprising new study that urges momstobe to drive extra carefully Women run a  percent increased relative risk of being in a motor vehicle accident when theyre pregnant than when theyre not  and the risk is especially acute during the first month of the second third of pregnancy Thats according to Canadian researchers who studied records of more than  women for six years from  to  comparing their risk of accidents before and after pregnancy In the three years before they were pregnant the women were involved in  car crashes a month During pregnancy the number jumped to  per month  a significant increase Its a reminder that the huge surge of hormones documented brain changes and other effects of pregnancy may affect expectant mothers more than they realize said Dr Donald Redelmeier a population epidemiologist at the University of Toronto I look after pregnant women who ask me extremely unusual questions about scuba diving or hot tubs or airline flights or roller coasters Redelmeier told NBC News And Ive never been asked about traffic safety despite it being a substantially larger threat to mother and child In fact car crashes are the leading cause of fetal death linked to trauma in mothers Redelmeier and his colleagues noted in the latest issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal Every year in the US there are about  million motor vehicle accidents that send  million people to hospitals Redelmeiers study followed women who gave birth in Ontario Canada and were involved in serious car accidents that resulted in emergency room visits It found that the higher risk of car crashes during pregnancy extended to women in diverse populations with varying lifestyles Redelmeier said The risk was higher in the fall and winter when the weather is worse and in the afternoons the study found Its the afternoon commute that can really ruin your day he said Though the risk is highest in the second trimester it resolves by the end of pregnancy Redelmeier said he believes it might be because the physical changes become obvious by the third trimester and pregnant women are surrounded by family and friends urging them to be more cautious In that second trimester women are feeling really good It contributes to that false sense of security he said Theyre rushing around to get things done before the baby comes The study doesnt mean women should stop driving during pregnancy Even at their worst theyre still better drivers than men of the same age he noted On the contrary were saying that individuals need to start driving more carefully Redelmeier said We shouldnt be complacent We all share the road
