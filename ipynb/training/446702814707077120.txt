However an article   is forcing a rethinking of this faith In the study which examined nearly  patients treated at  American hospitals over four years shorter DB times did not improve inhospital survival The median DB time dropped to  minutes from  in the period studied but shortterm death rates did not change There are several plausible explanations for this result Perhaps heartattack patients at low risk for death are already getting expeditious treatment and those who are sicker  and therefore at higher risk for death  are experiencing the most delays Perhaps the followup time in the study was too short and if we waited a bit longer a survival benefit would be seen Or perhaps there is another reason modern cardiology has reached the limits of what it can do to reduce mortality after a heart attack This would be a mixed blessing of course Perhaps more than any other medical specialty cardiology has been at the forefront of technological innovation and quality improvement in the past  years This golden period has witnessed a hailstorm of lifeprolonging advances including implantable pacemakers coronary bypass surgery and heart transplantation Cardiovascular mortality has dropped significantly over this period but the rate of that decline has slowed This should not come as a surprise The law of diminishing returns applies to every human enterprise and medicine is no different Inhospital mortality after an acute heart attack has dropped fold from  percent to  percent since the invention of the modern cardiac care unit in the s Can shaving a few more minutes off DB time possibly yield any additional benefit There are other examples of such diminishing returns In my field heart failure medications such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors have profoundly improved survival since their advent in the mids Yet recent studies of newer agents  endothelin blockers vasopressin antagonists  have shown little benefit Today patients cardiac risk factors such as hypertension or high cholesterol are better controlled It is getting harder to improve on existing successes No doubt we should celebrate the rise of evidencebased therapies For example more than  percent of patients who present directly to angioplastycapable hospitals today have DB times of less than  minutes with a median time of approximately  minutes  a major improvement from only a few years ago However this means the bar is continually being set higher for every new treatment  Clinical research in its current form focusing on me too drugs or addon therapies or optimizing existing procedures is increasingly producing only marginal advances For example no medicine developed over the past  years to treat acute heart failure has improved survival over the standard of care Should we continue to invest in exorbitant treatments that provide only modest gains when one dollar out of every six in this country is already spent on health care We have to get smarter about how we try to improve care The push to reduce DB time is revealing Hospital DB times are publicly reported and linked by insurers to reimbursement With the threat of financial penalties for any delays roughly a third of angioplastyteam activations are false alarms Treatment is frequently rushed potentially compromising safety Individual patient factors such as mental status or kidney dysfunction are often not taken into consideration A cardiologist in my department recently told me about a case when he was on call By the time I got into my car we were already at the minute mark he recalled I live a halfhour from the hospital so to get there on time I had to drive  miles an hour at  oclock in the morning We ended up inflating the balloon at  minutes But I dont think it helped the patient one bit Instead of focusing on making small cuts to DB time we should be focusing on reducing prehospital delays  patients with chest pains waiting several hours before calling  for example  which dwarf the delays in our current DB processes We need better educational campaigns to reduce symptom to door times before cardiac teams even get involved Quality improvement in medicine is too often a blunt instrument We try to take what works in certain situations and apply it to all situations Our methods yield results for populations not individual patients A shift to more personalized medicine will be needed to continue to make the kind of progress to which patients and doctors have become accustomed Until then maybe we should be satisfied with securing the gains that have already been made
