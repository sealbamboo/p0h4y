Its no news that the US has lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than most highincome countries But a magisterial new   says Americans are actually less healthy across their entire life spans than citizens of  other wealthy nations And the gap is steadily widening What struck us  and it was quite sobering  was the recurring trend in which the US seems to be slipping behind other highincome countries the lead author of the report Dr   tells Shots He says Americans of all ages up to  have shorter lives and more illness and injury An interactive graphic displaying the main results can be found   Strikingly even Americans who are white insured collegeeducated and upperincome are worse off than their counterparts around the world  a finding that no one quite understands People with seemingly everything going for them still live shorter lives and have higher disease rates than people in other countries Woolf says The page report was completed under the auspices of the National Research Council an arm of the   It grew out of an effort last year that concluded the US has a large and widening mortality gap among adults over  compared with other highincome nations The new report focuses on the other part of the population Americans under  Twothirds of the difference in male life expectancy between the US and other countries is due to deaths in that under age category and onethird of the gap is due to deaths among women under  The report also finds that the US fares worse in nine health domains birth outcomes injuries and homicides teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections HIVAIDS drugrelated mortality obesity and diabetes heart disease chronic lung disease and disability Areas in which the US is not behind other wealthy countries are cancer screening and mortality control of high blood pressure and cholesterol smoking rates and suicides The panel concludes that part of the nations poor ranking can be attributed to problems with its  trillionayear health care system the worlds most expensive by far Those problems include the  million Americans without health insurance fewer doctors per capita less access to primary care and fragmented management of complex chronic diseases But the new report places more stress on nonmedical shortcomings Many people might be surprised to learn for instance that for more than half the males who die before age  the cause of death has nothing to do with disease  and is therefore not amenable to reduction through medical care Those causes include murder  percent of deaths in males under  traffic accidents  percent other accidents  percent and suicide  percent Only  percent are diseaserelated and  percent are other causes Among US women under  the picture is different   percent of deaths are diseaserelated  percent are due to accidents homicides and suicide and  percent are listed as other Guns have a lot to do with the homicide and accidental deaths The report notes that murder rates involving guns are  times higher in the US than in  other rich countries Clearly we need to do something about violence and firearmrelated homicides if were going to close the gap Woolf says Its a major contributor to the loss of years of life in our country among young people Much of the poor health outcomes and premature mortality is due to other nonmedical causes  such as behavioral choices like drug and alcohol abuse a built environment that favors auto travel at the expense of exercise and dietary habits Americans consume nearly  calories a day on average  more than anyone else in the world That wasnt always the case Woolf says But over the past  years the consumption of highcalorie foods and refined sugars and other dietary causes of obesity has increased dramatically in the United States in comparison to these other countries Many reports of this ilk serve as doorstops or dustcatchers but Dr   a population health specialist at the University of Wisconsin Madison says this one shouldnt be ignored Its not like we havent known some of this yet but it hasnt penetrated  how serious it is Kindig says I hope that the report would be a wakeup call almost like Sputnik You know lets get going on this over the next decade Kindig says some clues about what to do come from a statebystate analysis of US health disparities that he and his colleagues do every year Some of the healthiest states  say like Minnesota  actually spend less on health care Kindig says And presumably that allows them to spend more on some of the other determinants of health Education is one of those determinants Kindig says it would be a mistake to cut spending on schools since education and health are tightly linked  and cuts there will just show up later in poorer health Woolf the panel chairman says the nations problems may be deeply rooted in Americans love of personal choice and aversion to government regulation of health and safety That wont be easy to change It is a difficult one to tackle Woolf acknowledges But we need to have a national discussion about whether we do or dont Were living shorter lives and were living sicker because of something were doing in this country Woolf says Americans need to decide if theyre OK with that  or are prepared to make different choices
