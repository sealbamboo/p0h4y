On Tuesday the federal government is expected to release details of payments to doctors by every pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer in the country The information is being made public under a   of the  Affordable Care Act The law   to doctors dentists chiropractors podiatrists and optometrists for things like promotional speaking consulting meals educational items and research Its not quite clear what the data will show  in part because the first batch will be incomplete covering spending for only a few months at the end of   but we at ProPublica have some good guesses Thats because we have been detailing relationships between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry for the past four years as part of our   project Weve aggregated information from the websites of some large drug companies which publish their payments as a condition of settling federal whistleblower lawsuits alleging improper marketing or kickbacks Today in cooperation with the website   weve added data for  which now covers  drug companies accounting for half of United States drug sales that year You can look up your doctor using   Here are some facts weve learned from the data Many many health professionals have relationships with industry Dollars for Docs now includes  million payments since  totaling more than  billion of which  billion was for research For  alone there were  million payments valued at nearly  billion Its not possible to calculate the exact number of physicians represented because drug companies havent used unique identification numbers that cross company lines But its clear that the figure is in the hundreds of thousands Excluding research payments the drugmaker Pfizer appeared to have interactions with the most health care professionals last year  about  AstraZeneca came in second with about  Johnson  Johnson and Forest Labs each had nearly  There are an estimated  to  active doctors in the United States Most physicians that are in private practice are touched in some way by the industry said George Dunston cofounder of Obsidian HDS the creator of Pharmashine Surveys   showed that more than threequarters of doctors had at least one type of financial relationship with a drug or medical device company The figure dropped from about  percent in  to  percent in  said the lead author Eric Campbell a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of research at the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital Dr Campbell who has been critical of physicianindustry ties says he hasnt conducted a followup survey but suspects that the percentage of doctors receiving payments has probably decreased somewhat since then I think theyre being much more targeted and specific he said Some doctors have relationships with many companies Those who read the fineprint disclosures accompanying medical journal articles know that doctors often have relationships with several companies that compete in a drug category such as heart drugs or those for schizophrenia Our data bear that out Some highly soughtafter key opinion leaders as they are known in the industry work for half a dozen or more companies in a given year Dr Marc Cohen chief of cardiology at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center received more than  last year for speaking or consulting for six companies listed in Dollars for Docs He is a prolific researcher and author In an interview Cohen said he works only with companies whose drugs are backed by large clinical studies In general terms the science behind the product is very strong he said The biggest companies arent always the ones that spend the most Some smaller drug companies spend big too Consider Forest Labs a midsize drug company that was acquired in July by Actavis a larger company based in Dublin Forests  billion in United States drug sales in  placed it on the edge of the top  companies according to IMS Health a health information company Its sales were far lower than those of Novartis and Pfizer the top two companies by sales last year Yet Forest easily outspent these competitors on promotional speaking events last year Forest spent  million on paid talks in  compared with  million for Novartis and  million for Pfizer An Actavis spokesman declined to comment on the companys strategy but a Forest spokesman said last year that the company spent more on speakers because it didnt use pricey directtoconsumer TV marketing It also had more new drugs than its competitors Companies with newer drugs or newly approved uses for their existing drugs often seem to spend more Companies that dont have many new products or have lost patent protection on their drugs or are about to lose it tend to pull back A lot of this has to do with where companies are in their development cycle of new products or emerging products rather than an industryspecific trend said John Murphy assistant general counsel at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America an industry trade group Meals vastly outnumber all other interactions between drug companies and doctors But they account for a much smaller share of costs Food accounted for nearly  of Amgens  payment reports excluding research in  or roughly  percent But at a cost of  million those meals represented only about  percent of its payments By comparison the company spent almost double that amount  million on just  physician speakers Other companies followed the same pattern speakers can command  to  per engagement or more Given doctors busy schedules treating patients mealtimes are often the only time to reach them said Murphy PhRMAs lawyer Researchers say that whatever the motivation even small gifts or meals can influence a doctors perception of a drug and lead to more prescribing of it
