Labour believes GP services have gone backwards citing a reduction in opening hours and longer waits to see a family doctor In a reworking of the Conservatives Labour isnt working image of  the party has launched a new election poster depicting a huge queue outside a waiting room with the title The doctor cant see you now As evidence to back up his claims Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham has pointed to figures obtained through a parliamentary question showing that the number of surgeries open on evenings and weekends had fallen from  to  in  Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have said that the data is outofdate as it does not include the changes taking place under the Prime Ministers Challenge Fund  which is seeing one in eight practices starting to offer improved access In that the coalition partners are right But that does not mean Labour is wrong In terms of numbers of GPs working in England the picture is complex   released at the end of last month  showed that in  there were  GPs once doctors in training and retainers mainly retired GPs who do a few shifts are excluded In  that had risen by just over  to  A sign of improvement Not quite  If the population rise is factored in the number of GPs per  people dropped from  to  However if you take  as the starting point there is actually a marginal improvement suggesting that the squeeze on GP care actually started under Labour Another way to look at GP care is obviously to consider waiting times  to which Mr Burnham alludes That is not so easy to gauge Unlike hospital or AE waiting GP data is not tracked officially  The best source of information is therefore the official GP survey carried out by Ipsos MORI for NHS England On a number of key measures patient experiences have got worse Some  rated their overall experience last year as good  down  percentage points since  In particular the ease with which people can get through to their surgery on the phone and the proportion of patients able to see or speak to someone when they last tried got worse On opening hours  said they were satisfied with their surgerys opening hours  a drop of  percentage points since December  But statistics can only tell you so much Talk to GPs and they will say that the ageing population means the complexity of illnesses that patients have is making care more difficult  They say the number of visits made per patient is on the increase  in the past five years the number of consultations overall is estimated to have increased by m to m a year That is why the Royal College of General Practitioners says that regardless of what has happened to GP numbers there are  simply not enough It believes there is a shortfall of around  Like the rest of the NHS demand is outstripping supply  even if there are signs that supply has increased Whats the truth behind the politicians claims on the campaign trail Our experts investigate the facts and wider stories behind the soundbites  Read   or follow us on Twitter
