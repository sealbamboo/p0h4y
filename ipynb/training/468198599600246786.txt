Nurses are under more scrutiny than ever before Following the Stafford Hospital scandal the profession has been forced to defend itself against accusations it has forgotten how to care But what is life really like for those on the frontline Everyone can have a bad day at work unreasonable requests from a boss perhaps a mountain of work that never seems to shrink  But for ward sister Louise Baxendale a bad day means the death of a teenager She is the lead nurse for Londons University College Hospitals bed teenage cancer ward part of the hospitals specialist adolescent unit the biggest of its kind in Europe  It means each and every day is spent caring for  to yearolds sick in pain and struggling to come to terms with their condition Figures from the   which partly funds the unit show seven teenagers a day are diagnosed with the disease Leukaemia and Hodgkins lymphoma are the most common cancers among this age group  Bowel cancer which last week claimed the life of Stephen Sutton the yearold who help raise m for charity is seen  although is much rarer So what attracted Louise  to such a demanding role  I have been a nurse for  years and this is my favourite job she says  I have worked in AE and with people with respiratory conditions but when I started here I just realised it was what I wanted to do  The patients are such characters and the care you give can make a real difference She adds The thing you have to do is be upbeat There is no room for negativity Of course that can be hard and it is difficult getting it right Louise describes how treating three different patients in the course of just one day proves her point The first she says had just been given a cancer diagnosis and were scared and upset In the next room  there was a patient at the end of life They had chosen to die on the unit with their family and the nurses and other health staff they had got to know around them  But the next room could not have been more different  The patient was at the end of treatment and planning for a fancy dress party they were going to attend Understandably the patient was  in Louises words  so excited they were on the ceiling  The thing is you meet patients at all stages of the journey but you can make a difference to all of them says Louise  You have to shape yourself to your patient You have to get to know them really well to make a difference I came into nursing to make a difference  Sometimes it is just the simple things like tucking them in with a blanket can mean the world  I spent time with Louise on National Nurses Day last Monday  two days before the death of Stephen Sutton As ward sister she divides her time between management tasks and providing care That in itself provides challenges You have to do a lot of juggling There may be a meeting to go to a shelf that needs fixing HR asking me questions  But my number one priority is always care and safety That comes first and if it means saying hang on I cant deal with those requests Im needed on the ward then so be it Louises day starts before am  often ending after pm  with the handover meeting with the night staff followed by a bed meeting with the rest of the paediatric and adolescent nursing teams to check on what staffing levels are like While debate continues about staffing ratios on adult general wards in the teenage cancer unit  and the general teenage ward which is linked to it but run by another ward sister Rebecca Mortimer  staffing ratios are already strictly monitored On the cancer ward there is often one nurse to two or three patients sometimes one to one while on the general ward which sees a wide variety of patients from road traffic accident victims to diabetes patients it is one to four or five during the day After staffing levels have been checked  the trust has an inhouse bank of nurses which it can deploy when there are shortages  it is then back on to the ward to help out with the care being provided  That involves giving medications including the chemotherapy drugs that many patients are on but part of it is also about spending time with patients You do develop a relationship with them says Louise Sometimes they just need to talk to you I have done jigsaws with patients It is about making life as normal as it can be and injecting fun where you can  We have the physios come in and during one session the other week we had all the staff doing the limbo under a tape To help the teenagers cope with their stay in hospital  which can last weeks even months at a time  there is an activity room It is equipped with everything a teenager would need There is a pool table flatscreen TV and DVD an Xbox console and arts and crafts facilities Louise says It very popular especially the Xbox with the boys They love playing FIFA We have to nag them to get off it It can be midnight or even later and then want to have another game We have to tell them no Then in the mornings they wont get up Youve got to remember they are teenagers after all One of them is yearold Dami Oguntoyinbo who has been on the unit almost constantly since last August after being diagnosed with leukaemia Seventy days after having a bone marrow transplant he is on the brink of being discharged I cant wait to get out obviously About the only thing Ill miss is the nurses They have been great It is really tough After my transplant I was really ill and had to stay in my room They really looked after me kept my spirits up Of course Dami is one of the lucky ones as Louise admits  Not all of them do survive That is very difficult to deal with as you get to know your patients really well You have to stay strong  Burnout is a real issue for us nurses That is why the team is so important We all look after each keep an eye out for each other But we know we have to be there for our patients  These are children who are going through hell
