Ladies and gentlemen, expect a new license plate slogan to roll out shortly; a recent ranking reveals the most livable states of the future.. Results of the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing index, released Tuesday (Aug. 8), ranks states based on an average of scores from "future livability" metrics, or the 13 different questions asked to a random sample of Americans to predict the future livability of their state. Among the metrics, many covered healthy living, such as accessibility of clean and safe water, availability of a safe place to work out, obesity rates and state smoking habits.
