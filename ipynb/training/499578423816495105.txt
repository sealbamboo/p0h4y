Theyre called nursing homes so most of us assume that they have nurses  registered nurses  on the premises But not all the time In some facilities not even most of the time The  federal law intended to reform the countrys nursing homes required a registered nurse onsite only eight hours a day regardless of the size of the facility Supporters at the time understood that in a building full of sick and disabled elders health crises could occur at any hour But getting the legislation passed required substantial compromises including in regulations allowing reduced nurse staffing Its something advocates have wanted to return to ever since said Robyn Grant director of public policy and advocacy for the   I think most people will be both shocked and appalled that theres not an RN on duty around the clock One person who was indeed completely shocked to learn this was Representative Jan Schakowsky Democrat of Illinois This applied to nursing homes whatever the number of beds she told me in an interview One hundred Four hundred She responded by introducing on July  the bluntly titled   or House Vote  It would require that a directcare registered nurse not an administrator be present  hours a day seven days a week in all the nearly  nursing homes that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement Its been close to  years she said Its high time to provide better care Its hard to calculate how many nursing homes would be affected Thirteen states already require hour registered nurse coverage in some cases but their statutes vary In Tennessee Rhode Island Hawaii and Connecticut for instance nursing homes must have a registered nurse on duty  period California makes that requirement only for nursing homes with more than  beds and New Jersey only for those with more than  Elsewhere Theres little published research but the American Association of Nurse Assessment Coordination  one of several nursing organizations backing the bill  rooted through the ratings data on Medicares Nursing Home Compare site for  Its researchers counted how many facilities had at least four staff registered nurses one was probably the director of nursing and theoretically could cover every shift In the end  nursing homes did not which means that at least  percent have no registered nurse available around the clock But thats a fuzzy percentage because a home could have two on the day shift and none at night or have some registered nurses doing administration instead of patient care Besides all staffing data is selfreported The actual proportion of nursing homes without a directcare registered nurse much of each day could well be higher Ms Schakowskys bill specifies registered nurses because they play a specific role Licensed practical nurses are vital to good care and of course the lowestpaid certified nursing assistants  the aides  provide most handson help But only registered nurses are trained and licensed to evaluate a patients care and conduct assessments when his or her condition changes which can happen rapidly  and at  am Without someone to make an assessment right then and there that resident could be at risk Ms Grant said Maybe he wont be hospitalized when its necessary Just as dangerously maybe someone will call  when he could be treated in the nursing home and avoid being hospitalized Studies have repeatedly pointed to the importance of registered nurses With higher registerednurse staffing patients have   aka bedsores and  and catheterizations They   longer Their homes get   from state inspectors Their   but it   Adding registered nurses doesnt constitute a bigticket expense either The average annual salary for registered nurses the Bureau of Labor Statistics says was  last year But operators are worried about finding enough especially in rural areas said Ms Grant who has met with industry leaders Nurses often prefer higherpaying jobs in hospitals Ms Schakowsky has enlisted five cosponsors  all Democrats  but suspects that well have bipartisan support on legislation like this she said Im hopeful Adding registered nurses will hardly solve all the quality problems at nursing homes which need more staff of other varieties too But its important unfinished business Otherwise we probably should refer to these facilities as something besides nursing homes prehospitalization holding facilities perhaps or wellintended residences for the incurably underattended to You can probably come up with a few evenlessflattering names yourselves
