Top of the morning to you, although visibility is a bit challenging where we are located. How so? Large puffs of fog that resemble cotton balls are hovering around the Pharmalot campus. Nonetheless, we have no trouble finding the official cafeteria where we are making – you guessed it – another cup of delicious stimulation. We are still enjoying Pumpkin Spice, for those who track this sort of thing. Feel free to indulge yourself, as well. Meanwhile, we have lined up some tidbits, as always. Hope your day goes well and drop us a line if you hear anything interesting…. William Ackman has taken a roughly $2 billion stake in Zoetis and could push the animal health drug maker to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals or another large drug maker; Gilead Sciences says its new Harvoni hepatitis C medication achieved cure rates of 96% to 97% in a study of patients who had cirrhosis and failed to benefit from prior treatments; and for the second time in as many weeks, the FDA is warning marketers of veterinary products, saying several are promoting their equine ulcer drugs without first having obtained FDA approval.
