Relatively few people have enrolled in new health insurance plans since the Affordable Care Act exchanges launched this month But some health care experts say its early days yet  and that getting the right proportion of healthy young new enrollees is just as important as how quickly people sign up The Congressional Budget Office projects that  million people will buy health insurance for  through the new exchanges integral to the implementation of the governments new health care law Federal officials say that the exchanges have received  applications since launching Oct  But so far it appears that most of those being enrolled are signing up for Medicaid the government health care system for the poor rather than private insurance plans As a result many health insurance companies say theyve received only a trickle of enrollment through HealthCaregov the federally run marketplace that serves  states and has been plagued by major technical problems The Obama administration said Friday that the federal exchange will work smoothly for the vast majority of users   But some are concerned about the financial consequences for the government and insurers if enrollment on the exchanges falls short Health care expert Larry Levitt senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation says the higher numbers of Medicaid enrollees is not surprising since Medicaid is free whereas most people will have to pay something for private insurance As soon as you sign up for a plan the insurer is going to ask you for the first months premium Levitt says And given that the coverage wont be effective until Jan  anyway I certainly wouldnt be in a rush to pay money that wont really help me for a couple months Levitt says he doesnt expect a surge of enrollments to start before midNovember But if the exchanges technical problems and bad publicity dampen enrollment significantly what might be the financial impact for the government In the short term Levitt says it would actually save the government money If fewer people enroll not only will the government be paying out less in tax credits but theyll be taking in more money in the form of penalties because of the individual mandate he explains Uninsured individuals must sign up by March  or face a penalty  percent of their annual income or  whichever is higher The penalty rises in later years But for insurance companies participating in the exchanges its not just a question of whether the exchanges fall short of the  million enrollment target for the first year Robert Zirkelbach spokesman for Americas Health Insurance Plans the association that represents US health insurers says the demographic mix of participants is crucial Its not simply the absolute number of people that are covered thats ultimately going to determine whether coverage is affordable he says Its the type of people that decide to purchase In fact to keep the premiums low and make the system work financially the government estimates that  percent of those  million people projected to sign up in the first year need to be young and healthy Because if only people who are older and have high health care costs decide to purchase coverage now thats going to mean that   year when open enrollment comes around again premiums may be significantly higher than we see today Zirkelbach says Rising premiums could lead to a downward spiral for the exchanges because the increases could convince young healthy people to pay the penalty rather than sign up for insurance that costs significantly more Also since some operating costs for the exchanges like computer servers and call centers will be paid with fees on each policy sold fewer policies could undermine the exchanges themselves financially And higher premiums would end up costing the government more in subsidies Jonathan Gruber an economics professor at MIT helped develop both the Affordable Care Act and a similar Massachusetts health care system back in the s He says the Massachusetts program was initially delayed for several months and then signed up just  people in its first month of operation We have to stop overreacting to daytoday noise Gruber says When we passed this law in Massachusetts I was on the board that implemented it and we got a report every month on how they were doing Thats probably about the right frequency to be thinking about this Gruber also says there was a rush of younger healthy people signing up in Massachusetts as the prospect of a penalty loomed closer What you saw was a big rush right at the end among the healthiest enrollees Gruber says The mandate kicking in really seemed to matter And remember  in this law the mandate doesnt effectively kick in until April  The Obama administration can only hope that the early problems dont sink the exchanges before they set sail
