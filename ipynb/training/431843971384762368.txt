
 Last week my impulse purchases at the farmers market included a lush bunch of red chard and a beautiful bunch of golden beets with the greens attached Normally I use these vegetables in Mediterranean dishes  you have seen many of them in Recipes for Health  but I was craving stirfries  It was a particularly busy week and I wanted my stirfries to work as onepot meals So I focused on stirfried rice or rice mixed with other grains and stirfried noodles I pulled frozen brown rice and frozen black quinoa from the freezer for a couple of the dishes I am always advocating for cooking more grains than you need for one dish so that you can freeze them and quickly thaw them for another and rice noodles and soba from the pantry for the others I bumped up the protein content of some dishes by adding tofu or eggs But these stirfries were first and foremost terrific vehicles for vegetables Stirfries always require a certain amount of time for ingredient prep as there are aromatics to mince seasonings to measure vegetables to chop But all the time is on the front end  the actual cooking is done in under  minutes usually well under  All of the dishes I made this week made great leftovers I enjoyed them for dinner one day lunch the next  Paperthin sliced beets contribute crunch and color to this comforting stirfry  A colorful stirfry with a variety of textures  The texture flavor and look of black quinoa make for an interesting dish  The nutty flavor of buckwheat noodles adds a delicious dimension to this unconventional stirfry
