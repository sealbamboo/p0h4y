Most Americans dont get the  to  cups of fruits and vegetables were supposed to consume every day per   But companies that make juice especially highend fresh juice are ready to come to our rescue The relatively new superpremium juice marketers are pushing more than just pretty colors and sweet flavors Theyre also trying to persuade Americans that getting fruits and vegetables from juice is convenient and pleasurable and will potentially alleviate your guilt about your unhealthy ways by blasting your system with incredible nutrition Look no further than Starbucks   this week that it has opened a  million stateoftheart juicery in Rancho Cucamonga Calif where it plans to quadruple production of its Evolution Fresh juice a brand it acquired in  The company says its betting its customers will make this juice a part of their daily habit  an additional beverage they pick up with their coffee in the morning The juice is already available at  locations nationwide including some branches of Whole Foods but Starbucks spokeswoman Sanja Gould says the goal is to get it in all of the more than  Starbucks stores in the US A daily juice habit would be an expensive one for many The suggested retail price of Evolution Fresh juice ranges from  to  for a  fluid ounce bottle Thats competitive with BluePrint and Suja two other growing national brands of coldpressed juice Evolution Fresh argues in its   that coldpressed juice is distinct and superior to the likes of Ocean Spray or Tropicana Why Because after pulverizing the produce to extract the juice its highpressure processed or HPP instead of traditional heat pasteurization to kill microbes and extend the shelf life And the company contends that this form of juice processing delivers more of the flavors vitamins and nutrients of raw fruits and vegetables than traditional heat pasteurized juices The real purpose of what were doing is keeping fruits and vegetables as close to their natural state as possible  thats the goal for both taste and how it makes you feel when you drink the juice says Chris Bruzzo general manager for Evolution Fresh But is highpressure processed juice really so different from the heatprocessed stuff We put the question to   who heads a food science research lab at Cornell University When it comes to flavor he says the answer is yes But when it comes to nutrition Not so much Liu says with the exception of the vitamin C in some fruits and vegetables HPP juice does not retain more nutrients than pasteurized juice as Starbucks and other companies have claimed The nutrition in some fruits and vegetables is actually increased after theyve been heated so it really depends on what product we talk about says Liu And so overall I wouldnt say the nutrition quality is extremely higher in these new juices Indeed theres a huge amount of variation between fruits and vegetables  many vitamins minerals and valuable chemicals can be unlocked or blocked depending on preparation and the foods theyre eaten with as   For example tomatoes are best eaten with a little fat like olive oil while carrots will release more of their antioxidants when cooked The industry magazine BEVNET   the influence of celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian both of whom are devotees of juice cleanses has helped boost demand for juice as both a health food and a weight loss aid But as we reported in   debunking detox cleanses it may be unwise to expect your juice pasteurized or not to remove anything nefarious from your body Another issue is that by consuming just the juice of a fruit or vegetable you lose some of the dietary fiber that fills you up and slows down digestion Some nutritionists   that since we absorb liquids faster than solid food juice causes a more dramatic spike in insulin levels than does eating whole fruits Still Liu says theres nothing wrong with companies trying to offer consumers new palatable ways to consume fruits and vegetables The key thing right now for America is to increase daily servings of fruit and vegetables says Liu We are far behind on that
