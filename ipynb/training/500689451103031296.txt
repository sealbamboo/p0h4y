Later this month new residents will arrive at a nursing home in the Bronx Like others coming to Jewish Home Lifecare they will be recuperating from hospitalization for cardiac surgery strokes fractured hips  the whole panoply of senior ills But these residents also will be addicted to alcohol or prescription drugs and so they will be enrolled in an unusual rehab program at the nursing home Traditionally people with these issues have been undesirable admissions said administrator Gregory PooleDayan They may have behaviors the staff isnt prepared to cope with There may be family dynamics This is a population nursing homes have shied away from he said  though it often goes unrecognized They   or misuse prescription drugs they began taking only recently to cope with pain either physical or psychological Sometimes the drinking that caused no problems a couple of decades ago   because aging bodies metabolize alcohol differently or because booze interacts with the many medications older people typically take A generational stigma may have prevented them from ever addressing the   that often accompany substance abuse When such seniors have a health crisis emerge from a hospital and arent well enough to return home where can they go Mr PooleDayan after consulting with local hospitals decided Jewish Home Lifecare should be the first nursing home in the country  he believes  to help them recover from both their medical conditions and their addictions Persuading the organizations planning group proved challenging and Jewish Home Lifecare decided it would not yet admit seniors addicted to illegal street drugs But it proceeded hiring a director with a grant from the Fan Fox and Leslie R Samuels Foundation and planning to set aside a bed unit for these patients Eventually Mr PooleDayan said he hopes to treat  addicted seniors a year Theyll get a thorough screening group and individual therapy step programs on the campus and counseling on preventing relapses When theyre ready to leave the home will connect them with community programs and professionals because the important part is continuing recovery Mr PooleDayan said He figures that Medicare and Medicaid will cover the costs But theres a lot still to learn here Is an average stay of just  days long enough to make progress Will families sometimes convinced that a parent is too old to make fundamental changes be supportive or obstructive or indifferent How can you help people recover from injury and surgery which often requires pain management while simultaneously trying to wean them from inappropriate pain medications What sort of additional training will the staff need Steven Wollman the newly hired director of the Geriatric Substance Abuse Recovery Program and he volunteers a recovering prescription drug abuser who has maintained sobriety for  years has few illusions about the task Hes braced for older patients denial If theyre newly addicted they think they dont have a problem he said Their doctor prescribed this so it must be perfectly OK He expects to see a fair amount of evasion too because a lot of people addicted to pain meds have multiple doctors and several pharmacies and the doctor prescribing pain meds doesnt know that someone else is prescribing tranquilizers More than drug abuse he expects to see alcoholism which requires no such subterfuge But regardless of age Mr Wollman said I think anybody can recover if they want to do it and have the guidance He told me about a yearold he had worked with in Florida to overcome addiction to crack cocaine He stayed clean until he died three years later and he said they were the best three years of his life Mr Wollman said He reconnected with the family that had wanted nothing to do with him Jewish Home Lifecare is applying for research grants to see what will work and how well Mr PooleDayan hopes to create a program that other facilities can adopt After all he notes Weve always had people with substance abuse problems in nursing homes We either havent known it or we havent done anything about it
