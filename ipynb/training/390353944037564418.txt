Heel strike or toe strike With the fall marathontraining season in full stride it is time once again to argue about running form  How a runners foot should strike the ground incites passionate debate among athletes and coaches despite scant persuasive evidence to support either position   But a noteworthy new study may help to quell the squabbling by suggesting that each style of running has advantages and drawbacks and the right way to run almost certainly depends on what kind of runner you already are For the new study published in   researchers at the Tampere Research Center of Sports Medicine in Tampere Finland began by using motion capture technology to determine the running form of  young adults from the area who played team sports None competed in distance running All wore their normal running shoes during testing  The testing showed that  of the women and  of the men struck first with their forefeet while striding  These small numbers tally with other reports most of which have found that an overwhelming majority of modern runners whether male or female slow or swift are heel strikers In a telling   published in May in The International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance  almost  runners participating in a recent Milwaukee Lakefront Marathon were filmed midway through the event and their form analyzed About  percent proved to be heel strikers including quite a few of the fastest runners  Similarly when researchers in New Hampshire   there they found that almost  percent were heelstrikers according to filming conducted six miles into the event Interestingly of the remaining  percent most had shifted to a heelstrike form when filmed again near the races end as they tired Regardless some running coaches and other experts question the wisdom of heel striking noting that   presumably the most natural way for humans to run many although not all adopt a forefootstrike running style This suggests enthusiasts say that forefoot striking is the inherently right way for humans to run  If so however forefoot striking should lessen the odds of a runningrelated injury And it was that possibility that the Finnish researchers hoped to explore  So they next matched the  forefootstriking female runners with an equal number of female heel strikers of similar age height weight and running pace There were too few forefootstriking men to include them  The women were fitted with additional motioncapture sensors and filmed again while running They also underwent measurements of leg and hip strength  Plugging the resulting data into formulas validated in other experiments the researchers determined just how much force the women were creating with each stride and of greater interest where that force was hitting hardest In general the knees ankles and Achilles tendons are the sites of most runningrelated injuries previous studies have found And in this experiment many of the women runners jarred their knees especially when they landed on their heels That running form resulted in about  percent more force moving through the knee joint than when women landed near their forefeet The elevated forces were particularly evident along the heel strikers kneecaps and the medial or inside portion of their knees where the joint is known to be particularly vulnerable to overuse injuries  But the forefoot strikers legs were not immune from force They simply absorbed it differently with almost  percent more force moving through their ankles and Achilles tendons than among the women who hit with their heels In essence the findings show that you cant escape the cumulative impact of running however you stride said JuhaPekka Kulmala a PhD student now at the University of Jyvaskyla who led the study Hit with your heels and you stress your knee possibly leading to conditions such as patellofemoral stress syndrome Strike near the ball of your foot and youll jolt your ankle and Achilles tendon potentially increasing the risk of such injuries as Achilles tendinopathy plantar fasciitis and stress fractures of the foot There is in other words no one invariably right and painless way to run  However Mr Kulmala said the results also indicate that strategically altering how you land could be advisable for some runners People suffering from knee problems can benefit from forefoot striking Mr Kulmala said Those who have Achilles tendon complaints can benefit from rearfoot striking  Switching form is not simple though as countless runners who have tried will attest I think that experienced runners are able to change stride pattern relatively easily Mr Kulmala said But nonexperienced runners find it more difficult Consider contacting a local coach for advice and have an obliging friend or spouse film you running so you can document how your foot hits the ground Incorporate any changes slowly Mr Kulmala cautioned   And if you have little experience with injury and are comfortable with your stride then by all means stick with it as is The best running form Mr Kulmala said is any that keeps you moving regularly
