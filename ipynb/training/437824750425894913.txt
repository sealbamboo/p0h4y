US doctors are warning of an emerging poliolike disease in California where up to  people have been infected  A meeting of the American Academy of Neurology heard that some patients had developed paralysis in all four limbs which had not improved with treatment  The US is poliofree but related viruses can also attack the nervous system leading to paralysis Doctors say they do not expect an epidemic of the poliolike virus and that the infection remains rare Polio is a dangerous and feared childhood infection The virus rapidly invades the nervous system and causes paralysis in one in  cases It can be fatal if it stops the lungs from working  Global vaccination programmes mean polio is endemic in just three countries  Afghanistan Nigeria and Pakistan There have been  suspected cases of the new infection mostly in children in the past  months  A detailed analysis of five cases showed enterovirus  which is related to poliovirus  could be to blame In those cases all the children had been vaccinated against polio Symptoms have ranged from restricted movement in one limb to severe weakness in both legs and arms Dr Emanuelle Waubant a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco told the BBC There has been no obvious increase in the pace of new cases so we dont think were about to experience an epidemic thats the good news But its bad news for individuals unlucky enough to develop symptoms which tend to be moderate to severe and dont appear to improve too much despite reasonably aggressive treatment The cases have been spread over a mile diameter km so the research team do not think the virus represents a single cluster or outbreak However many more people could have been infected without developing serious symptoms  as was the case with polio Dr Waubant suspects similar cases in Asia could explain why California is affected but not the rest of the US Fellow researcher Dr Keith Van Haren from Stanford University said the cases highlight the possibility of an emerging infectious poliolike syndrome in California He added We would like to stress that this syndrome appears to be very very rare Any time a parent sees symptoms of paralysis in a child the child should be seen by a doctor right away Commenting on the findings Jonathan Ball a professor of virology at the University of Nottingham told the BBC Since the neareradication of poliovirus other enteroviruses have been associated with paralysis but these viruses usually cause a very mild coldlike illness and severe complications are very rare Two children showed evidence of being infected by a strain of virus called enterovirus which has become strongly associated with outbreaks of respiratory illness  Whether or not this strain of enterovirus has caused these or other cases of paralysis is possible but remains conjecture further studies will be needed to determine this
