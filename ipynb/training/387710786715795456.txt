Older people living near noisy airports may have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease a new study reports Researchers used data from the Federal Aviation Administration to establish noise levels in zip codes abutting  airports in the contiguous United States Using Medicare records they calculated the number of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in areas with levels of noise of at least  decibels about the level of normal conversation As a comparison they also calculated air pollution a known contributor to cardiac hospitalization based on measures of ozone and fine particulate matter There were  million people older than  in the study population After controlling for age sex race socioeconomic status roadway density and air pollution levels the scientists found that each increase of  decibels in noise level was associated with a  percent increase in cardiacrelated hospitalization  for heart failure heart rhythm disturbances cerebrovascular events ischemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease The   The number of hospitalizations attributable to noise is lower than the number attributable to pollution levels said the senior author Francesca Dominici a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health About  percent of hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease were attributable to fine particulate matter as opposed to  percent for noise But thats still a ton of hospitalizations Using data from  that would be  cases
