A devastating tropical disease should be eradicated within three years says the former American president leading the fight against it There were  million cases of guinea worm worldwide when Jimmy Carters organisation started tackling the disease in  Now there are just  cases globally  many of them in South Sudan and Mali  Mr Carter acknowledged that Ebola had diverted some resources  but said this was only proper Eradication of guinea worm would make it the first human disease to have been wiped out since smallpox  and the first to be eliminated without a vaccine or medicine The highly debilitating infection comes from a parasite and is spread by drinking contaminated water Mr Carter told me Its hard to get our people and vehicles into South Sudan and Mali because of the conflict in both those countries But were making good progress there as well as in Chad and Ethiopia where the remaining cases are  Its impossible to determine exactly when well do away with it  but I think it will be in the next two or three years at the latest  Once the disease begins you cant do anything about it until the worm comes out of the human body That takes about a month because the worm is about a metre long Its a horrible disease a terrible affliction The organisation he founded the Carter Center has visited all  villages  mostly in subSaharan Africa  which have had guinea worm to train people in dealing with it and preventing it The former president added Once the water is contaminated if people dont use a proper filter cloth for every drink the disease can come out of that pond of filthy water again So we have to monitor villages even if they didnt have a case last year because they might have a case this year You have to be constantly vigilant Theres no doubt Ebola has taken away some effort from fighting guinea worm in Mali  but its very proper that people have concentrated on Ebola He said efforts to tackle other health conditions had been temporarily diverted to focus on Ebola Weve trained  psychiatric nurses in Liberia  because there have been terrible problems in that country with mental health  Their work has been diverted into helping fight Ebola but theyll go back to their psychiatric work now  The crisis needed to be met and we were glad to turn those nurses loose to work on Ebola Mr Carters team is also tackling river blindness another terrible parasitic disease which causes sight loss and skin problems  It results in itching which is so hard to endure that some sufferers take their own lives   The transmission of river blindness has been stopped in Colombia Ecuador Guatemala and Mexico  but the disease is still endemic in more than  countries in Africa and Latin America Drug treatment exists and many free doses have been supplied by the manufacturer Merck but eradication is further away than with guinea worm  Mr Carter said The policy has traditionally been to control the disease and prevent blindness by targeting the microscopic worms  But the adult worms would remain in the body and still need treating year after year  The Carter Center began an experiment in Latin America We found that treating the disease more than once a year meant you could actually eliminate it  We alone will treat around  million people for river blindness this year  Weve proven in Latin America as well as Sudan and Uganda that the disease can be completely eliminated And it gives people in Africa whove suffered so long with these diseases an element of confidence selfrespect and hope for the future Mr Carter who turned  in October added Ive been blessed with good health and I still enjoy going out to these countries and leading the work Im still going strong Last week Mr Carter sent the manuscript for his th book to his publisher  It is about the lessons he has learned from his life  and includes reflections on his marriage race relations in America and his  years as a submarine officer with the US Navy
