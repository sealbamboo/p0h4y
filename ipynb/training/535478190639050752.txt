When you open up your Skype app to make a call its probably no surprise that its accessing your phones call history But would you expect your Nike Running app to collect that information too If youre like most people the answer is no Thats why the Nike Running app gets a B on   a site for people to figure out what information their apps might be collecting Right now it only looks at Android apps but the site already lists hundreds of them from Google Maps to Instagram to WebMD Many of the apps that got graded are for health and fitness For instance What To Expect a pregnancy app gets the lowest possible grade a D for collecting images you take of your baby bump and potentially using them to offer you targeted ads The grades are determined by comparing peoples expectations about the information an app might collect with what the app actually collects For example people dont expect the Period Tracker Pink Pad app to track their location but it does so it gets a C Whereas Google Maps which everyone expects to track their location receives an A NPR News by the way gets a B while   scores an A Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Rutgers University created PrivacyGrade based on their studies of peoples privacy expectations They found unsurprisingly that when people are informed why their location or other sensitive data might be needed for an app theyre more comfortable giving that information away PrivacyGrade specifically looks at the pieces of an apps code called libraries Libraries are pieces of code provided by companies to help apps connect to their services Facebook Twitter and Google all offer libraries for app developers They allow users to post impressive weight loss gains or long runs to Facebook from within an app for instance But they can also let advertisers learn about an apps users in ways people dont necessarily want  and the developers may not even know it One of the big problems weve seen with libraries  developers dont often know what these libraries are doing says   one of the developers of PrivacyGrade PrivacyGrades main limitation is that it looks only at libraries While its a good start any given app could be digging much deeper into your private information on the phone outside of those libraries says   a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation And right now theres not enough demand by the public for app developers to use safer libraries or fix their code People who build apps dont have a huge incentive says Gillula An NPRTruven Health Analytics poll found that people   nearly as much as you might think Thats where PrivacyGrades rating system could help says   law professor at the University of Chicago He says he was skeptical of the site until he found out about the grades Grades or rating systems work People dont want to know too much about a restaurant other than its Zagat rating he says For health in particular BenShahar says there may be more incentive for people to use a site like PrivacyGrade Commercializing peoples illnesses medical problems is something that many people find particularly tasteless So there might be more demand  but only to the extent that they get low grades He says even people who say in a   that they want privacy but when it comes down to it they arent willing to put their money where their mouth is Its pretty easy to change settings or to even change service in a way that anonymizes you on your smartphone says BenShahar But people are not buying this form of protection And so when people really want some kind of protection like insurance theyre willing to pay a lot for it So where does that leave a free site like PrivacyGrade Its too early to tell if itll catch on says BenShahar And the grades should be taken with a grain of salt If people already expect the worst  then PrivacyGrade is not going to give them a negative grade
