The line one recent Sunday was out the door at   a monthold shop selling cheese made from nut milks People are very emotional when they come said owner Youssef Fakhouri who was raised in Casablanca and Paris and trained as a chef Customers who dont eat food made with the milk of animals for ethical reasons or because of allergies tell him they thought they were done with artisan cheeses At his little shop in a cramped strip mall at  Sunset Blvd near La Cienega they find nut milk versions of goat cheese logs Vive le Difference with ash blue cheese Veganzola Camembert Cashembert   varieties in total The inspiration is from friends who are vegan Fakhouri said Everyone was complaining about nondairy cheese Fakhouri took on the challenge He started experimenting with pine nuts pistachios and macadamias He makes milk from the nuts and then used traditional cheesemaking techniques straining the whey adding truffles or herbs and pressing the curds into forms Just as dairy cheese makers say each wheel may taste different based on where and what the animals ate Fakhouri says his cheeses taste of where and how the nuts were grown Thats the beauty of it he said Consumers should taste the product for itself rather than compare it to an animal cheese he said I am not trying to make it indistinguishable from the animal counterpart With that the cheeses taste quite good A macadamia cashew and pine nut Brie served on a baguette from the restaurant Republique which Fakhouri stocks was more than satisfying Customers apparently agree On that Sunday the refrigerator case was almost empty before  pm The cheeses cost  to  an ounce there are usually eight varieties available
