By many measures a neonatal intensive care unit or NICU with singlefamily rooms produces better results than one with a shared openbay arrangement a new study has found Researchers tracked outcomes in an openbay NICU for  months before the unit was moved to a new singlefamily room facility Then they tracked successive admissions to the new facility and compared them with the openbay NICU results There were no differences between the  infants in either type of intensive care unit in terms of gestational age at birth race or maternal educational status or ethnicity But the study   found significant differences in medical outcomes Infants in the singlefamily rooms weighed more at discharge and gained weight more rapidly They needed fewer medical procedures had increased attention less stress less lethargy and less pain In a room you have privacy the lighting you want nurses who work oneonone with the moms Its relaxed its calm said the lead author Barry M Lester director of the Brown Center for the Study of Children at Risk at Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island Theres more maternal involvement than in the open bay and more maternal involvement leads to better behavioral and medical outcomes
