Actress Julie Bowen of Modern Family doesnt want other parents to go through what she and her husband did when their toddler experienced a lifethreatening allergic reaction that sent him into anaphylactic shock Her son recovered completely but the incident inspired Bowen to become an activist in educating the public about kids allergies Here she talks about how parents can prepare themselves for the possibility of such an incident and what shes done to keep her family safe Julie Bowen An article about childhood allergies in the Dec  Saturday section incorrectly quoted Modern Family actress Julie Bowen as saying her son was treated with an EpiPen in an emergency room She actually said the boy was treated with epinephrine Also the article incorrectly said that  in  children has a food allergy about  in  does  When my oldest son was just shy of  years old he was eating peanut butter and he was stung by a bee simultaneously Were not exactly sure what the trigger was but he went into anaphylactic shock His entire face swelled up his eye swelled shut and his lips became giant My husband sent me a picture of it and I immediately panicked We took him to the ER where he was treated with an EpiPen and ever since then weve been vigilant about keeping him safe It was so scary At first I actually thought it couldnt be an allergic reaction there was some small amount of denial kicking in He had eaten peanut butter before and I just didnt want it to be true I thought No no it must be something else I dont want other families to go through that I think that if I recognized how serious this was I would have learned more about it and the denial wouldnt have kicked in at all For that reason I want other parents to know what to look for Our sons reaction to his allergy was very dramatic but Ive been over at a friends house and she was having nuts and her child had a slight reaction that my friend ignored Theres this wave of kids who have food allergies Its a big deal its a reality They know what the autoinjector is and they have seen us practice with it although I hope they would never have to use it We want all of them to live healthy normal active lives So far my other kids havent had any allergic reactions and theyve been introduced to all the same foods Were careful when we introduce a new food  especially something like shellfish which a lot of people are allergic to  so when we introduced shrimp to all the kids we didnt do it when we were on a tropical island far away from medical care Parents need to get familiar with the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis to be vigilant and aware and know the triggers With my son any time theres a new food that hes not familiar with hell ask if there are nuts in it Kids are surprisingly able to understand the issue and be part of the solution Hes young but hes very aware of it and doesnt think it makes him weird or strange because it doesnt One in four kids has a food allergy that can turn into anaphylaxis so its not unusual in most schools But theres a whole list of things that can be triggers from bees to nuts to even latex and people dont know about a lot of them Its pretty straightforward I dont need to know everything that happens during an anaphylactic reaction its enough for me to know as a parent that it can kill you Your tongue swells and breathing is hard We treat ours with an EpiPen autoinjector and my sons school has one If he has a play date it goes in a backpack with him
