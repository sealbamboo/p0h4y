The NFL adopted a new rule this season that makes it illegal for players to hit   of their helmet In other words ramming your head into someone In high school football its been illegal to hit this way for years But unlike in the pros Ive hardly ever seen it called in a game Still Nic McMaster coach at Castro Valley High School in the San Francisco Bay area  where Im a defensive end  tries to teach us better At a recent practice McMaster scolded a linebacker for leading with his head Alfaro that was horrible technique Thats why you cant lean and put your head down when you block he called out Football is the most popular sport among high school boys with more than  million playing the game   But the sport has taken a hit in recent years over allegations that the game is unsafe Young athletes across all sports   each year according to researchers from Nationwide Childrens Hospital My teams varsity tight end Mack Woodfox is one of them I was hit helmettohelmet from the side of my face and I kind of stumbled over and after that my ears started ringing and my eyes kind of blacked out a little bit Mack says He missed a week of school and a few weeks of practice Almost   in high school football happen from playertoplayer contact Thats one reason the NFL Players Association negotiated   during practices But very few high school leagues have caught up with that NFL standard Texas has The state that brought you   and more recently a  million high school football stadium in the city of Allen has adopted one of the strictest limits on high school contact and tackling at practices The University Interscholastic League the association that sets rules for high school sports in Texas limited full contact during practice to  minutes a week Just south of Dallas DeSoto High School is home to one of the top football teams in the state Lauren Silverman a reporter for NPR member station KERA recently visited a DeSoto High football practice and says she saw no headtohead action or players falling to the ground after a tackle This is a tackling circuit explains DeSoto coach Paul Beattie The way we modified it is were not going to take them to the ground We dont want to hurt our own players In this type of tackling circuit drill players run   instead of into each other The teams head coach Claude Mathis welcomes the rule I saw a big improvement in our kids in our kids legs in their body language They werent as tired as they were before he says But players like DeSoto varsity linebacker Derion Woods are conflicted I mean they do it to keep us healthy but as a linebacker you do like hitting he says Texas and Arizona both have rules limiting contact during high school football practice But most states have no regulations If you get a concussion in the San Francisco Bay area you might end up at the University Of California San Francisco Medical Center with Dr Carlin Senter a primary care sports physician She had me take the test that she uses to check for concussions She read me a list of random words  elbow apple carpet saddle bubble  and asked me to repeat them back in any order I didnt get them all Its difficult to know what that might mean in my case Senter says because we dont have a baseline Who knows You might not be so good at remembering things So how can we figure out who just forgets bubble and who has a concussion In the NFL all players are required to take a   at the beginning of each year This gives their doctors a baseline assessment of players regular mental and physical state But at high schools theres no standard medical testing for football players Nor is there a standard requirement for medical personnel to be employed by the team That can contribute to situations like that of yearold Jackson Wegner He plays special teams for Novato High Schools football team the Hornets about  miles north of San Francisco I went up over here by the end zone to catch a ball and I jumped up and landed on my back and my head just whipped back and slammed against the turf and that was it he says He got a concussion during practice last season but it was not diagnosed  so he played in the next game As kicker he hit three field goals before a coach came to tell Jacksons mom Christine Wegner that something was wrong The coach said Jackson has a concussion He doesnt know where he is or what field goal hes supposed to be kicking at  she recalls And this is   he already scored all these points Wegner wants the team to be able to identify concussions sooner But theres some debate about how to do that She supported her sons team getting a baseline concussion test at the beginning of the new season Its an extra expense but Russell White commissioner for the Oakland Athletic League which governs all high school sports in Oakland says its worth it When you see the NFL doing things high schools and colleges are not too far behind I think it needs to happen White says White loves football Hes played all his life and even made it to the NFL But when it comes to his own children getting into football hes torn I often see my oldest son playing pickup games and theyre out there just doing what we did out there tackling each other White says And you start seeing the moves you start seeing the speed  How long can you keep him away from it And you see him smiling How do you say No  Joining a team is a decision that parents and teenagers have to make together Check out the safety standards at your school  and understand football is a dangerous game But dang it is fun
