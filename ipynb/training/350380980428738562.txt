Earlier this week I mentioned two of the more absorbing blogs Ive come across recently other corners of the online world where people are talking about aging and caregiving and the final phases of life Now let me recommend a couple of helpful Web sites First the recently revamped   produced by the Administration for Community Living part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services When elder care has become practically a way of life when youre so deep in the weeds you can hold forth for  minutes on the complexities of spending down its easy to forget how daunting the whole subject feels at the beginning LongTermCaregov well designed and clearly written serves as a useful primer an introduction to the basics Its been around since  so it was time for a refresh said Hunter McKay program manager for the administration We wanted to make the content digestible and manageable Now the site has a pathfinder tool that allows you to enter your age or your parents it then tailors content according to whether a person needs longterm care right now or probably will in the future Youll find a glossary of common terms sections on advance care planning and information on how to pay for help including longterm care insurance and reverse mortgages Past traffic showed that consumers want to know about Medicaid so youll find a section that explains eligibility and benefits Coming soon a national map that shows  state by state  median costs for home care assisted living and nursing homes A few weeks ago a national telephone survey by The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research demonstrated anew   and how ill prepared most of us are to confront it More than twothirds of Americans will at some point encounter the need for help with daily living remember Yet in this sample of adults over  only about half understood that fact They underestimated what nursing homes cost and overestimated what Medicare pays for and most had yet to discuss longterm care with family members The whole subject of aging is one that  percent said they preferred not to think about at all But when they do decide to think about it LongTermCaregov provides a good starting point You just hope people get there before a crisis hits Another subject that gives people the willies what we have learned to euphemistically call end of life Hence a small spate of Web sites that guide patients and families through this sensitive territory including   founded last year by Ellen Goodman a former syndicated columnist and the more recent   produced by Dr Rebecca Sudore a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco  which went live just last week takes a different tack This is not a howto Dr Mary Mulcahy an oncologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine told me We dont tell people how to have endoflife conversations with their families Life Matters founded by Dr Mulcahy and a Chicago television journalist Randi Belisomo instead serves as an information source on an array endoflife issues Youll find recent articles from medical journals which Dr Mulcahy will translate into comprehensible English  no minor feat A news wire section follows political and cultural developments and events People post their personal stories in audio slide shows and a series of columnists weigh in monthly on legal health religious and financial issues The founders are committed to an unbiased approach Ms Belisomo said We dont have an agenda were presenting the facts
