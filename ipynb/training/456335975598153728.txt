Returning to watch the Boston Marathon was never a question for Heather Abbott After losing her leg in the bombing last year watching the race is just one item on a long list of things she did before and intends to do again Also on that list wearing inch heels Sometimes I think Why am I doing this to myself Because I could just wear regular flat shoes Abbott says I dont want to give things up that I love to do so Im going to get used to it and figure it out As Abbott walks around her bright apartment in Newport RI decked out in skinny jeans and a favorite pair of nudecolored stilettos on a special highheeled prosthesis  with custommatched skin color and painted toenails  its hard to tell which foot is which Shes come a long way since last summer when she struggled to take her first steps in her first prosthesis a bulky blackmetal contraption It felt like I was walking on a stilt Abbott says Her leg was still so swollen and raw that every step hurt That would be one of my notbetter moments Abbott says This was going to be the first step literally in getting my life back and it was so much harder than I expected it to be It was hard not to despair This is what I have to walk the rest of my life Abbott wondered How am I gonna do this With time her wound grew less painful and Abbott found her stride She has had her share of lows  like the day the doorbell rang and she jumped out of bed forgetting about her foot and slammed to the floor She has also hit unimaginable highs such as the day she defiantly made her way on one foot and crutches before she had a prosthesis onto the mound at Fenway Park to throw out the first pitch Her friends cheered from the sidelines with Heather Strong Tshirts and banners That was just hours after Abbott was released from the hospital and about a month after marathon day when shed taken her annual trip with friends to watch the race from the finish line That day she was about to enter the Forum Restaurant when the second bomb exploded just a few feet from her Abbott was blown through the door Her foot felt like it was on fire and she couldnt get up So many people were running by and I was stuck there Abbott says People were literally running for their lives and I was afraid that nobody would stop People did stop cinching a belt around her leg to stop the bleeding dragging and then carrying Abbott to an ambulance The next few days were a blur from waking up to news that her foot would never again function or stop hurting to first lady Michelle Obama showing up in her hospital room just as Abbott was deciding whether to allow doctors to amputate her foot That was a choice Abbott says that was not really much of a choice at all The life that was described to me with keeping my leg was not one I wanted she explains I would be in chronic pain and I was going to be pretty much wheelchairbound Still the decision kept her up at night in tears Tending to look at a glass as halffull Abbott says making that decision herself rather than just waking up to find it done to her gave her a small sense of control when she felt anything but You cant help but have moments sometimes when you say Why did this have to happen and Why do things have to be so hard now  Abbott says I cant change it So I have to try to do the best with the situation that I have now To that end Abbott has filled her days with speaking engagements talking about her recovery to students caregivers and college graduates She believes her story of resilience and the strategies that helped her can apply to anyone Tentative at first she is now poised and upbeat at the podium She tells audiences about her assortment of prostheses her highheeled favorite her improved flatfooted leg a donated waterproof leg that allows her to paddleboard and a blade leg that she runs on Right now I have six legs Abbott joked to a room full of pharmacology students at a recent event Abbott says she has been buoyed by the kindness of strangers from around the world as well as from fellow survivors whom she avoided for the first month or so even though they were all in the same hospital I wasnt ready yet to deal with anybody else I was just absorbing the fact that this had happened to me Abbott says Then I realized I needed to be with them They were the only people on this planet who understand exactly what Im going through Now Abbott says they meet up often for dinners or at physical therapy and theyve even started their own yoga group where no one has to feel uncomfortable about wearing or not wearing a prosthesis Abbott says she has also drawn strength from the many other amputees who came to visit her in the hospital mostly male veterans who were wounded in combat She says she was especially uplifted by the one female amputee who came Aviva Drescher of the reality TV show   It was a really big deal for me when Aviva walked in with high heels Abbott says I had a lot of questions about what I was going to look like and what Id be able to wear but I never would ask a room full of war heroes Drescher reassured Abbott she would once again wear skirts and heels and would even go dancing It made me feel OK Abbott says It made me feel like Im going to be able to do this
