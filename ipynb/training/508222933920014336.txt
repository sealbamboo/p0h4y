A growing number of Americans seem to believe that everything is better with butter I love butter says Ashleigh Armstrong  as she sips coffee at a cafe in Washington DCs Union Station Among her favorites Anything from Julia Childs cookbooks Theres no margarine in Ashleighs refrigerator Im not going to have the fake stuff she says adding that shed rather indulge a little in rich foods and burn it off at a spinning class And no shes not worried about cholesterol Thats her grandmothers generations concern she says Ashleighs butter habit represents a paradigm shift in the US thats been taking place gradually Americans   eating more butter Theres no question about it says Harry Balzer of the NPD Group a marketing research firm that tracks Americans eating habits He says that back in the mids only about  percent of households he surveyed were cooking with butter or spreading it on their morning toast Most families were eating margarine The increase in butter consumption in America coincides with the decline in margarine consumption Balzer says Two decades ago more than  percent of households reported consuming margarine But as that figure has dropped to about half of households butter consumption has grown about  percent Its a significant change Balzer says So what might explain this shift Well for many years Americans had been hearing the message to avoid animal fats to protect our hearts Cholesterol was the nutritional bogeyman And margarine is cholesterolfree Back in   percent of cooks in the households Balzer surveyed said they were concerned about the amount of cholesterol in their food Today that number is  percent Its dropped quite a bit Balzer says And this is likely because the science of fat has evolved First there was the revelation that  found in many margarine spreads back in the s and early s were really bad for us Then add the new evidence that   is not so bad Theres also a growing movement toward clean less processed foods Now you might assume that the rebound could explain the predictions by some that the US is close to a butter shortage But as we   earlier this week this isnt really the case Inventory of Americanmade butter is low because of the appetites of butter lovers in other countries including Egypt and Morocco Exports are way up Since the early s weve basically gone from zero exports of butter to where its  or  percent of our market Thats an incredible growth rate says dairy economist Brian Gould of the University of Wisconsin As for the stories making the rounds on the Internet   well that sounds like a bit much even to butterlover Ashleigh Armstrong and her partner Simon Anderfuhren who is French In France we put butter on bread and then we dip it in the coffee and we eat it like this for breakfast he said as he sat next to Armstrong at the Union Station cafe But we never just pour a spoon of butter in the coffee Never
