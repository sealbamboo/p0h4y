Assisted living underwent a big growth spurt in the s as major corporations built and bought facilities and almost ever since advocacy groups and researchers have been warning that however attractive these places look  chandeliered lobbies pleasant individual apartments the inevitable gazebo outside  the care they provide tends to be mediocre at best Many of these communities dont hire or retain enough adequately trained staff to support their increasingly old and frail residents who are not the active silverhaired strollers depicted in brochures but people typically in their late s with multiple health problems and high rates of cognitive loss Critics have pointed out that unlike federally regulated nursing homes assisted living facilities are governed by a hodgepodge of state laws some provide decent oversight while others remain quite lax So the hourlong Frontline documentary Life and Death in Assisted Living airing Tuesday night on PBS stations across the country doesnt really break new ground on the subject But it is important nonetheless One reason is that families who make most of the decisions about assisted living dont pore over gerontology journals or state regulations as they are looking for a place that is not a nursing home So they dont always realize that these reassuringlooking residences may have no nurse on the premises most of the time that health care in assisted living frequently consists of a  call that the average length of stay  according to the Assisted Living Federation of America  is less than two years For the average  monthly fee  a national average from a  Metlife survey that conceals huge variations between say Montgomery Ala  and Stamford Conn   families expect a final home full of attentive helpers They may get that sometimes But they will learn from this documentary how vigilant they need to be A coinvestigation by Frontline and the nonprofit news organization ProPublica which will publish an accompanying story Tuesday the film delves into several worstcase examples making full use of the dramatic power of visual media In oncamera interviews grieving relatives tell about the man with dementia who found industrial dishwashing liquid in an unlocked cabinet drank it and died of burns to his lips throat and esophagus for which the state of Georgia fined his assisted living facility  And about a Mississippi woman with dementia who managed to pry open a window in her secondstory apartment and jumped to her death About a California woman with dementia  perhaps you see a pattern here  who suffered so much from pressure ulcers that when family members sued a jury awarded them more than  million in punitive damages All these cases occurred in facilities owned by the largest American assisted living chain Emeritus several of whose former staff members and executives acknowledge that the facilities took in residents too sick for assisted living that the staffing was inadequate and that people were assigned jobs for which they hadnt been properly trained It is true that with roughly a million elderly people in such facilities many very old and in poor health tragedies will inevitably occur But pressure to keep apartments filled labor costs low and shareholders happy increases the likelihood When families enter this zone therefore they cant be lulled by the chandeliers Assisted living remains a reasonable option for people who cant manage their own households any longer who need help with personal care but who arent so ill that they require  nursing But given the lack of inspections or regulations with teeth residents will fare better if families carefully monitor their condition and step in when necessary  Life and Death in Assisted Living helps to explain why
