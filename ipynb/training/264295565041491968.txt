Health care in general  and Medicare in particular  have been big parts of this years presidential campaign But over the last couple of weeks Republican Mitt Romney has been making a new claim that doesnt quite clear the accuracy bar It has to do with  billion in Medicare reductions over  years included in the federal health law the Affordable Care Act And its become a standard part of Romneys stump speech Heres how he put it last week in his   in Ames Iowa Not true says   a professor of public health policy at the University of Chicago Im honestly rather baffled at the arguments that Governor Romney is making Now it   true that the law envisions   And some of that money will help pay for the rest of the law And there are problems in some places with doctors not being willing to accept Medicare patients But those two things arent actually connected The problem with   actually predates passage of the health law by more than a decade  its a preexisting condition if you will Pollack says And every year Congress has to go through the song and dance with something called the   to prevent Medicare fees from a fairly catastrophic reduction That has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act Health reform does not cut physician fees In fact the nations doctors were furious when the health law passed in  that it   It turned out that would have been too expensive Thats why Congress is still grappling with the problem today The law did however take a few steps to boost some payments for some doctors says Pollack including improving   providers in both Medicare as well as the Medicaid program where the shortage of doctors has been even more acute So how does Gov Romney back his claim A campaign email pointed to a   of doctors by the Physicians Foundation in which  percent said the law would prompt them to close their practices to new Medicare patients But the survey had a response rate of only  and more than twothirds of those who responded started out with a selfdescribed negative view of the law
