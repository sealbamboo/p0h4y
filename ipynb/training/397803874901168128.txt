Haskell details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in her latest book   At the time of the announcement Chevey was married to a woman Eleanor and a loving stepdad to their two children  Hampton now divorced lives as a heterosexual female after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries hormone therapy and a wardrobe overhaul  Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling  The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity  Youve obviously come to terms with Ellens decision What did it take on your part  First of all I realized very soon that its very overwhelming I knew I could never say dont do this My brother would have never hurt anyone so it really told me how powerful the feeling was Watching her go through it and evolve  not only was she radiantly happy but she was completely upfront with it Seeing how she handled it  she would talk about it if people wanted to  showed me this was meant to be  Yet you do candidly write about having unexpected anxiety about the news  I was afraid for her I was flabbergasted that this was going on There was shock and apprehension I had been all for more diversity and challenging binary roles for male and female behavior but it didnt somehow include my brother changing sexes  The one thing is that we are born male or female and we need those boundaries to rub up against I think one interesting thing a feminist said to me is that I seem to embrace these binary principles in the book I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female we need these dichotomies like good and evil We make these divides to keep our footing in the world  The sex were born is not immutable and that is very hard to grasp You cant really call her decision a choice Its too painful too perilous it has to be an urge that we dont even have a word for  What was your takeaway from Ellens journey  I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all For example the director of The Matrix Larry Wachowski who is now Lana Wachowski has this wild red hair My sister is so not like that This book is an attempt to unweird the whole subject I think its more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal but I do think we have to remember that its not that many people So much changes but so much doesnt change You can take hormones to change this have surgery to change that but you cant change the voice the hair the love  there is a core of self that doesnt change How has it been different to have a sister rather than a brother  Its wonderful Its like Ive gotten two for the price of one We have differences  it takes so long for her to get dressed Were just much closer than weve ever been Its hard to say the change hasnt made her happier At first I thought Im really losing a brother It was like a grief a death But her happiness is crucial Shes more open more gregarious I think my mother wouldve been very very upset but in a funny way Ellen is the kind of person my mother wanted Chevey to be  How was it different at age  than it might have been earlier  I think the reason she didnt go through with it before is because there was no acceptance Why is so much of this happening now Because it can There is a word for it and there are people doing it This submerged desire finally had a means of being liberated  Having Ellen in your life took some adjusting even in small areas like the correct language right   The first time we went out in public I was very selfconscious and nervous We went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food I said Mine is good but his is fabulous She Ellen smirked and I smirked  I would often call her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us And on the phone the voice is a huge thing that is not improvable There is no good surgery When she gets on the phone I would see her as Chevey my brother  Recently though Ive stopped doing that Its automatically Ellen  Ellen initially didnt want you to write the book but then she changed her mind Why  She wished she had this book when she was struggling with it I wanted it to be her book as much as my book I think of it as a partnership
