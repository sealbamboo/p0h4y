Everybody needs an HIV test at least once Thats the verdict from the US Preventive Services Task Force which has just joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a scrum of professional medical societies in calling for   for the virus that causes AIDS Teenagers and adults ages  to  should get screened for HIV the   say with retesting at least once a year for people at higher risk of infection including men who have sex with men and people who use IV drugs The task force also recommends that women in labor be tested for HIV if they dont know their status The independent group which evaluates tests and treatments by weighing risks and harms shied away from recommending universal testing back in  because it saw risks in the side effects of treatment But with treatments becoming more powerful and safe turning AIDS into a chronic disease rather than a death sentence the panel decided that universal screening will help people get into treatment faster and thus help reduce spread of the virus About  people become infected in the United States each year Right now  to  percent of the Americans who are infected with HIV dont know it according to the task force The percentage is much higher among    about  percent We would hope to capture people who either werent aware that they were at increased risk or preferred not to disclose that says   director of the Center For Health Policy at Stanford University That includes women Owens says since most women who get AIDS in the United States are infected through heterosexual sex Owens says Were trying to identify everyone who has HIV irrespective of risk behaviors Everyone in that  to  age group should be tested at least once the USPSTF says but after that the advice gets more complicated The evidence makes it challenging to say it ought to be this often Owens told Shots The   was published in   The CDC   that people with risk factors including multiple sex partners IV drug use and men having sex with men get tested at least once a year and perhaps more That is reasonable Owens says If you are at ongoing risk if you have new sexual partners periodically it would make sense to get screened
