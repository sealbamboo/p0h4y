My husband wont talk to me when we run Me I need to carry on a conversation from the minute I start running to the minute I stop The chitchat helps me forget the misery of the task at hand But more than that when I run alone my mind will bully me into slowing down or stopping When I run with other people my mind wont dare speak up  and I wind up running longer and faster than when I run alone With that in mind I joined a local running club and posted a message on Facebook saying I was looking for running mates I aint fast but I aint that slow either I wrote Within hours two women responded For weeks now Ive been running with Susanne and Tina though Tina knows so many runners well often have a third or fourth woman tag along I live by the ocean so we run along the boardwalk talking all the while about our kids accomplishments our fights with spouses or about relationships that fell apart before theyd even begun I feel like I have a gang a team mates Theyve also helped my speed and endurance For years my usual run has been just over three miles at a rate of about  a mile On my first outing with my new running mates I ran four miles at an minutemile pace On our second I ran nearly  miles at a pace of about  a mile I was delighted My inner voice could no longer hold me back mostly because I was no longer listening But running with others I soon learned can have its downsides too One rainy morning recently I thought about skipping my run But Id skipped one the week before also because of rain Tina had wound up going that day and said the rain held off and that it was a beautiful run  So I put on a waterproof running jacket which made a swishing noise as the sleeves brushed against my torso I liked the sound I felt like a real runner I was going out in the rain something I would never have done alone  I called out to my husband See you later Im running with the big dogs Ive got a gang now you know I could hear  in my head Everything is awesome Everything is cool when were part of a team When I arrived at the coffee shop where we usually meet Tina was already there with another runner Id messaged her the night before asking whether the new runner was a   I dont understand shed texted back  I initially thought she didnt understand my reference Im more than a decade older than she is and when I saw her at the coffee shop tried to explain who Speedy Gonzales was I know who he is she said Im just tired of people complaining about how slow they are The other woman chimed in that she was slow though I wasnt sure I believed her Shed just come from swimming laps at the local pool Id just come from my bed As we started to run Tina asked her how her  training was going Whats a TripleC I asked TripleT  its four races in one weekend the woman replied Her idea of slow was certainly very different from mine The last thing I remember hearing before they began to pull ahead was something about how the womans husband was annoyed about how much shed been training I tried to keep up with them but no matter how fast I went they were always several lengths ahead of me and the gap kept widening  Thats cold I thought Only in running  or junior high school  is it acceptable to just leave someone flat I kept thinking if Tina turns around and sees how far behind I am shell never run with me again Id done this run many times but this time as I trailed behind the other two runners in the pelting rain it felt harder than ever I finally caught up to them when I reached a drawbridge to a neighboring town They waited for me I thought relieved We stopped to take a photo Tina told me You going to keep going Were heading back I followed their lead The wind was now at our backs propelling me forward and enabling me to keep up with them though it was a struggle I couldnt speak and could barely keep up with the conversation At one point I thought they were talking about leukemia but realized they were discussing tattoos When we got back to the coffee shop Tina asked if I was walking home as we both live in town but I said I took my car  You drove she asked I was running late I said  We still run together though not as much Tina no doubt realized I was slowing her down But I realized something as well I never would have done it on my own Even though I felt left out during our run a little ashamed and embarrassed even I kept going Since then Ive been running farther and faster morning after morning even in the rain And when the little voice in my head tries to say Stop I cant go any farther I can now say Um actually I can
