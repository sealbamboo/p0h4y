The past year has seen more debate about the best way to find breast cancers A   concluded that regular mammograms havent reduced the rate of advanced breast cancers  but they have led more than a million women to be diagnosed with tumors that didnt need to be treated For mammography screening to work it must take women who are destined to develop latestage cancers and find them when theyre earlystage   coauthor of that analysis tells Shots Unfortunately it looks like screening has had very little impact on the rate at which women present with latestage cancer Mammographys defenders say that analysis is deeply flawed They just used the wrong numbers says   of Massachusetts General Hospital Had they used the correct estimate they would have found theres been a major decrease in advanced cancers Kopans is promoting a new technology  which he invented  that promises to find even more and smaller breast tumors Well come back to that shortly The  mammography debate is a continuation of a   touched off three years ago when the US Preventive Services Task Force   women under  dont need regular mammograms That panel says the risks of needless biopsies and unnecessary treatment outweigh the benefits in lives saved Faced with such conflicting claims some women are   regular mammograms But the fear of breast cancer is so great that other women are doubling down Theyre getting radical treatments even double mastectomies for precancerous tumors that some authorities think would never cause them harm Health writer   of the New America Foundation says the issue is a prime example of what she calls American medicines tendency to overdiagnose and overtreat disease Shes the author of  Currently Brownlee says most doctors present annual mammograms as a gottodoit thing not an individual choice Brownlee whos  has made up her mind She doesnt get regular mammograms But she says it wasnt easy We have been told for oh almost a century now that catching cancer early is always a good thing she tells Shots So when people come along and say Well maybe screening may not always be such a great thing its very very difficult to contemplate that As she delved into the subject Brownlee was impressed with the downside of routine mammograms  an oncologist and chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society tells Shots that  percent of women in their s who get yearly mammograms for  years will be told at some point that the test has found something suspicious requiring further tests And  percent will be told they need a breast biopsy In the end about  percent of these women will have breast cancer And many experts believe some of those would never have caused a problem if they hadnt been diagnosed When Brownlee decided she didnt want an annual mammogram that put her at loggerheads with her doctor She would say You have to get a mammogram and I would demur Brownlee explains And she would say Not a week goes by that a patient of mine didnt have her life saved by getting a mammogram And I wanted to say How do you know Because you cant know after the fact That in fact is true While studies show routine mammograms do save lives overall even their staunchest advocates acknowledge you cant know in a particular case Eventually Brownlee and her doctor worked it out She said shed get an occasional mammogram in her s and promised the doctor that shed get treated if an invasive cancer was found The doctor had assumed that she wouldnt Kopans the mammography specialist in Boston has an answer to those who lament the high rate of false positives from mammograms  those indicating something suspicious that turns out not to be cancer Hes invented a D mammogram called   It uses a computer to create D pictures of the breast It subtracts a lot of the visual fuzziness or noise in D mammograms that obscures many breast tumors With tomosynthesis I can page through the breast as if its the pages in a book Kopans says demonstrating the technology in a closetsized room at Massachusetts General Hospital Now Im pointing to a cancer thats much more easily seen because weve gotten whats in front and whats in back of it out of the way Kopans who says he has no financial stake in companies marketing tomosynthesis machines says D mammograms will drastically reduce the percentage of women who are   after a routine mammogram for further tests including biopsies Its pretty clear we detect more cancers with it he says But some like Brawley worry that as doctors find more and smaller breast tumors theyll also increase the detection of breast cancers that probably dont need to be treated Specialists call that   Some of the D imaging machines are just spectacular in diagnosing small lesions he tells Shots Now we dont know that theyre diagnosing small lesions that need to be diagnosed and need to be treated Brawley says research is under way to answer that important question Were on the verge of some tests to actually be able to say Mrs Smith youve got breast cancer but its the kind we need to watch Mrs Jones youve got breast cancer its the kind we need to treat  He thinks thats five to  years away Meanwhile the American Cancer Society recommends that women get regular mammograms starting in their s  as long as they understand it may lead them into difficult choices about what to do next
