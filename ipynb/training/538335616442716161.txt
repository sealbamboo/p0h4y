If youve seen the classic movie   you know that Ralphie really really wanted that BB gun And you know that his mother his teacher even the department store Santa all said Youll shoot your eye out Theyre right the nations ophthalmologists say And though BB guns still top the eye doctors list of waytoodangerous toys each year there are new contenders for that dubious prize Like the   which makes it possible to shoot glowing brands across a darkened room Am I alone in thinking that this sounds like tons of fun At short range it packs a punch says Dr Jane Edmond a pediatric ophthalmologist at Texas Childrens Hospital and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology It can cause bleeding cataracts retinal detachment That doesnt sound good The foam on the Air Storm arrows isnt enough to prevent injury Edmond explains Thats why the Air Storm bow ended up at the top of the  for WATCH a nonprofit promoting toy safety Truth be told my family abandoned our allout Nerf gun battles after a suctioncup dart nailed my husband right in the eye Luckily he had glasses on they stopped the dart Otherwise he might have been on the way to the ER too Parents need to weigh in and use their common sense Edmond says Wearing polycarbonate glasses or goggles will shield eyes against projectiles But they dont come with the Air Storm Firetek Bow or indeed any toy I can think of For toys like a BB gun or a trampoline the sense of danger is part of what makes it such exhilarating fun As a child I loved throwing heavy steel Jarts across the yard with my brothers But Jarts were banned in  after thousands of children were seriously injured by the projectiles Some were killed In  the American Academy told parents   because of the high injury count So I keep weighing thrill vs caution in the toy aisle Ive let my daughter shoot a BB gun and go hang gliding But Im resisting the trampoline despite serious kid pressure This is one Christmas when there wont be a glowing crossbow under the tree either
