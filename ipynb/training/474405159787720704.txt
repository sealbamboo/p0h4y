Talent and tactics aside the  World Cup could be won or lost by hamstrings those long stringy muscles and tendons that run along the backs of the thigh from the hip to the knee The most common injury in soccer hamstring strains and tears democratically strike highschool players adultleague hobbyists and such luminaries as Argentinas Lionel Messi and Spains Diego Costa Anyone in fact participating in a sport involving highspeed striding  whether track and field football ultimate Frisbee basketball dance baseball marathons or even brisk walking  is at risk of a hamstring injury The hamstrings decelerate the leg as it swings forward So near the end of each running stride especially during sprints they are under considerable strain and if insufficiently strong may rip Enter the Nordic hamstring exercise According to at least half a dozen recent studies   by practicing its simple steps After warming up kneel on the ground with a spotter securing your ankles Then as slowly and smoothly as possible lean forward so that your chest approaches the ground Use your hamstrings to put the brakes on your forward momentum until you can no longer resist gravity Put out your arms at that point to stop your fall Allow your chest to touch the ground then push yourself upright to repeat the exercise   Danish soccer players were randomly assigned to either an offseason program of the Nordic exercise or normal training In the subsequent season those following the Nordic exercise program experienced  percent fewer injuries than the controlgroup athletes Players who had previously suffered hamstring damage saw  percent fewer injuries The Nordic exercise works the study researchers conclude because of its eccentricity Eccentric muscle contractions occur when a muscle extends as it contracts Lower a weight during a biceps curl for instance and your forearm muscles lengthen at the same time as they clench Raise that same weight upward and the contractions become concentric shortening as they contract In general eccentric contractions result in more force moving through the muscle than occurs during concentric ones If you run hills its the downhill portion of the workout that leaves your muscles twinging the next day not the ascents But once those muscles heal usually within a few days they become stronger than before Eccentric exercises also seem to spark changes in the nervous system that result in improved coordination between brain and muscles Some physical therapists have expressed concern that the Nordic exercise if practiced without adequate healing time between sessions could weaken tissue and lead to a hamstring tear But researchers at the Sports Orthopedic Research Center in Copenhagen who led the  study documented no related injuries It is important though to ease in said Dr Jesper Petersen the studys lead author One weekly session is plenty at first you might easily complete it during the United States vs Ghana halftime break Week   session  repetitions Week   sessions  repetitions each Week   sessions  to  repetitions each Week   sessions  to  repetitions each Weeks     sessions  repetitions each divided into  sets of  then  then  repetitions After  weeks try to perform one weekly maintenance session of  repetitions
