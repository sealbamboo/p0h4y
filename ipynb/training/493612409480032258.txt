Nobody looks forward to spending their final years in a nursing home yet  million Americans are living in this oftenfeared institutional setting You may not want to place a loved one in a nursing home for more than a shortterm recovery  but never promise an aging relative that it wont happen When faced with the responsibilities of providing hour care for an aging person with everincreasing physical needs beyond what one person can physically handle a nursing home frequently becomes the best alternative Joanna R Leefer writes in Almost Like Home a userfriendly guide to choosing a nursing home Nursing homes generally have had a bad reputation as smelly indifferent places where people go to die But there are some homes that are better than being at home Ms Leefer said in an interview And there are many more good facilities than bad ones Ms Leefer developed her expertise through personal and professional experience and her book is replete with checklists and scores of relevant websites She learned a lot firsthand as primary caregiver for her aging parents one of whom lived three years with nursinghometype care She worked five years for an advocacy organization for older adults and she founded a consulting firm ElderCareGiving to help families make difficult care decisions Finding a place that suits the needs of an aging relative or friend and those who plan to visit requires considerable preparation The biggest mistake people make is waiting until the last minute when faced with a crisis to find a suitable facility Ms Leefer said Youre forced into an impulsive decision that youre not likely to be happy with unless youre really very lucky She likened it to shopping for a new car Do the research start looking around find out whats available what each facility offers whats best for your loved one Become an educated consumer Crass as it may seem you might start with the cost When paid for privately the average ranges from  to  a month   does not pay for longterm nursing home care only temporary skilled care usually in the rehabilitation section of the home If the patient qualifies for   and the nursing home accepts it most of the cost is generally covered The beneficiary must be age  or older disabled and a United States citizen He or she can have no more than a certain amount of assets as determined by the state Some patients become eligible by transferring savings and assets to a third party at least five years ahead of time Next choose a reasonably convenient location for likely frequent visitors You can search for possibilities online by township or ZIP code Ask neighbors and friends in the area for any recommendations or information they might have about homes in the area Make a list of homes in the chosen area and check out the governments report card at   Every home that receives federal funding must be evaluated and rated on a scale of  to   being best The assessments are far from perfect a recent study for instance found that star ratings often   Still Ms Leefer suggests considering only homes with a rating of  or higher Then start examining their characteristics What specialized services might the patient need  a   program mobility practice   Are there medical specialists on call Is the home affiliated with a good nearby hospital If the patient has a personal physician you might prefer a home where that doctor has privileges If the patient is not fluent in English are there staff members and other residents who speak the persons language Are there activities that would interest the patient including opportunities to go outdoors Dont rely on brochures Take a tour preferably more than once at different times including mealtimes Visit more than one floor Does the place look and smell clean An odor of urine is a clue to neglect Are the rooms light and airy Are residents permitted to have a few personal decorative items or furnishings Observe how patients are treated by staff members Are they courteous patient friendly and respectful of patients privacy Are patients greeted by the staff and addressed by name Are those that need it helped with eating and drinking Are there rigid wakeup bed and meal times or do patients have some choice Do the menus offer selections If possible talk with a few of the residents and their family members Ms Leefer suggests preparing a checklist for the   you are considering listing issues relevant to quality of life quality of care safety nutrition and hydration Admission to a nursing home is not automatic but based on such factors as bed availability care requirements and the patients condition It is best to submit applications to chosen homes well in advance of a needed admission Waiting lists can be longer than a year Your job does not end once a family member is admitted monitoring the care provided is critical At first expect resistance from the patient often accompanied by a loud desire to get me out of here now Visit often and stay as long as possible to ease the transition Ms Leefer says Be sure you or someone trustworthy is authorized to serve as the patients health care proxy so critical medical decisions can be made when he cannot speak for himself Make sure you have access to medical records and be present when the patient is examined and dressed Check for any hints of   and signs of incipient or existing bed sores which can become infected and hasten death Find out the names of staff in charge of various services and speak to them about the patients special needs or problems Keep notes dated with any issues of concern Try to solve any problems with the nursing home staff Be polite softspoken and avoid confrontation A hostile approach puts people on the defensive and is unlikely to get the patients needs addressed If necessary speak to the heads of departments filing a formal complaint with the health department should be a last resort
