Doctors are often called upon to deliver bad news to patients and there isnt much thats worse than a diagnosis of an advancedstage cancer for which there is no cure But theres new evidence that a surprisingly large majority of patients who receive this news dont fully comprehend it or perhaps willfully choose to ignore it Almost three out of every four patients diagnosed with stage IV lung or colon cancer believe that chemotherapy can cure them of their disease according to a survey of more than  cancer patients by the   And yet for cancers diagnosed at that late of a stage chemotherapy has been definitively shown to extend lifespan by only a few months at best Deborah Schrag a physician at DanaFarber who helped conduct the study says patients who dont understand the severity of their diagnosis cant make plans for their final few months or years If you think chemo is going to cure you she says maybe you dont have that conversation about a trip to California Maybe you spend your time getting chemo and you dont spend time on your boat We know that when people have unrealistic expectations theyre much less open to discussing endoflife planning The   which appears this week in the   also found that patients who rated their doctor as being a good communicator were more likely to hold mistaken beliefs about their prognosis Schrag says this indicates that some doctors may be trying to tell their patients what they think they want to hear rather than the truth Its not that doctors dont disclose that chemotherapy wont cure the cancer Its that we disclose quickly and then move on she says But patients always want positive news In the short term people will be happier if you give them happier news  an oncologist at the Washington Hospital Center and president of the   says its ultimately the doctors responsibility to ensure that their patient fully understands whats happening to them There needs to be continued communication about the prognosis and it needs to be done early on she says I dont think physicians do it particularly well  Many physicians just have a very hard time communicating that theyre not going to be able to cure the patient Swain says the results of the DanaFarber survey are a sign that doctors need do a better job of helping terminally ill cancer patients let go of false hopes without squashing all hope You dont want to take away hope from patients says Swain Theyre not going to be cured but its not like theyre going to die instantly So it is a really hard balance to achieve And comprehensive palliative care still be hard to find only   of hospitals with more than  beds offer it as Michelle Andrews   last year
