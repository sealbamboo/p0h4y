 The coffee or other caffeinated beverages a woman drinks during her pregnancy might up the odds for a low birth weight newborn or an extended pregnancy a new study says The researchers included data on nearly  Norwegian women As the risk for having a low birth weight baby was associated with   pregnant women might be counseled to reduce their caffeine intake during pregnancy as much as possible said lead researcher Dr Verena Sengpiel an obstetriciangynecologist at the Sahlgrenska Academy of Sahlgrenska University in Goteborg Sweden She believes the findings should also spur a reevaluation of current recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which advises that a pregnant womans caffeine intake not exceed two cups of coffee per day However because the study was observational in nature it cant establish a causeandeffect relationship between caffeine and low birth weight Sengpiel stressed We cannot say from our data whether caffeine is the specific substance responsible for the fetus being at greater risk of becoming a low birth weight infant nor did we study if these babies actually had special health problems during the neonatal period Sengpiel said The report was published online Feb  in the journal   In the study Sengpiels team accounted for all sources of caffeine including coffee tea sodas and food including cocoa such as is found in desserts and chocolate for almost  pregnancies tracked by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health They found that while caffeine was not linked to premature birth caffeine from all sources was tied to a higher risk for reduced birth weight For example if an infants weight is expected to be  pounds  ounces every  milligrams of caffeine consumed by its mother a day reduced a newborns weight by almost an ounce the researchers reported According to the Mayo Clinic the average cup of Americanstyle brewed coffee contains between  and  milligrams mg of caffeine Moreover every  mg of caffeine consumed per day increased the length of pregnancy by five hours And when the caffeine came from coffee as opposed to other sources the length of pregnancy was extended eight extra hours the study authors found Given this finding it is likely that it is not only the caffeine but something else in coffee that is acting to extend pregnancy the researchers added Dr Jennifer Wu an obstetriciangynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said Other studies have indicated that caffeine can affect fetal weight so this is in accord with findings of other studies Why caffeine might cause this effect is unclear she said We do know that caffeine crosses the placenta and the baby is not able to metabolize it very well so it may affect some of the factors associated with growth Wu theorized She advised that women limit the amount of   The World Health Organization says  mg a day but in the United States the recommended amount is  mg a day she added Wu noted that is the amount of caffeine in two small cups of coffee not a Starbucks size coffee There is less caffeine in a cup of tea or a piece of chocolate which has about  mg of caffeine she said
