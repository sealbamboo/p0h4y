Getting people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act remains an uphill battle in much of Florida Politicians in the state erected   to the law from the beginning  from joining in the   to placing restrictions on what insurance helpers called navigators can tell people seeking advice Even so advocates have been trying to get the word out to an estimated  million Floridians who qualify for new subsidies to make coverage more affordable Florida has the secondhighest rate of   in the US yet it seems many who could benefit the most arent interested in listening The message will be hardest to get across many say in the Florida Panhandle where sandy white beaches on the Gulf Coast back up to vast pine forests Towns are small and scattered The area is closer both politically and geographically to neighboring Georgia and Alabama than faraway Miami At local events like the recent   and the selfproclaimed Worlds Largest Free Fish Fry in   its not hard to find people like Elijah Mott an itinerant heavy equipment operator who says he doesnt know much about the health care law and that most of what hes heard is bad I think it sucks he says The median household income in this county is about  a year Lots of jobs here dont come with health insurance That means many here like Mott who doesnt have steady work at the moment probably qualify for subsidies to help them afford coverage But Mott isnt buying the idea that the health law could possibly be good for his family I would have to say no Mott says I havent investigated deep enough to know if there is anything Mott and yearold Michael Dees of Mayo who works in a paper mill have mostly heard that Obamacare is going to increase the price of health insurance making it more unaffordable for people like them Dees says he expects to be laid off soon and worries about how hes going to buy coverage for his family Who can afford  a month he asks Its easier to pay for the damn penalty at the end of the year the IRS is going to charge you than pay  a month Dees says its news to him that the health law offers people making less than  a year help paying monthly premiums I really hadnt heard about the subsidy he says Guys like Dees and Mott are exactly who health law advocates like   are trying to reach A longtime lobbyist for childrens and family issues in Floridas capital Tallahassee she says its tough to convince people here that the law might help them Its challenging to overcome messages that are coming out of elected officials offices and a governors office she says Florida said no to both the laws   and to tens of millions of dollars to advertise new subsidies for those with incomes between  and  percent of the federal poverty level Privately funded groups like   are trying to supply the outreach and education in Florida That includes partnering with churches like the Sanctuary at Mt Calvary in urban Jacksonville on Floridas Atlantic coast about three hours east of Perry  invited Enroll America representatives to address his congregation one recent Sunday From the pulpit he warns his flock of several hundred against misinformation he says opponents of the law are spreading People perish for what he asks Lack of knowledge comes the practiced response Newman tells congregants that the law helped him get coverage after a large private insurer turned him down because of a preexisting condition This Affordable Care Act is saving lives he says The message hits home with yearold truck driver Anthony Person I never knew what it was before until I started coming to this church Person says Pastor Newman he says started explaining it to us the way I could understand it Person left his contact information at the   table in the churchs lobby to get help signing up for new Obamacare coverage My job is one that does not have the best benefits so I need health insurance to cover myself he says And then there are those who might just fall through the cracks Back in the Panhandle Karen Ray wishes subsidies to help working people afford coverage had been available when she was running her small business out of Delray Beach There hasnt been a realization how many people out there are the working poor she says working hard and not getting health care And just living paycheck to paycheck and hoping nothing goes wrong Things went wrong for Ray in a big way after the   in  I had a beach wedding business and it kind of went downhill after the oil spill she says Ive just been trying to get back on my feet since then Even before the oil spill her business never generated enough income to provide health insurance says Ray  She used to get coverage through her husbands job I lost my business and my marriage and my house at the same time she says laughing wryly Thats left her uninsured She knows about the law  and she also knows that because she lives in Florida she is unlikely to benefit from it If Ray lived in one of the   expanding Medicaid she would qualify for new coverage But because Florida isnt expanding being poor alone isnt enough to get Medicaid here Benefits here are reserved primarily for children pregnant women and the disabled And because Ray has no income she wont qualify for new Affordable Care Act tax credits designed to help the working poor afford private health coverage I could maybe scrounge up the money to go get a mammogram What if it comes back positive What happens to me Its not like you can show up in the emergency room and say Ooh I have an emergency lump That wont happen says Ray I think a lot of us are gonna fall through the cracks she says and Im very irate about that very irate about that    In recent months NPR staff has published a series of
