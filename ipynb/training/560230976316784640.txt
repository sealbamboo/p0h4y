While dentists have been using video glasses and TV screens to distract their patients . , this is the first time the technique has been tested in interventional radiology treatments.. The study involved 49 patients between ages 18 and 87. Each of them was getting a minor outpatient treatment -- a biopsy or a catheter in the arm or chest. Twenty-five of the patients were given video glasses during their procedures. The other half got nothing.. Volunteers filled out a stress form before and after the procedure to indicate how anxious they were. The researchers found that people who used the video glasses said they were on average 18.1% less anxious after their treatment. People who did not use the glasses were only 7.5% less anxious.. The researchers found the glasses were especially helpful to women, and to people who were the most anxious before their procedure.. Because the glasses are just a little bigger than sunglasses, they are not in the way and do not pose any hazards, the researchers say.. And who wouldn't rather watch a TV show instead of a needle going into your arm?
