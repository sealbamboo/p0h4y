Getting tested for HIV in the US is almost always private sometimes even secretive Ditto for disclosing the results But some say the approach is outmoded at a time when many at risk for HIV  gay men  are in committed relationships Research   as many as twothirds of new HIV infections among gay men these days are within committed couples Thats very different from the days when promiscuity fueled the epidemic The implications of this for HIV prevention are big AIDS researcher   says what brought it home for him was the   that gay men in coupled relationships arent any more likely to know each others HIV status as those with casual sex partners In our analysis lack of awareness was pretty much the same Sullivan tells Shots So Sullivan and his colleagues decided to borrow a strategy that has worked in Africa For  years heterosexual couples in Rwanda Zambia and other countries have been encouraged to get tested for HIV together  and learn the results at the same time from counselors who can help them deal with the information whatever it is The result is a program called   Successfully piloted in Atlanta Chicago Boston San Diego and Seattle the program is being rolled out nationally in HIV prevention programs funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Couples go through the whole process together Sullivan says They get pretest counseling together Get their blood drawn together Get the results together And make a plan on how theyre going to remain HIVnegative  or how to support an HIVpositive partner to get into care and keep the negative partner negative David Lozano and Kevin Kreinbring a gay couple in Chicago say it makes a big difference Its just very comforting to do this jointly says Lozano a yearold painter and art instructor It kind of affirms our trust with each other I feel like we may not get tested as frequently otherwise He says the couple generally get tested together every six months Kreinbring a yearold accountant says some of the benefits have been unexpected It almost becomes an event he tells Shots In a bizarre way I almost look forward to it It creates a lot of dialogue about things we might not talk about otherwise Those things may include whether the couples relationship is exclusive or socalled open and what kind of rules and understandings are in place If one partner is HIVpositive and the other isnt it opens a discussion about condom use and the importance of getting the positive partner on an antiviral regimen to lower the amount of HIV in his system  and his risk of transmitting the virus Its called   And the conversation might turn to whether the negative partner should consider taking an antiviral pill that lowers his risk of infection an approach called  Testing Together is aimed at dispelling a dangerous myth that helps explain why there are still around  new HIV infections a year in this country The narrative even within parts of the gay community is that the epidemic is fueled by promiscuity Sullivan says That can lead men in committed relationships to have a false sense of security But the current epidemic patterns are not driven by promiscuity Sullivan says The face of the epidemic is quite different than it was before So we need to be providing prevention services where the risk is occurring Sullivan a researcher at Emory University says the math of sexual relationships makes that clear Men with a main partner have sex with that partner about  times a year  about the same as malefemale couples do with their main partners he says But about a fourth of malemale couples have open relationships that allow for occasional encounters with someone outside the couple Thats a little bit higher than heterosexual couples according to Sullivan If you add up episodes of sex with main partners and casual partners it might be  or  a year total he notes So obviously the biggest risk of infection is from a main partner even if the virus is introduced into the relationship by a casual encounter The risk of transmission within couples is raised further by the fact that main partners are more likely to engage in anal sex with each other which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission Sullivan says if one partner in a gay couple is HIVpositive theres a  percent chance the other one will become infected over time So far the results from Testing Together programs funded up to now by the   bear out the importance of getting gay couples tested About  percent of couples had one HIVinfected partner  but werent aware of it Sullivan says thats higher than the HIVpositive rate in most centers that offer individual testing and counseling Even when gay couples have agreed to be monogamous Sullivan says there are slips In surveys we did about onequarter of men said they had stepped outside their agreement in the prior year and most did not tell their partners about it he says As counselors we all know this happens When the couple tests together the counselor can defuse anger and focus the couple on how to deal with the news that one or both have become infected  or on how to stay safe in the future Sullivan says counselors might frame it this way You guys are a strong couple with a clear commitment toward monogamy but we want every couple to go out of here with a Plan B
