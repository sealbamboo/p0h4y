The emergency care provision in the UK has been cracking for years it just so happens that this winter it has collapsed Why I put it down to abuse of the  system This can be unintentional malicious or due to a lack of available primary care In the ambulance service a what if culture prevails causing healthcare professionals to be cautious to protect their registration  some paramedics fear repercussions if their decision to leave someone at home is questioned A typical hour shift should but rarely does include a minute check of the ambulance and its contents and a couple of meal breaks I might see as many as  patients in a shift How many of these actually need an ambulance Not many Not many actually need to go to AE  four per shift is generous Most should see a GP visit a minor injuries unit or urgent care centre call  or visit the pharmacy Its soul destroying One job I recall concerned a young person who was pretending to be unwell but we couldnt leave them with their family A call came over the radio on open airwaves only used by control as a last resort requesting a crew for a confirmed cardiac arrest nearby the nearest available crew was more than  minutes away This is the reality of timewasters  someone potentially died because of an attention seeking act Why do people call  when they shouldnt A big factor is that we live in a hour culture that demands immediate service This culture is fine when Im nine hours into my shift starving and have five seconds to nip into a shop at am to grab a snack When a patient has a cold however and feels like its got a bit worse at night  isnt the number they should be calling Why are these patients resourced an ambulance sometimes even when they call    The  triage systems use an algorithm and calls are rarely taken by healthcare professionals When a patient rings with their problem they want attention from a paramedic or a doctor so they may exaggerate their symptoms to ensure a response When asked Are you having difficulty breathing they say Yes This falls into the lifethreatening emergency category Red  This patient must now get an ambulance in eight minutes or a target isnt met Crews get the following information Red  eight minute response age sex breathing difficulties Some crews now dont drive with flashing blue lights until they get more information especially if its triaged by NHS  Saturday night and in the middle of town They know if they get there and become committed someone who really needs them might miss out This is another danger of inappropriate calls crews are getting worn down and are tempted to take triage into their own hands  can you blame us Do you want to pull over for an ambulance responding to a patient who has broken wind in bed It has happened Current public education isnt working and throwing money at services wont deal with the problem Paramedics need a universal no blame culture the autonomy to tell patients they dont need an ambulance signposting them to more appropriate care  or GP without having to do reams of paperwork Additionally a tick box could be added to patient records when the call wasnt appropriate When these go to audit a letter could be sent to the address of the patient explaining how to use NHS emergency services appropriately In AE nurses should be on reception to issue patients who shouldnt be there with a card advising them that they are not appropriate for AE and to call  If they choose to stay they should be exempted from the fourhour targets and wait as long as they have to This is a snapshot of the complex interlocking problems that are challenging the NHS the gravity of the situation can only be appreciated when you have experienced it yourself Its nothing like what you see on TV
