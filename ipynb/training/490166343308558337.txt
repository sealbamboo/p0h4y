When Rob Rhinehart first created    a powdered synthetic food product made of   he was a San Francisco techie trying to sustain himself cheaply without the inconveniences of grocery shopping cooking or even eating His initial blog posts attracted the attention of Hacker News and members of the lifehacking community who rallied around his DIY approach to concocting a nutritious food powder to live on Rhinehart posted his recipe online and invited others to tinker with it Some  customized versions like   and   tailored to various tastes and dietary needs now exist While some nutrition scientists   of Rhineharts claims that Soylent could be a healthful alternative to real food for everyone his vibrant online following helped him raise over  million through crowdfunding to take it to market Silicon Valley venture capitalists were also   that there was money to be made in Soylent and ponied up  million in funding Production began in late  and the company began shipping orders to crowdfunders early this year A weeks supply of Soylent  meals is  for a onetime purchase and  for a monthly subscription The company says new orders are rolling in to the tune of  a day But even as the companys early success suggests this synthetic food is here to stay tension is building between the company and the   online  now numbering  users from around the world  who helped get it off the ground The company has struggled to procure large volumes of the industrial nutrients in the formula And thats hindered its ability   Soylents sluggish shipping has caused dismay among some of its backers prompting some to propose buying and selling the communitys versions instead In a recent   with Rhinehart one member of the companys online forum noted that some DIYers  have started selling our DIY soylent to impatient Soylent backers They then asked how Rhinehart would feel if community members sold blends under a different name like Schmoylent Rhinehart discouraged it replying I wont stop you from selling Schmoylent on legal grounds but I must caution you it is unwise to enter into direct competition with us Soylent isnt patented and the recipe is still public But the companys DIY wiki   that Soylent refers to the    Rhinehart alone holds the trademark  made by Soylent Corp while soylent refers to any other version And managing that proprietary brand has indeed become a challenge says Anastassia Laskey Soylents vice president of marketing People confuse doityourself recipes with Soylent and were  grappling with that she says We dont want people to be making their own stuff and shipping it without understanding that they need to be licensed to do that As the organizers of this community we have a certain responsibility Laskey says the differences between the communitys custom blends and the companys are Soylents unique method of combining its ingredients and rigorous manufacturing process Still Laskey says the company welcomes competition adding We are more than happy to lead the way for this whole ecosystem to develop We think its awesome when you have competition that breeds innovation and brings cost down Some forum members whove already received their orders are getting creative with the product Jonathan van Clute created the website   to document his and his partners adventures with the beverage after receiving his first shipment of the official product in April And despite the fact that Soylent is invented as a substitute for real food van Clute says he has taken to experimenting with Soylent baked goods He posted a video of peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies to his YouTube account other Soylent users have come up with recipes for   and   After this story was published Soylent contacted NPR to clarify that the company raised over  million in crowdfunding between June  and May  Previously we stated that the company had raised an initial  through crowdfunding
