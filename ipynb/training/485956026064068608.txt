The prime ministers plan to tackle antibiotic resistance may be too slow a parliamentary report says  The science and technology committee says doctors and vets continue to prescribe antibiotics inappropriately  The   acknowledged the governments recentlyannounced review but warned more immediate action was needed and said ministers should not wait for its outcome  Experts caution the right solution is more important than a quick one  During the ninemonth analysis the MPs on the select committee looked at more than  submissions of written evidence  They heard concerns that doctors were offering antibiotics to simply placate patients with distressing symptoms And examining farming practices the authors said they suspect antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals Prof Nigel Brown president of the Society for General Microbiology told the BBC There can be an expectation from patients that some sort of prescription will be handed out  this needs to tackled And we also need to consider whether we should be using the same drugs in veterinary medicine as we do in human health If resistance develops in agriculture we dont want the same thing to happen to human pathogens  Prime Minister David Cameron recently commissioned a review that will investigate why there have been so few effective antimicrobial drugs in recent years  Since  there have been just five newly developed classes of antimicrobial drugs And most of these have been ineffective against gramnegative bacteria  a group of bugs that is becoming increasingly resistant to medication and extremely difficult to treat  The panel of experts from finance science global health and industry is expected to report next spring  But the select committee has called for a more urgent response saying Announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem The report continues It is clear to us that there is no room for procrastination We urge the government to take immediate and decisive action But Prof Brown cautioned This is a pressing need but it is most important to get the right solution not just a quick one The wideranging inquiry recommends a number of strategies to improve the current use of antibiotics from better education for medical students to the development of cheaper more rapid tests to accurately identify bacteria  And the MPs say the governments review must not delay discussions with the pharmaceutical industry about alternative pricing arrangements for drugs  The committee calls on the government to monitor how well patients deal with their prescriptions focusing in particular on whether people complete a full course of pills  A government spokesperson said This is an incredibly important issue which is why last week the Prime Minister announced an urgent review to stimulate the development of new antibiotics and why we are supporting GPs to prescribe more effectively Conserving antibiotics is everybodys responsibility so they can be used properly when they are really needed We will respond to the report in due course
