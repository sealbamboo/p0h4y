Pediatricians have long urged parents to put newborns to sleep on their backs to help prevent sudden infant death syndrome While the practice undoubtedly has saved lives it also has increased the numbers of babies with flattened skulls Roughly one baby in five under the age of  months develops a skull deformation caused by lying in a supine position Now a study has found that a common remedy for the problem an expensive custommade helmet worn by infants in most cases produces no more improvement in skull shape than doing nothing at all  published Thursday in the journal BMJ is the first randomized trial of the helmets The authors found virtually no treatment effect said Brent R Collett an investigator at Seattle Childrens Research Institute and author of   Skull flatness at back of the head may be accompanied by facial asymmetry one ear may be slightly farther back than the other and sometimes the side of the head can flatten Until now less rigorous studies had mostly shown helmets did help normalize head shape The helmets are sometimes adorned with stickers and are sometimes painted to resemble a pilots helmet or with the logo of a beloved football team I was very surprised at the results Dr Mark R Proctor an associate professor of neurosurgery at Boston Childrens Hospital said of the new study adding that it was rigorous Still the study leaves open the possibility that the helmets may still be useful for infants with severe skull flattening and those with tight neck muscles which make it hard for infants to turn their heads so they remain in one position  Renske M van Wijk and researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands assigned  babies who had misshapen skulls aged  to  months old to wear a customdesigned helmet that allows flattened areas room to round out as the infants skull expands Parents were instructed to have infants wear the helmets  hours a day for six months or so Another  babies with similar deformities received no treatment Infants with the most severe deformities were excluded After two years a researcher who did not know which babies had worn helmets evaluated skull shape in the infants The improvements were not significantly different between the helmetwearers and the infants not wearing helmets There are definitely cases of infants with mild to moderate skull deformation who are treated with helmet therapy and this study confirms and reaffirms that this is not necessary said Dr James J Laughlin an author of the   Helmets to treat flattened skulls range in price from  to  and parents are told to make sure infants wear them around the clock Dr Laughlin said the paper provides pediatricians and worried parents reassurance that not doing helmet therapy will give you the same results as doing helmet therapy which is expensive and can be stressful for the family Makers of custom helmets questioned the studys results Tim Littlefield a spokesman for Cranial Technologies called it inherently flawed William Gustavson a spokesman for Orthomerica called it alarming that nearly threequarters of parents whose children received helmets in the study reported that the helmets shifted or rotated on their infants heads The value of this research is fully reliant upon the quality of the fit said James Campbell the vice president of the American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association a trade group Some surgeons worried that the finding would be applied too broadly jeopardizing insurance coverage for severely affected children who could benefit from helmets What I fear happening is that children with a severe deformity are going to be denied helmets based on this evidence which is really only talking about moderate cases said Dr Alex A Kane the director of pediatric and craniofacial surgery at UT Southwestern and Childrens Medical Center in Dallas Courtney Reissig  a stayathome mother in Little Rock Ark doesnt regret the eight months her son Luke wore a helmet He had neck muscles so tight that he favored lying on his left side in bed to the point that it looked like the side of a toaster  flat not round Mrs Reissig said He outgrew his first helmet which cost  and required a second she said But wearing a helmet helped round out his head and he now closely resembles his twin Zach I do feel like the helmets were worth it she said Only about a quarter of the babies in the BMJ trial made a full recovery by the age  This is a problem we created said Dr Proctor of Boston Childrens Hospital All parents are told is sleep the child on their back They arent told about flat heads and how to prevent it Some pediatricians and specialists advise parents to try repositioning an infants head before considering a helmet Repositioning entails alternating to which side the infants head turns once they are asleep on the back That way pressure isnt always squarely on the back of the head Repositioning isnt as feasible for infants with tight neck muscles known as torticollis They may benefit from physical therapyÂ said Dr Chad A Perlyn craniofacial and pediatric plastic surgeon at Miami Childrens Hospital In addition to repositioning he advises parents to try more tummy time and to limit time spent in car seats Use a baby carrier he added because when the baby is awake theres no deforming force on the skull Doctors noted that some helmet makers encourage parents to diagnose flattened skulls on their own without a doctors evaluation Its important for a physician to rule out craniosynostosis or bones fusing together prematurely as a cause they said That much rarer condition requires surgery On the Web sites of some helmet manufacturers assessment tools encourage parents to compare their infants head shape to pictures Its a bit like having the wolf guarding the henhouse said Dr Proctor
