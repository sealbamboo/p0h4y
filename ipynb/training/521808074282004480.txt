Doctors in Britain are missing opportunities to spot lung cancer at an early stage meaning one in three people with the disease dies within  days of diagnosis research suggests A study of lung cancer cases in  people aged over  found one in  had died within a month of diagnosis  One in  had been diagnosed only after they had died the study published in the British Medical Journal says Researchers said GPs needed better diagnostic tools such as software  Lung cancer kills more than  people a year and is the biggest cause of cancer death in the UK Scientists based at the University of Nottingham tried to find the reason why fewer people in the UK with lung cancer survive than in other countries  In Sweden for example    The odds of an early death rose with the number of GP consultations a patient attended they found  Those who had died had visited their GP an average of five times in the months before diagnosis    Even surgeries that carried out lots of chest Xrays did not appear to translate to a reduction in early deaths from lung cancer it said  Lead scientist Dr Emma ODowd said the findings contrasted with her expectations that people with lung cancer were not visiting the doctor accounting for Britains lower survival rates  The study said out of the  people Dr ODowd said If patients are coming into the surgery and having a facetoface interaction with a doctor at least there is an opportunity to treat them She said if people had not been visiting the doctor at all it would have been more a publicengagement issue which could be hard to manage  At least there is something we can do she said   Other patterns in people dying an early death defined as within three months of diagnosis were highlighted by the study  Men were more likely to die of lung cancer than women   or  of those who died were men Of these  died within  days of diagnosis compared with  of the women  Dr ODowd said the fact more men than women smoked cigarettes in the past could be partly behind the gender gap  And people in rural areas were more likely than those in urban areas to die an early death from lung cancer said the paper  Researchers called for software allowing doctors to type in symptoms of lung cancer to rapidly identify the fatal disease which is the most difficult to diagnose as symptoms can look like other conditions such as chest infections  John Field at the University of Liverpool said the study was one of the most indepth primary care studies undertaken to date on lung cancer  He said The paper supports the argument that we do need to do a great deal more for potential lung cancer patients than what is provided at present  Data due from trials in the next two years would help decide the best costeffective treatments he said  Dr Penny Woods the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said The finding that one in three UK lung cancer patients dies within three months of diagnosis is sadly a very telling consequence of late presentation and delayed diagnosis  These are major reasons why lung cancer continues to be the biggest cancer killer in the UK and why survival rates in this country lag behind those throughout Europe and the US   Evidence suggests that wellfunded awareness campaigns are proving very successful in increasing earlier diagnosis A continuation and expansion of such campaigns will be crucial if we are to significantly improve lung cancer survival
