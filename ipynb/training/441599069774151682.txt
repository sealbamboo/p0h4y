Its been a dozen years since a definitive   found that breast selfexams did more harm than good and four years since a government task force   telling women to stop the oncemandated monthly shower sessions circular motions and all But some health experts have been hesitant to embrace the message and others have simply replaced it with a vague new term  breast selfawareness  that leaves women more confused than ever according to a commentary published this week in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology I think that most women still think theyre supposed to be doing them said Dr Katrina Mark a clinical instructor at the University of Maryland Medical School and author of the new paper Ive had patients who are just shocked that this isnt recommended In reality research is clear that monthly breast selfexams increased the number of biopsies in women boosted the number of falsepositive tests and increased anxiety  all while failing to budge deaths from breast cancer A landmark  study of more than  textile workers in China clinched the conclusion that selfexam was not an effective screening tool But a followup campaign for breast selfawareness which was intended to free women from the onus of precise exams while still encouraging vigilance has morphed into more of the same muddying the waters and making women feel like theyre responsible if they get the disease Mark said Breast selfawareness is at best ineffective and at worst costly and anxietyprovoking she wrote When a clinical intervention is shown to have no benefit and to cause harm it should be abandoned And it doesnt help that breast selfawareness is promoted by groups from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society to Susan G Komen The whole area of breast cancer all of the recommendations are very confusing to patients said Mark What women should actually do she said is to let doctors know if anything changes about their breasts Its that simple If you notice anything abnormal please tell me she said Otherwise its not something you need to worry about In principle the other groups agree Susan Brown managing director of health and program education for Susan G Komen said that organization regards  as completely different from breast selfexam which they no longer recommend We dont see breast cancer awareness as a screening tool at all Brown said Instead women are urged to know the signs and symptoms of breast cancer to know their own family history and risk to be screened appropriately and to take steps to control health factors such as weight and exercise that can keep breast cancer at bay Dr Mary Gemignani a breast cancer surgeon at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York said she understands the confusion but thinks its important to tell women something about breast cancer risks I think its unfortunate that the terms are so similar she said But theres a potential that if we go completely the other way and do nothing not have doctors say you should know your breasts theres a potential for women to not focus at all In practice most women didnt perform the monthly breast selfexams diligently doctors say and many were relieved when the US Preventive Services Task Force said in  that there was no benefit and the chance of harm Everyone wishes there were a better screening tool that could empower women to detect their own cancer the experts say But for now theres not
