Can corporations shift workers with high medical costs from the company health plan into online insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act Some employers are considering it say benefits consultants Its all over the marketplace said   a managing partner at Hill Chesson  Woody a North Carolina benefits consulting firm Employers are inquiring about it and brokers and consultants are advocating for it Health spending is driven largely by a few patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and those who need expensive treatments such as organ transplants Since most big corporations are selfinsured shifting even one highcost worker out of the company plan could save the employer hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  while increasing the cost of claims absorbed by the marketplace policy by a similar amount And the health law might not prohibit it opening a door to potential erosion of employerbased coverage Such an employerdumping strategy can promote the interests of both employers and employees by shifting health care expenses on to the public at large wrote two University of Minnesota law professors in a  paper that basically predicted the present interest The authors were Amy Monahan and Daniel Schwarcz Its unclear how many companies if any have moved sicker workers to exchange coverage which became available only in January But even a few highrisk patients could add millions of dollars in costs to those plans The costs could be passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums and to taxpayers in the form of higher subsidy expense Heres how it might work The employer shrinks the hospital and doctor network to make the company plan unattractive to those with chronic illness Or the employer raises copayments for drugs needed by the chronically ill also rendering the plan unattractive and perhaps nudging highcost workers to look at other options At the same time the employer offers to buy the targeted worker a highbenefit plan in the marketplaces A socalled platinum plan could cost  or more a year for an individual But thats still far less than the  a year that say a hemophilia patient might cost the company The employer might also give the worker a raise to buy the policy directly The employer saves money The employee gets better coverage And the health laws marketplace plan required to accept all applicants at a fixed price during open enrollment periods  takes on the cost The concept sounds too easy to be true but the ACA has set up the ability for employers and employees on a voluntary basis to choose a better plan in the Individual Marketplace and save a significant amount of money for both says promotional material from a company called Managed Exchange Solutions MES MES works with the reinsurer insurance carrier and other health management organizations to determine the most likely candidates for the program Consultant   based in Charlotte NC produced the Managed Exchange Solutions pitch last year But Matthew McQuide a vice president with Benefit Controls said the company ultimately decided not to offer the strategy to its clients Though we believe its legal as long as employees agree to the change its still gray he said We just decided it wasnt something we wanted to promote Shifting highrisk workers out of employer plans is prohibited for other kinds of taxpayersupported insurance For example its illegal to induce somebody who is working and over  to drop company coverage and rely entirely on the government Medicare program for seniors said Amy Gordon a benefits lawyer with McDermott Will  Emery Similarly employers who dumped highcost patients into temporary highrisk pools established by the health law are required to repay those workers claims to the pools You would think there would be a similar type of provision under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through the marketplace portals Gordon said But there currently is not Moving highcost workers to a marketplace plan would not trigger penalties under the health law as long as an employer offered an affordable companywide plan with minimum coverage experts said Workers cannot use tax credits to help pay premiums for an exchange plan in such a case either Half a dozen benefits experts said they were unaware of specific instances of employers shifting highcost workers to exchange plans Spokesmen for AIDS United and the Hemophilia Federation of America both advocating for patients with expensive chronic conditions said they didnt know of any either But employers seem increasingly interested I have gotten probably about half a dozen questions about it in the last month or so from our offices around the country says Edward Fensholt director of compliance for the Lockton Companies a large insurance broker and benefits consultant Theyre passing on questions theyre getting from their customers Still Fensholt said We just dont think thats a good idea That needs to be kind of an undertheradar deal and undertheradar deals never work Plus he added its bad public policy to push all these risks into the public exchange Hill Chesson  Woody isnt recommending it either Anytime you want to have a conversation with an employee in a secretive oneoff manner thats never a good idea Yates said Something smells bad about that
