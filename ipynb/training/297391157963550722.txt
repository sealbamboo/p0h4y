Super Bowl XLVII will kick off Sunday with its typical bombastic fanfare Beyonce will wow us with her live halftime show and   commercials will overload us with cuteness But this year theres a gray cloud hanging over the Super Bowl the mounting anger about devastating injuries to players brains and bodies Thousands of former NFL players   the league over allegations that it covered up brain injuries Even President Obama is concerned On Jan  he   the violence of football in an interview with   But tough rowdy NFL linemen have been taking down unsuspecting quarterbacks for almost a century Have hits really gotten harder  and more dangerous  in recent years Thats a complicated question says   a physicist at the University of Nebraska and author of   But a look at the physics behind a tackle suggests that the answer is yes Gay says One thing is for certain  football players have gotten much bigger and faster And the laws of physics tell us that the force of a hit depends on three factors body weight speed and how quickly the players stop moving Back in the s when the NFL was just getting started the average lineman weighed only about  pounds Now they average  pounds That means Hall of Famer Morris Red Badgro who played for the New York Giants in  would lay down quarterbacks with about  pounds of force according to Newtons   and a bunch of simplifications In contrast Baltimore Ravens starting lineman   weighs  pounds and runs the yard dash in just under five seconds If he sacks Colin Kaepernick on Sunday hell unleash about  pounds of force In other words getting stopped by Ngata is literally like having nearly a ton of bricks fall on you These are very strong forces Gay says This is why they call football a contact sport Athletes can usually handle these hits when the energy and force spread across the whole body especially with the help from modernday padding But when the tackles are focused on small areas like during a helmettohelmet collision then the impacts become severe Such collisions occur about  times faster than fullbody tackles   a bioengineer at Virginia Tech tells Shots And so a players head comes to a complete stop much more quickly than the rest of the body Inside their helmets they feel Gforces five times bigger than what jet pilots feel when they pull tight turns Although these numbers are just estimates Duma says they fit well with what he actually measures on the field For the past  years hes been putting little devices inside the helmets of Virginia Tech football players to monitor how fast their heads slow down during hard tackles Since weve been measuring the hits havent gotten stronger Duma tells Shots Even  years ago the athletes were very strong and fast I mean Michael Vick was on our team then Duma says players weights and training regimes really havent shifted since about the s If you were really talking about changes youd have to look back decades So what does this all mean for concussions and brain injuries Neurologist   at Johns Hopkins University says doctors and scientists are still trying to figure that out Faster heavier more aggressive players will absolutely increase the impacts Koliatsos tells Shots They are quite severe But right now he says they dont have scientific evidence about what links concussions to longterm brain injuries Theres even some concern that weaker nonconcussive hits  although poorly defined  may also have something to do with it
