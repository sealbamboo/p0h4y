The current Ebola outbreak is the worst the world has ever seen One reason its been able to spread so quickly is because of where it first emerged in the porous remote border area between Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia  We have just made the journey by road from Sierra Leones capital Freetown to Guineas capital Conakry to see what impact the disease has had  Its  and were getting ready to leave our hotel This journey usually takes four hours but weve been warned to brace ourselves for a much longer trip thanks to the number of Ebola checkpoints that have now been set up On the car radio I hear an advert about Ebola Wow Vinta you always have new facts on Ebola They are so accurate where do you get them I rely on the web pages of the ministry of health WHO and EbolaFactscom As we drive through the city the streets are bustling Women sit in front of their stalls selling fruits and vegetables But on roundabouts and billboards lining the main FreetownWaterloo highway reminders of the outbreak are loud and clear  There are posters with warnings dotted everywhere ABC  Avoid Body Contact proclaims one poster  By  we reach our first checkpoint Soldiers carrying two different guns stop us They have rifles over their shoulders and thermos temperature guns in their hands  Lt Martin Tejan holds his temperature gun to my head  I am  degrees and I am safe to pass through  If you show more than  we will take you to the holding tent and ask you some more questions Lt Tejan says Some people try and hide their sickness some are trying to escape the city to go to their families to use traditional healers instead of going to medical centres here Set back away from the road is a blue tarpaulin tent where very sick people are kept Ambulances are supposed to take patients from here to a treatment centre within four hours  But the lieutenant says three people have died there while waiting for an ambulance By midday we arrive at Port Loko where cases of Ebola have risen sharply in recent weeks  A governmentimposed quarantine is in place which means  in theory  that people living in the area arent allowed to leave the district We dont see anyone enforcing this though  We stop off at a treatment centre which is still under construction On the first day we had eight patients here Peter George the doctor in charge says By the end of the week we were full We are so busy here and need more international help By lunchtime we are at our fifth Ebola checkpoint The more sophisticated buckets of chlorine with taps have been replaced by ingenious makeshift wash bottles which you turn on by pressing a stick with your foot tipping the solution into your hands  My temperature is taken again and Im allowed through When we reach the border we are given a final temperature check and waved through A soldier wearing sunglasses has a cigarette in his mouth and a rifle on his shoulder Bonjour madam bienvenue Guinee he says with a smile The change as we enter Guinea is immediate The tarmac road turns into a bumpy red dirt track  We pass women with trays of eggs balanced perfectly on their heads and men sitting in their roadside shops selling everything from bed frames to iron gates People seem much more wary of our team Another difference is that here most people speak French Hardly anyone speaks English  Guinea is where the outbreak started A twoyearold boy called Emile now known as patient zero was the first person to become infected  He died last December but it wasnt until March that experts realised what had happened and declared an outbreak Some  miles into the country we come across a small Ebola holding centre  We wander inside Its the first time weve been asked to wash our hands and have our temperatures checked since we arrived in Guinea Its eerily quiet There are around  staff but no patients  I ask the doctor in charge why it is so quiet Some people prefer to die in the village rather than come here to get help he says We continue our journey through the dusty winding roads The landscape is stunning lush green forest blanketed over mountains that fill the horizon  A couple of hours from the capital we stop at a roadside market in a town called Maferiah  Children are running around laughing women are gossiping as they sell their watermelons pineapples and oranges  But when we start asking them about Ebola none of them want to talk After asking a seven or eight people a couple of men agree to chat to us I dont know about Ebola says one of the men I have never seen someone killed by it For me it doesnt exist The second man echoes his friends comments We dont have any Ebola here I dont know what is killing all these people  but Ebola is not real As we head into the city to find our hotel one thing remains very clear West Africa has far to go before Ebola can finally be stamped out
