Childhood vaccines for diseases like measles polio and whooping cough have repeatedly been proved safe and effective Even so some parents still worry that the schedule of vaccinations   immunizations by the age of   can be dangerous That worry is likely misplaced according to a yearlong   of all available scientific data Researchers from the   found there is no evidence that the federally recommended timeline for childhood vaccines is unsafe According to family physician   of the University of Washington School of Medicine who was a member of the IOM committee the research team looked at a large number of medical conditions including things like autoimmune diseases which even captures diabetes asthma hypersensitivity allergies seizures epilepsy child developmental disorders including autism and other learning disorders communications disorders intellectual disabilities and even rare things like tics or Tourettes syndrome None could be linked to the vaccination schedule Parents should be reassured says Berg But at the same time the committee report says that when it comes to the timing and number of vaccines given current research isnt as comprehensive as it could be For example theres been little research into whether its still just as safe and effective when vaccines are spread over a longer period of time than is currently recommended Once the schedule has been set though no one has studied whether moving the vaccine forward two weeks or backward two weeks or adding two vaccines together or splitting them apart would be better than the current schedule Berg says The committee suggests federal researchers could collect data and follow health outcomes among children whose vaccines are delayed In some cases children get sick and cant get a vaccine on schedule In others parents choose to space out vaccines because theyre worried about the safety of getting multiple vaccinations at the same time Even though this review finds that theres no reason to worry and that the current recommended schedule is completely safe Berg says it still might be useful to know what happens to children who dont get their vaccinations on time  by comparing them to children who do Preliminary research does show children who dont get vaccinated on time are hospitalized more often than children who are immunized according to federal guidelines Further monitoring and research is needed Some parents remain skeptical however Barbara Loe Fisher president of the   a nonprofit advocacy group says the committee relied on only  studies which she argues is not nearly enough science to give parents confidence that the current vaccine schedule is safe Despite Fishers concerns federal health officials say that most parents adhere to the recommended vaccine schedule and that  percent of all children are fully vaccinated by the time they enter kindergarten Only about  percent of parents refuse all vaccines
