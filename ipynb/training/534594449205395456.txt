Your smile is one of your best assets, so, of course, you want to keep it sparkling.. 
                  . 
                  But even if you brush, use white strips, and visit your dentist twice a year, it may not be enough..

                  However, most bottled waters contain less fluoride than recommended for good oral health (it will be listed as an ingredient on the label if it is an additive).. 
                  . 
                  "Fluoride makes the entire tooth structure more resistant to decay and promotes remineralization, which aids in repairing early decay before damage is even visible," explains Academy of General Dentistry spokesperson, Charles H. Perle, DMD, FAGD. "Studies have confirmed [that] the most effective source of fluoride is water fluoridation.". Diabetes reduces the body's resistance to infection, so you're at a risk for gum disease. Brushing, flossing, and monitoring your blood sugar can help..

                  "Diabetes is directly related to periodontal disease, so seeing the dentist and having your triglycerides and cholesterol levels checked on a regular basis is also crucial," stresses Perle.. 
                  . 
                  Perle also points out that research has shown that diabetics can reduce the amount of insulin they need to take by maintaining good gum health.. As you age, you're more susceptible to decay near old fillings or root surfaces unprotected by receding gums. But there's no reason you can't keep your teeth. Oral disease—not aging per se—is the danger..

                  Additionally, some studies have shown that women who use birth control pills may have more trouble healing after tooth extractions and are twice as likely to develop painful dry sockets where the tooth used to be..

                  If you use birth control pills, it's not a bad idea to discuss their effect with your dentist before major procedures.. It is not clear whether bleaching erodes tooth enamel, but it can increase sensitivity, especially when done too often.. 
                  . 
                  Even at-home whitening treatments should be used with moderation, as some whitening toothpastes and gels contain abrasive ingredients that can increase tooth sensitivity, which can be painful.. 
                  . 
                  Plus, as you get older, whitening products can only do so much, so after a certain point, using more won't necessarily do anything for your smile.. Soft drinks are chock-full of sugar, which puts you at a risk for cavities, tooth decay, and gum infections, and dark colas can also stain your teeth, leaving you with a lackluster smile..
