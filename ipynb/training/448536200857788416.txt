While dentists have been using video glasses and TV screens to distract their patients   this is the first time the technique has been tested in interventional radiology treatments The study involved  patients between ages  and  Each of them was getting a minor outpatient treatment  a biopsy or a catheter in the arm or chest Twentyfive of the patients were given video glasses during their procedures The other half got nothing Volunteers filled out a stress form before and after the procedure to indicate how anxious they were The researchers found that people who used the video glasses said they were on average  less anxious after their treatment People who did not use the glasses were only  less anxious The researchers found the glasses were especially helpful to women and to people who were the most anxious before their procedure Because the glasses are just a little bigger than sunglasses they are not in the way and do not pose any hazards the researchers say And who wouldnt rather watch a TV show instead of a needle going into your arm
