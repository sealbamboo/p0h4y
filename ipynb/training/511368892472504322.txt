Health officials in Saudi Arabia say they are doing all they can to avoid an outbreak of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Mers coronavirus at the annual Hajj pilgrimage next month The BBCs Global Health Correspondent Tulip Mazumdar has been given rare access to the kingdom Out in the humid golden desert on the outskirts of Jeddah we witness a loving scene A large strong beautiful camel is stroked and kissed by one of its herders Abdel Salam Youssof  I wake up each morning with my children and the first thing we do is bring him food and water he says  These impressive animals are the source of millions of dollars worth of trade as well as entertainment food drink  and status in Saudi Arabia But they are also believed to be a source of one of the worlds newest killer viruses known as Mers  In camels Mers mainly causes a mild cold In humans it can be deadly   The virus has killed  people in Saudi Arabia since it first emerged in  More than  people have been infected  At its peak in April and May the World Health Organization WHO was considering declaring Mers a public health emergency   Symptoms include fever coughing and shortness in breath It can also cause pneumonia and kidney failure Nearly  of those infected have died Most already had an underlying medical problem  It is unclear exactly how it passes from camels to people Scientists say it is probably via secretions from the nose and mouth of infected animals Raw camel milk could also carry the virus  The WHO says anyone working closely with camels should wear protective gear like masks and gloves It also says people should avoid drinking raw camel milk  We didnt see anyone at the market following that advice  Ive drunk raw camel milk every day for the last  years and I am fine Everything is safe here said Mr Youssof It is still unclear whether the key source of the virus is camels or whether it could be another animal like bats Mers is believed to spread between humans through droplets when infected people cough or sneeze  Although there have been sporadic cases outside Saudi Arabia the vast majority of victims have been from the kingdom  Now with around two million pilgrims getting ready for the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca there are concerns there could be a significant outbreak  Weve done a lot of work to ensure Hajj goes smooth without any Mers cases said Prof Tariq Madani the governments scientific advisor on Mers  Being a virus transmissible from human to human is a big concern for Hajj We have overcrowding and this is an excellent medium for a respiratory infection to spread But officials say they have now got this outbreak under control  Most of the victims who caught Mers however didnt pick it up from animals in the desert  they caught it in hospitals Poor infection control measures on wards meant people who came to hospital with Mers were able to spread it quickly to other patients and health workers  Staff werent taking basic steps such as washing their hands between patients and wearing masks properly so they were picking up the virus and passing it on Dr Hani Jokhdar said a third of those infected with Mers at King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah in the spring were health workers  When so many health care workers were becoming victims of the virus  that made an alert that theres something wrong this is not a joke We realised we need to stand up and put very strong infection control measures in It was after this spike in cases  months into the outbreak that the King sacked his health minister and other health officials and brought in a new team  It was only then that things started to improve and the number of cases started to fall  Now the health ministry says thousands of health care workers have been given strict infection control training  Whilst we were in the kingdom more than  patients were being treated for Mers We were unable to interview any of them nor were we given access to affected families  The government has been accused by some international scientists of a lack of transparency over the outbreak and taking too long to carry out the studies needed to find out more about the virus and where it came from  Given that we are two years on from first identifying MERSCoV it is disappointing that there are still have so many knowledge gaps The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said  The health ministry said it is working openly with international organisations including the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control in the US to figure out how Mers spreads and where it actually came from    Saudi health officials say they have beefed up their response to the outbreak with better infection control in hospitals and improved surveillance systems such as a new Command and Control Centre in Jeddah which can coordinate swift isolation and treatment of new cases to prevent spread  Mers is not an issue in Saudi anymore We will do our best to ensure we continue doing all we can to have a safe Hajj for all our guests said the Acting Health Minister Adel bin Muhammad Fakeih  The WHO says it still considers Mers a public health concern There are lot of unknowns in our understanding of the origin of the virus causing the disease transmission mode of the virus as well as the behavioural risk factors that may result in infection said WHO spokesperson Rana Sidani In the runup to Hajj it warned The virus will reemerge if people wont adhere to behaviours that will protect themselves  such as proper way of coughing good personal hygiene avoiding close contact with camels as well as close contact with people who have been diagnosed with Mers It says pilgrims are advised to consult a health care provider before travelling to review the risk and assess whether making the pilgrimage is advisable In Jeddahs busy souks some hadnt heard of the virus while other younger shoppers said they were aware of the disease from government campaigns on social media and YouTube  One man buying camel skin shoes said I am very worried especially when I am in crowded places I dont know why people here dont take precautions  Maissams mother in law is currently being treated with a neurological condition in hospital and said I am very worried I heard there are Mers patients being treated there as well  I am scared she will catch the virus or I will when I go and visit her The nurses were trying to give us masks and gloves for protection  but really the protection is from God only
