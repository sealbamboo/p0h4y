It was Saturday October    earlier than usual for me to think about a costume for my favorite holiday But this year I wouldnt be able to party on the same day as everyone else I was organizing one last massive celebration to honor my life and the people I love before my brain surgery two days later It all started early one morning in September while I was wrapping up my work as a digital producer for CNNs New Day  As I was typing at the computer letters were dropping off the right side of the screen I started to feel strange and went to the nurses office in my building to ask for help My speech began to slur my hands were tingling and my head was pounding I also forgot my coworkers and bosses names  The nurse thought I could be having a stroke and called an ambulance   Within an hour I went from thinking I might have a migraine because I needed new glasses to being rushed to the hospital I was  years old They stripped off my clothes in the emergency room to hook me up to the machines that would reveal I wasnt having a stroke  Great news But then what was going on  After an MRI we had the beginning of an answer When I looked at the scan of my brain sitting there big as an orange in the left hemisphere was a large black spot   My speech came back fully after a few hours but a terrible headache lingered all day and I was kept in the hospital overnight without discussing with the medical staff the full details of what was found on the scan  My family and I were scheduled to meet with a brain surgeon the next morning About  am I was asleep when a resident came into my room and woke me up He wanted to talk about my case he said  My parents are coming later and were meeting with the doctor I told this stranger Ms Moskowitz we suspect you have a meningioma  He could have been speaking Russian  We see you have a brain tumor and youll have to have surgery to have it removed he said in a calm even tone   I dont remember what I asked him after that but once he left I felt hopeless and alone Tears poured out of my eyes and I sucked in air when I ran out of breath It was the most afraid Ive ever been in my life When my parents arrived we met with the surgeon who offered more clarity He suspected that the tumor was slowly growing deep in the left ventricle of my brain for years And the incident at work  Perhaps a miniseizure related to the tumor but they couldnt be sure  I was told the mass wasnt lifethreatening at that point and probably was not cancer but the location was very deep and unique  The tumor was growing in an open tunnel in my brain and would eventually grow big enough to block the flow of spinal fluid  Surgery was recommended sooner rather than later  After my terrible experience earlier in the day with the resident who loved to share bad news and disappear I knew I didnt want to have my surgery at this hospital  It was time to shop around for a brain surgeon  Two weeks after the incident at work I saw a doctor at NYU who talked about the surgery in dire terms There was a  chance I would need a shunt to help drain excess fluid from my brain for the rest of my life Unsatisfied with that option I kept browsing Wonderful colleagues and friends within the CNN Medical Unit helped me find Dr Jeffrey Bruce at New YorkPresbyterian Hospital  Dr Bruce is a tall commanding man with the confidence and swagger youd hope for in a brain surgeon  Somehow his description of the sevenhour procedure and what would come later didnt seem as scary as before We booked the date for the surgery at the end of October  This is just like a pebble in my brain I told friends Theyll get it out and I can move on with my life  Two days before the operation my friends and family gathered at a bar in Brooklyn for that preHalloween prebirthday presurgery party I wore a short blue wig with my Wonder Woman outfit and set up a photo area to document everyones costumes  We all laughed and danced for hours and at the end of the party whoever was left did the Hora We ran in and out of a circle joyfully raising our hands in the air Ghosts and pumpkins mingled with birthday decor Although I was born at the end of November I wanted to cover all my holidays since I had no idea what the future would hold  What if they took the tumor out and it was cancer after all What if they couldnt get the whole thing during the operation and had to do radiation later What about that shunt What if ANYTHING went wrong and I would never be myself again  At the hospital my family bickered about who got a chair in the waiting room as I sat silently waiting to be whisked through the double doors and into the rest of my life Once I was on the operating table with the IV in the anesthesiologist started the magic medicine and I barely started to count before I was knocked out I woke up one brain tumor lighter and surrounded by the people I love  I spent five days in the hospital mostly sleeping from the antiseizure medicine Real Halloween came and passed  Friends and coworkers came to the hospital to tell me stories about their holiday adventures and share pictures of their nights   If I was ever lonely or uncertain about my place in the world before having this experience was a relatively quick way to discover that I have tremendous love and support in my life  My recovery has taken a lot of hard work  I went straight from the hospital to inpatient rehab to weekly outpatient care working on speech occupational therapy and memory recall I did so well there I was named Februarys Patient of the Month When my doctor recently told me Ive had the best recovery shes ever seen over her year career I burst into tears of joy  The experience has given me confidence in my resilience and more perspective than before on the importance of living in the present because things could always be worse  completely out of nowhere and totally unexpectedly  That fact was solidified when just a month after my surgery my best friends sister died from a brain aneurysm Survivors guilt overwhelmed me but so did a sense of gratitude I dont have an answer as to why Im OK and my friend is gone but I know it makes me push harder as I sweat through spin class and linger longer while I stare at sunsets and beautiful views My zest for life itself  the good and bad  is so much stronger than before  I returned to work parttime working one day a week starting in February Im at two days a week now and hope to be back producing digital content fulltime for New Day by May   Though Im now at the edge of  with a new identity as a survivor I dont consider myself a superhero  At least not until next Halloween
