Theres still a lot we dont know about the inflammatory bowel disease IBD called Crohns including its exact causes Scientists have found that there are a number of   risk factors at work such as smoking the environment changes to your immune system and your ethnic background But the most significant Crohns risk factor appears to be a family history of the condition According to the   studies have shown that  to  percent of those with Crohns or ulcerative colitis have either a parent child or sibling with one of the diseases One statistic in particular highlights the role that genes play in developing Crohns When one identical twin gets Crohns disease theres a  in  chance that the other twin will develop it eventually too Most cases of Crohns are diagnosed relatively early in life between ages  and  But even infants in their first few months can have IBD says   professor of pediatrics and director of the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at the University of California in San Francisco Because early detection is important to limit the damage Crohns disease can do knowing that you have a family history of Crohns can put you on the alert for its warning signs Despite the family link its important to remember that having a Crohns family history does not automatically mean you will develop the disease Even having the genes doesnt predetermine a diagnosis According to the   it appears to take an interaction of multiple factors to trigger the disease While you cant change your parentage one step you can take to cut your risk is to not smoke  and smoking once you have Crohns is believed to make flares more severe too In fact according to a   smoking can just about double any Crohns family risk you might have If you do have a history of Crohns in your family one question you might wrestle with is whether to consider early testing to look for the disease Dr Heyman recommends waiting for persistent symptoms to appear before beginning the screening process Here are the most common ones seen in  to  percent of patients in order of frequency The next set of symptoms may accompany the above Though many of these symptoms can indicate other woes if you have a Crohns family history and you repeatedly experience many of the warning signs talk with your doctor about your risk and when to start testing Diagnosing Crohns usually involves lab tests on blood and stool samples imaging studies MRIs or Xrays and endoscopies including a colonoscopy that let doctors see your intestinal tract Certain genes with a possible link to Crohns have also been identified but genetic testing is not yet available for the general population says Heyman Still research is continuing to identify genes present in people with Crohns disease to better understand the disease guide treatment and in the future find a cure
