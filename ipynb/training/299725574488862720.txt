Need a reason to go to the gym How about this Some scientists suggest that one simple workout can actually cause you to burn calories at a higher rate   after you leave the gym But is it too good to be true Depends which exercise scientists you ask For the past  years dozens of studies conducted by hundreds of researchers have attempted to prove whether the elusive concept of excess post oxygen consumption informally known as afterburn really exists The theory After a strenuous workout your body takes in more oxygen and your breathing rate and core temperature are higher as your body works to bring these back to your normal resting state you burn extra calories in the hours following your workout session Some dieters use this calorieburn bonus as a safety net for eating more because theyve worked out Makes sense right Not so fast researchers say Various studies on afterburn have reached different conclusions in part because they use different methodology and technology and in part because many different factors  including participants diets and fitness levels and the type of   performed  can affect the results A  study conducted at the University of Colorado in Denver and published in the journal   looked at endurance athletes moderately active people and sedentary people When each of the three groups completed a regime of lowintensity biking highintensity biking and resting researchers found   evidence that they burned more fat or calories in the hours following any type of exercise  which was contrary to what they expected to find Researchers said they werent sure why they didnt find a measureable caloric difference though they cant rule out that longer more intense exercise could cause an afterburn But still the researchers wrote that this new data indicates that exercise doesnt boost metabolism as much as previously believed But Amy Knab PhD a researcher at Appalachian State University in Boone NC more recently found different results Dr Knabs team concluded as other researchers have that the key to the extra calorie burn was not the length of the   but rather the intensity In the study participants alternated between days of minute sessions of vigorous exercise  intense enough that it was difficult to hold a conversation  and days of rest To accurately monitor the minutebyminute calorie burn of the study participants they lived in a chamber that measured all their metabolic activity for hour periods Using such advanced technology the researchers found that the days of intense exercise did produce a measureable caloric difference In this study lessintense exercises were not measured to see if they produced similar results We found that in the  hours after the workout participants burned an average of  extra calories Knab says The activity tapered off around  in the morning so we saw it continue even while the participants were sleeping Although burning an extra  calories wont immediately cause a person to shed excess weight this type of knowledge could help dieters plan more effective workouts which will eventually add up to weight loss The average person going to the gym who is walking on the treadmill or doing something similar may not realize how hard they have to work to produce a cardiac benefit Knab says Although walking does make you healthier in order to experience an afterburn you have to work at a higher intensity than most people think Unfortunately Knab says working harder is not the only key to reaping the afterburn benefit Digesting food which causes the body to burn calories is another essential component of afterburn If youre on a restrictedcalorie diet for weight loss you will burn fewer calories after a workout than someone who is not on a lowcalorie diet and eats immediately after exercise Knab says If you are eating more than your body needs after exercise you will gain weight Knab explains Yes you expend energy digesting food but that doesnt equal out to weight loss After a hard workout eat a small proteindense snack about  calories to help your muscles recover Eggs lean meat Greek yogurt and nuts are all good choices Its also best to stick with water to rehydrate your body as many sports drinks can pack unnecessary calories and sodium There are no hardandfast guidelines but its important to keep snacks small and avoid counteracting the amount of calories you just burned Dont use the thought of an afterburn as an excuse to pig out after a workout since the effect is really not as large as most people think Remember that most people and most cardio machines have a tendency to   the amount of calories they burn during a standard sweat session so track your calories consumed and calories burned carefully if you want working out to equal out to weight loss The good news is we now know that working out harder not longer could be the key to both a slimmer figure and a healthier body As Knab and other researchers have shown intense exercise can both boost your overall calorie burn and have additional benefits such as   If youre not sure how to up the intensity try an intensebuteffective boot camp class at your gym or swap your regular treadmill routine for fatblasting   training
