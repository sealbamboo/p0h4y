It was a far cry from Wyatts first six years of nonverbal communication He hated wearing clothing and ate nothing but PediaSure peanut butter and aerosol cheese He was completely inconsolable unless he was attached to my body Looking back I really dont know how my husband Jim and I ever managed   We knew early on that Wyatt was not making the developmental milestones But at the time they did not diagnose children before the age of  with an autism spectrum disorder  As Wyatt neared his second birthday I knew two things I couldnt fix him and I needed a job to pay for what insurance would not cover Although Jim was a successful securities broker we knew we were going to need additional income to fund the therapy services Desperate I began to reinvent myself  I had been successful as an assistant store manager  However I knew I could not maintain my weekly hour schedule and care for our son  I began to network with key community leaders and tried to apply for administrative assistant positions These jobs would allow me to work  am to  pm I was determined to not be deterred by the fact that the pay was half of what I made in my previous career  I was desperate to find a way to secure  to  a year and foot the estimated bill of providing intensive therapy   Six months before Wyatts third birthday I landed a job with a nonprofit For the first time in my life I didnt even negotiate the salary I took it It was my sons ticket to a new life The test of my mental and physical endurance had just begun We enrolled Wyatt in the school districts voluntary prekindergarten program when he turned   The school was  minutes from our home To manage I worked from home between  and  am I took a quick shower and then drove him to school  I would run back to get him deposit him at a local day care for a few hours and then run him to therapies I worked off the hood of my car and at night I was frazzled and completely sleep deprived Wyatt was evaluated and diagnosed with an ASD just weeks after his fourth birthday The series of evaluations were yet another bill not covered by insurance His therapy regimen involved speech physical therapy occupational therapy and behavior therapies  He saw each therapist for an hour twice a week   The average cost for these onehour sessions was   The monthly cost of services was   each year after insurance  Our private insurance company only covered  visits a year By the time Wyatt was  we had started to brace ourselves for the reality that he might never speak  Without any hesitation we purchased    We also invested in an evaluation by a pediatric clinical psychologist That was another  not covered by insurance We felt these tools were necessary in helping to give our son a voice and to assist the school district in developing his Individualized Education Plan The good news is that Wyatt was hooked on the DynaVox from the beginning He went from  tiles to  in a matter of months Then the most miraculous thing happened He wanted to use his voice We pushed on with the support of the school team to find things that would motivate his compliance and speech By Wyatts seventh birthday he could string together words and his speech could be understood in contextual situations  We continued this rigorous therapy schedule until Wyatt was almost  As he neared his ninth birthday I think Wyatt and I both hit a wall We were burnt out on therapies He wanted to try new afterschool activities Jim and I also needed a break   A couple weeks before Wyatt finished third grade last year I got a call I could not have anticipated Our trusted school team felt Wyatt was ready to go to his neighborhood school After years of driving to the north and south part of our county for Wyatt to attend schools with intensive services our boy was going to attend the school across the street from our house  In that moment I flashed back to the little boy who I dropped off at preschool  his red little face smeared with tears and snot his green eyes seared with anger I remembered feeling despicable for leaving him there Then I turned and looked a recent photo of Wyatt on my desk The school coordinator said Mrs Falardeau  are you still there Speechless I paused and said I never thought this day would come  I fell apart and started to cry uncontrollably They were tears of thanksgiving We are now debt free Looking back we never really questioned the mounting debt We believed with all of our heart that it would eventually pay off The financial sacrifices we made were worth every penny  We feel that Wyatts story is a testimony to the value of intensive early intervention His progress continues but we will never forget that emotional anguish   Our story is   parents of children with special needs In fact I often feel guilt or experience survivors syndrome I know that other parents have spent more tried alternative therapies and risked more than we have Their children are still nonverbal and noncompliant That angst continues to drive me to write and raise funds on their behalf  My prayer is that through my writing and fundraising for Autism Speaks we can encourage other parents  And in some small way play a part in supporting valuable research and services for those families who still yearn to hear their child speak and to be independent
