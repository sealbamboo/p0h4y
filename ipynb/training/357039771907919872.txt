The World Health Organization has issued revised guidelines saying that people with HIV should be put on antiviral drugs far earlier than was previously recommended The hope is that most patients would get started on treatment before they begin to get extremely sick Its a move that could have huge implications for African nations where millions of people are infected with HIV In South Africa roughly  million people are living with HIV  more than any other country in the world South Africa also has more people in treatment than anywhere else If the country ends up adopting   more than  million additional South Africans could be put on antiretroviral therapy at public expense Joe Maila spokesman for the national   says adopting these WHO recommendations would have huge implications on an already strained public health system We need to see how many people are going to be rolled into the program Maila says We want to see how much money that will cost us because this disease is lifelong Therefore we need to make decisions that are wellinformed The idea behind the new WHO guidelines is to treat HIV patients earlier in the course of the disease The guidelines raise the threshold for treatment from a   of  to  The CD cells help activate the bodys immune response A higher CD count signifies a healthier immune system The new treatment recommendations should mean that the patients wont get extremely sick and theyll be less likely to transmit the virus to others Dr Gilles van Cutsem the medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in South Africa says the new WHO guidelines are a major step forward in HIV treatment The country already has just over  million people on antiretroviral therapy Van Cutsem says adding an additional million to the rolls will be a challenge for South Africa That is a massive undertaking and we see already that the South Africa public service is bursting at its seams he says Recently public health clinics in several parts of the country have completely run out of AIDS drugs These outages sometimes last for only a few days but some patients say theyve gone on for weeks The new WHO treatment guidelines are widely praised in the country by physicians and activists as a step forward However Dr Francois Venter with the University of Witwatersrands   has been opposed to the new global guidelines His chief concern is that older drugs which are still used in Asia and other parts of Africa can accumulate to toxic levels in the body If we start people on treatment earlier he says particularly with the older drugs it just means patients have more time to develop the toxicities Where these old drugs are used they shouldnt initiate treatment at this higher threshold Hes also concerned that the longer patients are on these drugs the more likely they are to develop resistance to the medicines And hes not convinced that the huge logistical and financial costs of starting treatment at a CD count of  instead of the current  outweigh the benefits Most of the transmission seems to occur below  he says Almost all of the illness occurs below  Treating above   youre treating a very small problem Sitting in an AIDS clinic at Johannesburg General Hospital Venter says South Africa currently is struggling to consistently deliver AIDS drugs to the  million people enrolled in the system He calls the drug shortages the greatest threat right now to South Africas HIV program At a clinic just across the road from here patients took some of the nurses briefly hostage because they were so angry that they werent getting their treatment Venter says They kept being told come back next week a week at a time a week at a time These are people with jobs You spend the whole day and significant cost to get to the clinic and then being told No come back next week  I think these people were just fed up and just lost it a bit The Ministry of Healths Malia says the drug stock outs as they call them in South Africa are a limited problem And he says poor management of the drug supply chain has been to blame rather than the country actually running out of these medicines Maila says theres no set timeline for deciding whether South Africa will move to put hundreds of thousands of additional HIV patients on drug therapy but he says the ministry is seriously considering it
