A lot of it has to do with the cleverness that people feel says the studys lead author Nicole Ruedy a postdoc at the University of Washington The idea that theyve figured out a way to cheat successfully gives them a sense of accomplishment That contradicts previous data that suggests that dishonest actions and intentionally deceiving others makes people feel guilty and worse about themselves  These findings struck me as surprising says David Callahan author of The Cheating Culture  Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead who was not associated with the research In his interviews he says cheaters say that they often feel conflicted or not so great Why the difference Ruedy and her colleagues only studied the immediate effects of cheating so its possible that the thrill of cheating is shortlived and that many cheaters do later feel regret Theres also the fact that socially its not acceptable to admit to feeling good about intentionally bending the rules to your own benefit   There is this immediate boost she says  But we dont know yet what the long term emotional response would be if people were to reflect on their behavior In the research which was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology Ruedy and her team presented participants with opportunities to cheat on word games or puzzles claimed to be intelligence tests in some cases offering monetary rewards for being dishonest Quite a few of the volunteers took the bait  up to half cheated in some of the experiments  and in all but one of the setups the cheaters said they felt better afterward than those who played fair Its the same high you would get if you were stuck in a long line and somebody comes and pulls you out and brings you to the front saying You dont belong back there Callahan suggests Its a short lived euphoria  but youve just gotten something for nothing and something for nothing is always a bit of a high And that high can even be shared albeit vicariously even people who didnt cheat but were randomly assigned a partner who cheated in a way that helped both of them were thrilled by the deception Why the rampant dishonesty  We live in a time when the incentives to cut corners to get ahead academically financially or professionally are higher probably than they ever have been says Callahan  Rising social inequality has enhanced the rewards that come with taking every opportunity to benefit even if it comes at the expense of others and requires unethical actions The relatively painless consequences of not playing fair may also play a role  Theres lax enforcement in lot of key areas The watchdogs are sleeping and in some cases theyve been put to sleep says Calllahan But Ruedys work suggests another reason  the good mood induced by cheating  and even the good mood that comes with collaborating with someone who cheated could prompt more cheating behavior fueling a vicious cycle of increasing dishonesty   You dont want to be the chump who dots his Is and crosses his Ts when everyone else is cheating like crazy says Callahan Yet before you despair about the unethical hole into which our society is falling its worth noting that in the study no one was visibly harmed by the cheating  and that could be a reason for the feelgood vibes cheaters felt Appreciating that cheating is harming others is often critical in reining in immoral behavior Its far easier to rationalize cheating on your taxes if you see them as funding projects you oppose than it is if you see it as taking money away from hungry children police and firefighters for example To test that Ruedy is planning to study the cheaters high in conditions where the harm that results is made explicit to see if the good feelings are affected by this knowledge Hopefully shell find that the thrill is gone if it comes at a cost to others
