WASHINGTON—Federal regulators are weighing whether health insurers who participate in Affordable Care Act exchanges can levy a tobacco surcharge on e-cigarette users, the latest point of debate over the products' health risks. . The 2010 health law allows insurers in individual and small group markets to charge tobacco users as much as 50% more in premiums. But it doesn't specify whether that includes users of electronic cigarettes, battery-powered devices that turn nicotine liquid into vapor.
