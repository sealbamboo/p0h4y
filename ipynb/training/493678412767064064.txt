Medical tests are rarely a pleasant experience especially if youre worried that something could be seriously wrong Thats true even though we know that regular screenings and tests often help doctors catch issues early But of course humans dont always behave rationally Sometimes people will go to great lengths to avoid hearing bad news Social scientists call this sort of behavior information aversion or the ostrich effect based on the old myth that ostriches bury their heads in the sand when theyre scared And it can have important implications for our health researchers say In order to gauge how information aversion affects health care one group of researchers decided to look at how college students react to being tested for a sexually transmitted disease Thats a subject a lot of students worry about according to   an economist at Claremont Graduate University who led the  along with   an associate professor of accounting at Claremont McKenna College The students were told they could get tested for the   Its a common disease that spreads via contact And it has two forms HSV and HSV The type  herpes virus produces cold sores Its unpleasant but not as unpleasant as type  which targets the genitals Ganguly says the college students were given information  graphic information  that made it clear which kind of HSV was worse There were pictures of male and female genitalia with HSV guaranteed to kind of make them really not want to have the disease Ganguly says Once the students understood what herpes does they were told a blood test could find out if they had either form of the virus Now in previous studies on information aversion it wasnt always clear why people declined information So Tasoff and Ganguly designed the experiment to eliminate every extraneous reason someone might decline to get information First they wanted to make sure that students werent declining the test because they didnt want to have their blood drawn Ganguly came up with a way to fix that All of the students would have to get their blood drawn If a student chose not to get tested we would draw  cc of their blood and in front of them have them pour it down the sink Ganguly says The researchers also assured the students that if they elected to get the blood tested for HSV and HSV they would receive the results confidentially And to make triply sure that volunteers who said they didnt want the test were declining it to avoid the information the researchers added one final catch Those who didnt want to know if they had a sexually transmitted disease had to pay  to not have their blood tested So what did the students choose Quite a few declined a test And while only  percent avoided the HSV test three times as many avoided testing for the nastier form of herpes For those who didnt want to know the most common explanation was that they felt the results might cause them unnecessary stress or anxiety The researchers say that this study  and the growing body of evidence on information avoidance  has important implications Many health screening messages urge people to get tested by reminding them how awful diseases can be But these scare tactics might be a mistake Ganguly says Scaring people more about the implications may scare them away from getting tested he says That lines up with previous research In a  study that looked at adolescents in a high school and at a juvenile detention center scare tactics about sexually transmitted diseases proved to be unnecessary for teenagers who were receptive to health messages And they were ineffective for teenagers who were indifferent to such messages Theres a second approach to consider Tasoff says The ostrich effect is produced by anxiety One way to keep anxieties at bay is to draw as little attention to tests as possible to make them routine Of course these ideas need more testing Keeping people in the dark about their health doesnt square with our notions of patient choice and autonomy And if you dont tell people how bad a disease can be that can affect the incentive to get tested at all But one thing seems clear If we want people to pay attention to their health it doesnt make sense to stick our heads in the sand about the ostrich effect
