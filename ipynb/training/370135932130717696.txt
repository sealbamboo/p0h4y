Obamacare may have become a partisan issue but more Republicans than Democrats have signed up for one of its most popular provisions according to a survey published Wednesday The survey also pokes holes in the idea that most somethings act like Young Invincibles who believe they dont need health insurance A team at the Commonwealth Fund which strongly supports healthcare reform looked at one of the main target groups of the  Affordable Care Act  young adults who have been going without health insurance One of the most popular provisions of the law lets people age  and younger stay on their parents health insurance Public opinion polls found a partisan divide  but Republicans and Democrats both took advantage of the young adult provisions says Commonwealth vice president Sara Collins who led the study In fact more Republicans than Democrats did They found that by last March  percent of young adults identifying as Republicans had enrolled in a parents health plan in the last  months compared to  percent of those who considered themselves Democrats About  percent of the  adults surveyed said they were Republicans  percent said they were Democrats and the rest either said they were independent some other party or did not say The health reform law was passed in Congress in  without a single Republican vote and Republicans have fought it ever since  even though it contains many provisions that were originally suggested by Republicans The Republicanled House of Representatives has voted several times to repeal the law which has been going into effect in stages since  but the Democrats who dominate the Senate prevent any further action The  is to stop the law from taking effect by taking away money to implement its main provisions  Overall  million toyearolds or about half of all Americans this age are on their parents health plan the report says  The Obama Administration is working with a batch of nonprofit groups including one called   to encourage healthy young adults to sign up for health insurance Just this week the Health and Human Services Department and the group  trying to encourage young adults to make videos promoting the laws provisions   Health experts agree that people will take better care of their health and rack up fewer expenses down the road if they have health insurance  Theres also concern that if young healthy adults dont join the insurance pool health insurance companies will have to charge everyone more to cover the smaller sicker pool of adults who do have coverage But the Commonwealth survey suggests that its money that stops somethings from signing up for health insurance not some idea that they dont need it  There is a stereotype that young adults believe they are invincible and dont want or need health insurance said Collins This survey shows that is a mytha typical uninsured young adult is from a low or middleincome family and works a lowwage job In general young adults value health insurance but cannot afford it   Enrollment rates of working young adults in their own employersponsored plans average nearly  percent with cost being a principal factor cited among those who do not enroll the report reads A study released Tuesday showed the health insurance for an average family is  a year  for a single person Most Americans get health insurance through an employer Under the  law states and the federal government are setting up online marketplaces where people who dont have health insurance can buy it often with a hefty federal government subsidy And about half the states will expand Medicaid to cover more people with the federal government paying almost all the bill through  The survey itself may be only partly representative of the young Americans being targeted Online research firm Knowledge Networks GfK did two separate surveys of  to yearolds for Commonwealth in  and  each time inviting about  people to answer questions Both times just over half did
