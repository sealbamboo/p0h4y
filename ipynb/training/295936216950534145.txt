 American women with HIV shouldnt breastfeed their babies regardless of low levels of the virus and antiviral treatment the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP cautioned The only way to completely prevent HIV transmission through human milk is not to breastfeed a policy statement from the group pointed out in the February issue of   This guideline breaks from the strong AAP stance in favor of breastfeeding for women without HIV infection It also differs from World Health Organization recommendations for poor regions of the world where infant formula feeding typically isnt feasible and malnutrition and infectious disease are bigger threats That guideline recommends exclusive breastfeeding through age  months then breastfeeding with complimentary foods through  months together with antiretroviral prophylaxis for mother or child to reduce HIV transmission risk Without prophylaxis the risk of infection for the baby is around  per week in the first  to  weeks of life then about  per week for the duration of breastfeeding translating to a cumulative transmission risk of  in one study With  months of antiretroviral prophylaxis the risk dropped to  to  in studies of African mothers Although a low risk transmission can occur despite undetectable maternal plasma RNA concentrations noted Lynne Mofenson MD of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Rockville Md and colleagues in the AAP statement For families with access to clean water and affordable infant formula any transmission risk outweighs the benefits of breastfeeding in this setting it argued The transmission risk is higher with acute maternal infection mastitis or other breast abnormalities high viral load levels or low CD cell counts in the mother and mixed formula and breast feeding Women suspected to have an acute HIV infection shouldnt breastfeed their child until HIV infection is ruled out Pumping and discarding the milk meanwhile may help maintain its supply If an HIVinfected woman with repeatedly undetectable HIV viral loads on antiretroviral therapy chooses to breastfeed despite intensive counseling she wouldnt automatically qualify for a referral to Child Protective Services In such a case the document recommended that the pediatrician consult and coordinate with the mothers HIV specialist to carefully monitor her viral levels and treatment adherence Antimicrobal agents should be given promptly if the woman develops clinical mastitis The baby should also be monitored for HIV status through  months after weaning Flash heating breast milk to pasteurize it doesnt eradicate HIV cells Prechewing food for infants has also been associated with transmission of the infection in some cases If women are worried about affording infant formula pediatricians should help them find financial support such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children In the United States where there is access to clean water and affordable replacement feeding the AAP continues to recommend complete avoidance of breastfeeding as the best and safest infant feeding option for HIVinfected mothers regardless of maternal viral load and antiretroviral therapy the statement concluded Source
