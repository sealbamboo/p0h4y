I have a hard time making friends  Getting to trust people well enough to call them a friend takes a lot of work Its especially hard when you are living with schizophrenia and think everyone is making fun of you  Schizophrenia is the devil on your shoulder that keeps whispering in your ear and no matter what you try the little demon wont stop He hasnt stopped in the almost nine years Ive lived with the illness and hes not about to stop now Hes just quieted down a bit Id call him my companion but that would imply a degree of friendship and theres no way in hell Im the little devils friend  I have plenty of acquaintances and a couple hundred friends on Facebook But real friends mostly family I can count on one hand For me making friends is like climbing a vertical rock wall with no ropes requiring a degree of thrillseeking and a good deal of risk For someone to be my friend they have to accept that Im crazy and even getting to the point of telling them that is daunting when all you hear is the devils whispering that theyre making snap judgments about you or will be going back to their real friends and laughing about you  But interestingly in my efforts to make friends coffee shops have helped The simple routine of going to get your fix of liquid energy every day provides a sort of breeding ground for community You see these people every daywhether you like it or not and over time friendships form I used to live in a small town called Niwot about five miles down the highway from Boulder where I now live Every morning around  I would go to Winot Coffee the small independent coffee shop and every morning without fail there was a guy my age sitting outside with his computer smoking clove cigarettes Given the regularity of seeing him every morning and given that we were some of the only somethings in town we got to talking  He was something of an intellectual heavily involved with the writings of Noam Chomsky foreign policy our dependency on oil and the nonGMO food movement And eventually through our morning chats we became friends I told him about my struggles with mental illness and he told me about the history of the conflict in the Middle East He seemed trustworthy though I could never be sure and I never could shake the notion he was judging me as stupid or simple  I went over to his house for the first time one evening and found it piled floor to ceiling with strange books on metaphysics and Native American history He lived in in a deep grove of trees and grew kale and marijuana in his backyard We ate vegan pizza and I met his girlfriend who was  years older than him  One morning at the coffee shop he came to me for advice He said he was having a hard time with anxiety that he wasnt sure of anything anymore We talked for several hours that morning exploring the nuances of our anxiety I shared with him my irrational fear that people were speculating about my virginity and he told me about his overarching feeling that the world was collapsing in around him  I think it was too much because the next day at the coffee shop he wasnt there and I never saw him again  Sometimes being too vulnerable can throw someone off It was like we had stepped over a line where the friendship got too deep  There are others though who have made it into my inner circle and stuck around Id be nothing without their everconstant ear and their sometimes dark humor that can bring a smile to my face when I want nothing else but to curl up in bed  I have one friend Brianna who has seen me at my worst I met her a few years ago when I was sitting outside a coffee shop writing in a journal and she waved at me and came over and asked me what I was writing I was skeptical at first seeing her blue hair and the wild look in her eyes I told her what I was writing was nothing but then she started asking me questions and before I knew it two hours had passed and she knew that I had been diagnosed schizophrenic after a trip to the UN where I thought I was a prophet and was trying to save the world  It seemed like every time I went to that coffee shop she was there and it was nice to have someone to sit with and to talk with She and I are vastly different people We dont listen to the same music shes into early British punk hardcore stuff and Im on the mellower side preferring Dave Matthews or Blues Traveler Shes a fervent anarchist and Im again mellower taking no sides but believing that everyone should treat each other kindly  There are times when her quirkiness really gets on my nerves like when she tells me her stories about magic and fairies or getting drunk with bikers and theres just no way I can relate She lived in a shack with her boyfriend without water and electricity in the Texas desert for several years and traveled the country selling coffee for an independent coffee shop  Shes so caring though and describes herself as a demon wrangler working with violent people in mental hospitals and prisons talking them down from suicide and putting themselves in danger Six years on shes done the same for me  Shes stuck around despite my delusions that people are out to get me and shes asked me out for coffee during some pretty deep periods of depression I wouldnt be as nearly as stable as I am today without her Somehow we get along   Im grateful to have her  and a few others out of the thousands of people Ive met Because without them theres a good chance Id still be out in the streets thinking I was a prophet and talking about aliens and the coming apocalypse  You only really need one or two good friends anyway  Michael Hedrick is a writer in Boulder Colo His book Connections is available at   and you can find him on twitter
