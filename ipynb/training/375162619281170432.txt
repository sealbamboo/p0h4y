If youre on Medicare and youre in the hospital for a few days you may think youre an inpatient The hospital may have other ideas Increasingly hospitals are placing older patients on observation status They may be there for days but technically theyre still outpatients This is a big deal for someone on Medicare because followup treatment in a nursing home isnt covered unless someone has been an inpatient for at least three days Thats leaving some seniors on the hook for thousands of dollars in nursing home bills One of them is yearold Rosalie Winkworth of Dunellen NJ She went to the hospital in February for the same reason that many older frail people do She fell But she already had a lot of physical impairments stemming from a stroke she suffered when she was just  years old She was pregnant then Because of the stroke Winkworth has weakness on the right side of her body and paralysis Her daughter Donna Maxcy says My whole life thats how Ive known her And Winkworth also has other health issues She has peripheral vascular disease has had a heart valve replaced had a stent implanted and more So when her mother spent four days in the hospital Maxcy says there was no reason to think that she was anything other than an inpatient When a social worker told her that her mother was on observation status it really didnt register I thought she was being watched says Maxcy Observed After Winkworkths discharge her doctors said she needed to go to a nursing home But since the hospital considered her an observation patient not an inpatient the family had to pick up the bill And theyre not rich So they cashed in Winkworths life insurance policy at a loss The payment upon death would have been over  and the early surrender amount was  Maxcy says It was money that was supposed to be used for Winkworths funeral some day Toby Edelman a senior attorney with the   has talked to hundreds of people with similar stories She says to deny people coverage in the nursing home because the hospital called them outpatients makes absolutely no sense Thats why the Center for Medicare Advocacy is suing the Department of Health and Human Services Our lawsuit challenges the use of observation status says Edelman who argues that long observation stays are not authorized by the Medicare statute In fact Medicare recommends that observation status should be used for just a day or two But in the past six years the use of observation status has roughly doubled And according to a government study last year more than  Medicare patients were in the hospital for at least three days but still couldnt qualify for coverage of nursing home care Hospitals blame that on the government Specifically on a program called RAC That stands for   The auditors go through old hospital records and decide if the hospital should have classified a patient as in or out The recovery audit contractors can go back three years and in fact do go back three years says Joanna Hiatt Kim vice president for payment policy at the   Kim explains that if the recovery auditor decides that an inpatient should have been an outpatient the hospitals must return the funding that they had received years earlier and they then often get little or no reimbursement even though theres no dispute whatsoever that the care the patient received was reasonable and necessary So hospitals increasingly use observation status to make sure Medicare pays them something that they wont have to give back Meanwhile the American Hospital Association also has   over payments for observation status The Department of Health and Human Services wouldnt talk about the issue because of the pending lawsuits HHS has issued some  designed to make things better for patients and hospitals But critics say its not enough Really fixing this will take an act of Congress says Rep   DConn It was not really an issue that could be resolved easily by Medicare through an administrative change he says So Courtney has proposed   that would require Medicare to pay for followup treatment in a nursing home for any patient who had been in the hospital for at least three days no matter if theyre an inpatient outpatient or on observation status Courtneys bill has more than  cosponsors including  Republicans This is an issue that has a life of its own he says It is not an issue that  falls into traditional partisan playbooks Though that may not matter in a Congress as gridlocked as this one
