We all know which kid Mom and Dad liked best and odds are youre thinking its not you But does that really make a difference It can researchers say but not always the way you might think Lessfavored children are more likely to be using drugs alcohol and cigarettes as teenagers according to researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah But what matters is not how the parents actually treat the children but how the kids perceive it Theres this cultural perception that you need to treat your children the same or at least fairly says Alex Jensen a professor of psychology who led the   which was published in the August   But if kids perceive that its not fair thats when issues start to arise Earlier studies have found that many if not most parents do have a favorite child And though parents usually strive to hide that its not always successful That differential treatment has been linked to problems with family relationships and risky behavior in teens Jensen the youngest of six and his mothers favorite he says wanted to dig deeper So he and a colleague tested  teenage sibling pairs ages  to  He asked each person how parents treated the children overall who if anyone was favored and how the family functioned They found no correlation between thinking youre the unfavored child and delinquency There was a correlation between feeling on the outs and substance abuse But its even more complicated than that the researchers say In families that werent particularly close the child who felt less favored was more likely to be a substance abuser The more dramatic the difference they perceived in preferential treatment the more likely they were to be using But when family members were more engaged with each other the perceived favoritism had less impact at least when it came to substance abuse Obviously theres a chickenandegg issue here teenagers who are more likely to be using substances may just be more likely to see themselves as the odd kid out Jensens next task is to try to figure that out Parents can try to minimize any ill effects of perceived favoritism by letting the kids know that you really do love them Jensen says annoying teenage attitude and all See them as individuals and love them for who they are he told Shots Show them how you love them Hopefully you do but try to communicate that love
