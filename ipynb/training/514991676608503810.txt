Doctor is it OK for our rabbi to visit my father  I was an intern on call in one of the internal medicine wards in an Israeli hospital just south of Tel Aviv The first day of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot had just ended and the ward was beginning to fill up with visitors who had been unable to drive until after sunset Looking up from what I was doing I saw the son of one of my patients standing at the counter of the nursing station He and I had already spoken several times that day about his yearold father who had been admitted the night before because of a stroke The fathers CT scan from the night before had been unremarkable not unusual in patients whose strokes are caused by an interruption of blood flow to portions of the brain I had explained this to the son as well as what to expect over the next few days as his father would undergo further testing and then discharge to a rehabilitation facility I told him that it was impossible at this early stage to predict how much function his father might recover and cautioned against giving him anything to eat or drink until we were certain that his ability to swallow had not been affected All of the sons questions had been very appropriate and focused Of course I responded smiling and a little surprised that he had asked my permission No one else had that evening Thanking me he turned around towards the main door of the ward located just beyond behind the nurses station Bowing to the rabbi who was just out of sight the son addressed him in the third person Please may the honorable rabbi enter After kissing the rabbis hand he straightened up and led the guest to his fathers room I followed them down the hall with my eyes It was only as they were about to enter the room that I noticed that the rabbi was carrying a white chicken in his arms Although quiet the chicken was very much alive Amazed I stood up and followed them into the room Inside there were perhaps  people the men standing in a tight circle around my patients bed the women sitting off to the side The rabbi who I suspected would be visiting other patients that evening had already begun to chant the prayer for the recovery of the sick one that I recognized Totally new for me however was the role of the chicken Clasped snugly in the rabbis hands the bird was being waved in tight circles about  inches above the patients head as the prayer was being chanted I was familiar with the practice of kaparot in which observant Jews swing a live chicken over their heads on the day before Yom Kippur to symbolize the casting away of sin I had never however seen or heard of this being done as part of a Jewish healing ceremony My patients eyes were partially closed but the rest of the men by the bedside were fully engaged in ritual Swaying back and forth some chanted along with the rabbi Only one person seemed to notice me as I entered the room He glanced at me in a stern way as if warning me not to interfere I stayed there for a minute until one of the nurses called me away to see another patient A couple days later I asked the son about the ritual I had witnessed They were members of the local PersianJewish community he explained and this particular way of reciting the prayer for the sick  with the chicken  was their custom Beezrat hashem with Gods help his father would make a full recovery I was very impressed by how deftly the son was able to maneuver between two very different belief systems explaining his fathers disease and paths towards possible recovery biomedical and religious As evidenced from our repeated discussions about tests and treatment plans for his father he clearly understood  and valued  what modern medicine could offer And yet his belief in Divine mercy and intercession was unshakeable  In her book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down Anne Fadiman describes the collision between two radically different belief systems shamanism and biomedicine held by the parents of a Hmong girl suffering from epilepsy and the physicians caring for her The pushback the parents encountered from the medical team when they tried to incorporate shamanistic healing into their daughters treatment plan led them to reject biomedicine altogether with tragic consequences Although it hadnt occurred to me to disrupt the unfamiliar ceremony with the chicken  mostly because I was so astonished by it  I probably would have been within my rights to do so bringing live poultry into an inpatient ward is risky from an infectioncontrol perspective after all Im glad that I didnt Doing so would have prevented my patient and his caregivers from accessing the healing potential that their religious beliefs provided them and likely would have provoked antagonism towards  or the outright rejection of  the biomedicine that I represented And that would have been detrimental to my patient who so clearly needed the powers of both in order to heal Although nearly  years have passed since that October evening hardly a month goes by in which I do not find myself reflecting on this patient and the chicken This invariably occurs because of an interaction Im having with another patient or family with deeply held beliefs that need not only to be recognized and respected but also integrated into the therapeutic approach in order for treatment to succeed It is a lesson that has served me well and which has helped me to serve so many others over the years
