My nephew sisterinlaw and several others I know are on glutenfree diets helping to support a market for these foods that is   Supermarket shelves are now packed with foods labeled glutenfree including some like peanut and almond butter that naturally lack gluten Chefs too have joined the cause Many highend restaurants and even pizza parlors now offer glutenfree dishes Those who say they react to gluten a protein in wheat and other grains report symptoms like     gas     fatigue   foggy mind numbness in the legs arms or fingers and balance problems after eating a glutenrich food I suspected at first that the glutenfree craze was an attempt by some to find a physical explanation for emotional problems similar to the epidemic of   in decades past But a growing body of research indicates that many may be suffering a real condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity or NCGS It is not   a far less common autoimmune condition that can destroy the small intestine Indeed no one has conclusively identified a physical explanation for gluten sensitivity and its array of symptoms Recent studies have strongly suggested that many and possibly most people who react badly to gluten may have a more challenging problem sensitivity to a long list of foods containing certain   In    a gastroenterologist at Monash University in Victoria Australia and his colleagues studied  people with   who did not have   but reacted badly to wheat a glutenrich grain The researchers  Many of their subjects still had symptoms on a   however which prompted a second study of  patients with irritable bowel syndrome and nonceliac gluten sensitivity who were randomly assigned to a twoweek diet low in certain carbohydrates collectively called Fodmaps All patients on the special diet improved but got significantly worse when fed gluten or whey protein Only  percent of the participants reacted specifically to gluten prompting the researchers to conclude that Fodmaps not gluten   Fodmaps is an acronym for fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols sugars that draw water into the intestinal tract They may be poorly digested or absorbed and become fodder for colonic bacteria that produce gas and can cause abdominal distress They are   Fructose A sugar prominent in apples pears watermelon mangoes grapes blueberries tomatoes and tomato concentrate and all dried fruits vegetables like sugarsnap peas sweet peppers and pickles honey agave and jams dressings and drinks made with highfructose corn syrup   Lactose The sugar in milk from cows goats and sheep present in ice cream soft cheeses sour cream and custard   Fructans Soluble   found in bananas garlic onions leeks artichokes asparagus beets wheat and rye   Galactans Complex sugars prominent in dried peas and beans soybeans soy milk broccoli cabbage and brussels sprouts   Polyols The sugar alcohols sweeteners isomalt mannitol sorbitol and xylitol present in stone fruits like avocado cherries peaches plums and apricots People with irritable bowel syndrome often find that their symptoms lessen or disappear when avoiding foods rich in Fodmaps however it can take six to eight weeks on a lowFodmap diet to see a significant improvement Experts advise those patients to eliminate all foods rich in Fodmaps at the start You can find   at   Once symptoms resolve individual foods are returned to the diet one by one to identify those to which patients react So what about patients who think they are sensitive only to gluten Dr Joseph A Murray gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic and an expert on celiac disease urges that they first be tested for celiac disease a condition that has become dramatically more prevalent in recent decades The signs of gluten sensitivity often mimic those of celiac disease as well as irritable bowel syndrome Tests for celiac disease are less accurate if the diet does not currently include gluten Test first test right Dr Murray said in an interview Were seeing people with symptoms who go on a glutenfree diet and then we cant make a correct diagnosis With nonceliac gluten sensitivity there is no damage to the small intestine meaning many people may consume small amounts of gluten without incident A forthcoming book edited by Dr Murray Mayo Clinic Going Gluten Free lists the essential requirements for diagnosis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity   Negative blood tests for celiac disease and no sign of damage on an intestinal     Symptom improvement when gluten is removed from the diet   Recurrence of symptoms when gluten is reintroduced   No other explanation for the symptoms It is not yet known if the condition results from an immunological reaction similar to that seen in celiac disease or whether gluten exerts a chemical or other negative effect on digestion Gluten sensitivity is not the same as a wheat allergy a far less common problem with symptoms like swelling   skin rash tingling or burning of the mouth and   The best way to test for nonceliac gluten sensitivity after ruling out celiac disease is to remove all sources of gluten from ones diet for several weeks If the symptoms disappear reintroduce gluten to see if they recur Another option is to keep a food diary for a few weeks recording everything you eat and drink and any symptoms that follow In addition to the inconvenience and added expense a glutenfree diet can result in a poor intake of fiber and certain essential nutrients It may be wise to consult a registered dietitian if you plan to go glutenfree This is the second of  on gluten in our diets
