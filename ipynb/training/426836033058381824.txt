Now that the problems with the balky   website are largely fixed the Obama administration is finally feeling comfortable enough to launch some of the outreach it planned for last fall Its top target young adults specifically those between  and  Actress and comedian Aisha Tyler and former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson are among the celebrity spokesmen Both have released videos   than   The administration plans to air ads during the upcoming Winter Olympics and March Madness college basketball tournament The theory has been that without young and healthy people in the insurance pools   in future years But people have started to wonder just how critical those young people really are to making the health exchanges operate smoothly Theres been this incredible focus on reaching young invincibles and getting them to sign up for insurance says Larry Levitt senior vice president of the   But it turns out the invincible part is actually much more important than the young part Thats because under the health law insurers can no longer deny people coverage or charge them more because of their health status So healthy people will be cheaper to cover regardless of age An insurer would much rather have a healthy yearold who goes to the gym every day than a sick yearold Levitt says Insurance industry consultant   agrees that its not the young who insurers want most We need healthy people he said We need healthy yearolds and yearolds and yearolds and yearolds Laszewski says theres another reason insurance companies might prefer the older healthy person to the younger one  the older person is more profitable Its not uncommon for a yearold to only be paying  or  a month So getting lots of young people doesnt necessarily get us lots of premium he said Thats because while the law doesnt let insurers charge sick people more it does let them charge older people more  up to   Laszewski says what worries him right now isnt that not enough young people have signed up but that not enough people overall have bought insurance through the exchanges Weve always felt that you need  percent of a group to be able to get a good cross section of healthy and sick to make the program sustainable he said And the administrations only at about  percent This is troubling And what if the mix  healthy versus sick or young versus old  doesnt come out quite right The law is actually designed to take that into account There are a number of shock absorbers built into the system says Kaisers Levitt That means particularly in the first couple of years the insurance system can withstand a skewed mix of enrollees Those shock absorbers include   that can go to health plans that end up enrolling populations that are sicker than anticipated But those payments dont go on indefinitely Thats only going to help for a very limited period of time says Laszewski Its training wheels if you will to get this thing launched The real key to making the exchanges selfsustaining Laszewski says is to build the numbers overall I think the focus is wrong in that theyre reaching out only to young people he says of the administrations efforts They need to be reaching out to everyone The administration has just over two months to get those numbers up Open enrollment for  ends March
