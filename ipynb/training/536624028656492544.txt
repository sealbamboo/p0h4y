f Im on an early shift I get up at am grab a shower and pop on my uniform  a polo shirt black trousers and trainers Im based at one of the charitys two hospices Christophers which is in a rural location near Guildford so I jump in the car and travel the five miles from my home and get to work for am People assume childrens hospices are sad and depressing places but as soon as you walk into the building you realise its actually a really lovely place to be Its like a home from home filled with toys games and colour and most medical equipment is out of sight Coming to work every day never seems to be a chore but I do make sure I have a green tea before I start to wake me up With childrens hospice nursing its important to work closely with parents so children feel comfortable in the environment Each child has a detailed care plan which covers things like symptoms feeding bed time and favourite toys and activities to help with this Once weve had a handover from the previous shift each child is allocated one member of staff for the day and I check the drug charts to see what medication needs to be given when and to whom When I graduated two years ago some people told me to work at a hospital first and learn the basics and said Id be deskilled in a childrens hospice But I have to say I disagree  Ive seen a huge range of lifelimiting conditions at the hospice right from diagnosis to end of life and have had the advantage of administering onetoone care that Id never experience in a hospital setting We also benefit from caring for the child and family on a longterm basis which means we build up a fantastic relationship with them Once the children are up washed and dressed we start the days activities which can be anything from pumpkin carving and cooking to using the hospice hydrotherapy pool or going on a day trip to the beach Our activities coordinator plans some great things for us all to do or well often take the lead from the children and do what theyd like to for the day The aim is to make every moment count for the child we care for At lunchtime everyone comes together to eat in the dining room and it feels like were a big family which I love We care for children aged  with a range of complicated illnesses such as the degenerative condition Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the severe epilepsy disorder LennoxGastaut syndrome The same condition can display differing symptoms and reactions and each child has very specific needs so my day can often include mandatory or supplementary training Our hospice education team ensures we are up to date on paediatric care practices for things such as tracheostomies and ventilators and Im due to attend a course for catheterisation and bowel care If a child is particularly sick and needs endoflife care my day will focus on crisis symptom management and I work closely with the family and the palliative care team to manage pain while supporting the mum and dad through an extremely difficult time When a child dies its obviously really tough and the sad days are hard Over time Ive learned to deal with it emotionally by remembering weve done as much as we can to help make the child comfortable and have supported the family to the best of our ability  but its always difficult The best thing about my job is the children  they are superstars Their life is full of hospital appointments and medications and every day is a struggle for them but they are incredibly brave I feel privileged to be part of what theyre going through and offer care and support  its fulfilling to be able to treat them ease their pain and put a smile on their face by having some fun My job certainly puts things into perspective you definitely learn not to sweat the small stuff Before leaving for the day at pm Ill hand over to the next shift and explain how the children have been and what theyve done Then Ill go home where I share a house with other hospice staff There is an unwritten rule that we dont talk shop at home so we can all switch off from our shift If Ive had a particularly bad day I know I can talk to my team leader or supervisor and there are counsellors available to staff who need extra support If Im not working at the weekend I see friends and family in my home town Crawley and in the summer I spend a lot of my time off at festivals and on holiday which is my way of really unwinding
