Introducing a new rule While you walk put the phone   A new study shows that walking while mindlessly taptaptapping away on your phone actually changes your gait causing you to move more slowly which annoys everyone around you  Texting also makes it harder to walk in a straight line which combined with the phones powers of distraction can be potentially dangerous  This could potentially be a problem in high risk environments like walking near traffic or train tracks where people think they are walking in a straight line but are actually wandering in a different direction lead author Siobhan Schabrun said in an email YouTube is filled with   like the Virginia man who  last year because he was texting  For this new study   in the journal PLOS One Australian researchers filmed the movements of  young men as they walked about  feet The men were asked to walk three times once while reading texts once while writing them and once while just walking When they texted while they walked they had a harder time walking in a straight line and they also tended to walk more slowly than when reading text messages or simply walking Texting also caused them to walk more like robots Schabrun said they hardly moved their arms torso or head in order to keep the phone steady in front of their eyes Thats a problem Schabrun says because a more rigid posture puts you at a greater risk of falling especially for older people  Textingwhilewalking has to be among the most embarrassing reasons for a trip to the emergency room but such injuries are increasing recent figures show In  more than  pedestrians were treated in ERs for injuries related to using a cell phone while walking according to a  Ohio State University study and that number has more than doubled since  In the PLOS One study  percent of the participants said theyd had some sort of trip fall or collision while walking and texting  Much of this is down to the myth of multitasking When people try to do two things at oncelike texting and walkingthey end up prioritizing one over the other In our participants it seems people prioritized texting over walking compromising their posture and balance Schabrun said  In another recent study University of Washington researcher Dr Beth Ebel staked out one of Seattles busiest intersections to observe pedestrian behavior She found almost one in three pedestrians were doing something other than paying attention like listening to music And the folks who were paying the least attention to their environment were texting Ebel says She says that people who were texting were four times less likely to look up before they crossed the street and they tended to spend more time in the intersection  I really have come to look at this as being sucked into the world of your phone Ebel says Theyre basically on autopilot  But when youre crossing the street you can be killed Its a very high risk behavior  Just put the phone down she says
