Medicare spending on breast cancer screening for women age  and older has jumped nearly  percent in recent years But the rise in price was not associated with an improvement in the early detection of breast cancer Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine found that Medicare spending on breast cancer screening rose from  million in the years  to  million in the years  So why the big increases in costs The way that we screen for breast cancer has changed dramatically explains Yales   an internist and a coauthor of the study The study was   in the   In the past decade many hospitals and clinics have switched to using digital mammography machines which like digital cameras provide clearer more detailed images that are easier to store share and enhance than their filmbased counterparts They have also adopted computeraided detection which can help radiologists spot tumors they might otherwise miss But buying new machines and training people to use them can be expensive To offset the costs Medicare reimburses doctors and hospitals around  percent more for digital mammograms than for film mammograms According to the Yale review of the data the use of digital mammograms and of computeraided detection increased nationally from around two percent to  percent between  and  As a result the cost per screening mammogram rose from  to  during this period They estimated that for each Medicare recipient the average cost of all screeningrelated tests including followup biopsies MRIs and ultrasounds increased from  to  during the time period Almost all of that increase in cost came from digital mammography and computeraided detection But switching to the more expensive technology didnt seem to help doctors spot cancer The purpose of a screening test is hopefully to catch malignancy at an earlier stage when it is more treatable But we did not see a change in the detection of early or late stage tumors says   a breast surgeon at Yale and lead author on the study This study adds to the mixed report card on digital mammography since the technology first came into general use in the mids Studies show that it   at detecting cancer in younger women because it allows doctors to more easily identify tumors in denser breast tissue But it is about as accurate as film scans for older women Radiologists argue that digital screening offers many benefits for patients even if it doesnt always find more tumors I think digital is better all around says   a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School speaking on behalf of the American College of Radiology With digital mammography he explains technologists can see the images right away and can easily adjust the contrast Patients dont have to wait for film to be developed or submit to additional scanning if the images were overexposed or underexposed Doctors can easily store and share images allowing them to better track changes over time or seek the opinion of a colleague Kopans also points out that the Medicare reimbursement levels may not match the true costs of digital technology I would urge that we look at what the real costs are rather than just saying that we shouldnt spend the money he says Unfortunately women who are concerned about their breast health  and their tax dollars  rarely have a choice of method As of July    in the United States were digital At this point I dont think anyone would look at this study and say they should dig the old film machines out of the closet says Gross Digital machines are more accurate for a subset of the population he says and now that they are so widespread it would be impractical for breast imaging centers to buy new filmbased machines for their older patients But he says the study underscores the importance of fully discussing the efficacy cost and insurance coverage of future technologies  such as   which are just starting to be introduced  before they go into common use I view this as a cautionary tale Gross says
