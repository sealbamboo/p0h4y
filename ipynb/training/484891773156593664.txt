Unhealthy food makes a startlingly high number of appearances in childrens television shows researchers say  Junkfood adverts are restricted during childrens television in the UK However a study published in Archives of Disease in Childhood found the shows themselves skewed towards unhealthy food The Childrens Food Campaign said children were being bombarded with attractive images of unhealthy food Adverts for foods high in fat salt and sugar aimed at children under  are not allowed in the UK A team of scientists at the University of Limerick in Ireland watched hours of childrens television on the BBC and the Irish statebroadcaster RTE  They found that  of food appearances were unhealthy such as sweets or chocolate while sugary drinks made up a quarter of all appearances of fluid Prof Clodagh OGorman from the University of Limerick told the BBC We were startled by how much food there was and surprised at the type of food consistently represented  She said junk food was shown being consumed without consequence Programmes have teenagers after school going to a coffee shop or fastfood outlet having lots of sugary or highfat foods and theyre all thin and happy and thats not realistic she said The foods which should be in eaten in moderation are eaten excessively on TV and the staples fruit and vegetables are very infrequently represented However the impact of the programming on the viewer is not clear cut Previous research has suggested a link between advertisements children developing a brand affinity and wanting to consume that particular product  Our hypothesis is the children will want to eat fast food in general Prof OGorman said Further research would be need to discover if that was true In the meantime Prof OGorman called on parents doctors and regulators to be more aware of the levels of junk food in childrens television Malcolm Clark the coordinator of the Childrens Food Campaign said It is disappointing that childrens TV seems to be so tamely reflecting the obesogenic environment we all live in rather than presenting a more positive vision of healthy sustainable food   Children are bombarded with attractive images of unhealthy food and drink throughout their day  online on billboards in magazines in shops and still very much on TV  It is all part of the normalising of eating sugary snacks and sugary drinks that the food industry has so successfully achieved   We want the government to protect children by drawing up stricter rules including switching off junkfood adverts on TV until after  and putting rules in place to stop children becoming fair game for internet marketing A BBC spokesperson said We broadcast lots of programmes to promote healthy eating to children and to help them understand where food comes from with series like I Can Cook Incredible Edibles and Blue Peter
