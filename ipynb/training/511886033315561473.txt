Although I normally choose to greet my acquaintances surprise with a simple smile and Well see how I feel about it later I decided to speak out after learning that Britains Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are  The palace says Catherine is again suffering from   as she did during her first pregnancy It might seem crazy to some that I would have wanted more kids after my first hyperemesis gravidarum battle but I simply refuse to let it define my family planning  Hyperemesis gravidarum manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy Because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before youre out of the danger zone of the first trimester making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if youve suffered a miscarriage  Since you are so sick what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially   Hyperemesis gravidarum even managed to take away the joy of feeling my daughter Hannah kick once I realized her movements were setting off the nausea But what hyperemesis gravidarum cant take away is the last  years of joy Ive gotten from being Hannahs mom The moment Hannah came out I looked at her tiny face and knew that every second of sickness every expensive doctors bill every time Id felt desperate and depressed and doubted myself as a mother was worth it And as soon as Hannah was out I felt this pang of hunger that I hadnt felt in months I turned to the nurse and asked when I could eat About  minutes later she brought me a plate of lasagna that I gobbled up and  more important  kept down  The hyperemesis gravidarum was finally gone and the only thing left was my adorable baby who has grown into one of the strongest little people I know and one of my closest friends   I never once thought about the hyperemesis gravidarum when I watched her take her first steps perform in her preschool play sound out her first word present her first science fair project compete in her first gymnastics meet or any of the other incredible memories weve shared   The nine months of sickness I had with her in utero were nothing in comparison to the  years Ive enjoyed as her mom   So even on my darkest days during this pregnancy the ones where I am reduced to a smelly tearful nauseated lump on the couch Ive thought about those moments in Hannahs life and smiled knowing that I am going to get to experience all of those again with this daughter come February  I belong to an online community of women who have survived or are currently suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum sort of a support group and resource community all in one  From time to time someone will write a post saying they are at their wits end ready to give up or feel like they are losing their mind Within minutes the responses will pour in photos of recently born babies from hyperemesis gravidarum survivors descriptions of a new milestone someones little one has achieved and even tales from women still suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum of how much better they are feeling that particular week  I love when a few weeks later the original poster comments on someone elses post to tell them how they survived those desperate times and found the strength to keep going  Although there were some moments where I wanted to give up hyperemesis gravidarum has made me appreciate my life and my family so much more than I ever could have if I hadnt been sick  Perhaps next time someone asks me if Ive lost my mind Ill simply hold up a picture of my daughter and tell them absolutely not
