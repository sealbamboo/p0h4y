Doctors and nurses are being placed under almost intolerable pressure a leading medic has warned Dr Neil Dewhurst said this was due to cuts in hospital beds growing admissions and staff shortages The outgoing president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh called for an agreed set of manageable standards to be adopted nationally Health Secretary Alex Neil said there were pressures on the NHS but it was not all doom and gloom Dr Dewhursts comments came as the Scottish government released its latest series of health statistics which covered areas including waiting times staff levels drug and alcohol treatment and bed blocking The figures published by the Information Services Division ISD of NHS Scotland suggested that Dr Dewhurst who stands down as RCPE president later this week claimed the number of hospital beds being occupied now commonly exceeds what is regarded as the maximum safe level He said occupancy rates in some areas had reached as high as  last year He said it was essential for the health service to commit to having a maximum occupancy rate of  The consultant cardiologist went on to call for the introduction of more stringent standards for the quality of care as happened south of the border following the problems identified in Mid Staffordshire While Dr Dewhurst stressed there was much to be proud of in the NHS in Scotland he added that in recent years a variety of pressures have built up in our hospitals which are now seriously impacting upon our ability to deliver the quality of care that patients require Dr Dewhurst said problems in the health service had most recently been seen in NHS Lanarkshire  which was last year told a range of improvements must be made at three hospitals following a review into patient safety prompted by higher than average mortality rates But he said these problems could just as easily have happened elsewhere Dr Dewhurst said Reductions in the numbers of acute beds while medical admissions have continued to rise in parallel with workforce shortages have placed almost intolerable pressure on our doctors and nurses Dr Dewhurst said the practice of moving patients between wards because of overcrowding  known as boarding  was only intended for times of severe pressure such as during ward closures and outbreaks of norovirus or flu But he said this had now become established practice in many Scottish hospitals on a yearround basis While he welcomed a recent pledge from the Scottish government to end this discredited practice Dr Dewhurst said efforts to do this must be stepped up Boarding continues in our hospitals and efforts need to be accelerated to reduce it he said He warned that the occupancy rate for hospital beds in Scotland now commonly exceeds  nationally with Dr Dewhurst saying evidence had shown this was the maximum safe level at which we can treat patients He said Above this level the risk to patient safety also increases  Despite this bed capacity of up to  was recorded in some Scottish medical units last year Personally I believe it essential that we commit to the UKwide adoption of a maximum ward capacity of  He pointed out that in late  the NHS in England had adopted  specific new standards of care in response to the events in Mid Staffordshire and to support the delivery of sevenday acute medical services The standards to be implemented in England over the next five years have the support of the medical profession and these could be adapted for use by the NHS in Scotland he said What is needed is national adoption of an agreed set of manageable standards to drive up the quality of care for medical patients Without this the NHS in Scotland risks falling behind England He added I am a strong advocate of the NHS in Scotland and throughout the UK and believe passionately that we owe it to patients to provide the highest quality of care that we can This is why I believe that collectively we need to be honest about the challenges which we face to step back from crisis management to develop more sustainable strategies for managing hospital services and to improve the standards of acute medical care provided to patients Our patients deserve nothing less Speaking on BBC Radios Good Morning Scotland programme Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil said Id be the last person to deny there are pressures in the National Health Service but its not all the doom and gloom thats being painted For example Neil Dewhurst said the number of beds have been cut Thats not true Over the last year we have increased the number of beds in the NHS by over  We have the highest ratio of beds to patients in the UK We are investing in additional capacity additional staff additional beds and additional support for frontline staff Addressing the issue of boarding Mr Neil said Across the whole system there are fewer than  of patients who will be boarded and we are trying to reduce that significantly He said the NHS Lanarkshire report had shown that up to  of the hospital patients did not need to be there One of the ways we are tackling this is by trying in future to make sure that people who do not need to be in hospital are not admitted or referred to hospital he said
