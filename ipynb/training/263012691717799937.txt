When smoking is banned in bars and workplaces the number of people who suffer heart attacks and die drops within months according to two new studies They found benefits not only in saving lives but in lowering the cost of medical care for heart attacks stroke and other smokingrelated illnesses Its the best evidence yet demonstrating big swift health improvements when secondhand smoke is banished We should now accept this as fact says   a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic who led one of the studies Tobacco industry arguments that secondhand smoke isnt a major risk factor for heart disease he says are just nonsense because the only risk factor that changed in those  months was secondhand smoke Peoples cholesterol and blood pressure stayed the same and obesity rates increased Doctors should tell patients that avoiding secondhand smoke is something they can do to avoid heart disease Hurt says just like lowering cholesterol and blood pressure and maintaining a healthy weight People with known coronary disease should have no secondhand smoke exposure Hurt says It is too dangerous Thats bad news for people in the  states that dont have comprehensive smoking bans especially if they like to hang out in casinos or bars the places most likely to be shrouded in a haze of tobacco smoke About half of states have laws   according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Others may ban smoking in restaurants but not bars and casinos or let people smoke if the space is ventilated The new study looked at medical diagnoses in Olmsted County Minn site of an ongoing study funded by the National Institutes of Health Hurt and his colleagues found that the number of heart attacks there dropped by onethird in the  months after a strict ban on workplace smoking went into effect in  An earlier state law banned smoking in restaurants but allowed it in bars and some workplaces The number of sudden deaths from heart attacks decreased by  percent but there werent enough deaths overall to make that a reliable number Hurt told Shots His study was   in the   Banning indoor smoking also swiftly lowers the number of people hospitalized for smokerelated health problems the second study found Researchers at the University of California San Francisco combed through  studies covering  smokefree laws in the United States and other countries They found that total indoor smoking bans were associated with a  percent decrease in hospitalization for heart attacks a  percent decrease for stroke and a  percent decrease in hospitalizations for lung diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease The stricter the law the fewer people landed in the hospital Its just a gigantic effect says   director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at UCSF and a leader on the study Theres nothing else you can do thats going to have that big an effect that fast The   in the journal   Politicians should take note Glantz says because backing strict smoking bans would get them immediate payback not just in constituents health but in savings on health care costs Those benefits would far outweigh tax revenues from bars and casinos Glantz adds Loss of business to casinos and bars is a key talking point for smoking advocates
