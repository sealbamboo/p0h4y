For months consumers have been warned that they have to buy health insurance by the end of open enrollment or remain uninsured until next year But a little noticed provision of the health law may give some consumers another chance Insurers that sell individual plans have to offer insurance to all comers during an annual open enrollment period which this year ended for most people on March  However the   to sell individual plans on the exchange outside the regular open enrollment if they wish to do so as long as they dont discriminate against people who are sick Health policy analysts say they dont expect insurers to take advantage of the extra selling opportunity often The assumption is that no insurance company would do that because theyd just open themselves up to too much   says Sabrina Corlette project director at the Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms Still at least one state is embracing the option Under   that took effect in January any insurer that sells individual health plans outside the states health insurance exchange has to offer those plans year round To discourage people from waiting until they get sick to buy a plan insurers can require a waiting period of up to  days for coverage to take effect We recognized that there could be a time when a consumer in Nevada needs or wants to purchase insurance off of the exchange for whatever reason without having had one of the special qualifying events that create an enrollment opportunity on the exchanges says Jake Sunderland a spokesman for the Nevada Division of Insurance We wanted to allow for that No other state has taken Nevadas tack so far Under the health law people who dont get insurance through their jobs can shop for plans during a designated open enrollment period each year This year open enrollment ran from Oct   through March   Open enrollment for  coverage starts Nov   and ends Feb  Insurers on and off the exchanges   to enroll in their plans during these windows After the annual open enrollment periods ends in general people cant buy a plan again until the next   unless they get married have a child or experience other big changes in their life circumstances So unless they live in Nevada or an insurer makes a rare offer of insurance outside of open enrollment people who dont buy coverage during open enrollment and subsequently get sick may have to pay for their own medical care for the remainder of the year in addition to facing a penalty for not having health insurance Because of the bumpy rollout of the health insurance exchanges many people didnt finish enrolling in coverage by the March  deadline The   to complete the process in the  states where it operates the health insurance exchanges to enroll in exchange plans Many states that operate their own exchanges followed suit extending the length of time people could sign up for a plan on and off the exchanges into April In a statement following the announcement of the extra time to sign up through the federal exchange Americas Health Insurance Plans a trade group for the insurance industry urged that any extension be limited This helps to ensure there is an incentive for people to enroll It is also necessary so health plans know who is covered as they develop and submit premiums for next year which is required in some states as early as April the statement said Under normal circumstances insurers might balk at offering people a chance to sign up outside the regular open enrollment period But this Aprils exended time frame may be a special case With so much speculation that young and generally healthy people would likely wait until the last minute to enroll in a plan insurers might be more than usually willing to leave the enrollment doors open in the hope of snagging some of the healthy procrastinators Georgetowns Corlette says It may well be that issuers are assuming that these procrastinators are people that they want to have she says
