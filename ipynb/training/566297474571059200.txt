One things clear from the latest analysis of drinking habits  fewer people are indulging in alcohol and thats largely down to the preferences of young adults   Beyond the headline the ONS also reveals a fascinating snapshot of changing behaviour which tell us something about British society While the proportion of all adults surveyed who say they are teetotal increased from  to  between  and  the percentage of  year olds not touching alcohol rose sharply from  to    Amongst those who are  and over the opposite happened with non drinkers falling from  to  of the total   The fall in the number of teetotal pensioners was entirely down to fewer women saying they abstain from alcohol Binge drinking defined as at least one heavy night in the week before the survey was conducted fell overall between  and  but this was entirely down to the behaviour of young adults   Amongst  to  year olds it dropped from  to  of those surveyed and for the  to  year olds it fell from  to    For the older age groups there was little change There was a stark difference in numbers who dont drink around the nations and regions of the UK  While  of adults in the South West of England are teetotal more than double that  of nondrinkers in London dont touch alcohol   Adults in the north east of England and Scotland are most likely to have binged in the previous week     So whats happening and why are younger people apparently turning away from drink   The ONS believes that the targeting of underage drinking in recent years has achieved results    A tightening of the rules at licensed premises making it harder for young drinkers to purchase alcohol and other initiatives aimed at reducing the availability of drink have played a part according to statisticians Cultural and religious factors may well provide an explanation for the increase in abstinence  The Alcohol Health Alliance said the fall in consumption may in part be due to the change in the ethnic makeup of the country   The Alliance says the figures were encouraging but should provide no cause for complacency about the problems associated with alcohol   Perhaps people are simply becoming more responsible and have taken on board the health messages about the dangers of excess drinking    The Portman Group which represents the drinks industry argues there has been a culture change over the last decade and an improving relationship with alcohol Medical experts urge caution about the figures claiming that people responding to questions in surveys can understate their drinking habits    The survey doesnt tell us about other behaviour which might influence health and which might have increased as the popularity of drinking wanes  Yet at a time when Westminster and the devolved administrations have made a priority of reducing alcoholrelated harm these survey results provide some grounds for cautious optimism
