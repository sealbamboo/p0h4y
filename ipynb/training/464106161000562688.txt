For the first time scientists have expanded lifes genetic alphabet by inserting two unnatural manmade letters into a bacteriums DNA and by showing that the cells machinery can copy them The advance means that scientists have a new tool for exploring how life encodes information which could help them understand lifes origins Whats more this is a step towards giving living cells new abilities like being able to make more and better medicines cheaper and faster The instructions in DNA really are written in a kind of code Its made of strings of molecules that go by the letters   which stand for adenine cytosine thymine and guanine All of lifes diversity all of biology is encoded in these long strings of pairs of G with C and of A with T says   a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla California Life has been happy with this code for billions of years but to Romesberg it seems really limited Imagine he says if the English alphabet only had four letters Maybe you get three consonants and one vowel he says Maybe there are some words you can write and you can string them together to make sort of primitive stories But if you could have a couple extra letters theres more that you could write Having the ability to store increased information would allow you to write more interesting words bigger words more complicated words more nuanced words better stories Thats why hes been on a mission to add new letters to the genetic code Its not so much that I think life needs more genetic information but I think that there are things that we could really learn and drugs that could be developed by getting cells to be able to do more Romesberg says His   has created a pair of unnatural synthetic letters that can be inserted into DNA right alongside the usual letters And in a   published online Wednesday in the journal   they say theyve put this new pair of letters into the genetic code of a strain of common lab bacteria E coli When the bacteria reproduced by dividing the machinery inside each cell copied the DNA  including these unnatural letters This is the first time that people have integrated a truly synthetic manmade thing into the machinery  in this case the most fundamental aspect of the machinery the DNA  and used it to do something that system does in this case store information says Romesberg And obviously we can now store more information than we could before So what are the names of these new letters in lifes alphabet This is embarrassing We have really horrible names Romesberg says They are abbreviations for very complex chemical names He explains that because his lab has made and investigated many possible molecules over the years we couldnt give every one of them a cute little name like X or Y or alpha or beta  because we simply examined too many of them The awkwardlynamed pair of letters was put into just one spot in the bacteriums whole genome which contains hundreds of thousands of letters Its like someone inserted a random letter from the Cyrillic alphabet into an English text The cells were specially engineered so that theyd take in the chemical building blocks theyd need to copy these unnatural letters But the cell could not read the foreign letters We didnt want to look at that step yet We only wanted to look at the process of storing the genetic information says Romesberg The next challenge will be to show that a cell can retrieve information from unnatural letters and use it to do something that a cell wouldnt normally do  like make a new kind of protein Still just getting some new letters into a cells genetic code is a big deal It was quite impressive actually says Ross Thyer a biochemist at the University of Texas at Austin Taking it from the test tube into a living cell is definitely a significant step forward He says now scientists can start exploring some basic questions like why life settled on four genetic letters And what is the potential for adding more Thyer adds Can we develop more complicated living systems with these new pieces  He says all of this work gets at how living systems store and transform information which could help us understand how life got started in the first place
