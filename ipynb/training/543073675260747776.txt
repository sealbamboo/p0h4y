I think its time to switch therapies I told my patient as he and his wife sat next to each other by the wall of my exam room  He stared at me unblinking through his chipped wirerimmed glasses as his wife looked quickly down at the medication list she clutched in her hands Her worn purse sat on the floor by her chair Switching therapies was a euphemism for your cancer is progressing a point I didnt need to hammer home with them  they both knew the score OK he said taking a deep breath Whats next We had been navigating his cancer together for a yearandahalf balancing the most effective treatments we could devise with what his health insurance would cover and what he could afford The mile drive to Cleveland was itself an economic strain gas prices being what they were and their aging car becoming increasingly more finicky particularly during the cold winter months The next drug Id suggest is a pill that youd take every day It can get you into a remission and may even allow you to live a little longer Its the one weve talked about before I told him He nodded remembering The real expensive drug he asked This time I nodded When I first suggested he take this pill as part of his chemotherapy regimen I warned him about the possible cost as this has become a part of my standard informed consent process  I review potential risks benefits alternative medications the people involved in a patients care and now economic risks  After checking with his insurance plan which did not cover chemotherapy pills the way it did intravenous chemotherapy I had the unpleasant task of telling my patient that the medication would cost him  per month At the time he had laughed a mixture of surprise and incredulity He was too welloff to qualify for patient assistance but too poor to afford the drug His face was grave now I wont bankrupt my family for a month or two more time he said I have to leave them something His wife looked up briefly about to interject but remained quiet This was ground they had already covered and she would make her case for his taking the pill when I wasnt present They were private people proud and wouldnt disagree with each other in front of someone who wasnt family As the price of chemotherapy now routinely reaches  for a full treatment course my patients are forced more and more into making the equivalent of Sophies Choice when it comes to treating their cancer Spend down their savings for an improvement in survival that might amount to a few weeks secretly hoping that they will be one of the lucky few at the tail of the survival curve  the handful of people who live years more or decline the therapy and in so doing ensure that their families will be provided for after they have died I had to wonder whether anyone should be forced to make such a decision My patient and I discussed a couple of other treatment options and ways that he might receive his therapy closer to home a plan that made him visibly relax Not that we dont like seeing you he joked His wife didnt smile though Perhaps she wasnt ready yet to let him go or didnt agree with his reasoning that she would be destitute if he chose the pill Maybe she was incensed that hardworking people like themselves would be placed in such a quandary precisely at the time of their retirement and in such a wealthy nation The way she set her mouth I guessed it was a combination of all three Ill miss seeing you I told them both as we all got up to leave There was nothing else I could say  this was the part of cancer care I didnt have the tools to fix
