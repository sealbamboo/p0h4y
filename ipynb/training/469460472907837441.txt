Last year the Republican playbook for keeping control of the House of Representatives in  and winning the Senate consisted of a fairly simple strategy Run against Obamacare But now that the  races are starting to take shape that strategy isnt looking quite so simple Democrats are fighting back Theyre focusing on Republican opposition to the health laws expansion of Medicaid as a part of their own campaigns Republicans are kind of counting on Obamacare to bring them control of Congress in November and I dont think they should be so confident says Dean Clancy a longtime Republican operative and former vice president of FreedomWorks a conservative group that supports Tea Party candidates Its much harder now that Obamacare is up and running Chris Jennings a health policy consultant who worked on the issue in both the Clinton and Obama administrations agrees I think health reform is now feeling like more and more of an issue of the past Jennings says One thing I learned from Bill Clinton is every election is about the future  and not the past  and what are you going to do to address it Republicans face two key problems using the law as a political cudgel analysts say One is that with millions of people now signed up for coverage making the law go away would result in taking away something tangible for a large and growing group of voters So in short order its going to be about what you lose as a consequence Jennings says The second problem is with the back half of what Republicans have continually branded as a the repeal and replace strategy Clancy says In my  years of following health care policy Republicans have never been able to coalesce around an electorally inspiring alternative on health care That last point leaves them Clancy says on the horns of an insoluble dilemma On the one hand if Republicans do offer an alternative it gives their opponents and some in their own ranks something to shoot at If they fail to offer an alternative it becomes hard for their supporters to take them seriously But the health care issue has not shifted entirely in the Democrats favor either The most   found only  percent of respondents said the health law should be left as it is while  percent said they want it repealed and replaced and  percent favored repeal without replacement But as in most polls the largest plurality  percent want the law fixed A poll by Politico in the    those where control of Congress will be decided  found more opposition to the Affordable Care Act Close to half of those responding said they supported repealing the law But again a slim majority want to keep the law with  percent saying it should stay as it is and  percent saying it should be tweaked Results likes led at least some embattled Senate Democrats to try to turn the tables on their Republican opponents using their states failure to expand the Medicaid program against them In North Carolina for example Sen Kay Hagan is firing back at her newly minted GOP challenger   who led the charge in that state not to expand Medicaid in  As a result about  people who would have qualified for coverage through Medicaid are now not able to do so she said last week at a confirmation hearing for Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services In Louisiana Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu is also making Medicaid expansion a major part of her campaign including   that would let voters decide whether to let more people onto the program So far that fight has   Thats necessary in part because Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal seen by many as a possible GOP candidate for president in  remains outspoken  and out front  in calling for repeal of the entire Affordable Care Act The country that won two world wars and put a man on the moon cannot it is believed repeal a disastrous public policy Jindal wrote in a   Says who Why not But finding a single alternative could be a near impossible task Clancy pointed out in a lengthy   called Why the GOP is headed for an Obamcare crackup The problem in a nutshell he says is that Republicans are fundamentally divided between promarket and probusiness factions when it comes to health care While they are rhetorically promarket he explains they are often functionally probusiness They talk about patients but they worry about insurers The special interests  doctors hospitals insurance companies  have a huge influence over both political parties And that makes it difficult for Republicans to come together over truly propatient reforms
