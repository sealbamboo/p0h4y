Last October Jeanette Mariani was an independent yearold living alone in Dallas and getting around with a walker Then one night she switched off the light and tried to make her way into bed A chair was in the way And she fell There I was lying on the floor she recalled I pulled down one of my pillows I didnt reach very high just pulled it down put my head down on it and thought Well Ill wait until morning  The next day she called for help A fall from a chair or a bed may not seem like a death sentence  but for an older person it can be Falls are the   of death from an injury for older Americans For women its especially bad   of those with hip fractures are women For many the broken hip starts a chain reaction  usually because older people also suffer from underlying conditions such as diabetes arthritis hypertension or dementia Every moment counts after a fall says   an assistant professor of geriatrics at the   in Fort Worth When youre bedridden or hospitalized your odds of developing everything from bed sores to pneumonia increase dramatically Studies show that delaying surgery after a fracture for just  hours increases the chance of complications and death The most common scenario is they die of pneumonia after a hip fracture Moss says After spending the night on the floor Jeannette Mariani called her daughter Janet who took her to the hospital After her fall I knew that she was going to decline Janet said You had that sixth sense you know That sixth sense is backed up by real numbers Almost  out of  people over the age of  will die within a month of surgery for a broken hip That rises to   if the patient already has an acute medical problem Jeanette worked hard in rehab to become stronger but underlying health problems caught up with her Previous lung problems got worse and her lymphoma returned After she left the hospital she died within a month Janet said More than  percent of hip fractures are caused by falls But falls can be   Commonsense steps like removing rugs installing better lighting and getting an updated prescription for your glasses are a good start So is addressing the physical and psychological side to falls It might sound silly but it turns out that people who are afraid of falling are actually more likely to fall Nine years ago Joyce Powell was in hospital on her way to the bathroom when she fell and broke her hip She recovered but she hasnt gotten over the fear of falling It stays with you says Powell who is  and lives in Arlington Texas Youre aware that you cant function like you once did Thats why Powell attends a fallprevention class at the University of Texas Arlington  not just to get stronger but also to face her demons Participants are in their s s and s and their workouts involve everything from balancing on exercise balls to playing Wii games The greatest predictor of a future fall is a previous fall says   director of the Center for Healthy Living and Longevity at UTArlington The greatest risk for older people whove fallen is that theyll simply stop exercising Ray says One of the keys to preventing a fall is improving balance As we age Ray says natural changes make it hard to stay upright changes in hearing vision and proprioception  the awareness of where ones body is in space If seniors can learn to use these senses better they will be less likely to fall To help them learn Ray tests them using something that looks like a photo booth at an amusement park The machine assesses how well someone can use the senses to maintain balance The walls shift the screen changes and the floor tilts In daily life when we see seniors who fall its usually during multitasking Ray explains We pipe in loud noises city sound or music pipe in visual distractors on the screen or a test on the screen as theyre trying to maintain their postural control while the walls are moving in concert The goal Ray explains is to identify the best intervention for each individual For some a regimen of tai chi might be enough For others it might be weightlifting or even practicing walking with their eyes closed For Joyce Powell the exercise classes have made her more confident in getting around and traveling Still shes cautious When I walk I look to see where I am particularly if Im on uneven ground she says Freedom from falls is never guaranteed But dedication to an exercise program can help seniors keep their balance without giving up the activities they love Its one of the things Ive learned you just have to do in order to protect yourself to remain upright Powell says I guess I could use a walker to do it but I dont want to I want to be free
