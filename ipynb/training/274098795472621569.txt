Whenever the discussion turns to saving money in Medicare the idea of raising the eligibility age often comes up I dont think you can look at entitlement reform without adjusting the age for retirement Sen Lindsey Graham RSC said on   last Sunday Let it float up another year or so over the next  years adjust Medicare from  to  Its hardly surprising that the idea keeps finding its way into the conversation That same increase is already being   Even President Obama reportedly   during his informal negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner during the summer of  And why not Its clear that it would reduce federal spending and it can do so in a very immediate sense depending on how its phased in says Tricia Neuman senior vice president of the nonpartisan   and director of its Medicare Policy Project However while federal spending will go down costs to others will go up In fact total spending will rise Hows that Like everything in health care its a little bit complicated But the bottom line is that if you lower costs for one group you almost always raise them for another Lets focus on those  and yearolds In Medicare theyre currently the youngest and healthiest people So by delaying their entry into the program says Neuman you raise costs for everyone else already there The result would be that people on Medicare pay higher premiums she said Thats because youre taking the healthiest people out of the Medicare risk pool leaving sicker people to pay higher premiums At the same time those same  and yearolds would be the oldest and likely among the sickest people remaining in the insurance pools of the workingage population particularly in the new   That means that they are raising the average risk of people in the exchanges so that younger people in the exchanges everybody in the exchanges will see premiums rise but especially so for those who are younger Neuman says Thats because under the federal health law for the first time insurance companies   for the same insurance coverage Topher Spiro head of health policy at the liberal think tank   says its one more reason not to change Medicares eligibility age at least not right now We think its the absolute wrong approach when youre first implementing health care reform Spiro said To be clear raising Medicares eligibility age would save money for the halftrilliondollarayear Medicare program  and for the federal government as a whole The   estimates that Medicare spending would drop by about  percent a year And at the same time federal tax revenues would increase slightly because some of those  and yearolds would remain in the workforce and continue to pay taxes But overall according to a separate   the savings to the federal government would be more than offset by additional costs to states individuals and employers  about  billion more in  alone This is a very good example of how something that seems very straightforward in terms of reducing federal spending actually is a very direct way of shifting costs to other payers Neuman says And how nothing in health care is ever as straightforward as it might seem
