This is not the first time that Ive devoted a week of recipes to pesto genovese  basil pesto But it is the first time that I can vouch for a basil pesto that retains a gorgeous green color Ive been forever flummoxed by the color problem with pesto the way it goes from bright green to olive drab so quickly Ive tried this and that  been told about citric acid covering the pesto with olive oil or even lemon juice which makes little sense to me because acid usually turns bright green olive Anyway I read up on the problem this week and decided to try blanching the leaves  It worked I blanched them for five seconds and that was enough I was nervous about losing the vivid flavor that we love in pesto and yes a bit of that is sacrificed Thats why I blanch the leaves for only five seconds But my friends who tasted this weeks recipes had no doubt  that they were eating pesto and that it was delicious I kept each batch in the refrigerator without the garlic and cheese added for at least a couple of days and none of them faded Im thrilled with this  development Another bonus  is that the mix breaks down to a pure in the food processor rather than the finely chopped mix you get with raw leaves And if you  want to make the whole thing in a mortar and pestle it wont take quite as much elbow grease This means pesto is a quick sauce to throw together and youll be glad of that if youre wondering what to do with all that  basil that is still in your summer garden
