The American school lunch long the butt of schoolyard jokes is in for a nutritional makeover fueled by concern over a national epidemic of childhood obesity and funded by the first hike in federal contributions in three decades Starting next school year US schoolchildren will see changes in school lunch programs that are expected to bring fruits   vegetables more whole grains and potentially smaller portions to every meal served in the nations schools and at nonprofit childcare centers    Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined by First Lady Michelle Obama on Wednesday unveiled a platter of new federal standards for the lunch program which feeds roughly  million children each school day The updated school lunch standards are expected to spell the end of   ushering in offerings such as whole wheat pasta fresh cantaloupe grilled chicken and chef salads    Fridays mainstay  cheese pizza with tater tots and canned fruit  would get a major overhaul according to a sample menu released Wednesday In its new incarnation Fridays pizza would have whole wheat crust those tater tots would make way for baked sweet potato fries and pineapple in sugary fruit syrup would be replaced by grape tomatoes served with lowfat ranch dip Meals would come only with nonfat milk which can be flavored or with unflavored lowfat  milk See a beforeandafter meal plan      As parents we try to prepare decent meals limit how much junk food our kids eat and ensure they have a reasonable balanced diet said Obama on Wednesday at Parklawn Elementary School in Alexandria Va where she and Vilsack announced the changes to the school lunch program And when were putting in all that effort the last thing we want is for all our hard work to be undone each day in the school cafeteria When we send our kids to school we expect that they wont be eating the kind of fatty salty sugary foods that we try to keep them from eating at home    Schools are expected to phase in changes to their menus over the next three years starting with the  school year Vilsack said Next year the  public and nonprofit private schools that participate in the program will be expected to focus on making changes to lunch menus with fixes to breakfast and snack offerings coming later    The changes are expected to cost  billion over the next five years and come with a hike in federal contributions to the program Under the Healthy HungerFree Kids Act of  the federal government will contribute an additional  cents to each meal served under the program Currently the federal government  schools up to  for meals provided free of charge to students from lowincome households    Under the  the federal government is expected to help school systems find ways to access more fresh fruit and vegetables for schoolchildren and will require schools across the country to banish snack foods and beverages that do not meet healthy dietary standards    The  formerly the American Dietetic Assn praised the new guidelines and promised it would help lead creative collaborations to help cashstrapped school systems meet the new standards The new guidelines also won praise from the American Academy of Pediatrics which said in a statement that they will undoubtedly make significant improvements in the health of all our nations children    The pediatricians group acknowledged that Obamas stated objective of reversing the nations obesity crisis among children in a single generation wont be easy But the new guidelines will make great strides toward achieving that goal the group said    Under the   issued Wednesday school lunches for children in kindergarten through fifth grade must provide at least  calories but not more than  Students in sixth through eighth grades must be offered lunches between  and  calories and those in grades nine through  are to get lunches totaling between  and  calories Guidelines that have been in place specify only the minimum calories that must be offered in school lunches the newly drafted guidelines generally top out near or in some cases below the calorie counts required by current policy    Some of the new guidelines do not break new ground  no more than  of school lunch calories should come from saturated fat for instance But the new guidelines set new limits on sodium as early as the  academic year and over the following  years cut those limits almost in half The guidelines also set weekly requirements for the amounts of dark green vegetables redorange vegetables legumes and starchy vegetables that students must be offered    Those guidelines already have largely been embraced by the Los Angeles Unified School District which over recent years has implemented sweeping changes to improve its nutritional offerings David Binkle deputy director of food services for LAUSD called it exciting because the rest of the country is going to come up to the standards of LA Unified But Binkle also noted that such changes are neither cheap nor readily embraced by students to whom many new menu items  including sushi hummus and quinoa salad  are unfamiliar    LAUSDs purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables has risen from  million in  to  million last year and continues to rise Binkle said With such a costly undertaking he added the federal governments cent increase in schoollunch reimbursement certainly is a help Binkle said but its never enough At the same time Binkle said the district would have liked more flexibility to offer some children smaller meals more in line with their small appetites which he said would result in less waste
