After a year hiatus malaria is returning to Greece Some  cases have been reported there this year and at least  people appear to have been infected in the country The others picked up the disease elsewhere Thats a concern for health workers because it means malaria may now be endemic to Greece  and not just hitching a ride with travelers Plus the parasite is showing up in regions where it has never been reported the US Centers of Disease and Prevention said in a   last week Whats fueling malarias comeback Budget cuts have been tough on Greeces   causing medication shortages and a   in HIV cases over the past year Cuts to public health spending could also be contributing to malarias reappearance says   who directs Doctors Without Borders operations in Greece The majority of municipalities around Athens did not have enough funds to spray for mosquitoes this year Veizis tells Shots Thats why West Nile Virus appeared in the summer Bednets have not been readily available either But Veizis thinks theres more to the malaria story than just budget cuts alone Its a combination of factors that make Greece more vulnerable to the reestablishment of malaria he says Warmer winters may be lengthening the malaria season for one Greece fought hard in the s and s to snuff out the disease and by  the country was declared malariafree For decades Greece had only sporadic cases of malaria each year Then a big cluster of cases   in southern Greece in  when  people were infected locally This spike prompted Doctors Without Borders to set up shop in the Sparta region where theyve been helping local authorities get ahead of the parasite since early  Veizis says theyve been passing out insect repellents educating communities about malaria prevention and treating people as early as possible Early treatment can allow you to have less spread of the disease he says Theyve even distributed microscopes to help identify the parasite and diagnose the disease The extra efforts seem to be working I see a light in the tunnel he tells Shots The interventions they did this year in collaboration with authorities had a very positive impact on the number cases in the area Doctors Without Borders treats more than a million people each year for malaria So this outbreak in Greece is only small blip on their radar Nevertheless when a disease reappears after being gone so long Veizis says it can catch a struggling country off guard  especially when resources are already stretched thin
