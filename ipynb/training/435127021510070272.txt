As fluwatchers like to say you can always count on influenza virus to surprise The   is that scientists have apparently been wrong about where new flu viruses come from The dogma is that they always incubate in wild migratory birds then get into domestic poultry and then jump into mammals  especially pigs and humans If novel flu viruses acquire the ability to transmit readily in humans  boom  youve got a pandemic on your hands And if a pandemic virus is particularly lethal like the   that has made public health people anxious for the past  years it could be a global catastrophe But evolutionary biologist   and his colleagues say that wildbird scenario does not describe the true origin of the flu viruses that have troubled the world over the past  years Instead the flu viruses circulating globally since the early s are all closely related to those that infect an animal we dont associate with influenza these days the horse Worobey of the University of Arizona has reanalyzed  flu virus genomes with a new set of assumptions about how these viruses mutate at widely different rates when they infect different species His team found there was a global sweep in the midth century that replaced six of the flu viruses eight genes  the internal genes that code for proteins other than the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase markers found on the viruses surface Theres intriguing evidence that the ancestor of modern flu viruses first appeared in horses  and not that long ago in evolutionary terms Its introduction is marked by an   that began near Toronto in late  quickly devastated horse populations all over North America Horsepower was essential in this preinternalcombustionengine era so there were lots of horses around And so many horses died of the flu that mail delivery broke down the price of coal soared because it couldnt be delivered the US cavalry had to fight Apaches on foot and a fire destroyed half of Boston because teams of young men drafted to pull the pumping trucks couldnt respond fast enough At the same time a flulike disease was killing chickens ducks geese and turkeys This was a halfdozen years before scientists discovered highpathogenic influenza in birds Worobey says its now clear the horse flu and bird flu of the s were linked Thats what the genomic analysis shows and it jibes with historical evidence There were lots of newspaper articles about this horse flu jumping into birds Worobey tells Shots They called it henfluenza So theres this tantalizing suggestion of a relationship between this horse flu lineage and the genetic diversity that has reshaped and revolutionized modern avian influenza populations The new analysis published online Sunday in   doesnt determine whether the new flu jumped from horses into poultry or the other way around Chickens could have picked it up by roosting in barns with sick horses or viceversa But in either case its clear that once established in domestic birds it spread to wild birds  ultimately to the world over Moreover that svintage virus contributed most of its genes to the HN flu virus that caused the devastating pandemic in  which   around the globe The new analysis also establishes for the first time that the  flu originated in the Western Hemisphere and probably in North America Although its widely known as the Spanish Flu the first known cases were among Army recruits in Kansas Because Spain was a noncombatant in World War I its news media were not censored the way other nations were so early news reports of the terrible new flu emanated from Spain We show that the  virus got most of its genes from the lineage of bird flu that became established in the Western Hemisphere after the emergence of the horse flu in  Worobey says You can see this virus was in Western Hemisphere birds just a few years before  These insights were possible because Worobeys team used a different molecular clock to calculate the timing of viral mutations in different species Before now scientists used an average rate of mutation for all species even though they knew that the rate differed from one species to another You cant assume an average rate he says You have to allow the clock to tick at its own rate for each species It seems like a very subtle thing but the effect on data is not subtle at all This takes totally confusing and conflicting histories across the eight flu genes and snaps them into focus like the knob on a microscope Worobey thinks the new method of tracking the evolution of flu viruses will change the way scientists think about these important viruses I think this paper does help us learn more about the playbook of flu he says Pablo Murcia of the University of Glasgow who was not involved in the new research agrees He says the findings underscore the importance of monitoring poultry and swine which have replaced horses as primary reservoirs for the emergence of flu viruses especially since modern farming operations concentrate these animals in such huge numbers We have to be careful about the ecological conditions we create Murcia tells Shots as this could result in pathogens going into wild animals and then in the end nature will throw them back to us
