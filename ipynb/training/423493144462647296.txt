Ultrarunners are different from you and me They run more But a new study of these racers who compete in events longer than marathons joins other recent science in finding that they also tend to be older and have some different health concerns than most of us might expect suggesting that some beliefs about how much activity the human body can manage especially in middle age may be too narrow   In recent years the health effects of increasing inactivity have received plenty of scientific and   But the potential health effects of relatively gargantuan levels of physical activity have received less attention and much of the science that does exist focuses on the potential dangers of overexercise for the heart Few studies have examined the more general health implications  the benefits as well as the risks  of training for and running more miles in a day than many of us complete in a month  Hoping to better understand what happens to an ultraendurance athletes body researchers at Stanford University and the University of California Davis recently contacted more than  experienced ultramarathon runners and asked them probing and almost impolite questions about the past and current states of their bones hearts blood pressures prostates breasts skin lungs moods bowels eyes waistlines livers and many other body parts and systems They also asked about their race histories times training regimens and any recent injuries and illnesses  Then they compared the ultrarunners aggregate answers with comparable health statistics for average more sedentary adults while also comparing the training and injuryrelated data with similar information about recreational runners like myself who are not running  or mile races on the weekend  The results   were telling The ultrarunners had a low although not nonexistent incidence of high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats with about  percent of the runners reporting one of those problems But less than  percent had been diagnosed with heart disease or had a past stroke and few had experienced cancer with basal cell skin carcinoma being the most common malignancy occurring in  percent of the runners Those percentages are generally lower than among agematched American adults especially considering that a majority of the ultrarunners were aged  or older On a less salutary note the runners did report a high incidence of breathing problems with almost a third of the group telling researchers that they experienced either allergies or asthma often after running That finding while worrying makes sense the researchers note since ultralongdistance runners spend many hours outside striding along trails strewn with pollenslinging trees and flowers priming their respiratory systems for allergies and asthma  They also tend to get hurt as runners at all mileage levels do More than half said that they had experienced a runningrelated injury in the past year that had been severe enough to keep them from training for at least a few days about the same percentage as often is reported by recreational runners Many of the injuries were knee problems or stress fractures along with a few unexpected concussions I once slipped during a trail run and thwacked my head into a tree trunk so it can happen  Interestingly injuries were most common among younger inexperienced ultrarunners and in particular among men not yet aged  who trained fast and intensely Ultrarunners past age  whose training pace was more plodding were far less likely to be sidelined with injuries That finding jibes with other rather beguiling   which finds that on average their permile race and training paces are much slower than for marathon runners perhaps explaining why the fastestgrowing age groups in most ultramarathon fields are those for racers aged between  and  who as many of us would admit are no longer as fast as we once were but can it seems just keep going  And there can be substantial accruing benefits to covering those miles says Dr Eswar Krishnan an assistant professor at Stanford and coauthor of the new study Over all the ultrarunners in the study were absent from work less often than other American adults because of illness or injury he said and rarely felt compelled to see a physician with almost half visiting a doctor only once in the past year usually because of a running injury  Of course the ultracompetitors may have developed stoicism from their many hours of training Dr Krishnan said and ignored niggling ills that would keep the rest of us from work or send us hurrying to the doctor But they also displayed a substantially reduced risk of developing many of the common diseases of modern life  Which does not mean that the rest of us should abruptly revise our exercise resolutions upward and start training for a miler said Dr Krishnan who himself runs fivekilometer races and has no plans he said to go longer The real lesson is to stay the course with exercise he said whatever that means for you and even as you age and slow
