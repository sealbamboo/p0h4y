Good morning, everyone, and how are you today?  Clouds are hovering over the Pharmalot campus, but our spirits remain sunny. After all, who can forget what the Morning Mayor would say – ‘Every brand new day should be unwrapped like a precious gift.’ Sage advice is always welcome here. So while you tug on the ribbon, we will brew another cup of needed stimulation – we are back to Blueberry Cobbler – and get on with things. And so, here are some fresh tidbits. Hope your day is smashing and do stay in touch…. For the third time in two years, the FDA has approved a diet pill – the latest is Contrave, which will be sold by Orexigen Therapeutics and Takeda Pharmaceutical; In a letter sent to Allergan directors, Pershing Square’s William Ackman wrote that rebuffing the bid that he and Valeant Pharmaceuticals have made for the Botox drug maker has wasted company resources and are a professional embarrassment to the directors; and the first person to face criminal charges linked to a 2012 U.S. meningitis outbreak that killed 64 people across the country is due in court today to respond to claims he knowingly shipped tainted medication.
