Ive been livetweeting The Bachelor There I said it To a lot of people including my inner circle of friends my penchant for reality dating programming and my willingness to document it in real time makes me exceedingly nerdy In fact I suspect that some of my closest buddies hang out with me despite the fact that I like The Bachelor But thanks to Twitter even though I might be sitting on my couch by myself searching for the shows hash tag and hitting refresh means I never watch an episode solo Until the recent season finale on any given Monday gardenvariety Bachelor fans and funny women and some men with huge followings such as bestselling author Jennifer Weiner were gathered together on Twitter in a Cheerstype atmosphere  complete with inside jokes and oneliners  to mock the plot twists and talk with one another about how we really felt about this seasons object of affection Ive actually started to crave the community that comes from chatting with Bachelor fans each week  and feel validated that Im not the only one who sees the show as patently absurd yet wildly entertaining The communion feels for lack of a better term real Obviously The Bachelors is only one Internet community that has facilitated a shared experience  and potential reallife friendships Pick an interest and in the time it takes to type a hash tag or post a comment on a blog you can find people who share it whether its something like running parenting or managing diabetes With half a billion registered Twitter handles and counting were reaching out to total strangers and sharing details about our interests and lives with them in a way thats sometimes more intimate than the way we talk with our closest friends From an anthropological standpoint is that weird Fundamentally human beings are driven to connect says Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research CenterÂ and instructor of media psychology in the UCLA Extension program Biologically were wired to have an affinity toward people who are like us When you have an emotional engagement with something that someone else does  it actually triggers reward centers in our brain that were part of something Even though it seems like were putting the friendship cart before the horse metaphorically speaking what were really doing is fasttracking friendships Rutledge says much like weve souped up everything else in our modern lives Were maybe not evolving but were accelerating says Rutledge who says that she livetweeted the finale of Lost In a way it allows you to get to the substance before you get to the package Youre able to set aside the external trappings and connect with someone on an internal emotional level about something that is appealing to you Its a great way to make friends because youre focused on The Bachelor youre not worried about how youre presenting to this person or how theyre presenting to you So it allows you to be a little less posturing a little more authentic In last years book Alone Together author and MIT professor Sherry Turkle argued that isolating ourselves in a room bathed in a laptops glow can be destructive With the aid of Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts weve invented ways of being with people that turn them into something close to objects she wrote But social media researcher Barry Wellman a professor of sociology at the University of Toronto says the Internet has merely taken our preWeb relationships both farflung and near and multiplied them The Internet is reinforcing and expanding a pattern that already existed says Wellman who says hes gone on to meet a few of his Twitter contacts in person Thats not to say that face time is pass In fact its the gold standard for gaining the maximum possible amount of information about another person Wellman says However its impossible to stay in constant facetoface contact with connections around the country or the world What we can do he says is fill in the gaps by meeting up in person  meaning getting together with your best Twitter friend or your most trusted blogcommenter confidant is often a good idea Yes there are many people who are still cautious about online communities Its understandable says social media researcher Anatoliy Gruzd professor of information management at Nova Scotias Dalhousie University For many people who are not part of those communities its still foreign How can you have a meaningful relationship online Or on Twitter It will take probably years and years for that to go away For those skeptics lets not forget that previous methods of communication were not always as wonderful as we remember Its amazing how we have this sort of memory of the past of being all beautiful says Helen Fisher research professor of anthropology at Rutgers University How sitting in a little frontier log cabin with someone you cannot stand  and utterly no resources to tweet and find somebody you   stand  is somehow romantic Adds Fisher I just finished David Copperfield about a year ago and David Copperfield  now this was in the middle of the s when that was written  he was sending notes to his sweetheart every three hours People were using all sorts of social connections Its just become easier
