One of the biggest mistakes newbie runners make is doing too much too soon Picking up a new hobby like running is no doubt exciting but novice runners need to ease into the sport by building up a mileage base before increasing the distance intensity and frequency of their runs Slowly easing into a training program will help reduce the risk of injury so you can continue on with your new running routine Many experts suggest increasing your mileage by no more than  each week  Beginners might think they need to run every day or nearly every day to meet their fitness or weightloss goals but this couldnt be further from the truth Running is a highimpact activity which can be really hard on your body especially for novice runners whose muscles and bones havent yet been conditioned for such intense exercise So its important to give your body ample rest between workouts Follow a training plan that includes rest days While it may be true that you dont need expensive equipment to take up running its important that you wear proper gear for your workouts The most important piece of equipment for running is a good pair of running shoes so be sure to do some research before you purchase a pair Visit a running specialty store and ask an employee to fit you for a shoe They will analyze your gait and then recommend a few options in your budget Also essential A supportive sports bra When newbies take up running they typically dive head first into their training with run after run Running definitely makes you a better runner but not if your regular exercise routine lacks variety in the form of crosstraining Its important to mix up your workouts so youre not always using the same muscles which can put you at risk for overuse injuries and ultimately derail your efforts Running can be uncomfortable at times especially for new runners That feeling is all part of becoming a better runner but pain is a different story altogether If something hurts when you run you need to stop and treat the pain Remember It doesnt make you less of a runner if you listen to your body to keep it healthy Dont run through pain unless you want to end up on the sidelines When youre just starting out with running its tough not to compare yourself to others Youre excited about running so youre probably reading running blogs magazines and message boards where you might start to feel inadequate about your own mileage or running pace Instead of getting down on yourself remember that every runner was once a beginner and use their success as motivation
