If you're intrigued by the idea of using simple ingredients mostly found in your garden or kitchen to help care for your hair and skin, there are a number of books that offer guidance — among them, Annie Strole's "Homemade Beauty: 150 Simple Beauty Recipes Made From All-Natural Ingredients.". As a student learning to be a makeup artist, Strole eventually began questioning the products she was using. She began researching and eventually got busy in her kitchen. Here are two of her recipes.. This homemade deodorant soothes and hydrates while keeping unpleasant fragrances at bay.. In a bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons unrefined virgin coconut oil, 2 tablespoons raw shea butter, 1/4 cup baking soda and 1/4 cup arrowroot powder or cornstarch. Store the cream in a small, airtight container. To use, rub a small amount onto clean, dry skin.. "The moment I notice any flaking on my scalp," Strole writes, "I pop the treatment on and my crown is in the clear for weeks! This recipe makes one treatment, but you can mix up a big batch and store it in a cool dry place.". You'll need 4 tablespoons unrefined virgin coconut oil. If it's solidified, melt the coconut oil for 15 seconds in the microwave or in a small saucepan set over low heat. Add in 20 drops tea tree essential oil until thoroughly blended. Apply the mixture on your scalp (with dry hair) and massage for one to two minutes. Let it sit for at least two hours. You can even put your hair in a plastic shower cap or wrap it in plastic wrap and leave it overnight.. To remove, rinse thoroughly, shampoo (you may have to lather up to three times to get all of the oil out) and condition with a lightweight conditioner.
