Federal health officials plan to launch their first large-scale campaign aimed at preventing or reducing tobacco use by teenagers.. The U.S. . , which was given the power to regulate the tobacco industry in 2009, will start its “The Real Cost” advertising campaign on Feb. 11 with a slew of sometimes graphic television, radio, online  and print advertisements.  A government website, “TheRealCost.gov” is already operational.  The ads will run in 200 media markets for at least a year. The $115 million campaign is funded by user fees the tobacco industry pays to FDA.
