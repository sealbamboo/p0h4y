Controversial plans to overhaul emergency medical care have been put on hold after   bosses were warned that downsizing AE units would create a huge backlash NHS England has delayed its plans following claims by insiders that concentrating specialist services into just  hospitals would represent political suicide so close to the general election The plan to streamline the role of AE units across England was outlined last November by its medical director Sir Bruce Keogh He said the move was needed to save lives and it was an illusion that all AEs are equally able to deal with anything that comes through their doors Up to  AEs were to be designated as major emergency centres to look after the most critically ill patients  victims of strokes heart attacks or trauma  leaving the rest of the  AEs to deal with the less seriously ill But an insider involved in the process said All his talk about reconfiguring emergency departments abut splitting them into supercentres and other ones has died a death Keogh said advances in medical science meant that a minority of hospitals needed to have the specialist doctors and equipment required to maximise the chance of saving patients facing lifethreatening illnesses The first systematic review of emergency care since the s was necessary he claimed because the ageing population was changing the nature of the illnesses AE units were expected to tackle The review should be accompanied by an honest debate about how to improve emergency care he added Emphasising that the future vision of AE care had been drawn up by doctors seeking the best outcomes for patients Keogh said There will be between  and  major emergency centres but they will be connected as part of a network to smaller emergency centres who will still be receiving the majority of ambulances By passing patients with acute conditions on to the specialist centres we can decongest smaller AE units so they have more capacity Jeremy Hunt the health secretary said that ministers would back the implementation of Keoghs review Reorganising AE services which the public value dearly would show the coalition was a government that is prepared to face up to the difficult decisions Hunt said But the planned shakeup is not mentioned in a page document setting out the most recent update on the planned transformation of urgent and emergency care services which NHS England circulated in August but did not publicise It says that the reviews report last November recognised the appetite for change but emphasised that there will be no risky big bangs Insiders involved in the review say NHS England has been warned that introducing what amounts to a twotier AE system will prompt opposition including from MPs and councillors in areas where the local hospital could be seen as being downgraded if it did not become one of the  major emergency centres Chief executives of major NHS hospital trusts privately expressed their opposition with some concerned that it could lead to a loss of vital income Keoghs denial last year as categorically not true that the smaller AE units would be allowed to wither on the vine did not allay fears that some would ultimately close The College of Emergency Medicine which represents AE doctors said it never believed that the massive centralisation of services was justified clinically Dr Cliff Mann its president said In my view the urgent and emergency care review started from an erroneous premise that the system that has been applied with some success to the treatment of heart attack stroke and major trauma could be applied to many more conditions and hence regionalisation of major centres was a likely outcome It has become evident from evidence submitted to the review that fewer than  of AE attendances might derive any benefit from such a reconfiguration Importantly such a system works well only for severe conditions requiring very specialist services where the diagnosis can be made before the patient even reaches hospital It is easy to spot when someone has been hit by a bus fairly easy to spot the classic signs of a stroke and all ambulances carry machines capable of diagnosing an acute heart attack Meanwhile the Care Quality Commission says it has found problems in about half of all AE units it has inspected The most common problems the NHS care watchdog found were understaffing ambulances waiting a long time outside the AE unit because patient flow through the hospital is slow delays to patients undergoing diagnostic tests such as xrays and MRI scans and management of medicines Prof Sir Mike Richards the CQCs chief inspector of hospitals said the high number of AEs classed as inadequate or requires improvement was partly because inspectors using the regulators more inquisitive new approach had prioritised visiting hospitals where there was concern Despite the prevalence of poor care the AE units at Frimley Park hospital in Surrey and the Homerton hospital in east London were both found to be outstanding Richards said Prof Keith Willett NHS Englands director for acute episodes of caresaid There is absolutely no question of slowing down on the review It is a central part of the NHS fiveyear forward view and the pace is about to accelerate Sorting out the urgent care system is one of the most important priorities for the public and for the NHS The heavy lifting starts in  which will include the formation of urgent care networks to include all hospitals with AE departments across England We expect networks to identify the  emergency centres which have specialist services  This article was amended on  December to include Willetts comments on the emergency care review
