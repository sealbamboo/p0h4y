The first Ebola death on US soil has stunned and saddened doctors and relatives  and now it has people asking if the risk has changed for anyone else Thomas Eric Duncan   at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas a sobering death after three other patients were cured Their doctors said they hoped quick treatment and good supportive care helped them recover Duncans death raises questions about that but it doesnt change the risk for the  people who were in   with him while he was sick and the nearly  others who may have had some sort of contact Theyre being monitored for  days taking their temperatures twice a day and being closely questioned by health workers to make sure they dont get sick The doctors nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways Dr David Lakey commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement Well continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat Although Duncan died it doesnt mean he was   before he died however and it doesnt mean that people who were not considered at high risk before are at any higher risk now The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and doctors who have treated Ebola patients for decades say patients are not infectious at all before they develop symptoms that include fever vomiting and diarrhea No one who   with Duncan is at risk because he wasnt sick when he flew Those at highest risk are the health care workers who treated him when he came into the hospital and family members who were with him in the days after he became ill and before he entered the hospital The death also doesnt change the equation for two other Americans fighting Ebola  NBC freelance camera operator   being treated at the University of Nebraska medical center and an   being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta CDC officials say its entirely possible more people with Ebola will come into the US in the coming weeks and months It takes an average of  to  days to get sick after exposure to the virus so people can travel feeling perfectly healthy and become ill after arrival And CDC and the World Health Organization say all countries can expect more patients so long as Ebola continues to spread in West Africa WHO said Wednesday that  have been diagnosed with Ebola and  have died  and says this is almost certainly an underestimate CDC and Customs  Border Protection said it would add new layers of entry screening at   that most travelers from Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone New Yorks JFK International Airport WashingtonDulles Newark ChicagoOHare and Atlanta These include Travelers from Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone will be escorted by CBP to an area of the airport set aside for screening Trained CBP staff will observe them for signs of illness ask them a series of health and exposure questions and provide health information for Ebola and reminders to monitor themselves for symptoms Trained medical staff will take their temperature with a noncontact thermometer CDC said in a statement But CDC says its far more effective to screen people before they leave affected countries In the last two months since exit screening began in the three countries of  people screened  people were denied boarding a flight because of the health screening process None of the  passengers were infected with Ebola and many were diagnosed as ill with malaria a disease common in West Africa transmitted by mosquitoes and not contagious from one person to another CDC said
