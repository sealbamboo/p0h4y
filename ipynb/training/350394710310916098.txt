Jim Hindman the cofounder of car maintenance service Jiffy Lube was  when his eyesight started to fail The problem started as a tiny black dot in the center of his vision at first but the blind spot grew As the years passed Hindman now  had trouble reading and making out faces  The low point Hindman says came when his agerelated macular degeneration forced him to give up his drivers license That was I think the moment of despair Hindman told NBCs Dr Nancy Snyderman I began to get depressed I began to get angry  Agerelated macular degeneration a slowly developing condition that can make it difficult to recognize faces drive a car or read typically affects people in their s and older As baby boomers age  and as lifespans continue to increase  the numbers of people are expected to surge The worst part for Hindman was learning there was no way to stop the deterioration While there are some therapies for the wet form of macular degeneration  a more advanced severe condition  treatments for the dry form which afflicts Hindman and millions of other Americans have been mostly limited to magnifying glasses That wasnt enough for Hindman a college coach and a racehorse owner He found doctors at the   who have been helping patients see better with a tiny device that can be surgically implanted in the eye  The device was given Food and Drug Administration approval and is now covered by Medicare For those paying out of pocket the cost of the device is  not including surgery or rehabilitation  When people develop macular degeneration they lose their central vision as the middle part of the retina becomes increasingly scarred over Because the surrounding areas are unscathed their peripheral vision survives So they are able to see whats beside them but not whats in front of them  At the institute doctors implanted a miniature telescope behind the iris of Hindmans left eye The device magnifies whats in front of Hindman and projects it back onto the parts of his retina that havent been destroyed by the disease  The advantages of the telescope are that people can see detail much more clearly  peoples faces television looking out into the world says Dr Judith E Goldstein an assistant professor of ophthalmology and chief of low vision services at the Wilmer Eye Institute  Still the device is not a panacea Its important that patients know that this device is not going to allow them to drive says Dr Oliver D Schein a professor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute Its not going to let them read small print But it may take someone who has had to give up reading entirely and get them to the point where they can read large print Beyond that the device requires months of therapy Its implanted in only one eye because it takes away peripheral vision As a result patients need therapy to help rewire their brains to use one eye to see directly in front of them and the other to see everything else  The rehab isnt for the faint hearted The therapy at first was very exhausting Hindman said I can remember at the end of a two hour session just getting in the back seat of the car and going to sleep But Hindman says it was all worthwhile  I hate to use the word miraculous he says But it has been miraculous The change in my psychological outlook on life was dramatic And while he knows that the telescope is not a cure it is allowing him to once again to actually see the things he loves including the beautiful Thoroughbreds dotting his pastures
