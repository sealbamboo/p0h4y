At the end of yoga sessions for cancer patients we are told to say to ourselves I am whole healed and healthy in this and every moment Perversely since in yoga we express aspirations as if they were already so the sentence reminds me of people who congratulate me on being cancer free  Stable disease often goes unrecognized  Perhaps the concept of chronic cancer has been hard to comprehend because public discussion tends to focus on the initial diagnosis of breast cancer Early detection of breast cancer yields good survival rates and many patients can consider themselves cured Often we assume a clearcut partition between survivors and the terminally ill       In her book Cancer Made Me a Shallower Person A Memoir in Comics Miriam Engelberg divides a circle into two uneven segments to illustrate a divide in the breast cancer community The larger part of the circle is labeled Primary Diagnosis Only and a cartoon bubble exclaims Im OK  Really The small section is labeled Gone Metastatic with the caption Damn  From the time she got her initial diagnosis in  until her death in  the same year her book was published Ms Engelberg resisted pressure to become someone nobler and more courageous than I was She followed the path of shallowness by producing a series of droll comics on the insanely cheerful chemotherapy booklets and radiation technicians she encountered She mocked her own selfabsorption trepidation and irritation as well as the social quandaries that arose as she like her cartoon surrogate plummeted from cancer survivor to terminal patient  But for some of us there is a middle stage in this journey Because of advances in cancer research and the efforts of dedicated oncologists a large population today deals with disease kept in abeyance The cancer has returned and has been controlled but it will never go away completely Like me these people cope with cancer that is treatable for some unforeseeable amount of time Chronic cancer means you will die from it  unless you are first hit by the proverbial bus  but not now not necessarily soon The word chronic resides between the category of cured and the category of terminal It refers to disease that is not spreading malignancy that can be arrested but not eradicated At times the term may seem incommensurate with repetitive and arduous regimens aimed at an eventually fatal disease For unlike diabetes or asthma cancer does not respond predictably to treatment     Still quite a few patients with some types of leukemia or lymphoma prostate or ovarian cancer live for years While in the s  percent of women with metastatic breast cancer survived five or more years today up to  percent do Chronic disease may lack the drama of diagnosis and early treatment even friends can get bored by mounting details Its evolution does not conform to the feelgood stories of recovery that most of us want to read But neither does it adhere to the frightfully degenerative plot of quickly advancing tumors On a number of websites people with chronic cancer discuss the succession of therapies in which they enlist When one drug fails another combination of drugs begins Complex dosing schedules multiple tests and hospitalizations take their toll No matter how grateful these patients are for their continuing existence it requires not the spurt of sprinters but the stamina and sometimes the loneliness of long distance runners Ms Engelbergs path of shallowness can alleviate strain especially from disabling byproducts of persistent maintenance sadness anxiety anger and then remorse about all those roiling emotions When repetitive and arduous regimens weary the spirit it may be impossible to value the preciousness of life to adopt a healthy lifestyle to visualize ones harmony with the universe to attain loving kindness to stay positive to meditate to a state of mindfulness to greet each day as a prized gift to enlist the power of now The social pressure to be upbeat can get anyone down    The shallow path enables the cartoon character Miriam to circumvent the guilt trips induced by a gaggle of past and present cancer gurus Instead of going inward she often distracts herself zoning out on Judge Judy or attaining trivia nirvana through crossword puzzles or joking about the need for a support group to cope with the jolly advice of her support group Eventually she decides to make cartooning her spiritual practice  If I am low during a yoga session if the warrior the goddess and the star feel impossibly strenuous I take the shallow path with the supine pigeon and a revision of my wonderful instructors final words I am as whole healed and healthy   in this and every moment
