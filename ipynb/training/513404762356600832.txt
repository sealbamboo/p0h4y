Here are this years winners  A pair of researchers from the University of Oslo in Norway were recognized for producing evidence that reindeer are being attacked more frequently by polar bears as climate change leaves them with less sea ice and forces them to spend more time on land That evidence involved a series of experiments comparing the reindeers reaction to humans dressed in dark hiking gear and to humans dressed up in polar bear costumes When disguised as polar bears the researchers didnt have to get nearly so close to scare the reindeer and make them run away Their   appeared in the journal Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research A recent study demonstrating that   out of your garden was just as effective as poisoning them was not among the winners  this year Im still holding out hope that it will be recognized for its contribution to environmental science someday
