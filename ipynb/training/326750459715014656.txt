Just because an overthecounter product is called a dietary supplement doesnt mean that its harmless Quite a few   have been found to include hidden and potentially risky ingredients including drugs A recent   published in   found  recalls of dietary supplements between  and  because they contained drugs that could cause serious adverse health consequences or death When it comes to regulation of supplements the FDA is more reactive  than proactive explains Dr Ziv Harel an internist at St Michaels Hospital in Toronto and lead author of the study The majority of these supplements were marketed for sexual enhancement bodybuilding or weight loss About onequarter of them were manufactured outside the US Unless supplements contain some brandnew ingredient the Food and Drug Administration   before theyre sold Theyre regulated more like foods than drugs Companies that market supplements have to assure their claims are valid and that the products are safe which include making sure theyre manufactured properly But that doesnt always happen Consuming supplements containing unknown or unapproved ingredients can be dangerous There have been many many examples of health risks associated with ingesting adulterated dietary supplements says Harel Take for instance Pai You Guo a weightloss tea which was found to contain phenolphthalein a potential carcinogen and an appetitesuppressant called sibutramine which can dangerously increase blood pressure and heart rate The product was   in  Dietary supplements are so numerous  and their chain of supply and distribution so complex  that it creates a perfect storm for things to go wrong says Harel And given that there are around  dietary supplements currently on the market Harel says that there are probably many more adulterated products out there that have yet to be identified I think the problem may indeed be much larger than weve actually demonstrated he says The FDA has made some efforts to crack down on manufacturers and to increase consumer awareness of the potential risks of using overthecounter supplements But potentially harmful supplements continue to be found on the market From a public health point of view I think its really important that an effective strategy comes into place that protects the public says Harel Scientific evidence should demonstrate that dietary supplements are safe prior to them being marketed to the population
