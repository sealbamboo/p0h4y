 On Monday the Montana Senate defeated HB  which would have mandated prison sentences and fines for physicians who provide aid in dying to terminally ill patients The vote was  to  in opposition after which the Senate also voted to indefinitely table the bill eliminating the need for a final vote on Tuesday The senators clearly listened to me and to the citizens of Montana and were openminded and I appreciate it Dr Eric Kress said after the vote  He plans to continue to provide aid in dying to terminally ill patients when he thinks its appropriate The patient who changed his thinking Dr Eric Kress told me was dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS The man had hospice care but as he wasted away and lost his ability to walk swallow and speak above a whisper he asked Dr Kress the hospice medical director for a lethal prescription he could take to end his suffering and his life In Montana where Dr Kress has practiced family medicine for  years that act had effectively become legal a few months earlier because of a  decision by the State Supreme Court An aid in dying prescription for a terminally ill but mentally competent adult who asked for it did not violate state law the court said Still Dr Kress balked The Baxter decision as its known was new and controversial and he didnt feel he had time to grasp all the legal and medical issues When he said no his patient responded with anger and tears He cursed me and called me a coward Dr Kress recalled And three weeks later hed squirreled away enough medicine to take a large dose pouring the liquid painkillers down his feeding tube The man died on his own terms leaving Dr Kress relieved for his patient but questioning his own actions Am I going to make the suffering of my patients the primary issue he asked himself Or am I just scared and fearful of whats going to happen to me Over the next three years about  patients asked for aid in dying prescriptions After extensive discussions Dr Kress who is also board certified in palliative care provided them for three terminally ill men one with ALS and two with esophageal cancer He was present when one man accompanied by his sister and several hospice staffers raised a glass of Guinness in a toast thanked the doctor for his help then drank the medication hed prepared himself and died swiftly and peacefully All of which has become common knowledge in Montana where the latest deathwithdignity battle broke out this winter and will likely be decided within days Dr Kress a yearold native Montanan elected to go public with his experiences  testifying before the state legislature writing an oped article and appearing in radio and newspaper ads  because of a bill that would criminalize his actions HB  which passed the Montana House by a to vote in February outlaws any act by a physician of purposely aiding or soliciting another person to end the persons life including prescribing a drug The consent of a victim is not a defense says the bill which includes penalties of up to  years in prison and up to a  fine That prompted Dr Kress who said he knew of several other Montana physicians who had quietly written lethal prescriptions but werent willing to say so to take a public stand I feel theyre coming after me he said of HB  backers including state legislators a local righttolife group and the organization   I dont want to wear the orange jumpsuit Besides he said Why am I going to hide and act like I did something wrong when I think I did something right The bill is scheduled to come before the Senate for a preliminary vote on Monday with a final vote on Tuesday  Even    the national deathwithdignity organization that litigated the Baxter case expects it to pass Then Gov Steve Bullock has  days to veto it or allow it to become law He has not announced his intent and it is not clear whether both houses could muster the twothirds votes needed to override a veto The Montana debate has followed similar clashes in other states most recently   in November Supporters see the ability to hasten death when patients are already close to dying and normal palliative care cannot relieve their suffering and it usually can as a matter of personal autonomy Opponents including disabilityrights groups warn about slippery slopes Making it legal to end ones life they say will encourage coercion and abuse But Montana is also different Because a court ruling rather than legislation made assisted suicide legal as in Oregon and Washington the only other states that have legalized it doctors and patients are operating without regulations governing what they can or must do Montanans Against Assisted Suicide hasnt turned to sophisticated political operatives as deathwithdignity opponents did in Massachusetts nor has it received millions from Catholic organizations said Bradley Williams  the former lumber broker who serves as its president Instead volunteers armed with petitions collected plus signatures at county fairs Compassion and Choices for its part commissioned a survey of  likely Montana voters and found that  percent believed the law should allow doctors to comply with such decisions from dying patients and  percent opposed fining or imprisoning them for such actions As for Dr Kress he hasnt yet decided how hell respond if HB  becomes law But hes been heartened by supportive letters emails and phone calls from strangers who want him to be their doctor This is a state where people really value their freedom he said  If a patient asks him for aid in dying I may want to take my chances with a jury of  Montanans He doesnt think theyll send him to jail
