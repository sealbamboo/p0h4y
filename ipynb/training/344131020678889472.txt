We might need to change the definition of a designated driver from noble abstainer to something along the lines of not as drunk as you The idea of having one person in a group agree not to drink so that everyone else can get home safely after a night of alcoholfueled fun has been promoted as a way to reduce the dangers of drunken driving especially among teenagers and young adults But when researchers put the idea to the test the results werent all that reassuring When they gave breath tests of young adults leaving a bar on Saturday night they found that  percent of the designated drivers had been drinking Almost  percent had been drinking enough to be considered impaired drivers It may be that these youthful bon vivants interpret the duties of designated driver differently than do safety advocates In Europe a designated driver is widely considered to be the less inebriated driver not an abstainer And surveys of drivers in the US have found that they think its fine for the designated driver to drink as long as her or his blood alcohol level is below the legal limit But when peoples driving skills while drinking are tested in laboratories they start getting messed up much earlier than many people think Some studies have found driving skills impaired with a blood alcohol level of  percent  much lower than the  percent thats the current legal limit across the US At  percent pretty much everyones unable to drive very well Last month the National Transportation Safety Board called for   of  percent to better reflect that fact In this study researchers at the University of Florida tested the blood alcohol levels of  people leaving bars in Gainesville on Saturday night after a Gators home football game There were  people who said they were designated drivers The breath test showed that  percent had been drinking Seventeen percent of the designated drivers had blood alcohol levels of  or below so they might be able to make the case that they were kind of safe behind the wheel But  percent had blood alcohol levels of  or higher Uhoh All of the participants were above  their average age was around  and about half of them were students The more impaired designated drivers were also more likely to binge drink and engage in dangerous drinking behavior overall The   in the July issue of the  The drinkers who werent designated drivers did have higher blood alcohol levels than the designated drivers on average if thats any consolation Bottom line The researchers write that theres a need for communications campaigns that a designated driver must be someone who abstains from drinking entirely
