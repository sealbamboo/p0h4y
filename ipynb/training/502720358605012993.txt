The Ebola outbreak has set off an alarm around the world Public health leaders say the intense concern is appropriate given the   of the outbreak and the deadliness of the virus But experts say the outbreak has also produced a lot of unfounded fears Even just the word   is kind of terrifying Why Well Hollywood has a lot to do with it Take for instance the  movie   with Dustin Hoffman and Donald Sutherland Try to remain calm Many people are dying and are going to continue to die unless we find this monkey the movies trailer says as it promises the greatest medical crisis of all time Then more recently Gwyneth Paltrows character in   spreads a deadly virus around the world in a few weeks On day one there were two people And then four and then  In three months its a billion Thats where were headed Jude Laws character says about the looming death toll in   Sound familiar Well not really There are   differences between those movies and whats happening right now with Ebola The big one is how Ebola spreads says   a virologist at Columbia University Luckily for us unlike the movies it does not spread like wildfire and in fact does not even spread the way the flu does he says Its not that easy to catch To transmit Ebola it takes way more than a sneeze or even a cough You need direct contact with an infected persons bodily fluid like their blood or vomit Another big difference is that theres absolutely no evidence the Ebola virus is mutating in a way that would suddenly make it go crazy  and start spreading like wildfire This just doesnt happen in real life Morse says If it isnt that transmissible that easily then its not suddenly going to acquire that ability and suddenly move across the entire globe the way the fictionalized outbreak has it doing he says   So our logical brains can easily understand all of those differences But still many of us are afraid of Ebola  and misinformed about it A new   from Harvard School of Public Health shows fears and misconceptions about Ebola are widespread in this country More than a quarter of people fear they or someone in their immediate family may catch Ebola And twothirds believe Ebola spreads easily Why Ebola outbreaks have all the ingredients for the dread factor says psychologist   Uncontrollability catastrophic potential fatal consequences and involuntary exposure Slovic says These are the elements that kind of go together to make up what we call the dread factor Slovic of the University of Oregon came up with the idea while trying to identify what scares us the most So how does Ebola score Ebola would be extreme on the dread factor That means Ebola is just the kind of thing that would make people overreact  big time  for instance when someone whos infected steps off a plane somewhere unannounced This fear may spark counterproductive activities Slovic says People may want the sick transported out of the community or their activities restricted Now no one is saying Ebola isnt a dangerous virus We need to take it very seriously But if people start to panic it might trigger so much turmoil that it starts to take a toll of its own It might also divert attention from the terrible human suffering already happening in West Africa  and the efforts to stop it
