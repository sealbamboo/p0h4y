Cutting back on hospital services in England  before community services are geared up to provide care  is a recipe for disaster MPs say The Health Select Committee said the NHS faced one of its greatest challenges dealing with patients with longterm conditions such as diabetes They account for  of health spending but only  of patients The NHS has tried to ensure more care is done in the community but the MPs questioned the wisdom of this strategy The crossparty group said these patients would still need specialist hospital care The MPs acknowledged doing more in the community was perhaps desirable for the patient but added it would not necessarily save the NHS money  as has been widely assumed They said it was already clear there were gaps that needed to be plugged in the community pointing to figures that showed there was a shortfall in GPs in training But they said the NHS could not simply cut back on hospital care to pay for this Instead the MPs said there needed to be greater understanding of what drove patients with longterm conditions to hospital on such a scale Figures show these patients are responsible for twothirds of outpatient and AE visits and occupy  of beds The committees report said evidence presented to them suggested that by  the NHS would need to be finding an extra bn a year to cope with the rising burden of treating people with these incurable conditions unless a more efficient way of working were found Dr Sarah Wollaston who has just replaced Stephen Dorrell as chairman of the committee said Unless we get the treatment of longterm conditions right we are going to see more and more people unable to see a doctor in their GP surgery and therefore turning up at casualty She added that the answer lay in making sure community services and social care were working together to keep people living independently The government has already set out plans to achieve this through its bn Better Care Fund which will be launched next year to encourage collaboration between the NHS and local councils But that involves bn being taken from the NHS which hospital leaders have warned is likely to hit their services hardest Bridget Turner of Diabetes UK said the NHS had to develop a clear plan  She said The health system needs to change to put people with longterm conditions including diabetes at the centre of the care they receive But Dr Martin McShane NHS Englands director of longterm conditions said a number of steps were already being taken to refocus the agenda on proactive care to keep people well and save the NHS money He cited the push to improve the coordination of care for the frailest patients which includes a new responsibility on GPs to take charge of their care Dr McShane added We do not underestimate the scale of the task Rob Webster chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents NHS trusts told BBC Breakfast that the report proved the needs of a patient in the st century have changed He said patients with longterm conditions were still being cared for with oneoff interventions by the NHS which he said needed to fundamentally change the way it looks after people We need to see the people with longterm conditions as part of the team with the carers the people who work in the general practices community service providers and to join the services up around them and that will take some time and some effort he said
