Traditional nudist groups are trying to rebrand their wrinkled public image by swapping out some of the older faces in online marketing pictures and replacing them with fresher looks Yet their numbers are shrinking as former flower children slip into senior years Since  membership in the American Association for Nude Recreation AANR has dwindled from  to  says spokesman Tom Mulhall Some say the decline may be partly because some clubs and resorts in the gray end of the movement are inept at using social media to replenish lost members But young nudists also say they dont always feel welcomed by the oldtimers at traditional clubs  and many frankly just cant afford to patronize cushy clothingoptional resorts so they stick to shedding their threads at free openair venues beaches hiking trails remote lakes small ponds  In the barest terms the two ends of the movement appear headed for now in opposite directions  Lately AANR has been working to restore its ranks by wooing somethings in big ways and small sponsoring a September young nudist leaders summit in Florida and adding a touch of youth to its promotional campaigns  If you notice AANRs Facebook page we do have some younger people on there besides older people Were trying to get more younger people to allow us to use their photos Mulhall said  Our reaching out to young people is being done in part to expand nudists rights For example this year they  Lighthouse Beach on Long Island for nude use Were saying If you want to protect nude beaches so that when youre older you can enjoy them youve got to join the movement too added Mulhall who began skinny dipping in college and today coowns a Palm Springs Calif nudist resort the Terra Cotta Inn Mulhall declined to reveal his age saying My wife and I look way younger than we really are I use our youthful looks to our marketing advantage  Still many younger naturists are hesitant to join established nudists groups  AANR was launched in   in the same way that much of the Millennial Generation is reluctant to sign up for anything organized  We dont keep a roster said Steve Vickers  cofounder of Vita Nuda a collective of nudist hubs on the west coast in the midwest and on the east coast that attract  and somethings They often organize via Twitter Were more grass roots You dont get an email blast from us Usually people are more receptive to that  In the youthful end of the movement the numbers are small but a fresh energy is building The Young Naturists and Nudists America YNA now counts about  members  double its size from last year with hundreds of additional unregistered followers said YNA cofounder Felicity Jones   We are growing while the national organizations are losing members said Jones  She uses a pen name for social postings and media interviews to avoid losing her job  a concern shared by other young nudists  But we do try to support as many established nude businesses as we can Thats why we organize some of these gatherings at clubs and resorts We dont want them to disappear Jones said Some of them are losing members For more nudist places to close up is just not good for any of us The influx of younger naturists is indeed reviving an aging movement bringing new vibe and new social networking skills Vickers agreed  I see us educating people getting them into nudism sooner said Vickers who uses his real name and lives in Kissimmee Fla Because a lot of times it happens at the Empty Nester age where theyre looking for something to do Now its Hey were college students we can go out to this private lake and sit by a bonfire  Despite a mutual interest in a sustaining a shared cause the nudebies acknowledge a rift between the generations  Some nudist clubs dont want young people Jones said The thing is theyre not attracting new people because they simply dont know how to reach the to generation Some of the clubs dont even use email Its as if the rest of the world has gone digital and the nudist world is still using floppy discs Deepening that breach Some established nudists clubs dont welcome people who wear genital piercings Jones added   We see it as going against the naturist philosophy because youre discriminating against somebody because of what they look like because they decorate their body Jones said I would ask If the penis is no more obscene than the elbow then whats the big deal  But the old and new eras of nudism will always share one swath of common ground and it has to do with what the naked lifestyle is not about sex  According to the AARN   Nudist clubs are far less sexually charged than places where bikinis thongs or other provocative clothing are worn It adds that if unwelcome advances occur such behavior should be reported to resort management after which steps will be taken to ensure it does not happen again The YNA  simply reads A party for naturists or nudists will have nothing to do with sex For somebody who has never experienced naturism it can be difficult to understand that people hang out naked without jumping on each other said Jones who lives in the New York City area What separates us from animals is we can control our behavior For me its all about body acceptance Theres so much judging that goes on based on peoples appearance she added Were trying to teach people how to be more human
