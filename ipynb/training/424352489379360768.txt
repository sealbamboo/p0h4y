New guidelines from the National Obesity Forum suggest using harder hitting antiobesity campaigns akin to antitobacco campaigns in the UK The debate about whether to treat obesity like smoking is one that has played out in the US with researchers still searching for the most effective way to improve health outcomes  As a former smoker Dan Gilmore realised the power of stark words and images in changing his behaviour Somewhere along the line people said Would you please go outside and smoke or Ive got an allergy to smoking You started to feel societal pressure says Gilmore president emeritus of the Hastings Institute a centre devoted to bioethics and public policy The inyourface smoking campaigns of the past he says effectively convinced people both that their actions bothered others and posed grave danger to themselves  When it comes to obesity he says the public has not as thoroughly been terrorised  But hes yet to find the right balance of light stigma to help motivate people without alienating them  Alienation is a big risk when it comes to antiobesity campaigns Research shows those initiatives that make people feel bad about themselves tend to backfire  Campaigns that focus primarily on body weight or the number on the scale or used hardhitting controversial approaches to get attention were messages that tended to blame or stigmatise people for their weight says Rebecca Puhl deputy director at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University Those were not found to be effective  People are more responsive to campaigns that address specific health behaviour that people can engage in regardless of their body type Indeed one exsmoker and exdieter says there is already a level of stigma around weight  People wouldnt openly sneer at me because I was a smoker but they do that because Im fat says Lesley Kinzel senior editor at XOJanecom and author of Two Whole Cakes How to Stop Dieting and Learn to Love Your Body  And yet she says its more difficult to pinpoint those who may suffer from obesityrelated illnesses than it is to identify smokers People want to associate certain behaviour with fatness but in real life fat people exhibit a wide range of different behaviour in regards to their eating habits and physical activity If youre a smoker its because you smoke cigarettes  The many complex factors surrounding obesity and the fact that obesity itself is not a behaviour but a state of being makes comparing the two types of  campaigns difficult says Scott Kahan director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness At the same time he says there are lessons to be learned from antismoking campaigns  Sometimes people fall into the trap of looking back at the antitobacco effort and say What we did was shame people into not smoking and did hardhitting campaigns of not smoking says Mr Kahan But thats not the central part of what we did with the tobacco epidemic What proved successful in the US was a complex multifaceted approach he says  Smoking was addressed from the top down and bottom up he says  On the one hand there was education  This came in the form of public awareness campaigns the surgeon generals report outlining the dangers of smoking and increased educational initiatives in schools and the work place  On the other he says were changes that created supportive environments to make it easier to not start smoking or to stop smoking he says  This included higher taxes on cigarettes restrictions on how the products could be marketed and sold and the creation of more smokefree areas such as in restaurants and bars  Indeed Kinzel stopped smoking when the expense and hassles of smoking began to mount At a certain point it became too inconvenient she says  While the US has seen big drops in smoking rates obesity numbers have not dropped significantly and in many cases continue to climb That has American researchers focusing not on changing numbers on the scale but on encouraging healthy behaviours  The outward appearance of obesity is a distracter and a red herring says Mr Kahan If you take someone who is significantly overweight and they work hard and do what they need to do and lose  of their body weight more often than not they will see tremendous health and function improvements At the same time theyre still really fat We still point fingers of them losing weight and thats not really necessary  While the goal of antismoking campaigns was to stop people from smoking campaigns devoted to obesity seek a lesstangible outcome  The goal of obesity treatment is not necessarily to get to a normal weight Its to move in a direction where your health is significantly improved To that end says Ms Puhl campaigns should focus on behaviours to improve health not body size  Motivating people to eat better and move more has beneficial effects for everyone she says not just the obese
