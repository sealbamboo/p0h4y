If Dr Majella Doyle is your surgeon it means that something very bad or very good has just happened to you Doyle is a liver transplant specialist For years that meant she had her bag packed ready to fly or drive to wherever an organ donor lay on life support That could easily mean eight hours of travel And that was just the start You have a lung team a heart team a liver team and maybe a pancreas team says   who is an associate professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis Since each team has two or three people a dozen people from all over the country might descend on a smalltown hospital in the dead of night They would often have to wait because the operating room was booked with trauma cases and scheduled surgery And the staff may never have assisted with organ recovery Its incredibly difficult and challenging for all the personnel involved to be honest Doyle tells Shots The nurses in these little hospitals theyre not used to it so its very stressful for them But Doyle doesnt travel much now Instead organ donors come to her Thats because in  doctors in St Louis launched an experiment that they hoped would make the organ donation process swifter and less costly A dedicated surgical center was created at MidAmerica Transplant Services one of  federallydesignated regional organ procurement organizations Two staff members travel to a hospital in the region where a braindead  waits on life support and bring the donor to St Louis by ambulance or specially equipped airplane The experiment has worked Doyle says In the first  years travel time for liver transplants has been reduced from  hours to  hours and surgeons almost never have to fly out to donors The cost of a donated liver which is paid by the   was cut by  percent from  to just under  In   percent of liver donors in the area were transported to the St Louis facility which is within two miles of the two hospitals that perform organ transplants for the region which includes parts of Missouri Arkansas and Illinois These results which are based on  liver transplants performed from  to  were  Tuesday in the   The study didnt look at whether the swifter process makes for higher quality organs for the recipients but Doyle thinks it does As transplant surgeons we try very hard to minimize the time on ice she says Twelve hours would be really pushing it We like to keep it to six Having a team thats skilled at organ recovery makes it more likely that more organs can be used from each donor Doyle says For the families to know that their loved ones saved three or four people its hugely comforting She knows she says because she meets those families at a candlelit memorial service the facility holds each summer for transplant recipients and relatives of donors I have such admiration for families who are able to go through the whole donation process she says Theyre incredible
