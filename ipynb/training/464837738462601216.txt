More than  million patients  will remain uninsured because they live in  states that chose not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act according to a   by researchers at George Washington University Most of those patients live in the South because every state in that region except   and Kentucky opted against expanding the federalstate program for the poor after the Supreme Court   that it was optional These lowincome patients already face significant challenges to obtaining health care says lead author Peter Shin director of the Geiger Gibson Program in Community Health Policy at George Washington University Our analysis suggests these patients will remain without access to affordable insurance which will almost certainly lead to delays in care and the risk of more serious health conditions Health centers in states that have expanded Medicaid   as  million of their uninsured patients were projected to gain coverage in  either through Medicaid or through buying subsidized private coverage on the new health insurance marketplaces the report found Officials at health centers in Colorado Kentucky and other states that expanded Medicaid have seen their rates of uninsured patients fall dramatically this year Gaining coverage helps health center patients get access to specialists along with prescription drugs diagnostic tests and hospital care for little or no outofpocket costs The coverage will also be a financial bonanza for health centers that are paid several times more from Medicaid than from the sliding scale fees they charge the uninsured Nationally about  community health centers provide primary care services to nearly  million patients at  sites About  percent of their patients in  were uninsured and  percent were on Medicaid In the states that expanded Medicaid this year the government and private insurance payments will lead to potential revenues of  billion in  for the centers Thats money the centers can use to pay physicians and nurses and also to expand services But in the states that opted against expanding Medicaid the centers will lose about  million in extra Medicaid funding the study found Health centers in states that didnt expand Medicaid are unlikely to have money to grow and as a result access problems are likely to increase as the number of uninsured patients who seek care at health centers increases the report said And this is likely to exacerbate existing access problems particularly in the South The report showed that  percent of the  million community health center patients left struggling without insurance live in just five states  Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana and Mississippi That is a huge resource loss for them Shin said If all  states had expanded Medicaid as the laws framers had intended  million uninsured community health center patients out of a total of  million would have been covered the report projected Those that would have remained uninsured could not afford to buy coverage on the exchange chose not to purchase it or were ineligible for Medicaid because of their immigration status
