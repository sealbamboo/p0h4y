Instead of having to drill and fill cavities dentists could head them off at the pass with a new technique that accelerates a tooths natural healing Kings College London announced this week The technique called electrically accelerated and enhanced remineralization is being developed by Reminova Ltd a spinoff of Kings College London It is painless and could be brought to market within three years the college said in   The way we treat teeth today is not ideal Nigel Pitts a professor with the colleges Dental Institute who worked on the project said in the statement When we repair a tooth by putting in a filling that tooth enters a cycle of drilling and refilling as ultimately each repair fails Instead the college said the new technique administered in dentists offices would use a tiny electric current to push minerals into the tooth to repair the damaged site in essence reversing the decay Natural smallscale tooth repair happens all the time said Edmond R Hewlett a professor at the UCLA School of Dentistry who was not involved in the project When a person eats or drinks something sugary or particularly acidic such as citrus juice or certain sports drinks some microscopic loss of mineral takes place in the tooths outer enamel he said But saliva contains the building blocks of enamel calcium and phosphate If you have that occasional short exposure to sugary and acidic foods Hewlett said the saliva will put back the mineral that gets lost Theres this constant balance thats shifting back and forth in your mouth every day When that balance is not maintained and too much of the mineral is lost however the tooth develops a caries lesion  which can turn into a cavity Kings College London said To fight that decay people use products to shore up the minerals in their tooth enamel Fluoride is a remineralizer thats been around for a long time Hewlett said When it does go into the enamel it renders the enamel harder to dissolve Thats why fluoridated water toothpastes and mouthwashes have an effect Newer products such as creams dispensed at dental offices and specific overthecounter toothpastes contain calcium and phosphate as well as fluoride he added Thats not always enough Not everyone uses those products and even if they do sometimes caries lesions  and subsequently cavities  form anyway Electrically accelerated and enhanced remineralization would take the reversal of decay to the next level Not only is our device kinder to the patient and better for their teeth but its expected to be at least as costeffective as current dental treatments Pitts of Kings College said He said the technique could be used to whiten teeth as well
