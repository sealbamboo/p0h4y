 A small new study finds that people who had facial plastic surgery looked an average of seven years younger than they did before the procedure There are some caveats to the research Almost all of the study participants were women who were middleaged or older and the findings dont prove that the surgeries  instead of other factors such as the mood of the patients  directly caused them to look   Also only a single surgeon performed all of the procedures each of which costs thousands Still the study does give us some quantifiable evidence that we do achieve significant success in terms of our ability to rejuvenate patients and help them achieve a less tired look said study author Dr Nitin Chauhan a facial   in Toronto One of Chauhans colleagues performed one or more facial plastic surgery procedures on the  patients in the study between  and  One group underwent face and neck lifts another had those procedures plus upper and lower eyelid lifts and a third group had all the procedures plus a forehead lift The ages of the patients ranged from  to  only six were male The study authors then asked a group of firstyear medical students to estimate the ages of the patients after looking at photos of them before and six months after their procedures The goal of the research was to see if we can effectively quantify how much we can turn back the hands of time with certain rejuvenation procedures Chauhan said The results of the study were published in the Feb  online edition of the   After they adjusted their findings for statistical reasons the researchers found that on average the raters estimated that the patients looked  years younger than their actual age   surgery and  years younger afterward On average the estimated age dipped by  years in the first group and by  years in the third group which had all of the procedures The researchers tried to standardize the photographs by among other things asking participants to not wear makeup Chauhan said But some factors such as a persons level of happiness are hard to gauge he said As of  the American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimated that on average eyelid lifts cost  forehead lifts cost  and   cost  Dr Michael Olding chief of the division of plastic surgery at George Washington University reviewed the research and said it points to the obvious when it comes to multiple procedures The more the merrier or in this case the more the younger In his own practice Olding said he believes that doing a number of small things makes a tremendous difference when combined rather than making a tremendous difference in one area Olding said hed like to see a larger study that follows people over time instead of looking backward Also he said the study doesnt look at fat injections or address a major factor in plastic surgery  the quality of the patients   Another expert Dr Malcolm Roth president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and chief of the division of plastic surgery at Albany Medical Center in New York has advice on how to find a dependable plastic surgeon Do your homework and check that the doctor is boardcertified in plastic surgery Roth said There is too much whitecoat deception Virtually any kind of doctor can legally claim to be a plastic surgeon without any formal training in plastic surgery Members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons are seeing increasing numbers of patients  who have not done their homework  with complications and unsatisfactory outcomes
