Scientists in Japan report they have created eggs from stem cells in a mammal for the first time And the researchers went on to breed healthy offspring from the eggs they created While the experiments involved mice the work is being met with excitement  and questions  about doing the same thing for humans someday Wow Thats my general reaction said   a bioethicist at Stanford University who studies stemcell science Repairing hearts repairing brains repairing kidneys thats all good and important and wed all love to be able to do that But this involves making the next generation Scientists obtain the versatile cells from embryos Embryonic stem cells are controversial because researchers destroy the embryos to get them But because these stem cells can morph into any cell in the body theres always been the possibility they could do something especially profound They could offer a way to create eggs from anyone at any age That could change how humans reproduce In this weeks issue of the journal     and colleagues at Kyoto University in Japan   they finally achieved that elusive goal This is actually the first time to make eggs from embryonic stem cells and then produce eggs that become healthy offspring Saitou said Moreover Saitous team did something potentially even more astonishing They bred healthy mice from eggs made from another type of stem cell known as   These are cells that look essentially identical to embryonic stem cells But instead of coming from embryos they can be made from adult cells such as skin or blood cells So they dont have any of the ethical baggage of embryonic cells Theyre gotten to what was our Holy Grail which is making eggs said   a leading stemcell scientist at Harvard Its like cellular alchemy I mean they can turn lead into gold here They can turn skin cells or blood cells into eggs The big question of course is whether anyone could do the same thing for people No one knows for sure And it would surely take a ton of work But   a stemcell pioneer at the University of Pennsylvania says mice are close enough to humans to think its probably doable I think this will be worked out in time I dont have any doubt about it Gearhart said And if hes right then at the very least it would be a huge advance for women who are infertile for medical reasons or who have postponed having babies too long If we can make eggs from stem cells then the biological clock isnt ticking so much for women Stanfords Greely said But that could be just the beginning The same team previously made sperm from stem cells So for example the power to create sperm or eggs for anyone would be big news to many gay men and lesbians And Greely goes even further into territory charted by the book   Combined with other techniques eggs from stem cells could some day make it much easier for parents to pick babies with blue eyes or blond hair or a talent for sports or music Speculation about the possibilities get even more scifi Any skin cell that you can find on the edge of a coffee cup theoretically could be induced back to being an egg and a baby could be produced said   a bioethicist at Dartmouth University When you think about the commercial possibilities of people selling to infertile people babies produced from George Clooney or Jennifer Aniston or whatever you have to worry about it Green said Now its important to remember that this may end up being nothing more than speculation And even if it does prove possible choices like these are probably decades away Even so David Prentice of the Family Research Council says such research cheapens all life in a way not just embryonic or fetal life but babies and the rest of us when we starting treating life as a manufacturing proposition But just the possibility is already stirring intense debate about where the power to use stem cells to make eggs might take us Its like any other technology said   a professor of medicine and ethics at the University of Chicago Whatever weve done in human kind  whether its discovering fire or creating the wheel  you can use these things to do lots of good and you can use them immoral ways he says
